               <p>Q. Were there other people that you could see - A. The watchman was about ten yards off. I saw no other person that I knew. The watchman was going his round.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you observed four or five people. Were they coming as if to meet you - A. They were standing at the bottom of Golden-lane, and several of them put their hands to my waistcoat and breeches pocket. Two or three did.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the manner of their coming up to you - A. They came all round, shoving me about, and shoved their hands in my pockets. When I found that, I endeavoured to get away from them. I turned back towards Finsbury-square; I was followed by one of them, who began conversation with me. He wanted me to go and have some gin with him.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it was very dark - A. I could perceive the faces of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the face of the man that asked you to drink some gin - A. Not possibly to swear to him. Upon his asking me to have some gin, I refused, saying, I had seen enough of his company before. He began to abuse me. He told me he could get as good a character as I could. He kept me in conversation until I had a man behind me at my left elbow.</p>
               <p>Q. Until you heard a man at your left elbow - 
               <persName id="t18121202-37-person421">A. </persName>
            Yes. I turned my head round to let him pass; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020026"></xptr>struck me across the back of my neck with his fist, and put his foot against my toes, and threw me on my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watchman then - A. I did not see the watchman then. On my fall I had both hands in my breeches pocket, and in the fall my hat came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall with violence - A. Yes, and with my fall I pulled both of my hands out of my pockets, and along with it some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. The silver then came out unintentionally through the fall - A. I had hold of the money on purpose to save it, and pulling my hands out, the money came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in your pockets - 
               <persName id="t18121202-37-person422">A. </persName>
            Four shillings and two eighteen-penny pieces; and as I fell my hands came out, and the money along with it. I lost two shillings, and two eighteen-penny pieces came out. I picked the two eighteen-penny pieces up again. The man who kept me in conversation ran away with my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you observe any body else but him and the man that gave you a blow upon the neck - A. No. The man that struck me stooped and picked up the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How much silver did he pick up - A. I lost two shillings. I saw him stoop and scramble for the silver. I picked up the two eighteen-penny pieces. I saw him attempt to pick up the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not actually see him pick up any shillings, did you. You saw him attempt to pick them up - A. I did not actually see him pick them up, but attempt. I caught hold of him by the leg. I called out for the watch. Mr. Webb, the headborough of St. Luke's, came up to my assistance the same time. He came up instantly as soon as I caught hold of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the bar, and tell me who that man that you caught hold of his leg was - A. William M'Kone is the man. Upon Mr. Webb coming up, he took him into custody. M'Kone was searched in the watch-house, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost two shillings - A. Yes. I believe Doggerty to be the man that ran away with my hat, I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. His countenance is remarkable - A. I cannot positively swear to him; and Norman, I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect him - A. I cannot swear to him.</p>

            When these men, four or five of them, surrounded you, did you call out - A. I spoke to the watchman about it. He ordered them off.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He ordered them off - A. Yes, and they separated.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say, that the man that ran away with your hat, or that the man that you laid hold of, was one of the men that you saw first - A. William M'Kone was one of them, I am positive of. When we got into Bunhill-row, part of the gang came and attempted to rescue the prisoner M'Kone.</p>
               <p>Q. You were there, were you - 
               <persName id="t18121202-37-person424">A. </persName>

            Perhaps five or six.</p>

            They came up and attempted to rescue M'Kone - A. Yes. M'Kone retended to be in fits, or was in fits. The men that came up cursed us, and asked us what we were taking him to the watch-house for.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them any arms - A. Not as I saw, I observed none.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their asking you what you were taking him to the watch-house for, what answer did you make - A. I made none. Webb and me went on first, and they had taken M'Kone out of the possession of the watchman. Upon that we ordered the watchman to spring his rattle; several watchman came to our assistance, and M'Kone was secured.

               <p>Q. While you were taking him there did you observe any body else in the street - A. There were several others, but they ran away. Three or four more. I took M'Kone to the end of Bunhill-row; and in the mean time Doggerty came back in order to rescue the prisoner M'Kone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else come back but Doggerty - A. There was one or two, but I do not know them positively. Doggerty came up to me and asked me what business I had to take M'Kone; I told him I was an officer, I had a right to take him. I immediately struck him with a mace that I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You struck Doggerty - A. Yes, and I called out for assistance.

               <p>Q. Did you observe any others about them - A. There were several, but I did not take notice. I laid hold of Doggerty, he struck me several times. He said, you have taken several of my pals, and I'll be d - d if you shall take me. I then, with the assistance of

            . On the 31st of October I was officer of the night. I am an headborough. I heard the rattle spring. Me and Hutchins ran out to the assistance. I saw M'Kone in the custody of Webb.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hutchins. Do you know Norman by sight - A. I never saw him until he was brought to the watch-house. I knew the other two very well.</p>
               <p>LOCK. I saw Webb having hold of M'Kone, He told me to assist in bringing him to the watch-house. I did. Hutchins had hold of Doggerty. I saw Doggerty strike Hutchins several times in the watch-house. He had Hutchins down on the seat in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him strike him in the street - A. Not in the street, I cannot say. He had Hutchins down on a seat in the watch-house. I laid hold of M'Kone. M'Kone appeared to be in a fit as they said. We got them both into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Norman - A. I did not see him until he came in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought him there - A. He came in of his own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his pretence for coming in the watch-house - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. When M'Kone was in the watch-house, did he appear to be in a fit - A. Yes, for about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a fit was it - A. Kicking and struggling about. I do not know how long he was in the fit. I left him there, He remained there all night, and Doggerty and Norman with him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Saturday night - A. Yes. I searched M'Kone. I found on him a one-pound note, a three-shilling piece, an eighteen-penny token, and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the shillings that you found on him to Bunting - A. No. There was no much confusion in the watch-house. I put the whole into his pocket again as he was kicking in the fit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Bunting see the two shillings - A. No. Doggerty was fighting Hutchins and Webb. I was obliged to run to their assistance.</p>
               <p>M'Kone's Defence. I work for Mr. Caslon in Salisbury-square. I left off work at half after seven. I went to the gin shop the corner of Fleet-street. I had a glass or two of gin I got intoxicated, not being in the habit of drinking. I did not know what I was about; and how I came to affront Mr. Bunting I cannot say. I am subject to fits, and being in liquor, I went into a fit. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Doggerty's Defence. In Bunhill-row I saw M'Kone in a fit. Hutchins struck me on the face He said, I will have you; I said, you want me to strike you. I will not.</p>
               <p>Norman was not put on his defence.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gardener; I live in Canonbury-lane, Islington; I was going from my dinner, about half past one o'clock on the 20th of April; I was standing in Canonbury-lane, and I observed that boy, John Mitchell, with the till in his hand, running across the road, and give the till to the other boy, Carney; they ran down the lane; I observed to a baker that was pitching his basket, that they were bad boys, they had stole that till; I got the baker to go into Mr. Holt's, a chandler's shop, and he came out, and said, that they had lost their till; we pursued the boys more than a mile before we could take them; they are the same boys; I know no further.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What makes you think the till came from Mr. Holt's? - A.Because they were near the shop-door, and there is never another shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the till? - A. It was thrown over into my garden; I did not observe who threw it over; it is in the officer's possession.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol; I was coming down Bail's-pond road, about half past one o'clock on the 20th of April; it is a good way from Canonbury-house; I was coming into the Islington-road, and I heard Dale call out, but could not tell what he said; I saw these two lads running across Scott's brick-field; I directly ran out of the road after the boys; I took them both, and kept them there till Mr. Dale came down; I asked him what they had done; he said, they had stole a till; I took them up to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200117"></xptr>Holt's house, and we found the till in Mr. Dale's garden. - (The till produced.)</p>

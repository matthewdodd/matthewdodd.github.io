                  </hi>. I keep the Rose and Crown public house, Fort-street, Spital-square. Yesterday fortnight, an elderly man came and had a pint of porter; while he was there a young man about the male pri<lb></lb>soner's size came and talked to him—I cannot say he is the man—there were some pint and quart pots near the fire drying, which had been cleaned just before—some days afterwards I was shown a pint pot by the police; it was mine, and appeared as if it had been recently cleaned, and had not been used since.</p>

On Tuesday, 30th May, about half past 8 o'clock in the evening I went with Mr. Brown to No. 4, Wind<lb></lb>sor-street, Bishopsgate, and found the two prisoners there in a room toge<lb></lb>ther; Criton was sitting on a chair, and Hollis was just taking a pot off the fire on to the table with pewter metal in it, melted—I found another sauce-pan under the grate with a pint pot in it, and the handle of it which had been sawn off—it was not at all melted, the name of "Nooth" was on it—I asked Criton where the other pots were, and she deliberately walked to the cupboard and gave me these other two pots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one of which bears</p>

            . I got it from Mr. Knap's office, - (read.) Cullen was a weaver in the manufactory; I had delivered him thirty bobbins of sage coloured silk to work on, he took it away in a basket, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180036"></xptr>returned in five minutes with the basket empty. The bobbins were marked with Mr. Lawrence's name, or initials; the silk was wound round them. I saw him next day as I returned from town; I overtook him with a man who was much intoxicated. I had him apprehended, and next day in consequence of information, got a search warrant, and went to the prisoner's house in Angel-alley, with Mr. Lawrence and Matthews, while they were up stairs I found one of the bobbins below among the ashes; it was cut up, and partly burnt, and had Mr. Lawrence's name on it. Those I delivered to Cullen were of a similar description; they all came down stairs. I charged the prisoner's wife, in his presence, with burning part of the bobbins; she admitted it. Some more were produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You may have some thousands of bobbins alike, and sometimes they go out, and are not returned - Q. I may have lost fifty in the last two years. They are more valuable than fire-wood.</p>

            . I am a silk-weaver; I also went to the prisoner's house on the 7th of June. I and the officer went up stairs, leaving Dean below; we found the door open, and in the top room found the prisoner winding silk on one of my bobbins. I picked another off the floor, and asked if he knew the name on it; he said he did not. Matthews asked what he had done with the silk that was on the bobbins, and after some hesitation he said he had taken it off, and put it on a larger one, and sold it to a man who was gone to Coventry. He said it was the same colour as that of which part remained on one of them, which was sage green, and the same colour I had lost, and in the same state; it had been a little unravelled, and would not come off with the rest. We found twelve bobbins which I can swear to, they have all my initials or name on them. He said he did not know the man he bought the silk of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He answered all your questions - A. Yes; I will swear it is the same silk.</p>

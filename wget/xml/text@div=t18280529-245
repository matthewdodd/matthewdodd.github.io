            . I am laundress to Mr. Windle. I locked up his chambers, which are in the Middle Temple, on Friday the 4th of January; he had gone out of town a few days before - I had gone there every day, except Sunday; I went there again on the 5th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I found the outer door only on one lock, and the other door open, the blinds were drawn down, and the lamp was on the floor; it was in a very different state to what I had left it on the 4th - I looked round and was rather frightened, but did not know whether Mr. Windle had been there or not; I locked the chambers and went away - I went again on the next day, which was Sunday, a little after three o'clock, to look more particularly - the first thing I then saw was one of the drawers of the office table was broken open; I looked farther, and found all the drawers were broken open but two, which had not been locked, and the cellaret was broken open; I missed a tea-caddy, a brown silk umbrella, a clothes-bag, and a key, which were left at the chambers; I have since seen the caddy in Mr. Windle's possession, and the clothes-bag at Worship-street - I found a crow-bar and a chisel in the chambers; I gave them to the porter, and a gentleman who I fetched to the chambers- the outer door had not been broken; the key went in as easily as when I left it, but was only locked once - I had locked it twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you positive of that? A. Yes; I remarked, as I did not mean to go again that day that I had locked it safe - I found it singly locked on the Saturday; I double locked it on the Friday - I found the cupboards and drawers open, and the foul linen on the floor; I did not examine minutely that day, being alarmed and thinking Mr. Windle might have been there unknown to me - I made no more inquiry that day; I noticed it more on Sunday, when I went there to see if I could find Mr. Windle; I did not look for the key on Saturday - I locked the door when I came out; I went on Sunday to Mr. Tattersal's in Bloomsbury-square, and told him of it - I never saw the prisoner till he was taken up some months after; I heard he had been taken and was liberated - I have been a laundress four or five years.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. Q. Did you send to Mr. Tattersal on the Saturday? A. Yes, but he was not at his chambers; I went to his house on Sunday, and found him - he is a friend of Mr. Windle's; I attend to three other gentlemen's chambers.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday the 4th of January, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner crossing the road; he crossed Whitecross-street, went up a turning, and knocked at a backdoor; I followed him, as he seemed in a hurry, and passed him two or three yards - I then saw him turn back, and go into Whitecross-street again; I lost sight of him for about a minute and a half. I then saw him come across, and go into the front door of a house with this bag - I followed him in directly, and asked what he had got there; he said his father's clothes - I said that would not satisfy me, he must go with me to the watch-house: I took him there, and then said, "How did you say you got these things?" He said, "I met a gentleman in Holborn, who employed me to carry this bag:" I asked if he knew the gentleman; he said, "No:" I said, "Do you know what is in the bag;" he said No; I said "I must know;" I looked in and found all these articles - I have kept most of them ever since, but not all; I searched him and found these keys on him, and thinking one was not a right key, I said I should detain him - I looked into his hat and found some handkerchiefs; he was taken to Worship-street and examined three times, and then discharged as no owner was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he held to bail? A. No; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290105"></xptr>was at full liberty - he knew he was discharged, because I could not find the owner; he was taken again in three or four months - he was at liberty till then; he knew he was liable to be taken if the owner was found.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. Q. Do you recollect when you found the owner? A. I think about a week after he was discharged - the prosecutor came down to me; I then searched for him many a night and day.</p>
               <p>MAXWELL WINDLE, ESQ. These articles are all my property; I was out of town on the 4th of January; I left them in my chamber in the Middle Temple, where I reside when in town: I rent the chambers - they are entirely my own - I sleep there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the prisoner in a room in George-street, Shoreditch, on the 9th of May, about half-past six o'clock in the morning: I told him it was for Mr. Windle's robbery; he said, "It is of no use - I know I must go with you;" I had seen him the night before, in the skittle-ground of a public-house in Plough-yard, Shoreditch, but he made his escape. I found two skeleton-keys in his room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call these skeleton-keys? A. Yes - they are skeleton-keys for Bramah's locks; I got them from a young woman who was in bed with him. I have been an officer nearly fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Holborn on the 4th of January; a gentleman came and asked me to carry this bundle, and said he would give me a shilling; I followed him down Whitecross-street, when I was shoved into a shop by Lock, and taken; I had four hearings, and was discharged.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

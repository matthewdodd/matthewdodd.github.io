                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are out of business, what have you been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been a butcher—I have left that three years, and am living on my property—Mr. Hull is a hackney master—he keeps horses—he owed me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bill was given in exchange for another—it was a renewal—the other was drawn at the same date, three months—Hull was not able to take it up—I was able, but did not, because I wanted Hull to take it up—I did not apply to Shannon to renew it, nor tell anybody else to do so—it was not renewed for my accommodation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the renewed bill in the prisoner's hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the transaction was to postpone the day of payment by giving a new bill to run a longer time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how old was the original bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be nine months—I was the drawer of the original bill—I do not approve of the alteration in the date—I did not know it was drawn on Sunday when I drew it—I do not approve of it, because I consider the alteration vitiates the bill</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the sum you last lent to Hull preceding to the giving of this bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was at my own house—I do not want anybody present when I lend money—I have been sued on the bill and paid it, and I have Mr. Lewis's receipt for it—there was no execution on my premises—my receipt is dated Dec. 9th—the trial was on the 1st of Dec.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After the verdict was recovered against you, was there speedy execu<lb></lb>tion given? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had the money by me—the judge did not order speedy execution to my knowledge—I had notice to pay the money on Friday and paid it on the Monday.</p>

I said, "Don't deny it, for I have several witnesses who saw you take them, and if you don't give them up I will give charge of you" - he went up stairs, and brought the basket of tools down; he then dressed himself, and took them back with me to the public-house where he took them from - he set them down, and was detained.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you any witnesses who saw me take them? A. No, I believe not; it was a quarter-past six o'clock when they were lost - we stopped two or three times in going back, and gave him a glass of spirits, and had some ourselves; when I got back to Totteridge two witnesses said you might go, but you must wait till I came in - I stopped some distance behind; I said it was not my wish to prosecute, as I had got my tools - it was a servant at Mr. Paget's who induced me to prosecute.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had found the tools on the road from Totteridge.</p>

             re-examined. Q.Where did you place the tools? A. On the form under the window outside; and the saw was just over the window.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.How did you come to suspect the prisoner? A. A gentleman's bailiff told us he saw such a person carrying a basket, and we got his address from the overseer and found him in the morning - it is nearly eleven miles from Totteridge to his house; I think he might have disposed of some of them - I think it impossible for another person to have removed the tools and placed them on the road-side, as I went out immediately; nd one had seen the prisoner near the house.</p>

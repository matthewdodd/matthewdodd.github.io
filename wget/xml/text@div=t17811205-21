               <p>I live in Great Marlborough-street, Carnaby Market; I lost a watch, a base metal watch, gilt; a base metal chain, gilt; two stone seals set in gold; a white cornelian seal; a red cornelian stone seal, set in base metal. On the 29th of October last, as I was standing at the corner of <placeName id="t17811205-21-crimeloc115">Catherine-street, in the Strand</placeName>

I am positively certain I saw the watch in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>You did not mistake, in the crowd, one man for another? - No; I never saw the prisoner at the bar before that day, nor since till now.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was not there many persons round you, when you lost this watch? - A great many close to me, rather pressed upon me; there was a great crowd observing the man in the pillory. I know it was him by his drawing it out of my fob.</p>
               <p>You felt some man without any certainty of knowing it was the prisoner? - I felt him drawing my watch out of my fob. I saw it was his hand.</p>
               <p>You are sure that is the man that had it? - Yes; he gave it to a man in a dark grey, or blue coat. There was a woman that stood by me; I happened to turn my head; the woman had her hand in my pocket; I asked what business she had to have her hand in my pocket; Sir, said she, I ask your pardon, I meant no offence; I felt her hand afterwards in my pocket, attempting to take a small book out; I reported her to the mob; they gave her a little abuse, and she went away; this was before I lost my watch; at that time the chain was hanging out; I put the chain in my breeches pocket, and buttoned my coat down to the last button. The prisoner at the bar was standing by me, and took it, as I imagine, by the chain several tugs; the first the seals came out of my pocket; the next tug the watch; I instantly took him.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner called no witnesses to his character. Said there is one circumstance, I have been informed, might avail something; I would be very sorry to mention it, if it would affect me in the mind of any person; I was told the fact.

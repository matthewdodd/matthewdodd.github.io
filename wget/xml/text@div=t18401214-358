                  </hi>. I keep the Market coffee-house, West Smith-field; the prisoner was there between four and five o'clock in the morning. On the 16th of December a person in the coffee-room gave me a half-sovereign to pay for some refreshment—I said I would get change—the prisoner said he would give me change—I went over to him, and held out the half-sovereign—he put one of his hands into his breeches' pocket, to get change as I supposed, and with his other hand he took the half-sovereign,</p>

               <p>put it into his mouth, and, I believe, swallowed it—he made a motion, put his head back, and said, "It is gone"—I stood for a minute, and said, "Come, old fellow, give us the change," and he held out his hand to me with three buttons in it—I let him remain a few minutes, and gave him another cup of coffee—I have never seen the half-sovereign since—I asked him again for the change, and he said he had no half-sovereign about him—I gave him into custody—he had been drinking, but was sober enough to know what he was about.</p>

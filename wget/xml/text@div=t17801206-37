On Wednesday evening the 25th of October, between eight and nine at night, as we were sitting in the parlour, we were alarmed by Mr. Langley, who told us he had seen two men come out of the window; we immediately went up stairs and found the chamber and dining room doors both locked; Mr. Langley fetched two watchmen who got in at the window. They opened the door; we went up and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.) We had the house searched from top to bottom but found no person in it.</p>

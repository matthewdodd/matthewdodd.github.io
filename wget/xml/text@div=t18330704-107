On the 15th of June, I went to the west end of the wharf a little after four o'clock; I saw the prisoner endeavouring to conceal himself behind some chests of tea- there was a good deal of Indigo there - I said, "You are doing something wrong; we have had a great deal of depredation by some of our people, and you are the first I have detected" - I saw him concealing something with his left hand; I then saw a chest of indigo which had been opened, and which it ought not to have been - I then desired the prisoner to get up and go away, but I would not allow him to work there any longer; I followed him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040086"></xptr>centre of the wharf, and then desired him to halt that I might examine his person, and inside his waistcoat I found four pieces of indigo - I then said, "Now it is a fact that you have been plundering the indigo;" he said nothing - I sent for an officer and the indigo was taken from him in my presence, and given to the officer after I had marked it - this is it, it corresponds with that in the chest.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). As I am now called on for my defence, let my fate he whatever it may, I am resolved to state the real truth. With respect to breaking or wrenching any place or chest, or anything else, open, as I now stand before God and man, I am perfectly innocent; but as I saw those two pieces of indigo lay upon the ground, I did not know that I was committing any offence by stooping to pick them up, for I was certain they were of no value to me; neither did I take them with any intention of making a property of them, for I thought they might do for my wife to use in washing. Under these circumstances I now throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner had a large clasp knife by his side, with which the chest had evidently been opened - I had seen the chest safe on the wharf twenty-four hours before, but other persons could have got to the wharf - the prisoner was concealing himself when he saw me - he has worked on our wharf these five or six years, but I have had some suspicion of him of late.</p>

               <p>THOMAS STEELE. I am a porter, and live in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. On the 8th of April, I was going along Wimpole-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner, who threw from under his apron a roll of silk; a gentleman ran after him, and called to another person, who stopped him in my sight - the silk was taken up by a gentleman who was following, and he gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEGG (Police-constable D 149.) I saw the prisoner in custody of a gentleman in Wigmore-street; he delivered him to me, with this silk.</p>

This silk is mine; I had it safe on the morning of the 8th of April - the officer came about one o'clock, and then I looked and missed it; it has my mark on the end of the roll.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing up Oxford-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran, and a person threw this down at my feet, and the gentleman took me.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN LEGG. Q. How far was the prisoner from the prosecutor's? A. About two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards; there was a shop bill on the paper, which the prisoner tore to pieces.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of this month, about five in the morning, or a little after, we were alarmed with a knock at the door of Mr. Collet's house, I got up, and I heard somebody walking about the passage, but I thought it was my master got up, which he frequently did on particular occasions.</p>
               <p>Where do you sleep? - Up one pair of stairs; I heard some person go half way down the passage, and then down the kitchen stairs; I did not see who it was; then after that I came down stairs, and went to my master for the key of the door, and he gave me the key, I went down to open the door, it was shut at night, and when I found it, the bolts were undone; I let in some people and examined every room, and I found the prisoner in the necessary; I found the office window open, and the bolt of the outside shutter broke off, taken off, and it has not been seen since, and the inside shutter was wrenched off the hinges; I heard somebody go down the kitchen stairs, and I heard him walking about, about a minute or so before.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it daylight then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know nothing further? - No, I found a dark lanthorn in the office where he broke in, and this piece of wax candle.</p>

               <p>When did you first hear any alarm? - Not till past five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did any of your family hear any alarm? - I do not know that they did.</p>
               <p>Have you any evidence that tends to fix the time of the prisoner's getting into your house at an earlier hour? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing taken away? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, Gentlemen, upon this indictment I find it is impossible to convict the prisoner; this is an indictment for burglary, which you know consists of breaking and entering the house in the night, with intent to steal; the whole essence of the charge consists of breaking and entering the house in the night, and there is nothing in this indictment which we can separate or distinguish, it is one simple charge, and there is not, nor there cannot be, any evidence to shew that this was done in the night.</p>

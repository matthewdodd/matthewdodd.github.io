They say I was the person that escaped from goal; I was at my aunt's, at Laytonstone, and never came to town till this night; I came to enlist in his Majesty's service, which I did; the serjeant measured me, and did not approve of me, I was knock-knee'd, and not fit for the service, and I had no money; I dare say it was twelve o'clock when the serjeant came home, and then I went with an intent to enlist in one of his Majesty's ships upon Tower-hill, and they said it was too late, they were going to shut up; I had no lodgings to go to, and I walked about till this gentleman apprehended me; as to this instrument, I am as innocent of as a child unborn, and I hope your Lordship will recommend me to mercy.</p>

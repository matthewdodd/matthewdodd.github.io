               <p>On the 8th of August last, on my return from Edmonton, where I had been riding, I called on Mrs. Trehearn and Mrs. Fortescue, as I usually do; I am used to go in without ceremony, being intimate in the family, so I tapped with my switch, in order that the servants might open the door, this was about a quarter after six, to the best of my knowledge; as I did not discover any servant in the kitchen, I was going to ring, and I saw the hall door stand a-jar, with that I whipped in, and gave a great smack with my switch, and called out, Halloo! what are you all dead, is nobody in the house? immediately upon that, I heard a female voice, as I thought it might be one of the ladies seemingly in fits, I was going up stairs immediately, the front stairs of the hall, and I discovered there was a naked hanger upon the harpsichord in the hall, a hanger or a cutlass, I cannot say which; on that I drew back, suspecting that there were some thieves about, and I went to a neighbour, with whose family I was very well acquainted, and begged some of the servants would go with me; the footman came out, and we agreed to go to Mr. Coteen's to get assistance; I immediately went to the front of the door to see who came out; I waited till three or four servants came to my assistance; as soon as they came we went into the house, the servants rushed up stairs immediately, I did not go up immediately, I staid in the hall, they called down to me and said, the two maids are tied to two different bed-posts; they desired me to come up, I went up stairs half way, and I discovered a man with a blunderbuss in his hand; I thought he had been a thief, and I drew back, but it happened to be one of the servants; they desired me to lend them a knife, to cut the maids loose, which they did before I got up stairs; that was no sooner done,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040059"></xptr> but in comes Mr. Coteen, the gentleman where these ladies dined, and the ladies; Mr. Coteen and I thought proper to examine each maid separately, and we discovered upon the whole their accounts did not seem to agree; with that we suspected this robbery must be by the maids, or somebody concerned with them; every thing was in confusion and disorder, where there were things of value: the maids were not then immediately taken up; Alderman Townsend was sent for, and he, as I am informed, was clearly of opinion that the maids were privy to the robbery.</p>

               <p>Did she keep a public house? - No, a private house; I lodged there at the time of this robbery, she lived in Kingsland Road, the prisoner lodged in the same house, I do not know what she was; she had a man lived with her, I thought it was her husband, but she did not lay in the house while I was in the house; she had two rooms there; I was about eight days in the house; the prisoner came and asked for Edmonds, to lend her his clothes.</p>
               <p>Who is Edmonds? - He is the young man that was hanged for the same robbery; the prisoner said she was going to her sister's for a wager; she did not say what the wager was.</p>
               <p>Did Edmonds lodge in the house with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any acquaintance with the prisoner? - No, Sir, I never saw her till I went there to live; I heard her ask for his clothes, and Mrs. Goodall too; I saw her dressed in in them, it was on Tuesday, the 8th of August.</p>
               <p>Did she dress immediately? - Yes, she staid and had her dinner in the man's clothes, she had a round hat on, and the clothes which are in Court.</p>
               <p>Did you see her go out? - No, Sir, I went out about two o'clock of an errand, when I returned she and Mrs. Goodall was gone.</p>
               <p>What time did you come back? - I believe I was gone about a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner on the Friday following, the next morning, and Edmonds asked her for the clothes, I believe it was between eight and nine in the morning, at Mrs. Goodall's house, she was then in woman's clothes.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with her about the wager, or the success of it? - No, Sir, I had no conversation with her, she was too much in a hurry to speak to me.</p>
               <p>She seemed to be in a hurry, did she? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>(Produces the clothes.)</p>
               <p>I found these clothes in Mrs. Goodall's house, I cannot say what day, it was six or seven days after the robbery, I found them in Mrs. Greedy's apartment.</p>
               <p>Court to Greedy. Look at these clothes, are these the clothes that you saw Edmonds give to the prisoner? - Yes, Sir, they are, all but the breeches, the breeches were white cloth breeches.</p>
               <p>Is the hat there?</p>
               <p>Yardley. No, my Lord, I found none but a cocked hat, and I did not bring that.</p>
               <p>Court to Greedy. How came these clothes in your apartments when they were found by Yardley? - They were Edmonds's clothes, and he and I were going to be married, that was the reason that they were found in my apartments.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. Did you take the prisoner? Yes, my Lord, I took her about three weeks ago, she acknowledged before the magistrate that she was guilty of the robbery; I took her at a house in Norton Falgate; I had information of some coiners being at work there, and in the house I saw her, and I was informed she was the girl that was concerned in the robbery at Tottenham, and before Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Townsend she acknowledged that she was guilty of the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040060"></xptr>Court. Was that acknowledgment taken in writing? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the confession fair and free? was nothing said about it? - Justice Wilmot asked her, and said, you may as well tell the truth as you now stand indicted: she said she went to Tottenham in man's clothes, and Mr. Wilmot asked her how the breeches fitted her.</p>
               <p>Court. I ask you, whether the confession she made was a free and fair confession; or whether it was extorted from her by any hope or promise, or any thing of that sort? - No, my Lord, there was no promise at all.</p>
               <p>Was she persuaded to confess by being told that it would be better for her? - They did not tell her it would be better for her, they said it would be no hurt to her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Fortescue. I think I heard you say on a former trial, that none of these things were ever recovered again? - Part of them were, a piece of silk and a very little plate.</p>
               <p>Do they make any part of this charge? - A snuff box and some things, a man was convicted of receiving them.</p>
               <p>Prisoners counsel. How long was the prisoner under examination before Justice Wilmot. - I cannot say particularly, she had two examinations.</p>
               <p>I am speaking of that examination at which this confession was made? - I believe she was there two hours backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>How long had she been there before this confession was made? - I do not believe she had been there above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after she was ordered out? - I cannot say, I think it was the first time of her going in.</p>
               <p>I wish you would recollect the questions that were put to her before she confessed? - She was asked whether she was not in the robbery, and she had better own it, and that it would be no disservice to her.</p>
               <p>Court. nothing was found on her? - Nothing at all, I searched her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Chetham. The articles that have been since forthcoming, where were they found? - Not on this prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is nothing that affects this prisoner, but what comes from her own the accomplice.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Court to Mrs. Fortescue. If you wish we should call any other witnesses, to any other point, we will call them.</p>

               <p>Court. We cannot examine the accomplice now, because nothing has as yet come out against the prisoner, but by her own confession.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fortescue. We are not anxious at all about it my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. I dare say not.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The prisoner being thus examined before the justices, she has confessed the fact, and there is nothing else to affect her but that confession; the evidence of the accomplice cannot be received till something has come out to affect the prisoner from other witnesses, therefore you must acquit her.</p>

               <p>This ought to be a very serious lesson to you for the remainder of your life, for though by the tenderness of the law you have now escaped punishment, yet two people have been executed for the same crime, and two more transported for fourteen years; you have been one of their accomplices, and as deeply concerned in this robbery as any of them, and have been partly the cause of their death and punishment; you have therefore now nothing to do, but to make the best attonement you can, by leading a better life for the future.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 11th of Au<lb></lb>gust, about four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Woolwich Road, and noticed the prisoner coming from Mr. Miles's garden—I followed him and asked what he did on the premises—he said he was on a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> all night—I told him to come off the premises, up the lane leading towards the road—he complained of thirst—I said he could get some water from the pump—he had no cap or stock on—he carried a stick in his right hand and a stone in his left—he is a soldier—I suspected he had been stealing the fruit, and told him to give the stick up, making an effort to take it from him, he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with the stick and struck me over the right shoulder, and again over the right temple—he said he thought I was one of the picquet, and was there to take him into custody—he struck me several times—I took my staff out, and then we exchanged several blows—we both fell on the ground—there was a piece of iron, about five inches long, at the end of the stick he struck me with—it is termed a <hi rend="italic">chevaux-de-frise</hi>—he afterwards drove this part of the stick into my hand—I did not find any fruit upon him—he never gave any account why he was in the garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man. On the morning of the 11th of August, I was going towards Woolwich and saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling in the road—I saw the prisoner give the policeman some heavy blows—the prisoner sprung up and tried to get the stave from his hand, and threw him down—the prisoner came again, and struck him on the head with the iron end of the stick—the prisoner was secured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police force at Greenwich. On the morning of the 11th of August, I examined the constable Cannon—he had a contused wound on the left side of the head, two on the right side, a contusion on the right temple, a wound on the hand, and other marks of violence on his body—I considered the wound on the hand very serious, there was a great deal of inflammation about the arm, it had wounded the ligaments, and appeared to be done with great force—the prisoner had a severe contused laceration, such as a policeman's staff would make—the policeman's wounds were such as the iron end of the instru<lb></lb>ment would make—I think his head and hands were struck with that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Coming out in the morning about four o'clock, over the gate of the place, the constable came up and said, "Where are you going?" I said, "What is that to you?" be said, "You must give an account of yourself; I said I was on a bit of a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> all night; he said, "Well, I have been an old soldier myself, and have had many a <hi rend="italic">spree;"</hi> I laid hold of the handle of the pump; he laid hold of my hand, and said, "You must give up the stick; I said, "Why?" he said, "Come with me to the station;" I would not; he then up with his staff, and struck me; I said, "What would it be for a soldier to come along with a policeman?" and he then struck me before I struck him; he tore the breast of my shirt off; I said, "I am a-soldier, and will go to my bar<lb></lb>rack?;" he then struck me down; his wounds are not so much as they appear with that plaster over them; I picked the instrument up in the road.</p>

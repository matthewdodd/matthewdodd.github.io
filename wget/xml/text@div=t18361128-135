The prisoner Baston was in my service for about two years, and left on the 19th of November—I have very bad sight, and he used to go out with me, and do things about the house—about two days after, I was looking about, and found a box empty, which I had not seen for nine months before—it then contained bed-furniture, some plated candlesticks, and other things—it was kept under the bed up stairs—I have since seen the curtains—he was down in the kitchen all day, on the 19th, cleaning things till six o'clock at night, and we had a person cleaning the house down—the box was moved into the passage to clean the room.</p>

I was employed to apprehend a man named Jamaison, for a burglary committed at Stratford—after he was committed, I sat down close to the place where Jamiason was, and heard Mary Ann Collatty come down to speak to him—I overheard what she said to him—and suspecting what she said might relate to the prosecutor's robbery, I took her into custody, and to the Thomas Police—she was dis<lb></lb>charged, and I accompanied her to the house where she said she lived, and in her room I found the prisoners Stevens and Boston in bed together—I brought them to the station-house with Collatty—I overheard Stevens say, "It is not me that ought to be taken, it is the other, "alluding to Downes—he said he was not far off—in consequence of information, I went to Jerome's, a pawnbroker's in Union-street, Bishopsgate, and found the stand to match a branch, which I had found on Jamiason—they cor<lb></lb>responded in pattern, and fitted.</p>

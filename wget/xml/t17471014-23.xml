He was going out with it upon his Knot; I stopp'd him, and ask'd him where he was going with it, and said he was going to Mr Hurst in Talbot-court, Tower-street. I went to Tower-street to seek after his Master, but I could find no such Person; there were two Casks, one he had taken away before. The Casks belong to one Mr Richardson; his Servant came to enquire after it, and I told him how it was that one was taken, and I detected a Man in carrying off the other.</p>
               <p>It appeared by this Evidence, that it was known to whom these Goods belonged to, therefore it was not the Property of Persons unknown.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said in his Defence, That he met a Cooper in Goodman's fields, and he said he would give him Six pence to fetch this Cask out of the Bull Inn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato merchant, of 20 and 49, Tooley Street—I am one of the directors of this company—I was a director in June, 1874—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I produce the minute book of the company—there is a minute of 16th June, 1874, that is not in the prisoner's writing; I can't say that it was made in his presence—he attended a meeting on that day; an arrangement was entered into with him at that meeting appointing him secretary; it was reduced into writing and he had it to copy and some one on his behalf copied it—the resolution was that each of us, the directors and secretary, was to give his services gratuitously till such time as the mine should become a dividend paying one—the prisoner accepted the office of secretary; and it was arranged at that meeting that he should receive a shilling as a registration fee—he then entered into the service of the company and acted as secretary, from 14th May till 27th July, 1875—on 2nd September, 1874, the following minute is in the prisoner's writing: "It is further resolved that as no salary has yet been fixed for the secretary, that a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. be drawn in his favour as a gratuity"—he received that cheque which was duly honoured—on 24th March, 1875, this minute was in the prisoner's writing: "The secretary, having again applied for a salary, it was proposed that a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. be drawn in his favour as a gratuity, and should the mine prove to be a dividend paying one, then the services, past and future of the secretary shall undergo a fair consideration at the hands of the directors"—he received that three guineas—if money was sent to the office his duty was to pay it into the National Provincial Bank of England on behalf of the company—that was told to him—the company had an account at that bank—in February, 1875, a call was made—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the printed form of call sent out by the pri<lb></lb>soner—he kept the cash book and all the books of the company—the business was carried on at 184, Palmerstone Buildings, Bishopsgate Street—he had some one in the office, but in what capacity I can't say; he was not employed by the company—the last meeting of the directors before 27th July, 1875, was on 24th March—the cash book was always laid before the directors at their meetings; it was always kept by the prisoner—there is no entry on 23rd April of a sum of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Mackenzie—there is an entry on 8th April of two sums of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no entry on 17th May; on the 31st there is an entry of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from M. H. Aschin—the bankers' book is here—the last amount paid in is on 21st May—neither of these sums have been paid over to the directors, or accounted for—these three receipts and the letter on the back of one are the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing—the directors did not, that I am aware of, give orders for that letter to be written to Mr. Mackenzie—the endorsement on this cheque is the prisoner's writing—between 24th March and 27th July the prisoner came to me representing that we wanted money to pay the labour in Wales, I told him that knowing Mr. Mackenzie and Mr. Aschin, and being in the same line of business as myself, I should call on them for money, he begged me not to do so; he said it would place him in such a position, as secre<lb></lb>tary it was his duty to have money either sent to him at the office that he would relieve me of the trouble, being largely engaged in business, and he would go himself—in consequence of that I did not go—it was on the meeting of 27th July that I first discovered these entries in the cash book—May did not attend that meeting—no meeting was called between 24th March and 27th July because the directors were living very far distant</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200015"></xptr>
               <p>from May, and having but little cash in hand, and very little business doing, it was considered unnecessary to call them together, and they left the case in my hands to give directions to the secretary according to the report I received from him when the next meeting should be called—there had been no agreement entered into by the directors and May about paying him a salary, except what I have read—on 27th July he sent in this letter, making a claim for services rendered. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I beg to enclose you my account against the company for salary up to the present time, showing a balance due to me of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and as I am much in need of a little money I shall feel greatly obliged if you would make arrangements to <hi rend="italic">let</hi> me have a cheque this week.") That enclosed an account for salary for 13 months at 6 guineas a week, 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and credit is given for two sums of 3 guineas and for balance of cash in hand, 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and balance due, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I attended every meeting of the directors—that was the first I heard of any claim for salary.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This company was not a project of my own—I took some Welch take notes, and upon those it was incumbent on the purchaser to bring the matter into a company—the company was launched by myself, my brothers, May, and two others—I—was one of the promoters—I became acquainted with May about twelve months before the company was formed, about May, 1873—the company was registered in May, 1874—they had an office, one room—the rent was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the total amount the prisoner received was 6 guineas and about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for postage—I think the directors met every month except from March to July—he did not insist at <hi rend="italic">every</hi> meet<lb></lb>ing upon having some salary—the minute of 24th March says "The secretary having <hi rend="italic">again</hi> applied," but I think May put that in; I don't think it was in the motion—he had certainly said in the September previous that he should like a small salary—it would be on the cash book that he would have to account to the company for any money he received—the sums we. charge him with embezzling are entered in the cash book, but not on the dates when he received them—he has put on the other side 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the amount of rent for the office which he paid—he paid that out of the money he re<lb></lb>ceived—he had received 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he received two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Mesurier, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mackenzie, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Aschin—the quarter's rent is entered on 26th May, for which he had a cheque, which he never paid in, but paid cash, what has become of the cheque I know not—it has never been paid into the bank, I stopped it—the shares of the company were 25,000 of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the shilling fee to the prisoner was on the transfer from one person to another—I don't know how many transfers there were, very few—926 shares have been taken up by the public; I can't say how many of those have been transferred—in this mouth the directors were of opinion that the affairs of the company were in a critical state, and they suspended all operations—that was in consequence of the failure of the public to sub<lb></lb>scribe sufficient capital to go on—I don't think I stated before the Magis<lb></lb>trate about my conversation with the prisoner about Mr. Mackenzie.</p>

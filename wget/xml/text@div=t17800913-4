I called to the waggoner to stop; by this time I had got to the tail of the waggon. I saw the prisoner drop from the waggon; I got out of the chaise and pursued him; he ran round the houses, and I lost sight of him for a few seconds. There was a gravel pit by the side of the house. A woman who was standing there said he had jumped into that pit. He immediately ran out of the pit again; I halloo'd to a man at a little distance, who stopped him. When he was before Sir

               <p>I am agent to the Nottingham waggon. I was sent for on the 8th of July to Islington, where I saw the boy and the truss. I have the bill of lading. I went to the gentleman's house who sent the truss, and he gave me the bill of parcels. The waggoner is at Nottingham; I wrote to him, but he cannot be here before Saturday. There is W B marked on the truss. I know it only from its corresponding with the bill of lading. I was at the unlading of the waggon, and saw there was a rope of the waggon cut.</p>

               <p>Q. Within what time do you know that they were in your stock before you was told that some had been taken? - They came to me the night before from the manufacturers.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never sold them to any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you my lord I have got three children, one of my three children is in St. James's infirmary, (that is at the workhouse,) I applied to that gentleman to take my child out the Sunday morning till Monday, which he has always given me order for before, I had fish to sell that would be spoilt, as they would not keep over Sunday, so I went on Saturday night for the order, and he said he could not think of giving it me then, I left my barrow outside of the door, he said he could not think of giving it me that week, but he would the next, I came out to take the barrow home, I took it into the yard where I live in Cross-street, Carnaby-market, I wheeled my barrow into the yard where it always stands, and I saw the bundle of stockings in the barrow, and I thought that somebody when they had come for currants or apples had put it down; it was never touched, nor never untied, I took it up and put it down again as I found it, I went into the parlour, and I says, well, I will go for some butter, tea and sugar, I went for a quartern of butter, and came home with it, and went out again for tea and sugar, and that gentleman laid hold of my arm, and asked me for the stockings? I told him there was a bundle in the barrow, but how it came there I did not know; I went home to his house directly and he went to where I lived, and he took the bundle, and when he came back he charged the watchman with me. I have no witnesses, for it was all done in a few minutes; sometimes I have many things left in my barrow, which people leave, and come back again and have them. I have three children and never a father for them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I took her, I told her if she would confess I would not hurt her, but she did not confess to me.</p>

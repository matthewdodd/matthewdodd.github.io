            . On the 10th of November, the prisoner came in and called for a quartern of gin at my bar; I immediately served her, it was between eight and nine o'clock at night; after I had served her, she put down two-pence, I told her twopence would not pay four-pence for the quartern of gin. She then said, I must give her credit for the two-pence; I said, I had better give it her; a customer came in, and called for sixpennyworth of rum and water; the decanter had no rum in it; I filled the decanter; I then turned round to get a glass, and when I turned back again, the decanter with the rum was gone; there was not a soul at the bar but the prisoner. I exclaimed to my husband, the decanter was gone, he had better go to the prisoner's lodgings after the prisoner. Mr. Haigh and I followed the prisoner to her lodgings; I found her at her lodgings; I asked her for the decanter and the rum; she said she did not know what I meant. I said to her you may as well bring it out. I went up to the fire-place, I took up the decanter; the neck was broken off. I took it home. This is the decanter. Afterwards the patrole went and found the broken neck, This is it.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHAW. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody. She seemed very sorry for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300064"></xptr>what she had done; she said if the prosecutor would forgive her, she would make any recompense the prosecutor would take.</p>

I am a letter carrier, and have delivered letters in Veneer Street about two years—I deliver the evening letters between 9.30 and 10 p.m.—on 10th September, between 9.30 and 10 I delivered a letter there to the prisoner—I had not delivered letters into his hand before that—I have not the slightest doubt about him—it was addressed to Mr. or Mrs. Reynolds, I cannot say which—I saw a gleam of light from the back room—I did not carry a lantern on that occasion—I cannot say how the I prisoner was dressed, but he had on the same waistcoat as he has now to the best of my belief.</p>

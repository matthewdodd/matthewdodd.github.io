I am assistant to Mr. Bryer, a gold refiner, of 53, Barbican—on Saturday, 5th July, Burke called there, and offered me a gold snuff-box—I asked him where he got it from; and he said that he found it on Westminster-bridge—I asked him if he had tried to find the owner of it; and he said, "No"—I then said, "I must, detain it to make inquiries about it;" and told him to call again on the Monday—he gave his address, 4, Long-alley—he did not call again till the 10th—when he came then the officer, Baker, was sent for, and I delivered over the snuff-box and the pri<lb></lb>soner to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a city-detective, from information I received, I went to 4, Long-alley—I found no such name as Burke there; it is a baker's shop—I inquired all about there, from one end to the other—I went to Mr. Bryer's shop on 10th July, and found Burke there—he was given into my custody—I told him I was a police-officer, and was going to ask him some questions, he need not answer unless he thought proper, as whatever he said might be used in evidence against him—I had the snuff-box in my hand, and I asked him where he got it from—he said he found it about three weeks ago, on Westminster-bridge, about half-past 7 in the morning, beside the kerb stone—I then told him he must consider himself in custody—I took him to the station-house, and charged him with the unlawful possession of it—he was remanded on the 11th, and let out on hit own recognisances; that was about the 17th—on Monday, 14th July, from information I received I went to Pelham-crescent, and found the two prisoners there together—I told them to come inside the house as I wanted to speak to them—I told Noon I was an officer, and warned her in the usual way—I asked her name, and she said, "Mary Noon"—I asked her where she lived—she said, "Here"—I said, "How long have you lived here?"—she said, "Two days"—I then asked her if she ever lived with Madame Ude—she said, "Yes"—I then asked her where her boxes were—she said, "At 2, Haydon-place, Pelham-road, Brompton"—I told her she must consider her<lb></lb>self in custody for stealing a gold snuff-box—I then took them both to the station; the box was there produced, and Noon was told by the inspector that she would be charged with stealing it, and that John Burke would be charged with receiving it, knowing it to be stolen—Noon said, "I never saw the box; I know nothing of it"—I then went to the place where she said her boxes were, and two boxes were shown to me by a man named Jeremiah Connor—I searched them; Mr. Boys was with me—I found this miniature, this basket, some glasses, a small decanter, a table cloth, a gown, lined with</p>

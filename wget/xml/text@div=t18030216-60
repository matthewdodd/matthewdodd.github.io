               <p>Lumley. That is the funnel I saw in the hand of the prisoner, it is copper, and worth about five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went on board to enquire after a boat for a gentleman; a man came and said, what are you doing, you d-d rascal, you want to steal something; Lumley came on deck, and said, what are you doing with that funnel? I said, I was doing nothing with it; he said, you lie, you d-d rascal, I will take care of you; I never did a bad thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lumley.) Did this vessel belong to Mr. Blair? - A. He is the master of it, not the owner, but he is accountable for every thing in it.</p>

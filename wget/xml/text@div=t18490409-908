                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, of 3, Queen's-row, Chelsea. On 1st Feb., between five and six o'clock, just at dusk, I came home and found the prisoner there—he selected a number of articles—I am certain of the day, because I gave notice at the station that day, and got the date there—my wife asked me to make out a bill of the things—there was a coffee-biggin among them—when I came to it, I said, "Where is the coffee-biggin?"—she said, "The gentleman is going to carry that; he has got it in his handkerchief"—he held up his handkerchief, and said, "I have got it here"—my lad and his grandfather took the things, and the prisoner the coffee-biggin—my boy came back and told me something—I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Worship-street.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">Jun.</hi> I am the son of, and shopboy to, the last witness. The prisoner came to our shop between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—I went with him and carried half-a-dozen knives, a saucepan, and a teakettle—as we went along, he told me to wait a bit while he made water—I waited a little while, and then saw he was gone—I went to the station—I am sure be is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you sure it was between five and six o'clock.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the gas was lighted in the shop—there was no gas outside; all the gas there was lighted, and bad been so about a quarter of an hour—the pri<lb></lb>soner had a very odd way of twisting his spectacles—I and my father have talked about it; my father showed me how he did it—I am sure he had not his hat off; it was black—I did not see him again till I saw him with my father, it Worship-street—I never saw a person like him—he was in the shop about half an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, living on property left me by my husband, who was a merchant. I live with my married sister—the prisoner is our father; he used to pass his evenings at our house—I have not yet had my attention called to Feb. 1, but I have witnesses to prove my father was with us on the two occasions—he sometimes dined with us, about two o'clock—he was in the habit of coming between three and four, and remaining the rest of the evening; he has done so almost every day this year—I do not recollect any evening in Feb. when he was not with us—he is sixty-eight years old, and has a good deal of infirmity—I never saw a coffee-biggin in his possession—I have not often gone to where he lives—he does no work; I am his principal support, and from my opinion of this matter shall continue to be so, as I feel convinced he is innocent—a person is committed for the same kind of fraud: he is not like my father—I am certain my father was with us on 13th and 17th Feb.; I cannot say as to 25th Jan. and 1st Feb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the prisoner's daughters. My husband is a highly-respectable tradesman, and keeps a house of business in the City, and a private house as well—I used to see my father whenever he pleased to come, which was nearly every afternoon—I have not heard 1st Feb. men<lb></lb>tioned before to-day, and have only turned my attention to the 13th and'17th—I swear he was there on 13th and on 17th; he came at four o'clock; he generally came at four—he was there nearly every day in Feb.; it was oftener than my husband wished—I cannot remember 25th Jan—I took no note of when he was away—if he had had any coffee-biggins I think I must haw known it, and then we should not have appeared here to-day.</p>

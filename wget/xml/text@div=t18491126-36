I went out about noon on 14th Oct.—I left Mrs. Cooper in charge of my house—I left every thing safe—I came back about a quarter before nine in the evening, and found every lock and door broken, and everything in confusion—I missed five shirts and some other things belonging to a gentleman for whom I wash, and two shawls, four pairs of stockings, six silver spoons, and two salt spoons of mine, altogether perhaps worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since seen my two shawls and a handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Ed ward Cooper. On 14th Oct., Mrs. Willis asked me to take care of her house—the two houses are in one, but there is a door at the top of the stairs—I went into the yard, about a quarter-past seven in the evening, and heard a noise—I came in again, and heard something fall over the fireplace in the top room of No. 3—I went out in front to shut my shutters, and saw a light in the front room first-floor of No. 3, and saw two men walk across the room—I got a policeman, and went with him upstairs, with a candle—I saw two men open the door between my house and Mrs. Willis's—they were coming down stairs—when they saw the policeman they shut the door and went from No. 3 front room to No. 2 front room, and ran down stairs—the prisoner was one—he had a candle, and he threw it at me—the other man followed him—he was taken, tried here last Session, and had twelve months (<hi rend="italic">see Vol.</hi> 30, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 696)—the prisoner made a blow at me, and swore at me as he came out of the house, and got away—I went through my house into Mrs. Willis's—the first thing I saw was a hat—I went into the upstairs room, and found every drawer and box completely broken to pieces, even to the tea-caddy, and down stairs the same—the things were taken from the drawers, and packed up in a bundle to be taken away—in the passage of No. 2, I found a bag of skeleton keys—I am positive the prisoner is the man who threw the candle at me—Mrs. Willis told me if I heard a knock at her door to answer it.</p>

I saw Johnson and this prisoner and two others in company, about five o'clock, in Orchard-street, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's—I did not find the prisoner till 30th Oct., at the White Horse—I told him he was concerned with Johnson in a burglary—he said be knew nothing about it—he had a new hat and coat on.</p>

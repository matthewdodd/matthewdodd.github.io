The prisoner, Sarah Stringer, brought a lump of silver to my shop, and asked me what it was worth - I asked her where she got it - She said she found it at the top of the lane; I told her to leave part of it until the afternoon and call again, and I would let her know what it was worth-she left some with me - I went to the Mint-she returned in the afternoon. I had an officer there, who took her into custody.</p>

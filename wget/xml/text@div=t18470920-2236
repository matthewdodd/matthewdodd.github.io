                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in the Old Kent-road. I knew the deceased Mrs. Olds very well—I was called to see her on the Thursday, the day she died—I had attended her before, for violet cough, occasional spitting of blood, and irritability of the lungs—it was a pulmonary complaint—my first observation of her on this occasion was on the Wednesday morn<lb></lb>ing, 25th of Aug., when she came to my house, and complained of violent pain in her chest and about the stomach, and vomiting of blood at times—while she was in my house she spat up a good deal of blood—I never knew her spit blood before—she had frequently complained of cough and cold—she complained of being hurt about the throat, and being held and pressed about the chest—I saw the throat—the skin appeared a little reddened, as if com<lb></lb>pressed, but there was nothing particularly marked about it—it seemed redder</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200199"></xptr>
               <p>than it ought to be—there were no bruises—it was only red in one part—the left temple was bruised—that seemed to have been the effect of some violence—it was rather a lasting bruise, but not of itself likely to occasion death—I prescribed for her, and directed her to take everything very cold—I was sent for to her the next day, between one and two o'clock, and she was dead—I was prevented from seeing her in the morning—there was venous blood about the mouth—it seemed to come from the lungs—it was of a dark colour—by the direction of the Coroner I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the appearance of the lungs was very unhealthy—the upper part of each lung was very congested, very loaded with extravasated blood, the bronchial vessels also very loaded with blood and the aesophagus—the blood in the lungs was partly fluid and partly coagulated—the liver was very unhealthy, of a very dark colour instead of its natural colour—there was a flaxidity about it, which showed a great deal of unnatural character—the gall-bladder was almost empty—there was scarcely any bile in it—it contained a little air apparently—the stomach appeared partially inflamed about the upper part, and there was a great deal of blood mixed with fluid of the stomach—it must have come into the stomach from the trachea—the vessels were very loaded with blood, not rup<lb></lb>tured, but the arteries of that part are so minute, in all probability the blood might have come in partially from the veins of the stomach—that would not account for the whole—a large quantity must have come from the lungs, and got down the throat—the spleen and other organs were not quite healthy—there did not appear any inflammation about the bowels in general—the principal seat of disorder appeared the lungs and liver, and the irregular state of the bladder—in my opinion the flow of blood from the lungs arose from violence by blows or falls—the lungs being in a weak state they were susceptible—I can undertake to say that violence must have produced those effects—they could not have been produced to that extent without violence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you attended this poor woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Several times in the course of the summer—she had taken medicine—she had stated to me before this that she had spit small quantities of blood, not to any extent—she told me that she occasionally expectorated blood—I mean by that, thrown it from her lungs—that might probably be occasioned by ulceration—there must have been some lesion of ves<lb></lb>sels to give rise to it—there may be a lesion without a rupture, or the evacuation of blood, but it generally happens—I am able to say that the blood evacuated was venous blood, and not arterial—I did not ascertain what vessel was broken—there were a variety of vessels, towards the upper part of the lungs, not any of the main vessels—there is no difficulty in ascertaining whether blood is venous or arterial—the colour of venous blood is dark, and arterial blood is red or florid—at the upper part of the lungs, the veins and arteries mix and inter<lb></lb>sect—I can hardly say that there were no arterial vessels ruptured, probably there might have been, but the greater amount was venous blood—I cannot say whether that was from the diseased part of the lung, as the lungs alto<lb></lb>gether were very weak, and participated in point of texture to a similarity of construction—there had been ulceration—it occasionally happens with the lungs in such a state, that the cough may rupture the vessels and produce great extravasation of blood—it is almost universally the mode in which such patients die—I know that the deceased was subject to a frequent cough—I do not consider, from the appearances of the lungs, that a violent fit of coughing would have produced the great effusion that I witnessed; the lungs were apparently not in that very tender state as to produce it—they were in a weakened state—external violence must be a considerably greater strain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200200"></xptr>
               <p>upon the lungs than a cough—it must in my opinion have been done by a violent concussion which jarred the vessels, and gave rise to the ruptures—such a concussion might be occasioned by a violent cough under a very much more diseased state of lings, but I do not consider these lungs were in that state—none of the main vessels were ruptured, only the smaller once—they would be very tender, and were in a delicate state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose she had died from any other cause than the rupture, and you had seen these lungs without the extravasation of blood upon them, should you have said they were at all safe even from day to day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I should not consider they were in such a weak state as to give way—I should not consider that a violent cough would have been likely to affect them at all</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Evan though you had heard that she had been in the habit of spiting blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The answer to that question would depend entirely upon the examination of any particular part which might be diseased—I believe har age was about forty odd, I cannot say exactly, from forty to fifty—she might have been fifty-two—the blood in the stomach had come from the lungs, got into the trachea, and so passed into the stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you rightly, that the state of the lungs was not in your opinion such as to lead you to conclude that a mere fit of coughing would have ruptured the vessels, and have produced the quantity of blood you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if on the Saturday night pre<lb></lb>vious to my seeing her, she had been thrown down on the ground, and held there, I should consider that would account for the rupture of the vessels I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there many ulcers on the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a great many, there were four or five patches of ulceration—sometimes the efflux of blend arises from ulceration eating into the vessels, opening the surface of the vessels themselves; and sometimes a vessel will burst or rupture from con<lb></lb>cussion, by reason of its weakness—it was quite impossible for me to in<lb></lb>vestigate the number of opening through which the blood might have flowed, there was such a large accumulation in the parts that it was nothing but a mass of blood, intermixed so firmly in the upper part of the lungs with the trachea, and so on, that it was a complete choak as it were—I divided the lungs in my examination, but could discriminate the openings, the vessels are so very minute there—suffocation was the immediate cause of death by the vomiting of blood into the mouth, choaking the passage—she was cough<lb></lb>ing at the time she came to me in the morning from the quantity of blood that was rising in her throat—I had never seen her so violently troubled by a cough before—I had seen her about a fortnight before—I did not observe any more chance of her dying then, than I had observed at other periods when I had seen her—if I had heard next morning that she had been taken with a violent cough which had ended in suffocation by blood, I should have been very much surprised—she was not in that condition—she was generally emaciated, with weak powers, and had been in a bad state of health for several years—there was no accounting for the state of the liver, lungs, spleen, and gall-bladder—there was peculiar constitutional irregularity—I had know her for many years, and she was a very regular, quiet, domestic person—the liver may be disordered by a habit of drinking—there were appearances that would arise from irregular habits, but I never saw her intoxicated, or sup<lb></lb>posed she was addicted to drinking—I always considered her a woman of feeble habits, weak about the lungs, with an unnatural state of liver, and no on—the ordinary immediate cause of death from pulmonary complaints is from inflammation of the substance of the lungs, producing matter, so that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200201"></xptr>
               <p>they expectorate <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> and in proportion to the number of ulcers on the sur<lb></lb>face of the lungs, so in the same ratio will a person become sooner or later destroyed—it is a diminution of the powers of life—the process of ulcera<lb></lb>tion going on in the lungs must necessarily furnish blood to support those inflammatory parts, and thus nature is robbed of a very great support—it decays the functions of the lungs—I examined the deceased's body externally—I did not perceive any marks of violence except that on the left temple and the throat.</p>

On the Saturday night the 21st Aug., I was in my own back room, and was disturbed by a fall, and a cry of murder—I heard the fall first—the deceased and her husband slept in the up-stairs front room—the fall appeared to be in their back room—I heard Mrs. Olds cry "Murder"—I then ran to my door and opened it—the cries were still going on—they then appeared to come from the front room—I went up stairs into my front room, and opened the window, and then heard Mr. Olds say something to his wife, but what it was I could not understand—I heard her crying—I did not hear her say anything—it appeared to me as though he was still beating her—I did not see him—I judged by her cries that he was beating her—I did not hear the sound of blows just then—I saw their son William pass my door as I opened it—he came from his father's house—I saw him come back with a policeman—after the policeman was gone, I heard Mr. Olds beating his wife again—I heard the blows—the policeman stayed, I should think, about five minutes—I heard Mrs. Olds say, "You brute," you brute," several times, that was after I heard the sound of blows—there was no one there but the boy William, Mr. Olds, and his wife—I only heard the one fall, the other was hitting—I saw the deceased about four o'clock on the afternoon of the next day (the Sunday) in the back yard—she was very ill then—I saw her again on the Monday in the back yard, and saw marks on her throat—I did not see them on Sunday—I was nearer to her on Monday than I was on the Sunday—she had a bruise on the left temple—I had seen her about the middle of the day on the satur<lb></lb>day—she had not any bruise on the left temple then—I was her on the Wednesday and Thursday—she was very ill each day—each day she got worse—I saw her at the sink vomiting blood—she called me to see it—I had not seen her spit blood before the Saturday—she had not been well for some time before—after the Saturday night I observed a very great change in her—it continued up to Thursday, when she died—I saw her on the morning she died, at nine o'clock, not after that—she died at half-past two—I ran in when she was dying.</p>

                  </hi> I am fourteen years old, and lived with the prisoner and the deceased, my father and mother. On the Saturday night before she died I was at home—my father and mother and I were in the house above nine o'clock, nobody else—my mother had had some money left her—I believe it was kept in a drawer of a cheat of drawers that was there—when my father came home he said, "I want some money"—he was not sober my mother said, "No," she would not give it him; and he took hold of the drawers by the bottom and turned them over—I believe the money was in those drawers—I never saw any there—my father went backwards to get the hammer to break the drawers open—my mother took the hammer out of his hand, and threw it over the pigstye—he then began quarrelling and hitting her—they were both quarrelling—I did not see my mother hit him, nor my father hit her—I went out to fetch a policeman—my mother was then in the front room—she was standing up—I did not see her down upon the ground at all—I went for the policeman because my mother sent me—I did not see my father do anything to her—she was sitting down in a chair when I went for the policeman—my father was standing by the fire-side—he was not quiet, he was making a noise and <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I did not see him doing any-thing else—I should have seen it if it had been so—my mother hallooed one two or three times, "Run for a policeman," and I did so—I did not see anybody hold my mother round the body.</p>

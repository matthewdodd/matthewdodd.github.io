I am a labourer in Her Majesty's Dockyard at Deptford—on the evening of 17th October, a little before 8 o'clock, I was with my brother in New King-street, Deptford—Scamel came behind us and tapped my brother on the shoulder—he asked my brother if he had any animosity or spite against him—my brother said no, if he had he freely forgave him—I never said a word to him—I was holding the child's hand—after about 2 minutes, Catherine Scamel came up—she hit me first; she pushed me away and then he hit me on my nose—we both fell together, and then he</p>

               <p>began to bite my nose—he bit me well—I thought he was eating it—he used me most shamefully—his wife caught my brother while I was down and held him very tight, and I sung out to my brother that Scamel was eating my nose—this lasted I suppose about a couple of minutes—my brother took him off me; no one else came to my help—I went to the doctor's and got my nose strapped up—I do not know whether the prisoners went home or not—when I came back I was going to my brother's house, 2, Brunswick-square—the prisoners live next door—as I was going to my brother's door, my brother was behind me; the female prisoner had her hands behind her, and she struck me with a glass bottle, and it laid me up four weeks—I was standing when I got the blow, and as I was falling the male prisoner came on me and he used me most beastly and unchristianlike—I fell down and was insensible—next morning I went to my brother's house—I was going to get a summons for Scamel's wife—she was sitting on the door-step settled for a fight—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Jacky,</hi> I have given you a mark with a bottle, and I will give you another"—that is the wound produced by the bottle (<hi rend="italic">showing it</hi>)—the doctor attended to me for three weeks—I was in a very bad way—I never thought I should live.</p>

I am the brother of the last witness, and also work in Her Majesty's Dockyard, Deptford—in the evening of 17th October, I was in New King-street, with my brother—I saw the prisoners in the alley leading out of New King-street—Scamel came up and tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Do you owe me a spite"—I said, "No, if I do, I forgive you"—my brother said, "You are a fine man, and you would kill us all"—he then knocked my brother down—when they were down, my brother said, "Patrick, he is eating me"—I tried all I could to extricate him, and I did—I brought him to the lamp and saw that his nose was cut on both sides—I took him to a chemist and got his nose strapped—about an hour afterwards, I was going to my door with him, thinking all was over—the female prisoner was standing at her door—I did not know that she had anything in her hand—she struck my brother and knocked him down, and then I took him to my own house till he was taken to the doctor's the second time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon practising at Deptford—John Ahearn was brought to my surgery at 1 o'clock in the morning of the 18th—I found a large wound on the top of his head, the left side, 3 inches long; a contusion over the brow, and a wound, on the nose, which could arise from a bite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a likely way of its being produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Possibly—I did not see it early afterwards—I was not the first person he was brought to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your opinion is rather against its being done with a bottle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am rather disposed to think it was not done with a bottle, although it could possibly have been—the wound on the nose was in the reverse direction to that which falling on a stone would cause—it was curved upwards—I did not observe any marks, but from the direction of the wound I should suppose it was caused by a bite—the wound was quite through—I do not think a person could have penetrated through it with his nails, unless they were very sharp and strong.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember Monday, October 17, the day before Charlton fair—I know both the Ahearns—I saw Scamel standing at his own door on that day—I saw both the Ahearns and their wives—they were threatening to fight Scamel—Patrick Ahearn wanted to bring his brother forward to fight him—one of the wives came up and called Scamel a cockle, and spat in his face, and made a kick at him; but he was standing in his own doorway and did not receive the kick—after that, John Ahearn brought a stick out of his own house and came up to the defendant, who was standing in his own door at the time, and made a blow with the stick at him, and broke the stick—I picked up part of it and took it to Charlton fair with me—I have not got it here—after that Mr. Ahearn brought out a poker behind his back, and all the people, cried out to Scamel, "Mind the poker"—he moved back from the passage, and Ahearn threw the poker after him, but I do not know whether it hit him—then Bridget Ahearn picked up a bottle and threw—I did not see whether it hit anybody—the Ahearns were abusing them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That bottle was whole at the time she picked it up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I saw her pick up the bottle and I heard it break—the stick was a rough one, a piece of a paling—I took it to the fair, because it is a custom for people to take some sort of weapon to Charlton fair—I did not see Scamel and his wife come up the court, nor the Ahearns—I did not see them up King-street, or out of the court at all—I only saw it between 11 and 12 o'clock—Mrs. Ahearn made a kick at Scamel, and spat in his</p>

               <p>face, when he was standing quite quiet in his own door—I did not notice Ahearn's face at all after the row—the police came and dispatched them—I did not see Ahearn on the ground at all, or that he was touched by anybody—there was only the scuffle that I have said.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Deptford—on Monday, 17th October, us near as I can tell, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I was going for some tobacco, through the alley leading to Brunswick-square—I saw some persons in the alley—I saw some men in the alley with a woman underneath them, and I heard the cries of "Murder! the woman is dead"—I came and released the woman from a man who had her by the hair of the head—I took her up, and then went out for a policeman, but when I came back, there was a policeman there—I cannot say whether the man is here that had her by the hair of the head, because I did not know them at the time—I could not speak to any of them—there were three persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married—my husband is a labourer—I live at Deptford—on Monday night, 17th October, as near as I can say, between and 12 o'clock, I heard a disturbance in Brunswick-square—I was in bed, and I got out of bed when I heard the <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and went to Scamel's door—I saw John Ahearn and his brother go to Scamel's door, and ask if he was a mind to come out and fight him—Scamel said he could not fight two—some man spoke and said he would see fair play—then the two men rushed at Scamel's door, and knocked him down—the three were all down together—I saw John Ahearn and another man getting up—Ahearn's face was then all over blood—I saw him go to his brother's house, and wash his face, and then come to Scamel's door, and then his brother shoved him up before him to Scamel's door—I saw Ahearn's wife come out to Scamel, and call him a cuckold, and spit in his face, and make a kick at him—he was then standing in his own door—Patrick Ahearn used a great many bad words—I heard some man call out to mind the stick—Scamel went inside his door—the Ahearns stopped outside, abusing him—I saw Ahearn's wife stoop down to pick up a brick or a stone, I do not know which, and they told her to put it down.</p>

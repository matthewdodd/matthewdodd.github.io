               <p>Q. Your wife takes in washing, does she? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Particularly for a boarding school in that neighbourhood? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th or 5th of December had your wife fetched linen from this school? A. Yes; boys' shirts and other linen.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of December who was up last in your family? A. Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed? A. At eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten the door and the windows? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got up first in the morning? A. A lodger of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that lodger here? A. No; he is only a boy that rides the twopenny post mail horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out of the door before you got up? A. He and I were on the stairs at the same time, only he had got the start of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this? A. About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went down first did he discover any thing? A. He exclaimed that the street door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down and looked, did you? A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it was so? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040064"></xptr>Q. Did you observe any marks of breaking about the door? A. None at all: it was unbolted. I locked it at night, and hung the key up inside of the door, and bolted it within.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course whoever came into the house must have come in some other way, not at the door? A. I found they came in at the window at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks of violence did you see there? A. I saw at the bottom part of the window the wood work broken away; the window was partly open, and the sash was shoved on one side: it is a little sash, only three squares. It is a wooden house; the window was shoved within the partition - it was shoved within the wood work of one side.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the window was only secured by a sliding frame? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that frame was shoved of one side? A. It lay on the ground a part of it; and the other part was on the frame. It was only a kind of a bead, which confined the window from going out of the groove.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a bead on the internal and on the external - the external was broken off and fell on the ground; in consequence of this the window was shoved of one side? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So as to admit a man's hand? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not taken out of the frame then? A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How was this window secured? A. I never knew it would open before; I thought it had been made so.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the window was always fast, - you never was in the habit of opening it? A. Never was in the habit of opening it.</p>
               <p>Q. But the wood being taken off part of the bead, they were able to shove the window of one side? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they shove it in the groove? A. Yes, there is three squares, they shoved it in a square and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure the window was completely close when you went to bed? A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was room enough for a little man to get through? A. There was quite sufficient room for any body to get through.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found this was the case, I suppose you examined the house? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And many things were missing? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were missing? A. About eighty shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a numerous school, there was a many children there, was there? A. Yes, upwards of seventy boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen this linen the over night? A. Yes, all of it: there was about sixty boys' calico night shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Boys' bed gowns? A. Yes; and about fifty brown holland pinafores: and several other articles of my own property, that I could not swear to even if I were to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all gone? A. All gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole house ransacked? A. No, there was a number of pairs of stockings that were left.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no alarm in the night? A. Before I went to bed the dog ran to the door and barked, and that made me be very careful of fastening the house up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house in a village or in a street? A. We have got a neighbour that lives under the same roof, my door goes into his house; the two houses are together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any inquiry after your things? A. I immediately set out to Bow-street, on the 6th in the morning, and gave information there.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Kirby calling at the office? A. Not to my knowledge. I knew nothing of his information at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? A. I know them well.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you discovered the prisoners? A. On the 6th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in company with Loyd and Crouch, my fellow-officers, at the lower part of Islington, by the back of Scott's-place, going to Ball's-pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it near the old Thatched-house? A. It is below the old Thatched-house. As I was going towards Ball's-pond I met the prisoners. I stopped Warwick, the tall man, and asked him what he had got? He had this bundle (they both had bundles). Warwick told me it was working clothes. I asked him what they consisted of? He told me there was some shirts and his working clothes. I asked him where he brought them from? He told me from Northamptonshire. I told him I thought that was a great way to bring such a load as that. I was not satisfied with what he told me: I took him into the Rose, in Frog-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him or them? A. We took them both.</p>

               <p>Q. You were three of you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took both to the public-house? A. Yes, to the sign of the Rose, in Frog-lane, and examined them both there; and I found a great many things, quite contrary to what he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined both bundles, of course?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040065"></xptr>A. Yes: after having them there I opened Warwick's waistcoat, and found some shirts wrapped round his body; the waistcoat was buttoned over it.</p>
               <p>Q. You took these shirts with the bundles, and took the prisoners before a magistrate? A. I did, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the other man? A.

             searched him. I told him to be particular in searching him, and to keep the prisoners apart.</p>
               <p>Q. The bundles you secured, and you have had them in your custody ever since. A. Yes, all the things: I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were taking them to Bow-street, did either of them say any thing how they came by the property? A. Before I brought them out of the Rose, I asked Warwick where he got them, as I was sure he did not come by them honestly. After some time he told me he got them at Finchley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Stevens by when he said so? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Warwick say that he got them from Finchley, or that we got them at Finchley? A. I believe they both answered that we got them from Finchley.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to be sure of that. You are quite sure that Warwick said that he got them at Finchley. Did he say by himself, or in company with the other? A. They both consented to it, I am clear of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they mention particularly about the house where they took them from? A. I asked them where it was? They told me it was at the further part of Finchley; they could not say exactly. I then asked them what night it was they got them? They told me it was between the hours of one and two, on Thursday the 6th of December. I asked them where they had been all that time with them? They told me that they had concealed them.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to be accurate whether it was they or he? A. Warwick told me, Stevens was by, that they had concealed them in Hornsey Wood. That was all that happened then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say that they had fetched them from Hornsey 
               <persName id="t18051204-49-person582">Wood</persName>
             that night? A. They said they had fetched them from Hornsey. I will not swear whether it was day or night. They fetched them from Hornsey Wood that evening. (I produce the property). I then ordered a coach, and put them and the things in a coach. Then I asked them where the things lay in the house at Finchley? Warwick said, in a cradle, I asked him what he had done with the cradle? He told me that he had left it on Finchley Common.</p>

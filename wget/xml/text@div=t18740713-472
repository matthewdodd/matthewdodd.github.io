                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and have lately been living at 21, Pigot Street, Limehouse—on 21st July I was at the Pigot Arms, twenty doors from where I live—I was by myself having something to drink—the prisoner was there drinking with some prostitutes; I believe they were—he asked me for a glass, and I gave him one—it was then about 11.40—he said "Come along old boy, I will see you home"—I said "There is no occasion for that"—he said "You had better come with me, and I will go away home"—I said "I will go by myself"—we were then outside—he kept jostling me and took me by the arm—I crossed the street, and accidently took the Wrong turning—I said "I have got into the wrong street," and as soon as I turned round he hit me a violent blow on the eye, and I went down on my knees—I think he had brass knuckles on, it was something harder than his hand—I got up and caught him by the throat, and another man came up with a life-preserver or a staff, and partly broke my jaw, and knocked me right over on my side—while I held the prisoner by the throat he snatched away my watch and part of my chain—this is the other piece, it has been cut off—I have never seen the watch since—as soon as I was knocked over they ran away—I got up and ran after them after lying insensible for a few seconds—I found a policeman and I described them to him—I went to the East India Road Station, and made a charge, and a policeman went with me to a detective's house, and I went with the detective to house in Limehouse, where we found two men in bed—the detective touched one of them and said "Here you get up"—I said "I don't know that man," but when the prisoner put his face up, I said "That is the man who robbed me—this was two and a half or three hours after the robbery.</p>

I am barman at the Pigot Arms—on Wednesday night, 1st July, I saw the prosecutor there for an hour and a quarter—he treated the prisoner to a glass of ale—the prisoner had been refused admission to the house on several occasions—McQueen was not drunk when he left at 11.45—the prisoner followed him.</p>

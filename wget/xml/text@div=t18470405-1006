                  </hi> I am a coal-whipper, and live in Queen Anne-street, Whitechapel-road—the prisoner, Charles, is my first cousin—the prisoner, Ann, is his wife—I live at No. 19, and they at No. 21—my father lives with me. On the 12th of Feb., about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in bed—I was awoke out of my sleep by a knocking at my window—I heard the prisoner Charles say he would have my wife's life—my wife was down stairs—she had not been to bed at all—I got up—looked out at the window, and saw him and his wife in the street—I got up, went down into the street, and said I would get a policeman—the prisoner Ann flew at me, and I hit her—I saw the prisoner Charles go into his house and fetch out a poker—he came towards me, flourishing it at me—he got close to me, and hit me on the left shoulder—my father came out, and seized him round the arms—I did the same—we threw him on the ground—I told my father to go and get a policeman—he did so, while I was holding him on the ground—Catherine Hurley wrenched the poker out of his hand, and Ann came behind me and struck me on the head with another poker—I turned round, and saw her throw the poker away—I was smothered in blood—I took the poker up, and gave it to Catherine—a policeman came up, and took Charles—Ann went towards her own door—she hit me again on the nose with her fist in the presence of the policeman—I</p>

I will have his b—y life"—I knocked Charles down—I did not fall on him—I held him down by the head—my father got behind him, and held him, and me and the girl took the poker from him—I never hit him at all—I did not hear him say he would not see his wife murdered, when he struck me—I did not hear the prisoner cry for help when we had him down—he might have uttered words—he did not say, "You will choke me"—my father did not strike him on the breast—I went to work on the Monday morning, but was forced to give it up—I do not know if anybody tried to rescue him from me, I held him so tight till the policeman came.</p>

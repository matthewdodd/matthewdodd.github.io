                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 6, Northcote Place, Greenwich—on 4th February, between one and two in the morning, I was in the Borough Road—as I passed a coffee stall the prisoner asked me to treat him with some coffee—I gave him a cup and he went away—there were three or four of them there—I stopped there several minutes thinking I should see a policeman, and then went on towards Red Cross Square—when I was going to knock at my friend's door, the prisoner came up to me and two or three more—the prisoner held me round the neck behind while the others robbed me—I know it was the prisoner because they never got out of my sight—they took my watch from my pocket and snapped the chain, but I had the watch in my hand—they bit my hand to make me leave go, but I did not, and they broke the chain—I cried out that I was being robbed, and my friend Rowland came out—I gave my watch and a portion of my chain, which was in my hand, to Sarah Rowland—the prisoner said "It was not me," and ran away and Rowland after him—I followed and saw him taken.</p>

I keep the Red Cross Arms, Red Cross Square—on 4th February, Day was going to sleep at my house, and between one and two in the morning I heard him call out "George, I am being robbed"—I looked out at the window and saw the prisoner hugging him round the neck—I ran down, opened the door, and pursued the prisoner, calling "Stop thief"—a serjeant stopped him; I had kept him in sight all the time—I was not ten yards away from him—I saw no one else with him—he said it was not me it was the others.</p>

Rowland came up and said "I saw him with his arms round the neck of my friend—I took him to the Red Cross Anns, and the prosecutor charged him—his only reply was that he had been drinking coffee with the prosecutor—on the way to the station he struggled violently, put his legs round me, threw me down, end broke the small bone of my arm.</p>

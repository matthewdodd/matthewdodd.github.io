On Friday the 9th of February, while I was conversing with a gentleman in my parlour, I heard somebody in the shop; I went into the shop and found the prisoner there. He asked me if I had a child's great coat to sell? I told him I had not; he had a sack hanging across his arm; I observed he kept moving it as if he was hiding something under it; that caused me to suspect him. I looked round the shop and missed a dark cotton gown and a pair of ruffles from a nail. I had been in the shop about two minutes before and saw them there then. As he was going out of the shop I took hold of his collar and under the sack I found concealed a gown and pair of ruffles; they were worth about fifteen shillings. The prisoner then went down on his knees and begged my pardon, and desired I would let him go.</p>

Mr. Rowney called me out and said, this man wants a child's great coat; I saw him pull the gown from under the sack. I took the prisoner into the parlour till a constable was sent for.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop to ask the price of the gown; the gentleman asked me eleven shillings for it; I had it my hand and had a bag on my shoulder at the same time; I cannot say whether any of it might not be under the bag. I had some brass in the bag.</p>

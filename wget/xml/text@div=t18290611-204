On the 20th of May I came into the shop first to let the young men in, about seven o'clock - I sleep in the house myself; I observed a ladder on the counter, against the sky-light above, and observed the skylight window was broken - I found two squares had been taken out, and the bar of the window broken - the skylight slants - a small man might have got through; but there was a latch by which the window might have been opened; it was closed then; I had not been in the shop over night - I looked upon all the shelves, and discovered that many pieces of silk were taken away; I missed eight or nine rolls of silk, but am not certain of the exact number - the young men were with me; I missed a piece of calico, used as a wrapper, from near where the silks were taken; it was used to keep the dust from some muslins - the silks were on blocks of wood, which were also missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure the house is in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields? A. Certainly; my father is the churchwarden - I am not in partnership with him; he has no partner: I was the first person in the shop in the morning - the maid servants might have been up before me; I was up before any of the male servants, for I called them all up: I sleep on the second floor - my room looks down about twelve feet from the sky-light; I think the prisoner might get through the hole in the sky-light; a small man could have got through easily - the latch is immediately under the hole; I cannot say whether it had been raised; my father has a very large stock of silks - it is a large establishment; I buy every piece of silk myself: I cannot say how many pieces were in the house - I missed the property, and will swear it was there in the evening, but I was at the theatre that night - I know the wrapper ought to have been on the muslins.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HOLDSTOOK. I live at No. 81 1/2, Drury-lane; I do not know the prisoner personally - I know him, when I see him, by his lodging in that house where I now live; he came there first on Thursday morning, the 21st of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I think; I am only a lodger - before he came, a porter brought a box to the top of the house - this is the box (looking at it); the prisoner followed the porter up; he came at the same time in company with the porter - I was outside my room door, and the porter asked me where the box was to go to - the prisoner was close to him on the stairs; this was on the third floor; I did not know the room was let, and asked the porter who he wanted; he said the box belonged to a gentleman behind - I asked if he wanted the empty room; he said he did; I pointed to the empty room, which was on the same floor; he went in, took the box into the room, and the prisoner followed - the porter left the box in the room, and the prisoner asked me if he could lock or fasten the door; I cannot exactly say which - I told him I knew nothing about fastening the door, but I would take care nobody went in till the landlady came up: the prisoner went away, and left the door just on the latch - it is a kind of a spring latch; the landlady came up soon after, and I left - I did not hear of the robbery till the evening; I did not see the prisoner again that day myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you heard of the robbery that day? A. That evening - it was Thursday; Mr. Foulkes' son told me of it: I am a widow, and a stock and collar maker - I work for Mr. Foulkes and live five or six hundred yards from him, I should think; it is on the opposite side of the way; I was not present when the prisoner took the lodging; the man who brought the box wore a porter's jacket and an apron - I cannot say whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110089"></xptr>the prisoner paid him; I did not see the contents of the box till afterwards.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I belong to Bow-street office. I went, on the 11th of June, about twelve o'clock. to the prisoner's lodging, No. 81 1/2, Drury-lane, at the top of the house, with a search warrant, in company with Ellis, the principal officer of Bow-street, and Mr. Foulkes, Jun.; we went into a back-room, where the prisoner was in bed - the door was open; we told him we had suspicion there was stolen property in the room, and had got a warrant to search the room - he made no answer; I commenced searching, and in a dark corner, close to his bed, I found this box; it was nailed down all round - there were no binges; all the sides seemed alike; it is like a packing-case: I asked him what it contained - he made me no answer; I then broke it open, and found it contained silk: Mr. Foulkes looked at it, and said it was his property - it contained eight pieces of silk, and ten rollers; the silk was off the rollers, which were at the bottom of the box - I then searched his clothes, and in a coat which laid near the bed I found this pocket-book in one of the pockets, and in the leaf of the pocket-book I found eight pieces of remnants of the pieces of silk in the box, and each having the number of yards contained in each piece on them - I also found four duplicates in the book for four pieces of silk, pawned for 1l., 2l., 30s., and 20s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time was this? A. About noon: I cannot say whether he had been asleep - he was awake when I went in; this was about three weeks after the robbery, which had made a great noise in the neighbourhood: a complaint had been made at Bow-street, and it had been stated in all the newspapers - I asked the prisoner what he was; he said he had formerly kept a linendraper's shop at Brighton.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EVANS. I am shopman to Mr. Gray, a pawnbroker, of Fleet-street. I have some recollection of the prisoner - I saw him on the 1st of June, in my employer's shop; he pawned about thirty-two yards of silk; I lent him 2l. 10s. on it - this is the silk; I have brought it from our shop - to the best of my belief he is the man, but I cannot speak positively to him: I gave him a duplicate - this is the one I gave him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a stranger to you? A. He was.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WESTON. I am shopman to George Benton, a pawnbroker, of High Holborn. To the best of my knowledge the prisoner is the man who pawned this piece of silk on the 6th of June; I think it was in the evening, just before candles were lighted - I asked if it was his own; he said Yes, and gave the name of

             - I lent him 1l. on it; the duplicate I gave him is among these produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not certain of the time of day? A. No, I believe him to be the man; that belief is not strengthened by the duplicate being found - it is not uncommon for persons to pawn in fictitious names.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LAMAN. I am a shopman to Young and Luxmore, pawnbrokers, of St. Martin's-lane. To the best of my recollection the prisoner is the person who pawned this piece of silk on the 10th of June for 1l.: this is the duplicate I gave him - I think it was about six o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS GREEN. I live at No. 81 1/2, Drury-lane, and am landlord of the house. The prisoner came to me on the 21st of May to ask for a lodging; I had a bill up to let a room - I told him I had a room to let, and I could put a bed and bedstead into it; he asked what I should charge a week - I said I could not charge less than 2s. 6d. a week; he agreed to take it - I then asked him what he was; he said a linen-draper, and that he had burt his leg - he walked lame at the time; this was between eight and ten o'clock in the morning - he went away, and before twelve he and a porter came together; the porter had a box on his knot - the prisoner rather came before him to the door, and went up stairs behind him; the box produced is what he brought - I told the porter he had better take the box off his knot, or he would break the wall; he said, "No, I can carry it best on the knot," and the prisoner followed him up stairs with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You heard of this robbery, I suppose? A. I heard a rumour of it, but not on the day it happened - I am not much acquainted with Holdstock; the prisoner was three weeks at the lodging - he was in and out, sometimes he laid in bed all day, and sometimes used not to get up till one o'clock; he slept at home every night but one.</p>
               <p>MR. FOULKES. I can swear to all these silks by having my own private marks on them - here is one piece; the other end of it is marked with a private mark: it has not been cut - I put them on the rolls myself since they have been found; I have examined them all - there are eight pieces; there is no private mark on the remnants, but they correspond with the pieces; and the silk produced by the pawnbrokers are my father's, and have my hand-writing on the end of some of the rollers, and I know the handwriting of our shopman on the others; I have not the least doubt of the silk being my father's property - I value them at about 70l. or 80l.; the wrapper is here - here are part of some letters on it, which were made by our stamps; the word is "white," it is partly torn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you leave the house? A. At seven o'clock; the performance had commenced when I got to the theatre - none of our shopmen are here; we shut up at ten o'clock - it is not at all likely these silks could be sold that night; it is a large quantity: we have had an order for five thousand yards - a little boy at our desk receives money for goods; the people in the shop keep the order-book - we do not often sell whole pieces in the shop, and when we do we invariably take the rollers off; if we sell a large quantity we have them direct from the manufacturer, and then often do not block them - I went to bed directly I came home; I had no supper - I went into the drawing-room; people going out to sell silk often take a pattern with the length on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You receive silk from the manufacturer without rollers? A. Some of them; this wrapper would not have been sent away with silk - if silk is sold we pack it in paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the silks, and paid a very fair price for them. I went into Rowbottom's, in James-street, Covent-garden, to take refreshment; I entered into conversation with two or three young men, one of whom I had been in company with several times; he asked if I would buy a quantity of silks - I said if they were cheap I had no objection; he showed me the samples, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110090"></xptr>after a time I agreed to give him 30l. for the lot - I told him I would pay him 22l., and the rest when I had disposed of the goods, which he agreed to - two of the party left the house, returned in about half an hour, (which was about half-past seven o'clock) and brought the silks - I paid the 22l., and they agreed to take the rest when I had sold them - I know nothing whatever of the robbery, and never had a charge of the kind against me in my life.</p>

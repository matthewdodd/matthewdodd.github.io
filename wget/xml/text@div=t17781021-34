               <p>Had she the pocket book in her hand? - I cannot say she had.</p>
               <p>What did you see her do? - I cannot say I saw her do any thing; she was one that surrounded me, she seemed very much frightened when I laid hold of her.</p>
               <p>Did she seem before to be in the company of the other two? - She was one that surrounded me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether the other two prisoners were two of the persons that surrounded you? - I do not know; they ran away immediately as they took the pocket book; there were notes in the pocket book to the value of 14 or 1500 l. and many memorandums.</p>

               <p>Are you sure there was no more than three? - I think there was no more, I could see no more.</p>
               <p>You say you saw four hands held up, then one must have held two hands up I suppose? I suppose so; as soon as the book was taken four hands were held up to receive it.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing? - I do not recollect a word, it was all done in a minute.</p>
               <p>As to the persons of Arrogony and Davis, you know nothing of them? - No. They are perfect strangers to me.</p>
               <p>You saw the pocket book in the hands of a person when the hands were held up, did she seem to have received it from the hands of another? - She might have received it from the hands of another; I do not know which.</p>

Mr. Kitchen cried out, stop thief! I am robbed. There was no other woman near him when he cried stop thief.

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, Wilcox, in your service at the time this matter took place? - He was a twelvemonth from the 16th of April last. On the 4th of July, in consequence of missing bread before, I counted my bread that was left in my kitchen, there were twenty-six, twelve, and seven quartern loaves; on that day, I being unwell, had requested Mr. Lashbrooke, a neighbour, to be at the top of the street, in case he should resist. About ten o'clock in the morning he had been down to Westminster, serving all there; he then came in and put two loaves in his pail, and out he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - I did not. He went out with the pail to fetch yeast; in consequence of which I looked into the kitchen and missed two loaves. I immediately followed him; I came up with him about the middle of the street, or hardly so high, it may be twenty or thirty yards from the door; when I came up to him, I took hold of him, and I believe I said, you scoundrel, where are you going with that? I perceived two loaves in the pail; I do not recollect that he made any reply whatever; but requested me to let him walk without being held. I told him he need not be ashamed of me if he was not of his action. Mr. Lashbrooke came up within three yards when I laid hold of him. I took him to the watch house; I immediately left him there to go home with my fresh bread, which was laying in a very awkward state. I first see him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160233"></xptr>again over at the Bear, in Bow-street; he then confessed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him any thing if he would confess? - NO.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any threats? - Neither to my knowledge. I asked him if he was not ashamed to serve me in the manner he had done? He intreated me for mercy; he begged I would forgive him, on account of his children; that was nearly the expression he made use of; I told him he had no thought of me and my children, or else he would not have done an act of the kind; I said, I suppose let you tell the story, you would say this is the first time; he said, no, I don't say it is the first, it is the second; I said, you know I have put my hand in my pocket and lent you money, and when you have offered to pay me half of it, I said, you had better leave it and pay me when you can. He then went over to Bow-street, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. You had a good character with this man? - I had, or else he should not have been taken into my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Has he a large family? - I never knew he had but two children; but that day he told me he had a third.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Hungerford-market. On the morning of this day I was about a hundred yards from Mr. Freame's door, about ten o'clock in the morning. I see the prisoner come out of Mr. Freame's house with a pail at his back; he walked some little distance from the house; I see Mr. Freame come out of the house after him, which was a signal to me to stop him; I then crossed over the way then and came within six or seven yards of him, and by that time Mr. Freame had come up with him; I stopped him, Mr. Freame was behind him and I was before him. There were two quarters loaves in the pail, when taken off his back at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - I did not hear. Mr. Freame said, he had heard of people carrying iniquity in their bosom, but thou carriest it at thy back.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What is the value of these two loaves? - Ten-pence halfpenny a quartern loaf, and nearly all the money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel. My master entirely left the business to his daughter; he entirely looked after the bakehouse. I, that morning, had taken out a great deal of bread; I always went down into the kitchen for what bread I wanted; I was going to serve customers with this bread, they lay in my way that I was going for the yeast; it was a considerable wet morning, and I put these loaves in the pail, and my master came out after me. I always used to make it my practice to take the bread out of the kitchen, while there was any bread in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was he at liberty to go down into the kitchen and take what bread he pleased? - No, he brought it into the shop and put it on the counter when the shop was emptied, and it was counted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were you ever there to do it yourself? - I was there, or somebody that I entrusted.</p>
               <p>Miss. FREAME sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever act in your father's business? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it over the custom in his business for the bread to go out without being counted? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not happen, by accident, that bread may go out and account given of it afterwards? - Never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160234"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. Is not the bread, when taken out by the journeymen, always taken from the shop? - Always.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Gooch, who keeps the Bell public house, Old Bailey. The prisoner was in my service, about two months—on Sunday, 30th April, I went into the prisoner's room, and opened one of her drawers; I found there a bottle of rum, marked with Mr. Gooch's mark—I took it out, and asked the prisoner if she knew about it; she said, "I know nothing at all about it; you can have my key"—she did not give me her key—she drew back, and would not let me have it—I told her I should search her box—she went up stairs, opened the box herself, and took out another bottle of rum, and on looking in the box there was another bottle containing brandy, a dram glass, a basket which I identified, and some small articles of wearing apparel; two of them are charged in the indictment, this small white shawl, and this scarf—there were several other things in the box—the bottles in the box had not our mark on them—they were medicine bottles—no doubt they were mine, but I cannot swear to them—this scarf is mine—there was this pocket handkerchief, which I can identify.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and am in the service of Mrs. Gooch. On 30th April, the prisoner asked me to draw some brandy—I was to get it in the bar—she gave me two glass bottles, and a black bottle, to draw it in—they were medicine bottles—I drew the brandy—my master and mistress were at that time in bed—I took the bottles up stairs—I also drew some rum—I put two bottles under the mattress, and one in the drawer in our bed room—the prisoner and I slept together—I drew the liquor out of the pipes in the bar—I did not tell my mistress—the prisoner said I was not to tell her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Between six and seven o'clock, on the night of the 9th of December, I saw the prisoner coming down Compton-street, with something on his head—he saw me and quickened his pace—he went down Northumberland-place, where there is a private door, leading to a marine-store shop—I watched—he went, pushed the door, and went in—I went into the shop—there was nothing there—I went into</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a marine store-shop, at No 44, Compton-street. On this Saturday evening the prisoner came into my room, and threw the lead down—I took the light, and went to the door, and saw the boy in the passage—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Some lead"—I told him I could not buy it—he said he could not take it out, the policeman was at the door—he threw it down, and went out—the policeman came in, and went out at the same door and found him—the policeman found the lead there, and took it—I do not know how much there was.</p>

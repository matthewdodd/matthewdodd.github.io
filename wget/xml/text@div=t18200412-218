I do not know whether my coat was buttoned or not. When I awoke he was standing by the fire, which was some distance from the box. It is a small room - I did not see Stone. I called for some liquor,

            . I live in Cumberland-street, Middlesex Hospital, and am a shoemaker. I was drinking in the house. I was not there when the prisoner came in - the prosecutor was not sitting by him. When I came in he appeared quite sober, and I saw Saunders drinking with him - I drank likewise with him, and we had not more than a pot of beer each. I was there when he lost his money, and was on the opposite side of the box. Saunders was the only one that sat on the same side with him, no other person could set next to him on the other side. Saunders was on the left side of Vercolme. I observed Vercolme get change at the bar, and did not see Stone; I must have seen him if he had been there.

I asked him if he had any money, or had robbed the prosecutor? he said, No. Saunders was very much in liquor - he made some resistance, and denied robbing him. I found 34 s. in silver, and a 1 l. note in his fob, and 3 d. in copper. Stone was not in the house at the time to my knowledge.</p>

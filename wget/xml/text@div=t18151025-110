               <p>Q. Look at that paper, (paper put into the hands of the witness,) Is that signature of his name, his hand writing - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q.You saw Seabrook sign a paper, but whether it was this or no, you can't tell - A. I certainly think it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, as counsel for the prisoner, objected that this paper, (which purported to be a confession taken in writing from the prisoner's month,) could not be admitted in evidence, until the signature of the prisoner's name affixed to it, was proved to be his hand writing; as in all other cases where documentary evidence was adduced, the handwriting of the person whose name appeared affixed, ought to be proved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin, contra-contended. First, that this must be taken for granted as the prisoner's hand writing, for it was the magistrate's duty not to sign it until he had seen it signed by the prisoner. Secondly, the last witness, Sexton, had sworn he had seen the prisoner sign it, though if he had not, he could not perhaps have sworn to his hand writing. If seeing a man sign a paper was not proof of the identity of his hand writing, half the documentary evidence ever adduced, would be invalid. Suppose the case of a person who could not write, and therefore affixed some mark, why, one could swear to one mark from another; but if they saw a certain person make a certain mark, they might surely be enabled to prove that it was his.</p>
               <p>COURT. This witness has said, I know Mr. Henderson's hand writing; one of those signatures is his; I saw the prisoner sign that paper also. That is quite proof enough of the prisoner's signature.</p>
               <p>(The paper was now read, and appeared to be a confession taken from the prisoner on his examination, and the same in effect, as what he first made to the witness Sexton, and which appears upon his examination.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent, and never knew what the meaning of signing was.</p>

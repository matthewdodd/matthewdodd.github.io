            . Are you the wife of Mr. Lake, the occupier of this house - A. Yes. I had the key of the room where the prosecutor and prisoner lodged, on the day the things were stolen, the room door was locked from nine o'clock in the morning till nine at night, I locked it myself. At a quarter past nine at night, the prisoner came in, I gave him the key, he went up to bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180010"></xptr>at that time. I took the prisoner without a character, I had suspicion of him, I watched the light every night, and that night he kept the light in a long while, I thought he was either robbing me, or the young man that was in that room. About a quarter after ten, the prisoner came down, and said he had a letter to write; I gave him a light, and he went up stairs.</p>

On the evening of the 13th of June, about half past ten at night, I went home to my lodgings, the landlord called me into the shop, told me that he had a suspicion that the prisoner had broken open Mr. Newberry's box; I stood in the shop some time talking to the landlord, the prisoner came down and asked for a light, said he was going to write a letter. I went up stairs, I looked through the key hole of the door, I saw a bundle lay on the bed tied up in a black apron, I went and told the landlord of it; as I returned up stairs again, I looked through the key hole again, I saw the prisoner kneeling or stooping by the bed side, pushing something under the bed. Newberry came in soon after that.</p>

I waited in the house till Newberry came in; I went up after and saw the things out of the box, and a bundle under the bed, the box was broken open. The prisoner was then in bed with his clothes on. I waited in the room while Newberry went for an officer.</p>

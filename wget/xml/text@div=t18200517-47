               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You missed your property on the 18th of March? Was the first step you took to recover it to go to a fortune-teller - A. Yes. I took the prisoner up on the Monday after on suspicion, but she was set at liberty, and has been so ever since. After that a gentleman served me a process from the King's Bench, and I was obliged to pay her 5 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not this morning, at the door of this Court, tell Littlefold to be sure, and swear positively that Poll Pearce gave him the note - A. I did not. I told him if he was concerned in it to say so.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow. As I was going home the prisoner called me to her gate, and asked me if I was going down to Hounslow town? I said not then, but should after I got home, to sell a few radishes. She asked me to bring her a purple purse, two red spotted handkerchiefs, and a pair of silk gloves. She gave me a 10 l. Uxbridge note and 4 s. - this was on the 27th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon; she told me to go to Mr. Wood's shop, but to no other, and the articles hung in the corner of the window, and that if I did not see her when I came home I was to hide them till I did see her - she told me to say I had lived at Mr. Wild's four years, and to deny my name. I went there and bought the things, Mr. Wood asked me who I came from, and I said from Mr. Wild's - when I returned I did not see her, and hid them in a heap of turf. I did not see her till the morning, then asked her to go with me, and I would give her the articles? she said No, she could not stop, for she was going to Isleworth for greens, but when she came back she would. I watched her back, and asked her again, but she said,</p>
               <p>"You are not going to bring me into any scrawl," and did not go with me. I fetched them, and gave them to her before a witness, Mr. Field.</p>
               <p>Q. They went on purpose to see what passed - A. Yes. When I put them into her hands she said it was a fine present, and then my father and the constable took her. She held them in her hands all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Never threw them down - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say,</p>
               <p>"It is a fine present, but I know nothing about it." - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been questioned about the note before - A. Yes, directly I came home Mr. Wood came to me, and I denied it. I did not give the prisoner the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you - A. Nearly fifteen. I never had a sovereign in my possession - I did not tell Mr. Wood that I found the handkerchiefs and the gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never offer to give Sarah Weven a purse - A. No. I am sure I never had a sovereign.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you had the note, you had heard of the prisoner's being taken up for the robbery - A. Yes. I gave Mr. Wood 4 s. 6 d., besides the note, because she told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Wood charged you with it you told him you knew nothing about it, and that you was never in his shop in your life - A. Yes, and next morning I told this story.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know in March that the Uxbridge note was stolen - A. Yes, and I heard that a young woman of a fair complexion was suspected.</p>

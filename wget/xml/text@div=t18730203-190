                  </hi>. I keep the Monmouth Head, Leicester Square—on 1st January the prisoner brought me this note, and asked me to cash it for him—seeing that it was not payable for three days, I said, "This is not payable yet; what guarantee have I that the man will sail I"—he said that Wilson was on board then, and I need not wait the three days; that he had cashed the note for Wilson, and wanted the money—he said he had received 12 1/2 per cent, for cashing it, and would I allow him the same—I cashed it; he spent a little money in the house, and I gave him a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to Mr. Gilmore, in Fenchurch Street, and the note was dishonoured—I asked the prisoner to whom the cheque was to be made payable; he said "Make it payable to me, my name is Williams"—there is no truth in the allegation that a waiter of Mr. Lyons's came and said that he would be re-sponsible—a waiter came and said that he had no doubt it was all right, and if his mistress had the money she would have cashed it for him, but there was no guarantee—I knew the waiter.</p>

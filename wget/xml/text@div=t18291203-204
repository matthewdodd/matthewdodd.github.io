               <p>JAMES ALDRIDGE. I am errand-boy to Mr. Edward Wrench, of Gray's Inn-terrace, Gray's Inn-lane. On the 23rd of November I was going down Saffron-hill, and saw the prisoner in his shop - he called me, gave me 3d., and asked where I worked, and what I worked at; I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030073"></xptr>him, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think you could get any thing?" I said, "I dare say I might," and then went on my errand; that was the first I saw of him - on the Saturday night I took him three pairs of spectacles; I thought he meant could I steal any thing, when he asked if I could get any thing; on Saturday night he was behind his counter - on the Monday I went again, and took him seven pairs more; he gave me 2s. for them, but said they were not so good as those I took him at first. and he could get such as them at 4d. or 6d. a pair - he had given me 1s. for the first three pairs; I afterwards took him a little telescope, six pairs more of spectacles, and a gold eye-glass - he gave me some money, and said it was only plated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Have you ever had any conversation with him before? A. No - by"getting" I understood him to mean to steal - he did not say what he would give me; I mentioned this to the Magistrate at the second examination - I was told by a boy to take a silver spoon about a month ago; it was taken to Mr. Saunders' by the boy - he was stopped, and we were both taken; I said I knew nothing about the spectacles - I did not say I would swear I never had them; my father took one pair, which I told him I had found - they were stolen; my father said, "Tell me the truth where you found them, and I will keep them till I find an owner."</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EVANS. I live with my parents, in Ravenshall-rents, Liquorpond-street. Aldridge came to our house, called me out, and gave me a silver spoon to sell; I sold two pairs of spectacles and an eye-glass to the prisoner on Saturday week - he gave me 8d. for the spectacles, and 3d. for the eye-glass; I saw Aldridge take two pairs of spectacles to the prisoner's shop, for which he gave him 8d. - I took two more, for which he gave me 8d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If he has sworn you told him to steal the spoon. it is not true? A. No - he told me he had picked it up; I never stole any thing- I have not come from the prison; my father bailed me - I was in prison about six months ago, for being with some boys who stole a vice and some snuff-boxes; the Magistrate liberated me - I was never in prisoner about any thing else; I am twelve years old.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK. I am an officer. I received information, and went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's on the 23rd of November, and asked if he had bought any spectacles of a boy - he hesitated; I said I should search if he did not answer - he then turned, and gave me eleven pairs and an eye-glass off the shelf; I asked if he had any thing else - he said No; I took him to Hatton-garden and saw Aldridge, who said there was an opera-glass - the prisoner then said, "Yes, I have one - it is on a shelf in my window;" I went back, and his wife gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has not the prisoner served the office of constable, and carried on a respectable business? A. Yes.</p>

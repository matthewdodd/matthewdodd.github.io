On Friday, the 14th of September, the prisoner applied for a lodging at the house, and was admitted - he remained with us till the 19th; he then went away, without paying his lodging, my box was in his room - I slept in the room underneath. When he was gone I missed from my box a purse, containing ten sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, a quantity of loose silver, a brooch, four rings, and two silk handkerchiefs; I am sure my box had been locked, and I found it still locked; there were no marks of violence on it- I am sure the things were there when he came to the house, and I left it all safe on the Tuesday night before he went to bed; he slept in the room that night, and went away on the Wednesday morning - I had opened my purse that night to take some money out; I was present when he was apprehended, and pointed him out to the officer - he had then got one of my handkerchiefs in his possession.</p>

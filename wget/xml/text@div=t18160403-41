            's house, which is No. 11. Hart-lane, Thames-street. On the 28th of February, in the afternoon; I went there about five o'clock, and was stationed there to watch on the 29th, about six or seven in the evening, I was in the kitchen, and heard the street door go; I then got up, and went into the passage, and met the prisoner, with the middle door open, coming in; I told him to walk in, and not stand there, and when he came in, he took a chair, and sat down by the fire. I then asked him who he wanted, and he said, Watson, either Mr. or Mrs. I then asked him what he had got; he then looked at me with a little surprize, and said nothing. I told him that would not do for me, for I knew he had something concealed about him. I told him he had better pull it out; but he did not chuse, and I searched him, and pulled out from under his jacket, fifteen cakes of Spanish juice. I then took his apron off, and found a small bag, concealed in his breeches, which he said, was coffee; but on examining it, I found it to be cloves. I asked him where he got it; and he said, he found it. I asked him where he worked; I could get no answer; at last he said, for no one in particular, but for any one that would give him a job; I told him as that was the best account he could give, I should be under the necessity of taking him into custody; and when I questioned him more closely, after I got him to the Compter, he told me where he had been at work, and that he had taken the juice out of a chest. Nothing farther passed then. I went to where his master lived, and examined his warehouse, and I saw a chest of juice, which corresponded exactly with this; on looking farther, Mr. Lewis shewed me the cloves, and I could see that some had been taken out, for there was the mark of a hand like.</p>

               <p>JOHN LEWIS. I reside in Botolph-lane, Thames-street. The prisoner had been in my employment, as a carman, about nine months. I recollect the last witness coming to my house either on the day or the day after the prisoner was taken into custody. On examination when we looked at a cask of cloves, we found that it had been opened, for part of the head was loose, and some cloves were gone; it had been opened in the usual course of trade; I can't say whether I could have discovered that any were missing. The prisoner had an opportunity of taking cloves and Spanish juice, if he chose; there were two pounds and a half deficient in the cask of cloves, and one pound and two ounces were found on him. I believe the cloves found and the liquorice to have come from my premises, as far as my judgment goes.</p>

               <p>GEORGE BARLLY. I am a warehouse-man, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030034"></xptr>conversant with these articles. We took stock, and found two pounds and a half of cloves deficient. The bag in which the cloves were found, is the bag in which the prisoner usually brought his victuals. The cloves found on him exactly correspond with those on our premises.</p>

               <p>The prisoner received a good character from several witnesses.</p>

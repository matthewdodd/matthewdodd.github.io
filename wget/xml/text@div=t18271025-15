On the 10th of October, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and took down a pair of stockings, which hung about fifteen inches within the door - I was told of it, and went in pursuit; I first saw him about one hundred yards off, and did not lose sight of him till he was secured by a gentleman - I had raised an alarm; I took this pair of stockings from his hand - they had been fastened by three pins, to a very large cord; a strong pull would disengage them - they were safe half a minute before.</p>

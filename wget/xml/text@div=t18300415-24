            . I live at Notting-hill, and have known the prisoner from his infancy; his mother used to rent a cottage of the prosecutor. I met the prisoner in the Bayswater-road, about ten o'clock on the morning of the robbery - I saw a black silk handkerchief round his neck, and asked how he came by it; he said his cousin Polly had given it to him - I saw he had a pair of trousers on, and asked how he came by them; he said Mrs. Jordan gave them to him - he went to wash his face in a ditch by the road side; he took the handkerchief off and gave it to me to hold - I told him that was dirty water; he then went to the horse trough - I went on with my cart; I saw him in the road afterwards, and called after him to give him the handkerchief, but he ran away - I afterwards met the prosecutrix, and gave it to her.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Flint, of Edgware-road. On Tuesday, the 30th of March, in the evening, this shawl was pawned for 2s. 6d., in the name of Thomas Thomas - to the best of my recollection it was by the prisoner; I believe it to be him - I did not know him before; the prosecutrix claimed the shawl a day or two afterwards.</p>

               <p>ISAAC LONON. I rent this cottage. I do not know what parish it is in. On Saturday, the 3rd of April, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Kilburn, and said,"How came you to rob me, Tom;" I knew him before - he made no answer; he had got my wife's shoes on his feet - I challenged them as her's; he had trousers on, but not mine - I said, "Tom, how came you to break into my house? how did you get in?" he said, "Why I took a pane of glass out at the back window, and got in;" I did not threaten him or make him any promise.</p>

            . I am a constable and watch-house-keeper. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington. I found the prisoner at the watch-house, searched him, and found on him a pair of glasses, nothing else.</p>
               <p>MRS. LONON. This is my shawl; it had never been worn - I am sure it is mine; I have no mark on it - it is just the same as I folded it up; this silk handkerchief I know to be mine, and the one I lost - the two glasses fit the frames.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Their son used to pick the fat off the wash-tub, and tell me to go and sell it, but I would not; that was the first indication of my going thieving.</p>
               <p>MRS. LONON. I keep pigs, and suppose he means the hog-wash-tub.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Forest-gate, in Essex. I had a grey mare on the forest on the 5th of April—I saw her last at two o'clock that day—she is a very quiet mare—I went to look for her in the evening, finding she did not come home at her usual time, and at half-past ten I found her at the station—she was dose against Forest-gate, in West Ham parish, on the Wanstead-flats.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I met the two prisoners about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, against Can Hall-gate, about a mile and a half from Wanstead-flats—it was not part of the forest—Callow was riding the mare—he had on a jacket and collar—Mountjoy was walking at the head of the mare—this is the bridle they had—(<hi rend="italic">producing a boy's red comforter</hi>)—the toll-man stopped them, and demanded his fare, which was 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mountjoy said, "Wont it do when we come back?"—I said to the toll-man, "I don't think this is right, I will question the boys"—I asked them who the mare belonged to—they said, "To Mr. Davis, an ironmonger, of Stratford"—knowing there was no such person in Stratford, I said, "Does he keep a shop!"—Callow said, "Yes, he keeps an ironmonger's shop, it has been lately opened"—I said, "How long has it been opened?"—at last Mountjoy said, "I will tell no more lies about it, we took the mare off the forest; I took this off my neck, and Callow put it on the horse's neck, and rode it away;" and they meant to take it to their uncle's stables, in Beer, or Vera-yard, I did not properly understand them at the time.</p>

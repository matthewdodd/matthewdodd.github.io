I rent the ground floor; the landlord lives in the next house - the house is let out in tenements. The prisoner was in my service, and slept in the same room as me. I lost a trunk, containing the articles stated in the indictment, and five sovereigns and some halfpence; the hat and hankerchiefs were not in the trunk; it was locked. I saw it safe in my room, at four o'clock, on Thursday afternoon, and missed it about eight o'clock that evening. I have no other servant; he and I were the only persons who lived there. I left him in the room, about four o'clock, and went out; and, on returning, it was gone. I took him into custody next evening, in Whitechapel; he had lived with me a month. The officer has found the trunk, and all the things, except the shirt and trowsers; only 1 l. 9 s. was left, out of the five sovereigns - he lived with my brother for two months, and then came to me.</p>

            . I am headborough of Whitechapel. I received the prisoner in charge from Higgs about half-past six o'clock in the evening, searched him, and found Higg's hat on his head, and a silk hankerchief; and in his pocket I found the watch, and in his trowser pocket a purse, containing a sovereign, 9 s. 2 d., and a key. We asked him where he lodged the night before; he took us to Essex-street, and shewed us the house, and said he lodged up stairs I found an empty trunk on the second floor, there which Higgs claimed. I found another trunk in the next room, containing things which the prosecutor claimed; the key found on the prisoner opened it.</p>

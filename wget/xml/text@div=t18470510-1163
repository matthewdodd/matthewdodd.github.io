                  </hi>. I live in Well-street, Oxford-street. I was a patient in Mr. Byas' Lunatic Asylum, Grove-hall, Bow—I was about to be dis<lb></lb>charged, and am as well now as ever I was in my life. On the 27th of March I was sleeping in the ward No. 1—the prisoner Garrett was upper keeper there, and Downes his assistant—Garrett slept in the ward No. 1—upwards of twenty persons slept in that ward—in the morning, just at break of day, Garrett called me to assist him—I directly went to his bed, and found him in bed, and William Rance, the deceased, who was a patient, and slept in the same ward, by the side of the bed, holding Garrett fast by the throat with one hand, in the act of putting a leather strap over his head with the other hand—it was a strap which Rance used to wear round his waist—I immedi<lb></lb>ately seized Rance by the arms, and drew him into the middle of the room—he struggled a little with me, and we both fell together; and at the time I pulled him away, he said, "Oh, it is you, Mecklenberg, is it? you are the last person I should have thought"—Garrett got up, and called for Chumley, one of the assistants, but before he came I and Rance had got up—he did not appear injured in the least by the fall, as my arm was under him—he fell on his right side, and got up again without difficulty—Chumley came and tripped his feet from under him, and threw him down—he fell first on his seat, then fell backwards—he was struggling, and I could not perceive that he was hurt by the fall—Garrett then went down stairs for a straight waistcoat, and while he was gone Chumley struck Rance several times about the body and side—Garrett</p>

               <p>returned, and Downes with him—they brought a straight waistcoat—Rance was then on the ground, and Downes struck Rance violently about the body and sides—they were all three trying to put the straight jacket on—Rance was striving very much to get away—Garrett called for a handkerchief or scarf—a black one was handed to him—he put it round Rance's neck, and held him down on the floor by it till he became quite.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the quietness caused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared to me by strangling, holding him down—Rance at that time turned dark in the face, and there was a little blood from his nostrils and mouth—he was quiet after that till the jacket was put on—his arms were tied behind him, and he was carried to his bed by the prisoners—he was then quite manageable, and could not help himself—when he was put on the bed his feet were confined by one or two handkerchiefs tied to them, and then to the lower part of the bedstead—he was laid in his back, with his arms under him—a sheet was passed through between his arms and back, and tied on each side the bedstead; to keep him down—he remained in that state till a little after eight o'clock in the morning—I never saw him attempt to strike either of them down to that time—a lit<lb></lb>tle after eight o'clock I followed Garrett and Downes, who went up and released him—they untied the sheet and handkerchiefs at his feet, and took off the jacket—when he was released he was as violent as ever—directly the jacket was off he struck. at Garrett with great violence, and very nearly hit him in the face, but did not do so—Downes immediately struck him on the right side, and knocked him down on the bed—I believe he struck with all the power he had—Rance appeared to me to fall on the left side of the bedstead—he was getting exhausted, and appeared very low—Garrett assisted in holding him down on the bed, having his hand on his head—pride, who is a keeper in the house, came into the ward just at that time, and I then left.</p>

               <p>27th of March, about eight o'clock, I heard a noise in No. 1 ward, and heard Garrett's voice as I went into the ward—he ordered Rance to put on his clothes—I saw Rance standing with his back towards the door—Garrett and Downes were facing him, ordering him to put on his clothes—Downes had the straight jacket in his hand—I took hold of both Rance's arms, and held them behind him—he was always considered a violent man—I observed his face all over blood—Garrett put a handkerchief round his neck, held the two ends with his hand, and dragged him to the bed more on his side, and then on his back, with violence—he put his knee on his chest at the same time, and held him down—Downes at the same time struck him ten or twelve times with his clenched fist on the left side, more towards the bottom of his belly, where Garrett's knee was—they appeared to me very serve blows, as hard as he could strike—Garrett's whole weight was on Rance's body on the bed—I told them several times to <hi rend="italic">drop it</hi>, to leave off, but Garrett said, "Give it him, give it the old b—r"—Downes continued to strike him several blows, after I desired him to cease; and after Garrett had said, "Give it him"—Garrett's knees were at the time about the same part—Rance could not make any resistance—the blood was running out of his mouth and nostrils, and he could not speak, for the handkerchief was round his neck so tight he could not cry out—they then took him off his bed, and he stood on the floor—they put the straight jacket on, and after it was fastened it appeared too tight in front—Garrett took hold of his two shoulders and struck him four or five times violently with his knee at the bottom of his belly, and said, "Stick your belly in, you b—y old b—r"—he sighed and leaned forward, and blood ran from his mouth and nostrils—he did not appear able to speak—Garrett took him down stairs and locked him in the cell—I never saw him afterwards—I saw no marks of violence about either of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent at Grove-hall Asylum. I have been there about two years-and-a-half—I knew William Rance—he had been under my care for twelve months—he was described as an agricultural labourer, fifty-eight years old—he was occasionally violent, and has been under restraint on two previous occasions—I proposed temporary restraint, and he recovered—I saw him on the 27th of March, about eleven in the morning—I reside on the premises, and am accessible at all times—I found him in seclusion—I went to him from a representation made to me by Garratt—found him in a straight-waistcoat, in a state of considerable mental excitement—I directed that he should remain in seclusion—ordered medicine and proper diet—I observed no blood about him—his left eye was contused and black—Garratt was in the cell with me—I asked him how that occurred—he said, he had been very violent during the night, and attempted to strangle him while he was asleep, and with the assistance of Mecklenberg and the keepers, with considerable difficulty, he succeeded in restraining him, and fastened him to the bed, and the contusion had occurred in that way—I did not notice any other appearance of violence about him—that was the only part uncovered—he was standing in the cell, which is on the ground-floor—it has windows to it—it is not padded—I saw him daily till the 1st of April, when he died—he had a diseased action of the heart, and I had no reason to suppose his death was caused by violence—I attended the inquest on the 3rd of April, and the prisoners were examined as witnesses—pride was examined after them, and in consequence of hearing his examination, I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination of the body after the verdict—his body was muscular and fat—the left eye bruised, and a bruise on the centre of the chest—bruises on the left side of the body, the left arm, and left groin—on opening the chest, I found the fifth rib on the left side broken obliquely about three inches from its cartilage—the anterior portion of the broken part was protrude<lb></lb>ing through the pleura—the sixth and seventh ribs were broken about an inch further back than the fifth rib—the eight and ninth ribs were also broken about an inch still further back, but the broken ends were not at all disturbed—the cavity of the chest contained about four ounces of bloody fluid on the substance of the lungs—the lung itself was healthy on the left node of the chest—the fractured bone had not penetrated the lung—the death was caused by the inflammation of the pleura, arising from its being punctured by the broken rib, which caused the inflammation—the other broken ribs would not cause death—the external bruises on the left side were over the internal injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> would the other bruises and broken ribs increase the ten<lb></lb>dency to inflammation.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say they would—the pressure of the knee on the parts and places struck with force, would account for the inter<lb></lb>nal injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the pleura, does it not surround the heart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the lining of the lungs and ribs—the pleura was punctured—I do not think a rib is easily broken—he was in a healthy state of bone—it would requires considerable violence to produce the fractures I saw—the ribs had been recently broken, certainly—I treated him for excessive action of the heart, which was precisely the treatment I should apply for inflammation—I had him bled—his heart was very much enlarged—that is a disease which very frequently causes sudden death—a person with that disease is never safe—any excitement might occasion death, but a great many such persons undergo a great deal of excitement—he had hypertrophy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say he did not die of hypertrophy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can, by the appear<lb></lb>ance of the pleura, on the left side of the chest—if I had not found the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184705100054"></xptr>
               <p>inflammation, I should have had no hesitation in accounting for the death—the approximate cause of death in hypertrophy is the disturbance of the heart's action—that would not necessarily produce the enlarged state of heart which I found—it was enormously enlarged—there were no other ap<lb></lb>pearances about the heart—inflammation of the pleura may be reduced—it had been stated to me that there had been a considerable struggle, and that violence was necessary to restrain the patient—the struggle described might affect the action of the heart, and might terminate life suddenly, but not necessarily sudden, it might be lingering—if he had died of hypertrophy, I should expect to find the appearances about the heart which I described—Pride holds the same situation as he did before—he has not been advanced—I do not authorize a straight waistcoat in the asylum, except under my direc<lb></lb>tion—his endeavouring to strangle the keeper would call for more than ordi<lb></lb>nary care, and render more than ordinary restraint necessary—I gave it as my opinion before the Coroner that he died of effusion arising from disease of the heart—I had not then made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Downes been in the establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One mouth—he came from Whitmore-house with a good character—Garratt, also, had a very good character—serus effusion into the cavities is a common sequel in disease of the heart—this was bloody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The effusion you found in the cavity of the chest was of a totally different character to a case of death from hypertrophy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so, it was a bloody effusion—the blood itself, I believe, arose from decom<lb></lb>position during life, caused by inflammation from the fractured rib—I was not aware that any violence had been used to him, when I was examined before the Coroner—the straight-jacket should have been put on in a proper manner, and he should have been taken to a single room—they should have reported it to me, with all the particulars connected with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> why do you fix with certainty the death to be caused by the broken rib, instead of the diseased heart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I see in the one an amount of structural alteration which I know full well men do live with, and, in the other, an amount of structural alteration which I know must be fatal—one case is ambiguous, and the other clear—I think the injury happening on the 27th of March, would have produced the death within that period—the fracture would have caused the inflammation which produced death—the effusion of blood arose from the inflammation and mortification, caused ori<lb></lb>ginally by the puncture of the ribs—the bruises and contusions had a tendency to increase the inflammation.</p>
               <p>(The prisoners received good characters.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 95, Granby-street, Wa<lb></lb>terloo-road, the prisoner lives at No. 93, next door but one. On 22nd Oct, between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, I went out for a pint of half and half—as I passed her window she muttered something, I cannot say what—as I came back she struck me on the temple, and said, "Take that, you old cow, for going up against the people at No. 3"—(I had had to bind them over to keep the peace at No. 3, as they were always insulting me)—I was cut, and the blood flowed very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 2, Granby-street. On the night of 2nd Oct. I saw the prosecutrix pass No. 93, where the prisoner lives, on her way to the public house—the prisoner was at the window, and said, "There goes that fat old <hi rend="italic">cow</hi>; I will kill her"—she had some sharp instru<lb></lb>ment in her hand; I think it was a pair of scissors, or a penknife—as the prosecutrix returned she said, "You went against the people at No. 3, did you; take that, you old cow!"—she struck her with the instrument in her hand, and blood flowed immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. I was standing talking to the last witness, and saw the prisoner with some sharp instrument in her hand, like a pair of scissors, knocking it on the window ledge, and threatening Mrs. Felstead—it shone—as Mrs. Felstead came back, the prisoner leant out out over</p>

               <p>the window, and struck her—I saw something in her hand at that time, and afterwards too—Mrs. Felstead had done nothing to her, but she said, "Oh, my God, I am stabbed!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the polite force. Mrs. Felstead was brought to me on the following day by the police, by order of the Magistrate—I found a triangular puncture, but did not probe it, as it was healing—a pair of scissors or a penknife would be likely to do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in Drury-lane. On Saturday, 12th June, the prisoner came about a quarter past 11 at night; he had a Cuba cigar, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me sixpence, I gave him 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the sixpence in the till where there was no other sixpence—about an hour afterwards, when I closed the shop, I went to the till—I found only one sixpence in it, which turned out to be a bad one—I had a number of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces there, but no other sixpence—when I found the six<lb></lb>pence was bad, I put it in a small box by itself, separate from all other coin—no other person had been to my till—on the following Saturday night the prisoner came again; he called for another cigar, and laid down a sixpence in the same quiet manner that he had done before—I tried it, and found it bad—I then accused him of having passed one before—he said he had not, he was not in the shop on the Saturday night before—when I told him the sixpence was bad, he attempted to get out of the shop, but I pushed him forward, and his hat fell off; and while he was picking it up the officer came in, and I gave him into custody—I gave the officer one sixpence then, and on the Monday following I took the other sixpence to the police court—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who came on the first Saturday.</p>

On Monday, the 12th of March, I saw the prisoner come from the back garden; I found he had broken through the fence; I asked what he did there - he said he wanted the old man in the next cottage; I told him he must have known this was not the old man's cottage; he said nothing, but passed me, and went through the gate; our front door was fast, but the back door, leading to the garden, was open; I was in the garden; he went towards the next cottage, but passed the door, without going in, for I watched him. The moment he went out at the front gate I looked through my kitchen window, which is on the ground floor, and missed the mustard-pot, which was safe two minutes before; I sent the servant after him - I went in doors, and missed the rest of this property from the parlour cupboard, which is also on the ground floor. I saw the prisoner at Mary-le-bone Office the next day, and was not quite certain of him. When I talked to him in the garden I thought I should know him in a moment, but I was frightened at the office, and did not look thoroughly at him, but when I saw him before the Magistrate I recognised him perfectly, and am quite certain he is the person. I have found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. What time of the day was this? A. Somewhere about two o'clock, or from that to three. He was fresh shaved at the office, and appeared to have some pimples round his face, which I had not observed; I said I thought he was not the man, not that he was not; he was popped out of a cupboard in a hurry, and I could not notice him. but when he came to have his hearing I knew him instantly.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Clark. I was coming out from the garden, from the right-hand side of the house, and saw the prisoner come from the left side; he was in the front garden when I first saw him - he came from the back garden - I am certain he is the person - he had something in a yellow handkerchief; I spoke to my mistress - a boy ran after him, and I went into the house, and missed the plate; I ran out after him, but he had got out of my sight; I saw him at Mary-le-bone Office the next day, and am certain of him; he had broken through the palings to get into the garden; the wind had first blown them a little about, and he had slipped through. I missed all this property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him a very short time? A. I stood, and said to him, "Pray Sir, what do you want?" he said, "I don't want you - I want the old man at the next cottage;" I stated at the office that I spoke to him; I went to the Kingsland-turnpike, and asked if they had seen a cart go by with two men, and described the men; they said they had not. The prisoner had a blue coat and blue trousers on.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Hardcastle? A. She came to me that afternoon, and asked why I did not tell the boy which way the men went - she seemed frightened. She did not say she knew the men; I did not ask her. This was one mile and a half from Dalston-lane.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, in Lisson-grove; I told him it was for stealing some plate in the neighbourhood of Ball's pond; he hesitated a minute or two, and then said it was not him, or that he was not there; he pulled off a pair of blue trousers, and put on another - I said he had better not do so, but he said he thought they would be warmer, as he knew he should be detained. Immediately that Hardeastle saw him she said he was the man - she never doubted about him - she had described him before. Mrs. Clark saw him in the lock-up-room - there was a great many men about, and she did not recollect him. I found 4l. 16s. 6d. in his blue trousers pocket; I found in his room a yellow handkerchief; Mrs. Clark had stated that the bundle she had seen was in a yellow handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Mrs. Clark look at him? A. I was a little distance from her; she said at first she did not think he was the man. He said he could prove he was in a house in Bell-street, Lisson-grove at the time - I think he said he was in Byrne's house, and Byrne came down to me.</p>

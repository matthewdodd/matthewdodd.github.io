On the 12th of July I lock'd up my door and went to a neighbour's house about a quarter of a mile off, where I staid an hour or something better, and when I return'd I did not find my house in the same condition as I left it, for a quarri of glass in the ground room was taken out, and the casement was open. I miss'd 4 s. 4 d. in farthings, and a silver spoon, a paper of pin, 2 s. 6 d. in silver, half a 6 d. broke in two, 2 cap - I can't tell whether they were linen or holland, and a pair of stockings. The Prisoner took them away when she got into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to believe so?</p>
               <p>Wainwright. She must have some liberty to take them, or how could it be? This man took her as she was coming out of the window, and she own'd it all to him</p>
               <p>Isabella Wainwright. I keep a chandler's shop. I and my husband went out, and I fasten'd and barr'd up the house my self, and the window was hasp'd very strong, and was very hard to be got open. There was no glass broke about the place when we went out, and when we came home, the window was broke and the casement was open. The Prisoner was then at my next door neighbour's, and I ask'd her why she did so, and she said she did break open the place to take my goods away.</p>

             Clark call'd out at the Prosecutor's garret window, to one Saunders and I, that his landlord and landlady were gone out, had lock'd the door, and that somebody was robbing the house. We went to the fore window and look'd in and saw no body: then we went to the back window which look'd into the shop, and saw the shutter which encloses the shop, broken, and the drawer a little way out; and we perceived the Prisoner's legs half way out of the window, getting out. We immediately seiz'd her, and her pocket being over fill'd, I saw a pair of purple stockings and a cap in it. We took her to a public house, and there she pull'd out the goods and money and confess'd the fact.</p>

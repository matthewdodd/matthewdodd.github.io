                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, employed at Mr. Burchett's brick field, at Isleworth. I know the three prisoners; they are labouring men like myself—last Whitsun Wednesday, at 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in the brick field, and could see the five cottages in Wood-lane—I heard a noise there, and saw a number of persons throwing things at the cottages, but I could not see what they were throwing, whether they were clods or bricks, as I was too far off—I saw one very large lump of brick thrown, about the size of six bricks; it struck the cottages, and I heard a smash of glass in the windows—I did not see the doors pulled down, but I saw them in the garden, and saw parties jumping on them—I was too far off to see whether that broke them, but I heard the noise of the wood breaking—about three quarters of an hour afterwards, when I went home from work, I went to look at the cottages, and found all the windows broken—I did not see any in—I saw the places where the doors had been; some of them were out—I went inside—I only saw one ceiling, and that was in the same state as when I lived in one of the cottages, eighteen months ago—some of the grates were pulled out—I saw the fragments of the windows and doors outside—I saw the prisoners among the people there, and I also saw Henry Mason, and Palmer, and Newman, and another man, named Browning—I have not seen them since—there were a great many besides them, I should think there were six and twenty.</p>

               <p>Wednesday in Whitsun week I was out with my team, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I passed these cottages, and saw a number of people about throwing brick <hi rend="italic">bats</hi> at the cottages—I only knew one of them, John Brown<lb></lb>ing; not the prisoner Browning—the bricks were flying about pretty thick, one of them hit me on the foot—I only saw two people, but I heard some more—I was passing the end of the lane, not the front of the cottages—I stayed about a minute—I have not since seen either of the men whom I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter, employed at Mr. Burchett's brick field. I live across a field, about 300 yards from the cottages on Mr. Burchett's premises—the cottages look across the field, and I can see the fronts of them from where I live—I had had an accident, and was lying on my bed; I was called up, looked from the window, and saw a disturbance going on at the cottages facing—I went back again, and was afterwards called again; I went down, went to the gap way, which is about 250 yards, or 200 as the crow flies, and saw a number of people running about, and making a strange rattle—I saw things which looked like bricks thrown at the cottages, but was not near enough to hear whether the glass rattled—I did not go nearer then, but I afterwards saw a lot of doors and windows broken up outside—I should think there might have been more than half a dozen people; I do not think there were a dozen—I saw three that I knew, Joseph Carter, Henry Mason, and Newman, but I cannot say hardly which of them threw anything, for they were running backwards and forwards—I did not see Carter do anything particular—Carter has worked there since, and I have seen Mason once or twice; I told the officers so when they came and asked me—they were not employed there at brick making; Mason has not been employed there since the job happened—I do not know whether they left their work, but I did not see them at it any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Burchett, of Isleworth, who has a brick field there. The prisoners and others were in his employment at the time this happened—I was there on this Wednesday, and heard a great noise and disturbance at the cottages; there were about two dozen persons throwing something heavy, but I could not see what, at the doors and win<lb></lb>dows—I saw them pick up things to throw, which appeared to be two or three bricks together—I heard the things strike the cottages, and heard a noise of breaking, a crash—I saw one man carrying a door on his back; he threw it down and stamped upon it, which broke in two of the panels—I saw a man named Mason there, whose father lived in one of the cottages—I did not see any of the people again till I saw Mason, about six weeks ago; he stopped a few minutes, or perhaps an hour or two—they all left their work, and ran away for some time, with the exception of Carter—I do not know whether the people living in the cottages were friends or relations of those who were knocking them about; they were all brick makers, or fellow workmen—an ejectment had been brought, and possession given, a few days before this—I saw George Tyler there among the rest, but was not near enough to see what he was doing—I do not know of either of the other prisoners being there at that time—I have since been over the cot<lb></lb>tages, and found all the window sashes out, the panes of glass were out of them, the grates were torn up, the banister railings were broken, some of</p>

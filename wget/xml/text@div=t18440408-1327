                  </hi>. I live in Rope-yard-rail, Woolwich, and am nearly eigh<lb></lb>teen years old. I have been keeping company with the prisoner nearly two years—on the 3rd of April, about half-past nine o'clock, he came to my mo<lb></lb>ther's house and stopped till half-past ten o'clock—when he left I followed him to close the door—he said he was going home to his mother's at Poplar on Thursday, and asked if I would write to him—I said I would by Mon<lb></lb>day or Tuesday—he wanted one before then, and asked if I had picked up with any body else while he was away—I said, "No"—he said was I going to give him up?—I said I was—he wished me good night and went away—he came again almost directly after, and knocked at the door—my mother opened it, and asked him to come in—he said no, he wanted to speak to Jane—I went out to him, and he said "You are going to leave me?"—I said, "Yes, George"—he said, "Oh you are, are you?" and he up and hit me with a knife across the neck—it was not a deep cut, it only just went through the skin—I was not much hurt—Mr. Downs attended me—I was going to give the prisoner up because he had got into bad company.</p>

                  </hi>. Last Wednesday night my daughter, who is a servant, came home about eight o'clock—the prisoner came about half-past nine o'clock, and stopped an hour or so—he was in liquor—I said, "George, we want to go to bed"—my husband had gone to bed—he jumped up and went out, and my daughter also—they had some words outside, and my daughter seemed very agitated when she came in—in two or three minutes he knocked at the door, and said he wanted to speak to Jane—he was very agitated, and looked very wild—I said, "George, come in"—he said, "No, I want to speak to Jane"—my daughter went out—in a few minutes I heard a scuffle, and heard her say, "Oh!" or "Oh mother!"—I jumped out of my chair, and saw her throat was cut and bleeding—I ran to the door and said, "Oh George, what have you done!"—I rushed in doors, bolted the door, ran up stairs and told my husband—he ran down in his shirt, and went to look for a policeman—a doctor was sent for—the prisoner had always be<lb></lb>haved very kindly before, and she is still very fond of him.</p>

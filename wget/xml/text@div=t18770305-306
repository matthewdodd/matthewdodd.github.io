               <p>Ewart's door, at the bottom—I took my lantern and found it was newly done—I looked through the hole and saw the prisoner run across inside—several persons came down Fitzroy Place—I asked them to go round and pull the bell at Mr. Ewart's, but they all refused—I asked a gentleman to send a constable, and while doing so the prisoner came out at the hole, caught me by my legs and threw me down—I got up and he commenced kicking me and kicked a piece out of my left leg—the whole lot in the court rushed on me, and in trying to drag him from me, dragged me all over the place, and I was obliged to draw my truncheon—two constables came, and we took him to the station with great difficulty.</p>

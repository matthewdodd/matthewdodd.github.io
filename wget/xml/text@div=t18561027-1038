                  </hi>. I am a printer, of No. 4, Old Fish-street-hill. I engaged the prisoner on 11th Sept., at a salary of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and ten per cent. commission—on the 13th he brought me this order (<hi rend="italic">produce</hi>) from Mr. Sugden, of Aldermanbury—(<hi rend="italic">This was an order for post, foolscap, and other sizes of papers, ruled, all blue lines, and amounted to</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and was marked "ten per cent, commission</hi>, 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")—this "Ten percent, com<lb></lb>mission" is his writing—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission, and received his receipt—he told me that the printer over the water had the plates—I asked him for them again in the week, and he told me that he had not got them—I asked him again, and he said, "What, have they not brought those plates yet?"—ou 20th Sept. he brought another order, and said that it was from Mr. Hunt, of Shad well, Windsor-soap maker; it was for 15,000 wrappers—this this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in his writing, and amounts to 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—his commis<lb></lb>sion on that amounted to 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not pay him that—I have made inquiries all over Shadwell, and have looked in the Directory, and can find no soap maker named Hunt—I have since made inquiries at Mr. Sugden's.</p>

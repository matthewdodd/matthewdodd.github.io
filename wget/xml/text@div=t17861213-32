               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have been convicted upon clear evidence, added to your own express confession, of a very considerable crime, that of breaking open the box of the man in whose room you lodged, (a base breach of trust, added to felony,) and stealing away all the property that was in it; there is this peculiar circumstance in your case, that you have avowed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130049"></xptr> the commission of this crime, with an intention of being transported to Botany Bay, prefering the ignominious punishment of being transported from your own country, to an honest life in it; the Court will indulge you in your desire of being transported, but you will be disappointed in the place, you shall not chuse your place of destination; and therefore the sentence of the Court is, that you be <rs id="t17861213-32-punish172" type="punishmentDescription">

               transported for seven years to Africa
            </rs>: and the Court wish it to be understood, that if there are any persons so infatuated and lost to all regard to the laws of their country, as to prefer transportation in an ignominious manner to a distant place, from whence they have no hope of returning, the Court will disappoint their expectations, by changing the place of their transportation.</p>

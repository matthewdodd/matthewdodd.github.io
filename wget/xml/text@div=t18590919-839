                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger, of Limehouse—on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, 28th August, I was in Houndsditch; I went into Cutler-street, and then into the Clothes Exchange—I turned into a court leading into the street, and when I got within three or four yards of the bottom, I was accosted by three or four persons, and the prisoner obstructed my progress by pressing himself against me—I had no suspicion, but when I got out of the court I missed my watch—I met a policeman and gave the prisoner in custody—my watch was safe when I went into Houndsditch—I had this guard, it was not cut or broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am collector of the Clothes Exchange, Houndsditch—on the Sunday I saw the prisoner come rushing into the exchange with two other persons; I saw that there was something up and followed them; they went out at the middle door into the court—I saw the prisoner press the prosecutor against the wall, draw his watch out, and pass on till he was given in custody—the other two went towards Phils-buildings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the Clothes Exchange open on a Sunday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Petticoat-lane is three or four minutes walk from that neighbourhood—there were a few persons passing through the court, which is about six feet wide—the centre door of the Exchange opens into it—I stood there easily to be seen—I was on the step when this took place—I went out directly to the prosecutor and said something—when the prosecutor spoke to the policeman I was by his side, and the prisoner kept by his side—three or four persons got hold of him—I mean to say, on my oath, that I saw a watch in the prisoner's hand—I only saw the glitter of it, but to all appearance it was a watch—I cannot say whether it was a gold or silver watch—I had often seen the prisoner before—the watch was passed sideways, and as they passed</p>

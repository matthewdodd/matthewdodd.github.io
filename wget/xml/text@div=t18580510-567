                  </hi>. I live at Deal, and am agent there for Lloyd's. On 20th March last, I went to Dungeness to raise the <hi rend="italic">Clipper</hi>; I commenced my operations on 26th March—on the 27th I moved her considerably in shore—after I had moved her on the 26th, the ballast port was nearly dry; on the first ebb there was about two feet over the ballast port, it might have been a foot—the first thing that we saw was the water bubbling up on the inside of the vessel, which led me to conclude imme<lb></lb>diately, that the ballast port was open; we found that to be so—the ballast port is the square port at the side of the vessel—I had previously caused her</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Laxson, a carcase butcher, in Cambridge Road. My brother, John Manhood, was mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Clipper</hi>—in consequence of something that was told me, I went to London Bridge station to meet the prisoner, with Mrs. Lakey, and my cart—the pri<lb></lb>soner did not arrive by the train—I drew the cart up in front of the Margate entrance, and I observed a man, with his hat rather drawn over his eyes, keenly observing me, and I then observed him as keenly as he was observing me—I did not know him before—it was the prisoner—he crossed over, and spoke to his wife; and then she said, "This is the mate's sister"—he had no luggage with him; the train had not arrived then; when it did arrive, the chief part of the luggage was Mr. Lakey's—there were three boxes and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100062"></xptr>
               <p>a feather bed; compasses, some beef belonging to the ship, barometers, and a lot of things—it was put into my cart—Mr. Lakey stood by and saw it—mybrother John said, "Where shall it go?" and he said, "Let it go with yours, John"—it was taken to my house—it was put into the shop for about a week, and then, afterwards, Mr. Lakey came, on the Monday, and asked me would I burn the boxes and all the bags, and turn the things out, and mix them with mine—there were three long canvas bags, such as sailors put their clothes in; one had "William Lakey" written on it—he also told me to take the nautical books, and tear out all the parts that had his name in them—in the front of some of those books there was "Wm. Lakey" written; but I did not tear any of them—a good many of the things were marked in full, "W. Lakey," and he said, would I pick out all the marks—there was an official log—Mrs. Lakey took that away on the Monday that Mr. Lakey was apprehended at my house; but there was not any entry in it; it was quite plain, for I looked over it to find the name to tear it out; but I did not tear any of the names out; Mrs. Lakey has them—there were two ship's compasses and a barometer; the barometer is at my house now, and the gear that belongs to the lamp that makes it swing—all the charts were thrown on the top of my chest of drawers, and Mr. Lakey said, if I was asked, I was to say they belonged to my brother—he opened the barometer, and looked at it, and said it was broken, and not of much use, and I could hang it up and say that it belonged to me—he took the chronometer away on the Monday night; that was in Chestney's box—he unlocked the box and took it away—therewere three boxes, all belonging to Lakey—they are at my place now, on my pigstye—I told him, on the Monday night, that Mrs. Lakey had told me that he had said it was better to hasten the vessel, for if they went to sea in her, she would prove a coffin for the whole of them—he said, "You must make a mistake;" I said, "No, I don't make any mistake, Mr. Lakey; for you remember, at the time, Mrs. Lakey said to you, when you wanted to bring away the whole of the ship's tools, "My God, William, don't be so avaricious;'" and he turned round to me, and said, "It was owing to her taking a glass; she would sink the whole of us"—he told me to put the things among mine, and Mrs. Lakey herself mixed a great part of the things along with my things in my chest of drawers—I asked him what I was to say, if any one asked me about it; I said, "I might be asked to say and swear that these things belong to me;" he said, "Swear they are all yours;" I said, "How can I do such a thing as that, Mr. Lakey?" he said, "Me and your brother John will swear out forty of them."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your brother John was the mate on board the vessel, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did not bore the holes in her; not one of them, that I am aware of; I was not on board the ship—it was by Mrs. Lakey's desire that I went to the railway—I had not seen my brother at that time, and I did not know that the vessel had foundered—the conversation with Mrs. Lakey, about the vessel being the coffin of all of them, was on the Mon<lb></lb>day previous to Mr. Lakey coming to me, and telling me to burn the boxes—I said to him then, that Mrs. Lakey had told me, that had they gone to sea in the vessel, it would have proved a coffin for the whole of them, and that William thought it would be better to hasten her—the prisoner told me to burn the boxes and the bugs, and to mix the things up with mine, and to tear the names out of the nautical books—he told me to put the compasses into my brother's box—the clothes were all mixed up with mine, with my knowledge—I am not aware that I have since mistaken any of them for mine—I have not taken any of them to the pawnbroker's—I have not taken</p>

               <p>anything to a pawnbroker's belonging to Mr. Lakey—I never took anything to the pawnbroker's myself—the girl that we had living with us took two shawls of Mrs. Lakey's to the pawnbroker's, and I have had to discharge that girl through dishonesty—to my knowledge, those were the only things that were mixed with mine that found their way to the pawnbroker's—I do not know that anything was pawned but those two shawls; they are all at my house—I am not wearing any of them, and never did—my brother is at Lynn, where he resides—he has no occasion to wear Mr. Lakey's things, when he has plenty of his own—my husband has not worn any—what should he want with sailor's clothes? he is a butcher.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell all this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw Mr. Jeremiah Lodge a week before Mr. Lakey was apprehended—I saw that my brother's reputation was at stake, and, if I had not exerted myself in the manner I did, it is possible he might have stood charged with Mr. Lakey, as accessory before the fact—thatwas the reason I acted as I did—I have been in the habit of keeping my father's books, and have had to do with acts of Parliament since I was very young—I thought my brother might be charged as an accessory before the fact—I saw Mr. Lodge at the Protection Society, at Lloyd's, a week before, and gave in this statement—I expected they would have sent an officer, and taken all the things from my house—I had given the whole of this informa<lb></lb>tion before the prisoner was taken into custody—I do not know why I was not before the Magistrate—I was before Mr. Yardley the day Lakey was there first—I was not called—this is the first time I have been examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook and steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Clipper.</hi> Lakey was master—we got to Dungeness roads on the Saturday morning, and lay there Saturday night—in the course of the Saturday night, Lakey told me to take the table away, and to take the lazarette hatch off, and go down into the lazarette along with him—I took the candle, and went along with him—hebored a hole through the ship, under the ballast port; he bored one, and I bored one—they were bored with an auger—the water then came in—we then went back by the lazarette, and into the cabin—I think this was near 2 o'clock in the morning—about an hour afterwards, I assisted to make a hole in the lazarette—the prisoner was there, and assisted in doing it—the hole was made with a gauge and a chisel, an anger and a crowbar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner say anything as to why he made these holes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the first commencement of it, he said the ship was making so much water that we could not get into any harbour, and if we went any further she might be a coffin for all of us, and so he thought the best thing we could do with her was to let her sink there—the ballast port was knocked out; that was by the prisoner's direction—we all went away in the long boat—I took my things with me, and so did all the crew and the master—there were ten of us in all on board; nine men and a woman.</p>

               <p>diminished the water in the hold—we kept the pump sucking—the men did not knock up; they kept pumping—they said they were knocked up, but we sucked the pump when we came round Dungeness, and they were not asked to pump any more after we came round Dungeness on the Saturday morning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I mean, when the captain turned back, and when you were off the Isle of Wight, before anything was done to the vessel, would it have been safe to have gone on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We could not have got any further—there came on a gale of wind about an hour after we bore away—the ship was not brought as near the shore as she might have been—the wind was about W. N. W., I think, when we were off Dungeness—that was nearly off shore—she was sunk in about three fathoms—it was not much of a secret, because, when the port was knocked out, the captain called them all up to haul the cable chain out, and put it on that side—I do not know that they knew much about it before that, though they might think something about; I cannot tell; I never heard them say anything.</p>

I was mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Clipper.</hi> I was aware of some holes being made in the vessel when she was lying in Dungeness Roads, on Sunday morning, about 2 o'clock; I became aware of it by seeing a light in the hold and hearing the sound of an auger—I did not go down into the hold to see what was doing, I could see the light through the holes where you put your hands in to take the hatch off—I could not see what was being done, but I heard the auger going—the captain and Chestney were down in the hold—the vessel was leaking when she lay in the West India Dock—there was a considerable quantity of water in the hold at the time these holes were made—I spoke to the prisoner about the ship making water, and having a deal of water in her, and he said, "The best thing to do is to scuttle her; if we go into any dock, the dock bill will come to more than she is worth, and it will be the ruin of me"—he said, the best thing to be done with her would be to scuttle her, and let her go—I heard him give an order about knocking out the ballast port—it was knocked out—I did not save all my things, I saved the greater part of them; there was plenty of time to do so.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The protest was here read as follow:</hi> By this public instrument of declaration and protest, be it known and made manifest, that, on the 18th day of March, A. D. 1858, before me, Henry Cornfoot Cheeswright, of the city of London, notary public by royal authority, duly admitted and sworn, personally came and appeared William Lakey, master mariner and com<lb></lb>mander of the late good brig or vessel, called <hi rend="italic">Clipper</hi>, of the burthen of 228 tons by register measurement, or thereabouts, belonging to the port of Dart<lb></lb>mouth, John Manhood mate, and John Chestney seaman, of the said vessel, who did severally, duly, and solemnly declare and state for truth as follows, that is to say:—That, on the 9th day of March instant, these appearers and the rest of the crew of the said vessel set sail in her from London, bound on a voyage from thence to Newport in ballast, the said vessel being tight, stanch, and strong, well manned, victualled, and found in every respect fit to perform her said intended voyage. That they proceeded with all possible dispatch down the river Thames, with fine wind from west-north-west and all sail set to advantage, nothing worthy of particular notice occurring until the evening of the same day, when they arrived in the Downs and came to anchor; the wind, however, shortly afterwards became more contrary, while there were heavy snow storms at intervals, in consequence of which they were detained at anchor as aforesaid, until the morning of Thursday, the 11th, following, when, the wind being moderate from north and fine weather, they again got underweigh, and proceeded under all sail down Channel, the weather con<lb></lb>tinuing favourable; nothing further happened until the following day, the 12th, when it came on to blow a gale from west-south-west and subsequently west, with a rapidly rising sea; at such time they were off the Isle of Wight, and finding, in consequence of the violence of the gale and exceedingly high sea, they could make no progress, they bore away for Dungeness; the ship making water, they kept the pumps carefully attended to, and on the following morn<lb></lb>ing, the 13th, at 10 o'clock, they came to anchor under the lee of Dungeness, in six fathoms water, with the small bower and sixty fathoms of chain; the gale meanwhile continuing, they remained at anchor in Dungeness roads aforesaid, comparatively sheltered from the fury of the gale; having pumped the ship out dry, they set the watch, and the crew west below for the night. That, on the following day, the 14th, at 4 A.M., the said appearer, John Chestney, being on the anchor watch, discovered the said vessel had sprung a very serious leak, immediately called all hands on deck, and sounded the pumps, when they found twelve feet of water in the hold, the said vessel in consequence settling rapidly; the only thing that could be done was to get out the boats, to save the lives of the crew. The wind being off the shore, it was impossible to run the said vessel aground, more particularly as, in all probability, had they ventured to set any canvas on her (being nearly full of water) she would have capsized; therefore, for the preservation of the lives of the crew, they got out the long boat, and the crew put a part of the clothes into her, and the chronometer was saved, in a damaged state, but they saved</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100066"></xptr>
               <p>nothing else, and the crew then got into her, the said appearer, the master, remaining on board until he saw there was no hope of saving the said vessel, and at 7.10 A.M. he got into the boat, and they had hardly time to get clear of her when she sank in three fathoms (low water), Dungeness light bearing south-west three-quarters south, distant about two miles. That the said appearers and the remainder of the crew then proceeded to Folkestone in the long boat, but finding no Shipwrecked Mariners' Society they proceeded to Margate, where they arrived at 4 P.M., and the said appearer, the master, immediately repaired to the office of Messieurs Brooke and Mertens, notaries public at that port, and caused his protest to be duly noted. Therefore the said appearers declare to protest, and in and by these presents they do most solemnly protest, and I, the said notary, at their request, do also protest, against the total loss of the said vessel, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, facts, incidents, and occurrences aforesaid, and for all and every loss, cost, detriment, damage, and expense that hath, can, or may arise therefrom, to the end that the same may he had, borne, sustained, and recovered by those to whom of right it doth, can, or may appertain. We, William Lakey, master, John Manhood, mate, and John Chestney, seaman, all of and belonging to the late good brig or vessel called <hi rend="italic">Clipper</hi>, within-mentioned, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare the contents of the aforegoing declaration and protest are strictly true; and we make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to be true; and by virtue of the provisions of an Act made and passed in the sixth year of the reign of his late Majesty, King William the Fourth, intituled, An Act to repeal an Act of the then present Session of Parliament, intituled, "An Act for the more effectual Abolition of Oaths and Affirmations taken and made in various departments of the State, and to substitute Declara<lb></lb>tions in lieu thereof, and for the more entire Suppression of Voluntary and Extrajudicial Oaths and Affidavits, and to make other Provisions for the Abolition of unnecessary Oaths." 'William Lakey, master. John Manhood, mate. John Chestney, seaman.—Thus declared and protested, in due form of law, at my offices, 62, Lower Thames Street, in the city of London, this 19th day of March, 1858. H. C. Cheeswright, Notary.")</p>

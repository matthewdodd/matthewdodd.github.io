                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 76). On Thursday, 5th March, I was on duty in Church Street, Deptford, near a creek in which a barge was lying, and at 3 o'clock in the morning I saw a man, not the prisoner, standing against the door of the theatre; as I got near to him he walked towards me—I spoke to him, but he never answered me—I concealed myself, and in a few minutes he returned and saw me—I still remained there, and in a few minutes the prisoner walked out of the creek with a bag of something on the back of his head—I crossed the road and stopped him; he attempted to ran away, but did not get many steps—I found wheat in the sack; he begged me to let him go, and said that he was never in trouble before—I asked him where he got it from—he said that a man gave it to him to take to Bermondsey; I took him into custody—there were three pecks of wheat, and three pecks were missing—I saw Mr. Taylor compare them.</p>

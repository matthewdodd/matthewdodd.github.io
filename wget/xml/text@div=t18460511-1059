                  </hi>. I live in Long-lane, Smithfield, and am a book-binder. On the 1st of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was going down St. Martin's-le-Grand—I met the prisoners Foley and Humphreys—I went into a public-house, and asked them in—we went in together, and had some gin—we staid there ten minutes, and then proceeded to St. Ann's-lane, on the other side of the Post-office, and from there to Little Britain—we there went into another public-house, and had something else to drink—I did not see any other woman but Foley and Humphreys—we staid in that public-house from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour—we then went down to Smithfield, and stopped at an oyster-stall—they had some pickled eels, but I did not have any—we stopped there about ten minutes—I did not see the prisoner Mack—from there I proceeded towards Smithfield-bars, but I did not go to the corner of King-street—the policeman came and told me something—I then found I had lost my watch and pocket-handkerchief—Foley was then with me—Humphreys had left me—this is my watch—my handkerchief has not been found—I wore this watch in my waistcoat pocket, with this guard round my neck—the guard is not broken—I must have pulled off my hat to use my handkerchief, and in the mean time the guard and watch were taken—I had been drinking.</p>

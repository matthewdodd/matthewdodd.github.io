            . I am superintendent of the Police. I found these veneers in the prisoner's right-hand jacket pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. BARTHOLOMEW. I know these by their being cut from some long pieces in my possession; they have been cut as if to do some work which he had at his lodging - I missed two long pieces, Nos. 34 and 35.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you mean to say they were cut out of two veneers? A. It is most likely; here is rather more than two veneers, but I know I missed two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They are not his at all; they are the ends of several veneers.</p>

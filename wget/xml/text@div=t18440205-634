                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house in High-st, Shoreditch. The prisoner was in my service—I received some pence which I put in papers, and locked them in a drawer up stairs—my cousin or I kept the key—on the 3rd of Jan. I went to the drawer—I found it locked—I opened it and missed two papers of coppers—on the 5th of Jan. I searched the prisoner's box—it was locked—she burst it open saying she had lost the key—I found this paper of copper in it—I know it, as it is rather a thicker paper than we usually put them up in—it was done up like the others, and a person could tell by the feel what was in it—I gave her in charge.</p>

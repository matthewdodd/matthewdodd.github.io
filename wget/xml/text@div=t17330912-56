I came home with my Husband, on Monday Night, a little after 12, When I open'd the Door the Deceas'd ran in, and said, Save me, Woody, or I shall be kill'd to Night. Who'll kill you? says I. My Husband will, says she. Phoo! says I, don't fright yourself - Sit down - Then she said she was very dry, and wish'd I would fetch her a Pint of Drink from Mr. Palmers, which I did, and she drank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173309120023"></xptr> of it. And then her Husband, the Prisoner came in, and without any Provocation knock'd her down with his Fist, and kick'd her on the Belly. She was stunn'd with the Blows, and did not speak a Word. I told him, he should not have her home to kill. He ask'd me, What I had to do with his Wife? And bid me keep her at my Peril, and with that I takes him and pushes him out, and shuts the Door upon him. He threaten'd to Sue my Husband for keeping his Wife from him, and at last my Husband knowing him to be a quarrel ome Fellow, put her out, and we went up Stairs. I look'd out of the Window, and saw him knock her down in the Alley. It was then rull one a Clock; some Man coming up the Alley took her Part. I he Prisoner ask'd him, What Business he had betwixt a Husband and his Wife? I call'd to the Man, and said, Master, don't mind him; he beats his Wife every Day, and if you stand by her I'll stand by you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not she in Liquor? M. Wood. No more than I am now, if I was to die upon the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Dorcas Bates. I was looking out of the Window, when the Deceas'd came out of Mr. Wood's House, I saw the Prisoner knock her down under the Window. She took hold of a Man's Hand, and beg'd him to stand by her; but the Prisoner drag'd her in a Doors, 'till next [the same] Morning, when she was taken up for dead, and carry'd to Bed. Prisoner. Did not you tell me, on Tuesday Morning, that you saw nothing? D. Bates. No; and I would not say such a Thing, in the Condition I am in, if it was not true.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Halliston. On Tuesday Morning, when the Deceas'd was dying, I heard some Neighbours ask her, Who beat her so? She said, The Rogue her Husband. They ask'd, With what? She said, with the Heel of his Shoe. They ask'd, If he did it at home? She said, In her own Kitchen; and that besides, he beat her with a great ragged sharp pointed Stick. They ask'd, For what? She said, she did not know. They ask'd, Where she was hurt? And she pointed, trembling, to her Head behind her Eat, and to her Neck, her Stomach, and her Breast - She dy'd on the Friday following.</p>

            . I heard her say, he knock'd her on the Head with the Heel of his Shoe, and with a sharp rugged Stick, and she pointed to her Head, Neck, Stomach, and Back. I have seen Skarmishes by him many times before this.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stockden. I found the Deceas'd Speechless. I suspected by the loss of Motion on one side of her Head, that there was a Fracture on the other, and according, the Head being open'd, we found a Fracture on the Lamdoidal Suture. The Surgeon then there was a mere Concussion of the Drain, but it was my opinion, there was a Concussion and Depression - The Fracture was such, that no trapaning could save her Life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lee, Surgeon. I saw the Deceas'd 3 Days before she dy'd: Her Breast was bruis'd, and there was an Impression of a Key, with all the Wards, stamp'd as plain, as if it had been made in Clay. I suppose she had the Key in her Bosom, and it was done by kneeling upon her. I let her Blood, and apply'd a Blister, but she still grew worse; and when she dy'd I open'd her Head, and found a Fracture in her Skull 2 Inches long, from the hinder part of the Skull to the Ear, which was the Occasion of her Death, for it was impossible she should live. I live not far from the Prisoner, and have many times had her as a Patient, with violent Bruises and Cuts, when she has been beaten by her Husband, and I have often told her, he would certainly kill her sometime or other.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Palmer. Between 7 and 8, on Tuesday Morning, I heard an Outery, that the Deceas'd was murder'd. I did not wonder at it, for I had often heard the same. However, I went to see her, and found her speechless, but I fetch'd some Drops and gave her, and then she came a little to herself. Who has misus'd you so? says I. The Rogue my Husband, says she. What did he beat you with? - The Heel of his Shoe. - And with any thing else? - Yes, with a nasty ragged, rough pointed Stick. - Did. he give you any thing to drink? - Yes, a little sow'r Ale. I ask'd where she was hurt? She trembl'd, and pointed to her Head, Neck, Stomach, and Breast. I saw the impression of a Key, and something like Money on her Breast. She was carry'd upfor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173309120024"></xptr> for dead, and when the Surgeon came to bleed her, the Prisoner came up too, and said, Damn her, is not the old Bitch dead yet! O fie ! says I. If she is not, says he, I will kill her, for I will be hang'd for her. Pris. Was not she drunk? E. Palmer. No, she was sober when I saw her at 11 a Clock o' Monday Night. Pris. Did not she go to your House for Drink ? E. Palmer. No; Mrs. Wood came for it. Court. If she was drunk, that will not justify you in killing her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 205). On Saturday morning, 5th February, I was on duty at Station Road, Bermondsey, when the prisoner gave Mary Ann Aplin in custody, and charged her with stealing his watch—she said, "Oh you wicked man, God will punish you for this; you know your watch is in pawn at Mr. Gill's, in the Grange Road; it is only spite because I gave you in charge three months ago for stealing my brooch"—he told the inspector at the station that he bought the watch of a hump-backed man, in Suffolk Street, Borough—the woman was taken before Mr. Benson, at the Southwark Police Court, the same day, and I saw the prisoner sworn and heard the oath, and saw him kiss the book—he then stated that she had robbed him of his watch, in the Station Road; that she took it from his waistcoat pocket, tearing his button-hole; that he took the watch out from Mr. Sprunt, in Blue Anchor Road, about four months ago, where it had been five years, and that he had paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a year for it and that the maker's name was Veni Nicola—he took out this bill of a watch, at the tune time, which has the maker's name on it, and said he bought it of Mr. Belsey—I found the watch at Mr. Gill's, in Grange Road—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) and this is the pawn ticket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am manager to James Sprunt, of Blue Anchor Terrace, Bermondsey—he has no other establishment—I have charge of the books—when I take a watch in pawn I put the maker's name on the ticket—no watch has been pawned by the prisoner with the maker's name, Nicolas Taunton, No. 1296—I do not know him; he has not paid me interest, and I was not present when he came to the shop with a constable, or when he talked of redeeming any watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and lire at 37, Rodney Road, Walworth—I lived with the prisoner at one time, and left him about eighteen months ago, since when we have not been on very friendly terms—he stole a brooch, and I gave him in charge, about three months before—the case was called on, and dismissed because I could not get in, and nothing was done to him—I did not see him again till the night of 6th February, when I saw him talking to a policeman, and he gave me in charge—while we were living together he had a small watch, which he pawned at Gill's—he bought it when he lived with me—I was with him when he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187002280064"></xptr>
               <p>pawned it—I think it was on Whit-Tuesday—I did not see another watch belonging to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you say that you never saw me that night till you saw me speaking to a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; a policeman came and fetched me—you turned me out, with my children, at 8 o'clock, and I had to take them next door, in a blanket—J gave my evidence about the brooch, and the Magistrate discharged you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> This is a different watch altogether. I bought this for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Mr. Gill's; the one I have lost was a good watch, which coat me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I am a pipe maker; this female accosted me, and I pushed her away; she took my watch; three females prevented my going on, and I lost sight of her. I described her to a policeman. Two persons called her by some such name, and said they were looking after her, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he brought her back. The name is very curious, it only wants an "S" to make it Nicolas. I bought the watch of Mr. Belsey, and I wished to go there; but he would not go with me. The lad is here who fetched the watch from Mr. Gill's.</p>

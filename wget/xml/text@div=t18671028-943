                  </hi> I live at 125, Whitfield Street, Tottenham Court Road—on Saturday night, the 5th October, about half-past five, I was working in the brewery; I heard a man screaming out "Murder! "—I went to the window to see what it was, and saw the prisoner and a man both down in the gutter; the prisoner said to the man, "Give me the coin that you have in your hand"—he refused giving it, and both got up—the prisoner knocked him down again in the gutter; a young man came along, and held him till the policeman came—I saw him given into custody could not get out—the prisoner was the worse for liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was returning home, and saw the prosecutor tailing against a wall, drunk. He beckoned me to him, opened his hand, was showed me half a sovereign, and asked me to have something to drink. I liked him where he lived, but he could not tell me. I could not get away from him, and I shoved him, and he, being tipsy, fell down. He held that hold of my coat; I tried to get it out of his hand, and had to pull him up with me. When I got up he fell down again, because he was not able to stand. I did hit him for tearing my coat, but I am innocent of the robbery.</p>

               <p>Here are counterfeit pieces of money, finished in all the process, from the casting to the finishing.</p>
               <p>Are they finished shillings, in a state fit for circulation? - After being scowered, they are thrown into aqua fortis; the water is to mollify the aqua-fortis; and then they use sand and water to take off the stain the aqua-fortis has left.</p>
               <p>Prothero. The door went at once, but only it catched the sleeve of my coat; and Morant pushed against it to lessen it, and tore the sleeve of my coat.</p>
               <p>To Clark. Whether those finished, and those rough, are the same cast? - There is not the least doubt of it: those who cast the pieces, that are finished, cast those that are in the rough.</p>
               <p>Court. They immerse the piece in aqua-fortis, and afterwards in water? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There must be a vessel to hold the aqua-fortis, and another to hold the water? - Yes. If ever we find pickle that has been made use of, we produce it. After the metal has been put into pickle, it loses the strength and turns green: that we have produced when we have found it, but we never produced the water.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. The water, and stuff to blacken it, is only to lessen the colour of the silver, which the aqua-fortis gives it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. From the things found in the room, which have been produced, the prisoner could not then be employed in the act of colouring, without the vessel of the pickle had been removed. Certainly.</p>

            ? - Yes. He lived in Crown-court, in the Old Change, near Doctors Commons.</p>
               <p>Have you been at his house? - I was there with him from the Sunday till he was taken up; he lived in the two pair of stairs room: it looked out forward: there is no back-room.</p>
               <p>What was he employed in? - He scowered some half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. After they were scowered, he put them into a bason, and put some aqua fortis over them. When they had been there some little time, he took them out, and put them into cold water, and then scowered them again with some house-sand. Then he rubbed them with a greasy cloth, and said then they were fit to lay out.</p>
               <p>Had they that appearance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that (shewing her a finished counterfeit shilling). - I have seen him do a great many like this.</p>
               <p>When he first began them, were they like that? (shewing her a piece as it came from the casting) - Yes; he brought them to me several times as he had them from the casters.</p>

               <p>Are you the wife of the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>You passed as his wife? - Yes, during the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Was what you are talking of done in the day or night time? - Mornings and evenings, from six o'clock to nine or ten. Sometimes he would come home to tea, and go to work. I was not there all day.</p>
               <p>I believe you are very well known in this court? - I never was here but upon a just cause.</p>
               <p>You have been at this bar, I believe? - Not for coining.</p>
               <p>But for several other offences? - No; not several other offences.</p>
               <p>Court. You lived with this man as his wife? - Yes; he took the lodgings: I was with him.</p>
               <p>Who did you give the information to? - To a relation of mine. I fell ill, and I was terrified at the thoughts of this employment, and I divulged it to my relations.</p>
               <p>You were at the door, taking in milk, when the officers came? - I was not: I was up stairs in the room.</p>
               <p>How long had you lived with him? - Five days.</p>
               <p>You know him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And lived with him before? - Only three days, at Battle-bridge. Then I sent to my relations, to fetch me away.</p>
               <p>It was when you fell ill, you began to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120060"></xptr> terrified at this employment? - Yes; I was only three days.</p>
               <p>How long was that before the time he was taken up? - About three weeks.</p>
               <p>If you were terrified with his conduct before, when you fell ill, how came you to go on that Sunday, and live with him five days after? - Because he was not to do any thing more of the sort, only a few he had then he was to finish.</p>
               <p>Though he was to do no more of that business, to induce you to live with him, yet he continued to do it the whole time you lived with him? - Yes; night and morning.</p>
               <p>Did you reproach him with his breach of promise? - He said, Nothing should happen to me: if he was taken, he could always clear me.</p>
               <p>If you was terrified with his employment, what induced you to return to him again? - I really don't know what induced me: I was very ill, and really don't know. I happened to meet with him, and did not know how to get from him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you go back with him to have an opportunity of giving information against him, that he might be taken at work? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How long before he was taken did you determine to give information against him? - Three days.</p>

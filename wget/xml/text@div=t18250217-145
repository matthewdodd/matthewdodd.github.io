            . I am the wife of the last witness. These articles were in two drawers, in the parlour, which were not locked. I saw them safe about six or seven o'clock in the evening; I then went out. We have no lodgers, except a young man, who went out with us. The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170070"></xptr>is quite a stranger. I came home about a quarter past nine, and the articles were gone. I had been with my husband to a public-house, where we have to pay the men their money. I left my house locked, and no person in it. I and the young man were the persons who first returned; we found the doors all open. I did not notice that the things were gone for some time. I went back immediately to my husband, to inform him of it. We then examined the premises, and missed the articles from the drawers; I saw them on Sunday evening, at the watch-house; the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Shadwell: my beat is about sixty yards from Lomas's house. On Saturday night, about ten minutes after nine o'clock, I stopped the prisoner as I was going on duty; he was coming from Lomas's house, with this bundle under his arm. I asked what he had got there; he said, clean things, which he had brought from his father's. I took him to the watch-house, and then asked him what the bundle contained; he could not tell me. I found it was women's and children's clothes. I asked again where he got it, and he said, he picked it up at the wooden bridge, which is near Lomas's. I searched him, and found this key upon him. I saw Lomas on the evening following. he claimed the things. The key was tried to his door, but it was too large.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Did not he tell you, it was a bundle he found? A. No; he did not.</p>

            . I am ten years of age, and live with my parents, in North-place, Somer's-town - my father is a weaver. Mr. Bond gave me the care of his gig, at No. 71, Euston-square; there was a great coat in it, When he had been gone in about ten minutes the prisoner came up - I had often seen him before, and knew him; he said he would give me 4 1/2d. for my chance, and the gentleman would not give me more than 2d. - I said No; he then said he would give me 5d., and then 6d.; he at last gave me 1s., which I took. and he told me to go and get change at the corner of Charlton-street, and to give the other boy, Payne, 3d. - I went and got change, and gave Payne the 3d. - the prisoner was to take care of the gig instead of me; Mr. Bond came afterwards to me, and said he had lost the coat; I said the prisoner lived down Church-way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where have you seen me before? A. Up and down the New-road, and in the Church-way - I thought he lived down the third turning, but it was the first turning; there were two or three boys in the Churchway, who showed me where he lived; I know his brother - his name is Twydey - he is less than the prisoner a good bit; the prisoner had a coat on like the one he has now - his brother had a jacket and knee-breeches.</p>

I was with Clarke when Mr. Bond left the gig for him to mind; I had not seen the prisoner till that day - he came up to Clarke, dressed as he is now - I am quite sure of his person; he said, "I will give you 4d. for your chance," and at last he got up to 1s.; he said the gentleman would not give him above 2d.; he gave Clarke the 1s., and told him to give me 3d., which he did; the great-coat was in the gig at that time; I was going by afterwards, and saw Mr. Bond come out.</p>

I was at home when he was apprehended; he came that day a little after three o'clock, and he never left but to go and get a pint of gin; he returned instantly, and he did not leave again till the watchman came at half-past five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What induces you to believe that it was only after three o'clock, and not after four, when he came? A. I know by the milk-woman that it was not four o'clock - she comes at half-past three. I know the prisoner's brother; they are very much alike - his brother wears a coat like the one the prisoner has on; they both wear kneebreeches, but he is not so tall as the prisoner - I should think there is two years difference in their ages; his brother had a coat on like the one the prisoner has on, and when the prisoner was taken, he pulled it off - the prisoner was taken up for his brother once, but I do not think he was tried.</p>

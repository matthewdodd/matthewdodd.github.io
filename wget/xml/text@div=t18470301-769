                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in fetter-lane. I bought six dead sheep of Mr. Bonser, in Newgate-market, and desired winter to fetch them home—the prisoner was standing by my cart in Warwick-lane, and asked if he should assist the man—I waited at the cart while my man went to fetch two of the sheep—he brought them, went back a second time and brought two more—he went a third time and brought only one—the prisoner brought none—I did not see him again—he went immediately after Winter, and I expected he would have brought the second two, but he did not—my man brought five altogether—they were dead—it was mutton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Read. I was at Mr. Bonsor's, in Newgate-market—the truck was there—six sheep were bought, and the prisoner came to assist me in carrying them down—he was there seeing them weighed—he put one of the sheep on my back—I did not see him with any mutton, but thought he was to follow me with two sheep—those were his orders—he did not follow me—I went back to Mr. Bonsor's and found only three sheep left—there ought to have been four—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody.</p>

I recollect Mr. Read buying six sheep—Winter and a man came to fetch them away—I knew Winter, but not the prisoner—the sheep were all hung on a rail to be taken away—no man helped Winter, except the man he brought—I cannot identify the prisoner, but I saw the man who came with Winter take a sheep off the rails.</p>

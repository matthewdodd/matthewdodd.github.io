            . On the 30 of March, in the Afternoon, I met Captain Mitchell in <placeName id="t17340424-10-crimeloc46">Long-Acre</placeName>

And how does Mr. such-a-one do? says he; Very well, Sir, says I again, and then I look'd upon my Watch, and it was just upon the Stroke of two, and so the Captain and I parted. The Minute he left me, I met the Prisoner; he got betwixt me and the Wall, put his Arms round my Waist, asked me a rude Question and thrust me up against the Post. I was very much frighted; but as soon as I recovered myself, I said, O my Watch is gone - Then, Madam, says he, you can't tell what's a Clock. So he walked along towards Drury-lane, and stopt to speak with an Ordinary Creachure that stood at the End of Princes Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Hunter. No, I never saw the Fellow before.</p>
               <p>Court. It's very strange, that a Man should be guilty of such an Action in a publick Street, and in the middle of the Day, and yet not endeavour to escape.</p>
               <p>Hunter. But it's very true; and last Friday Morning, a Watch-maker came to wind up a Clock in the House where I live, and he told me that he had seen such a Watch as mine, and had it in his Hand, and that one Lowther (not the Prisoner, but another of the same Name) brought it to him - it was a Gold chaced Watch. I value it at 14 l.</p>

             I saw Mrs Hunter in Long-Acre, and a Man had his Arms round Waist She flung from him, and call'd him Fellow and said, she had lost her Watch. Then she went to Princes Court, and he to Red-Lion-Court End, on the other side of the Way. She turned back in a great flurry and went in at a Door. I thought it a very odd Matter, and so I look'd after him and he crost the Way, and stood talking, with a fat Woman in a striped Gown, at the End of Princes-Court</p>

            . There was a Mob about my Door, and this Gentlewoman and that Man were among them She held her Watch-chain in her Hand, and said, she had lost her Watch; and he said in a Bantering-way, Why don't you search me? You see I don't run away.</p>
               <p>Captain Mitchell. I know nothing of the Prisoner or the Fact, but I met this Gentlewoman <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240006"></xptr> in Long Acre, and as I had a small Acquaintance with her, in good manners I asked her how she did, and how a certain Gentlewoman of her Acquaintance did. I remember she look'd upon her Watch, and I saw the Pointer was toward two. Whether it was a Gold Watch or no, I can't swear; but it was like one, in Shape and Colour.</p>

            . Last Thursday Morning, a Gold Watch was brought to me to be set faster. Mrs. Hunter had describ'd her Watch to me, and this answer'd the Description; but as it was not advertised, I would not venture to stop it. So going to her Lodgings to wind up a Clock, I told her of it. It was brought to me by one Lowther a <rs id="t17340424-10-deflabel47" type="occupation">Seal Graver</rs>

I had but a short Acquaintance with him. I asked him how long he had had it? He said, sometime I asked what he would have for it? He said 14 Guineas, and he would spend half a Guinea of the Money. I bid him leave it, and may be I might help him to a Chap, tho' I intended to shew it to Madam; but he would not I went with her to his House, but he was not at home.</p>

               <p>Hunter. There was not a Creachure near me, when he stopt me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The People said, they did not believe her, for she was a Town-Madam of a very indifferent Character. And so when she came down again, I had the misfortune to ask her if she had pawn'd her Watch? Damn you, says she, I don't know but you have got it - she went after some Captain, as she call'd him, unto Long-Acre; but when she had gone a little way, she came back once more, and I offer'd to be searched; but she got a Constable who carried me before the Justice.</p>

On Monday the 13th of February, about half after eleven, as near as I can guess, coming past our shop door in Holborn, I saw a woman go into the shop, and take this piece of beef off the shop board; I waited till she came out; I then asked her what she had got there; she said what was that to me; I insisted upon seeing, I pulled her coat from her left side; the little boy came out and saw me take it from her, and while I held her she struck me; I let her loose, I did not like to be hurt; she attempted to strike the little boy, and escaped; I saw her taken again in about half an hour.</p>

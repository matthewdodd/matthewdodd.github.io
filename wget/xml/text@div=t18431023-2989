                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Edwin Ward Scanning, solicitor. Gordon-street. On the 14th of August the house was under repair, and the family went out of town, leaving me in charge—the prisoner was employed there as a painter, by Mr. Allen—a quantity of wearing apparel and drawers were taken out of the wardrobe, and placed in an upper attic, and the room was locked—I went up stairs with the prisoner, and unlocked the door of that attic, for the purpose of his painting the coping-stone on the roof, which he could not do without going through that room—some time after that, I re<lb></lb>member the prisoner coming up stairs early one morning, when I was lying on the bed, partly dressed, after having let the men in—he had no business up there, for that had been finished a week or ten days before—I said, "Halloo, what do you want?"—he said, "I was looking for a short pair of steps;" but he turned back, and never looked into anv room for them—he wen down as if he were taken by surprise—I followed him down almost im<lb></lb>mediately, went into the parlour where he was at work, and the steps he wanted were there—he said, "What a fool I was! the steps are here"—about three o'clock that day I missed wearing apparel to the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more from that upper attic, which had been locked up—these two pairs of drawers are my master's—I got them made for him.</p>

Q.</hi> Were not these steps in the habit of being used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the staircase, but this was beyond the staircase—I do not know whether the inside of the window was painted after you went up, but no steps had been up there, or were wanted—they had never been used up there—no person had access to that room but Giles, the foreman, who finished the work that you began on the outside—he had to pass through this room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 49.) On the 15th of Oct. I took the prisoner at his own house, in Somers-town—his wife came to the door—she gave me an answer, which induced me to watch the house for some time—I went away, then came back, and took the prisoner in his room—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked him for his duplicates—he said he had none—I took his keys, and found two—I said, "Here are two"—he made no reply, but got round a chair, on which was a coat—I took it up and said, "Whose is this?"—he said, "Mine"—I found in it eight duplicates—one of them was for these drawers, and another for some things that were given up—I asked him if these drawers were his, and he said they were.</p>

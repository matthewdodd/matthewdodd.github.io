In July, 1843, I was one of the servants of the Great Western Railway Company—I was stationed at Paddington, in the goods' department—the prisoner was also stationed in the same department—I have been in custody charged with participating in the stealing of this property—I left the service of the railway about Aug., I believe, 1843—I left on my own account—I stated that I was going to see my friends—I had leave of absence for a week for that purpose—I did not go back to the railway—I did not inform them that I had quitted their service—I returned, and re<lb></lb>sided in the immediate neighbourhood of the railway, and sold butter—the railway people knew I was on the spot—about a fortnight before I quitted the employment, I met the prisoner at the Red Lion, Red Lion-street, Whitechapel—we had agreed to meet there—the witness Williams was also there—he did not come in by accident—w e had agreed to meet</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184511240015"></xptr>
               <p>there—I have known him for years—I had met him in Fleet-street that morning—the prisoner said he had a little box or case to dispose of, which he had from his sister—he asked me if I knew who would buy it—I understood him to say his sister lived near Temple-bar—he produced this box—it was unlocked—it looks as if it was forced—it looked so then—he had it in a green-baize bag—Williams was to buy it of him for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these glasses and fittings were in it, and there was a gold chain, which the prisoner produced from his pocket—in a day or two, or two or three days after, Williams brought the case to my house, No. 1, Conduit-street, Paddington—he brought it to deliver it up to the prisoner because he said it was not worth the money—I saw the prisoner in a few days or a week after, or something like that—I told him Williams had brought it back, and he would not have it, and he could have it when he liked—he said he would call for it some day, and take it with him—I saw him once or twice after that, but nothing more was said about the dressing-case—I kept it—the chain was sold—I sold it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and kept the money—I intended to return it when I was asked for it—I sold it to a person named Sayford—I suppose he took it to a refiner's—I do not know where he took it—I sold it to him some time in July, 1843—I believe it was the latter part—it was about a fortnight after I had it from Williams—I never disposed of the case—I got the chain from Williams's pocket—he gave it me when he gave me the case—I kept the dressing-case in my possession till I was over at Kensal-green, which was very soon after Christmas, 1844—there was a distress put in for rent, and Mrs. Fowler lent 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a table, two chairs, and this case—she lent it to Mrs. Oborne, by my direction, and I paid the rent with the money—I did not go and live in the country after leaving the service of the railway—I went into a butter-shop in North-street, very soon after—I got my butter up by the Great Western Railway, and had to meet it there, and always do—I did not ask the prisoner's permission to raise money upon the case—he was at Bath at the time—I did not write to him—I pawned without any autho<lb></lb>rity—they would have taken it if I had not—the prisoner never called for the case or chain—I was taken into custody on the 18th or 19th of last month—the box was proved to have been in my possession for the last year—I did not say anything at that time about who gave it to me—I said I got it from the prisoner, when Collard apprehended me—I was three times before the Magistrate, and then let out—I made this statement against the prisoner when I was first taken.</p>

In July and Aug., 1843, I lived at 75, Berwick-street, Soho—I followed the same calling then as I do now—I have known Morse about six yean—I do not know the Red Lion public house, Red Lion-street, Whitechapel—I know Red Lion-street and the public-house at the corner, but I do not think that was the house we went to, it was the last house on the left from Whitechapel, and the first on the right from Leman-street—I was there at the middle or latter end of July, 1843—I went by the invitation of Morse—it was an appointment to go to smoke a pipe and enjoy ourselves, a convivial party you may say—I met the prisoner there—I never knew him before—he had a green baize bag with him containing this box—the prisoner offered it to me to dispose of for him, not to purchase—I looked at it—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was wanted for it, including a gold chain—I thought it a large price, and said if I bring you 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, I think that will be sufficient, and it was arranged that should be the price—I was to try and find a purchaser—he did not tell me where he got it from, except that it came from some member of his family—I do not recollect who—I engaged to endeavour to get the money for it—it was intrusted to me—I</p>

               <p>took it home—I could not return it next day—I believe I was engaged in business, but seeing it had been as I fancied forced, I did not think it had been come by rightly—I returned it to Morse, to deliver it to Glazier, without endeavouring to find a purchaser—I never saw any advertisement or publica<lb></lb>tion that any such things had been lost from the railway—I never went into the neighbourhood of Paddington—I have never been to Morse's house—I never heard from the newspapers of such a thing being lost—I took it myself to Morse's house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you had never been to his house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> House—no—I had never been to his house, but he told me to bring it to a man named Howse, or Howard, a hair-dresser, somewhere in Paddington—Praed-street, I think it is called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not return it to the man you had it from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not know where he lived—I met Morse in the street, and returned it to him there and then, in the street—I returned him the chain and case together—I said to Morse, "I don't think this thing has been come by justly, I have my suspicion about it," and perhaps I can explain why I might have more suspicion than others, my parents were locksmiths and bellhangers, I have seen these things brought in to them, and I have assisted in the business; and when I saw it forced, it aroused my suspicions—I have a wife and two children, and I did not like to dispose of a thing which I had an idea had been come by wrongly—I delivered it back to Morse, with a caution that the box had been forced</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where do your parents carry on their business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Seetbing-lane, Tower-street, City—at least my brother is there now—my mother is living at 25, Haydon-street, Haydon-square, Minories—I did not consider the things worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but that was not the reason I would not sell them—I told Morse they were not worth the money—and I said, "Another thing, I have a decided objection, seeing that I fancy it has been forced"—I have not mentioned that before—I was not asked that question—I do not go about with a donkey, selling vegetables—I had a donkey to bring my things from the foundry, and I intended a journey into the country with it, to sell tickets; but I did not go, and I sold the donkey—I never went to the Great Western Railway—I am quite sure I was not there on the 1st of July, 1843, nor was I in a public-house in the neighbourhood that evening—I was never there but once, when I went to see my wife off—I never knew where Morse lived—stop, allow me correct myself—I speak from the time he was in the service of the Great Western Railway Company—before that, when living with his brother-in-law, I knew where he lived—I had been with him at a convivial meeting before, at the Garrick Tavern, with his brother—I went to this public-house by his own appointment—I was going into the City on my rounds in business, to call on my customers—I told Morse so—I did not tell him that I wanted to see my mother—I met him in Fleet-street, accidentally—we talked together for some time—he said, "Where are you going?"—I said, "I am going my rounds"—he said, "You know where Jem lives—(that is his brother)—there is a house on the right hand side in the street, just past there; I am going there, if you like to meet me there, we will have a pipe of tobacco to<lb></lb>gether"—I said, "I am going as far as Messrs. Deane's, London-bridge, and perhaps I may call on my brother, and I will look round"—I did not expect to see the box—I had never seen the prisoner before—I thought I might make something of the case among my private connexions—most likely I should have offered it to my landlord or landlady, at No. 75, Berwick-street—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184511240019"></xptr>
               <p>my intention to offer it to them, or any one else—I did not offer it to them—I showed it to nobody but my wife—the chain came out of the prisoner's pocket—I cannot call to memory whether he said it came out of the box—I looked at the box at the time—I did not see that the lock had been broken then—I am quite sure it was broken when I had it—when I came to ex<lb></lb>amine it next morning, I found that force had been used—I was in the public-house perhaps two or three hours—the bag might have been opened about half an hour after we got there—at the time I took it to sell, I did not think there was anything wrong in it—I had no suspicion at all—Morse never told me he had sold the chain—I have seen him but twice since—I heard that Morse was taken up—his brother-in-law called on me on the Thursday after his first or second examination—I suppose it must have been after Morse had charged the prisoner—he asked me to speak the truth of what I knew—he may have asked me to come as a witness—I do not know, but he asked me to come on the part of Morse, to speak the truth—that was all he said, that I know of—of course he meant me to speak as to the innocence of Morse—I did not hear that he had sold the chain, till the second examina<lb></lb>tion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the police on the Great Western Railway. I took the prisoner into custody at Bath, on the 18th of Oct.—I came up in the train with him—I said I was sorry to see him in that predi<lb></lb>cament, I was in hopes that there was nothing against him—he immediately replied, "Oh, Mr. Collard, I have been drawn into it"—I said, "Drawn into it, what do you mean? the less you say about it the better; but what<lb></lb>ever you do say I must repeat to the Magistrate"—he said nothing more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before he said that, had you said anything regarding the part that was assigned to him in the transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he know at that time about Morse having been given into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he knew Morse had made a charge against him—I pledge myself to the exact words he used, without the change of a word—I did not do so positively at first on my examination, but I am quite satisfied on reflection—I remembered the words immediately after—they were, "Oh, Mr. Collard, I have been drawn into it!"—some other words were attempted to be put into my mouth, and at first I confess I was doubtful whether or not they had been used, but immediately after I recollected—the words put to me were, "by a false accusation, "or" a false charge," but those words were not used, most decidedly—I took no note of what took place, but I drew the attention of my brother officer, who was in the train, to the words—I am satisfied he did not use those words, because I have seen my brother officer since, and he confirmed me—the prisoner has been in the service of the company since June 1842, up to the time of his apprehension—I have heard that he had previously been a soldier in the Life Guards—I have no doubt he left with a good character—I never heard anything against him, on the con<lb></lb>trary, I have heard his superior officers speak well of him.</p>

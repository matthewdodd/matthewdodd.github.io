                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers in the General Post Office—the prisoner was a letter carrier, and his district was Alders<lb></lb>gate Street—on 27th December I made up a letter, and enclosed in it sixty penny postage stamps in one piece, I marked each stamp—I addressed the letter to Mr. Jones, bookseller, 91, Aldersgate Street, E.C.—two other letters were also addressed to the same person—I gave them to Crocker, a police officer attached to the Post Office, with instructions to post them—they would arrive at Mr. Jones's about eight next morning—it would have been the prisoner's duty to deliver them—I saw the prisoner on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 28th, a little after eleven—I asked him if he had had any letters for Mr. Jones, 91, Aldersgate Street—he said he believed he had, he had delivered all that he had—I told him that one letter was missing—he said he knew nothing about it, he had delivered all he had received—I then told him that it was one with sixty penny postage stamps in it—he</p>

               <p>said he knew nothing about it—he was then detained—some time after<lb></lb>wards I went to the receiving house in Aldersgate Street kept by Mr. Purvis between two and three the same day—I there saw the youth Mayo, who handed me some postage stamps, I don't know exactly how many, there was a large quantity—I examined them, and among them found the sixty that I had placed in the letter addressed to Mr. Jones; they were still in one sheet—I then returned to the Post Office, and the prisoner was asked in my presence if he had seen anything of the letter addressed to Mr. Jones that was missing—he said he had not—he was asked if he had sold any postage stamps that morning—he said he had not—he was further asked, if any one said that he had, would that be true—he said no, it was not true, he had not sold any—Mayo was then sent for, and he said he had bought 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps of him that morning, that he had placed them on a back counter, and they were the same stamps he gave me that he had received from the prisoner—the prisoner made no remark on that—he was asked if he wished to ask Mayo any question—I then gave him into custody—these are the stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also received two letters from the constable, which are those I addressed to Mr. Jones, but not the letter that contained the stamps.</p>

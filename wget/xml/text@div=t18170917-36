I was going home; he said he would have something more to drink. I took the bottle and went down, under pretence of geting something merely to get away, his wife went down with me to take the bottle up again; we waited some time and then went up, thinking he would be asleep - We did not mean to get any liquor; when we got up she asked him what was the matter with him. We sat down and he stood in the middle of the room with a large stick in his hand, two inches and a half thick; the prisoner took a knife in her hand to cut a piece of meat, the deceased fell upon her directly, and struck her a violent blow on the head; I was going to her assistance; he fell backward immediately-she had a bonnet on - I did not see what caused him to fall, it was so instantaneous - He bled very much; she jumped up, and said, "good God, what have I done!" He was wounded in the left breast. I ran out for assistance, and several of the nighbours came in; she was crying over him, and trying to stop the blood; he was taken to the hospital, and I sat up with him.</p>

            . I lodged in the same house with the prisoner, in Little Pearl-street, Spitalfields. On the 18th of August, in the evening, about nine o'clock, I was in the room with the deceased and prisoner; I helped to undress him, he was very much intoxicated. As soon as his wife and Swain went down he got up, and put his breeches and waistcoat on, he then went into the back room and got his rod, I tried to get it away from him but could not; when the prisoner came in he struck her with it on the head, very hard - I went down stairs; when I returned he laid on the floor bleeding</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased at the London Hospital; he had a wound in the left side of his chest, he lived about six hours and a half-the wound was three or four inches deep, and had punctured the heart, it appeared to have been done with a sharp instrument; there is no doubt but the wound was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOWTLE. I am headborough of the parish, and took the prisoner into custody. I went to her lodgings, and found a knife in the drawer, covered for about three or four inches with blood - I have lost it; she told me it was the knife she was eating her supper with.</p>

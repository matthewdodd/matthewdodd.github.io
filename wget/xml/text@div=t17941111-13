            Was your house ever broke open? - Yes, on Monday morning, the 26th of July last, about three o'clock, I heard the glass break of the window in a back room, that I made for the convenience of my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it at all communicate with your house? - Yes.</p>

            Was this the room that you left the curtain in? - Yes, it was. I heard them break the glass, and I thought it might be the cat, my wife stared and wished me to get up; I got up, and then I saw a woman at the window, and she said, d-mn you, who are you? and she said, she was not afraid of any bloody b-gg-r, to the best of my recollection. In consequence of that the prisoner went from the window, and I ran after her, and I followed her, and she got about three doors from my house, then I caught her, and called the watch; the watch came; I went in doors and dressed myself, and then went to the watch, and gave charge of her.</p>

            Had she any thing on her? - I did not suppose she could have any thing on her, and when I had given charge of her I came home; my wife said she had took the curtain, the shed curtain, which was a curtain to keep any person from looking in; I went back to the watch-house, and the prisoner had it on her, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she it in her pocket? - No, she had it in her lap; she was down in a hole, in confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so dark as not for her to know what she was about? - I cannot take on me to say, I was very much confused.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I went to an acquaintance of mine, and I drank a little drop more than I should, and I lost my way; I do not know any thing at all about it, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

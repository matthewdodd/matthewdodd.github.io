                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 441). On Wednesday night, 7th Sept., about a quarter to 7 o'clock, I was watching an unoccupied house in Cheapside, which was to let—I saw the prisoners enter the house—in about a quarter of an hour Scott came outside, and shut up the shutters, and left Rolfe in the house—he went to Mr. Debenham's, the auctioneer, in Cheapside, and took the key there; it was about 100 yards off—the woman did not come out, but she let him out, and let him in again when be returned—he remained in till 25 minutes to 8 o'clock—he then came out with this lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his shoulder—it was tied up in a red handker-chief, and in this blue bag—the woman came out about a second or so after him, and closed the door after her—they went up Freeman's-court, into Honey-lane Market—I followed them—the man waited till the woman came up to him—I then took them both into custody—I asked him what he had on his shoulder—he said, "Some lead"—I said, That is just what I want you for; you must go to the station with me"—I took them there—he said be knew nothing of the female; that he had met her promiscuously at the corner of Lawrence-lane, and merely asked her to mind the house while he went with the key, and that he gave her some beer for so doing—he said he thought the dustmen were about to have the lead, and he thought he had as much right to it as they had, or something to that effect—there were 33lbs. of it—they both gave false addresses—Scott gave his as No. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., High-street, Hoxton Old-town—I inquired there, and they said they had left, and they did not know anything of them; they had been living there, but had left about a twelvemonth—the woman gave her address where her husband was lodging, in Lamb's-passage, Chiswell-street.</p>

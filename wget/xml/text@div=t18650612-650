I live at 4, Willow-court, Union-street, Southwark—I know the prisoner well—on the night of 8th May, about 10 o'clock, I fastened up my premises safe before going to bed—at a quarter-past 1, I was awoke by the noise of a little dog barking—I came down stairs and found the middle door and the front door open—I had a lamp in my hand—I saw the prisoner running away—I found a small hole over my wash-house where he had broken through—he got in at a little window, and then broke a portion of the flooring away and got into my wash-house—I missed my scarf and waistcoat, nothing else then—they were hanging behind the door when I</p>

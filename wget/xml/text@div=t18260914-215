My coat was on a shelf behind the counter; the pocket-book was in the pocket; I had seen them safe about two o'clock on Friday, the 14th of July; I missed them about five o'clock; I did not see either, of the prisoners in my shop - I had gone up stairs to be down.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 14th of July I was in White's-yard, Whitechapel, a little after five o'clock in the evening, about two hundred yards from Mr. Roberts' house - I stopped both the prisoners, in company, and in Surry's right hand I saw a black pocket-book, which he was looking at - and in his left-hand a bundle of papers; I asked where he got the book - he said he bought it of a hawker for 1s. 6d.; I asked if he knew the hawker - he said, No; I took him to the office; Marston took the papers from his right hand.</p>

I took Gillett, who had this coat on over his own - he said he bought it at a shop in Whitechapel; I found a letter in the pocket, which he said came from his brother in the country; I found it related to the prosecutor, and found him out.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>SURRY'S Defence. I bought the pocket-book of the same person he bought the coat of - he was a hawker, who exposed braces, and such like things, for sale; he found the papers in the pocket, and gave them to me to read them.</p>
               <p>GILLETT'S Defence. I gave 9s. for the coat, to a hawker near Petticoat-lane.</p>

            : On the 18th of the present month, I went into that part of the cellar, in which we had formed a stove for drying sugar; I there observed a tub full of raw sugar, covered with a sheer of brown paper; knowing it to be an improper situation for the sugar, I knew there was something wrong, it was a sort of sugar that we do not use for drying; after I came up, I observed the prisoner go there almost instantly, he continued there for half an hour; when he came up again, he was sent into the lamp-room to paper a few loaves; I then went down a second time, and observed, that a considerable quantity of sugar had been taken out of that tub; he was then going home, and had got several yards from our premises, when the other witness and I secured him and brought him back; we took him into the place from whence he had taken the sugar; he denied having any knowledge of the sugar that was missing, till it was felt through the trowsers; I then went for the constable; I felt the sugar under his stockings myself; I am certain, that which remained in the tub, and that which was found upon him, was exactly the same sugar.</p>

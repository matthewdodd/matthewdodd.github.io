               <p>(The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, stated, that he had the exclusive management of the prosecutor's business for eleven years, during which he received and paid various sums; the account of his disbursements were on slips of paper, which were in the prosecutor's office, and be could not get access to them; that he was engaged as "managing agent," and was to have half the profits of the business he procured; and that the prosecutor had promised him 264<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., arising from the will of Mrs. White, none of which he had received; and that his brother had discounted various acceptances of the prosecutor's; some of which were dishonoured).</p>

               <p>"To W. Willis, Esq.—Sir, I harewith inclose two accounts; the first, in relation to Mrs. White's money, due to me, beyond all doubt, from your acknowledgment to poor Budd, who is gone; and my sister, and Mr. John Wood: the other, in relation to the arrears of salary, due to me, resulting from Mr. Budd's business: if there is any matter of elucidation about them, or about any other current or past business, I will attend at any time you may mention. As I shall trust this parcel to be delivered by the servant, I have not deemed it safe to put into it Mr. Steward's lease and other papers. I need not say such papers, &amp;c. shall be forthwith forwarded. You might have had the key of my desk at any hour, without breaking it</p>

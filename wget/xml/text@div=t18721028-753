                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at 81, St. John Street, Clerkenwell—on 30th September I arrived home a little after 3—the prisoner occupied the shop and parlour; I lived up stairs—I remonstrated with the prisoner on account of some blackguard expression he had made use of the day previous—I said I would serve, him the same, and threatened to pull his nose, and made use of some bad words—he said "If you touch me I will cat your b—head off "—he struck at me, and I don't remember any more—he was doing his work, and I was leaning with my hands on the counter—he made a hit at me, and cut all one side of my face—I did not see anything in his hand—he is a shoemaker by trade—he was sitting at work when I went in to him—my wife came and took me away, and a man fetched the police.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police—I was called to the police-station on 30th September—I found the prosecutor there, suffer<lb></lb>ing from an incised wound, extending from the scalp to the cheek-the greater part was superficial, but where the carotid artery passes up towards the head it was very deep, in fact so deep that I could see the artery—the wound was 5 inches long—the carotid artery was laid bare, but not injured at all—the wound was not in a dangerous place, but a very little more would have punctured the artery—a knife like this would inflict such a wound.</p>

I live in York-terrace, Camden-town—on the 6th of Feb., about three o'clock, I was passing the prosecutor's shop—I saw a man who was shorter than the prisoner take this carpet—I went in and asked the prosecutor if he had got a fresh servant—he said, no—I went after the man, but he was gone—this is the carpet I saw him take.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Shoolbred and Co., and am engaged in the furnishing department—in August lust the two male prisoners came there, and said they wanted to furnish a bachelor's bedroom,6 and also wanted a carpet for a sitting-room—they directed us to send a man down, and their housekeeper would give all instructions—the amount of the order was about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they gave the name and addresses as James Crane, I, Woburn-villas, Twickenham, and 8, Eastcheap—a man was sent down to measure for the carpet, but as no pattern was selected, the order was not proceeded with—the female prisoner called about a month afterwards and selected the carpet from Mr. King—Inwood, who seemed to act as Crane's confidential servant, he handed him a chair, and made me think he was a person of importance—the female prisoner introduced herself as the house<lb></lb>keeper of Mr. Crane—the order was executed and forwarded by our cart in the usual way.</p>

Shoolbreds', respecting the last quan<lb></lb>tity of goods that had been obtained from them, and wanted to know who Mr. Crane was, and she said he was a gentleman of independent property, and that he had property in Ireland and Devonshire, and also that he was a member of the Stock Exchange, that he had that day gone to London, and he might not be home that night; but if he did come he would be driving his own phaeton—I asked her where he kept the horses, she said in the stables—I asked her where they were, she said she did not know—I then left and went to 8, Eastcheap—I found the name of "Crane" on the wall, but I saw no one there, the offices were empty—I then returned to Twickenham, and saw Crane—I went in with a police-officer—Crane said that I was exceeding the orders of Messrs. Shoolbred, and if I persisted in taking the female pri<lb></lb>soner on the warrant that I had obtained, he would see Mr. Shoolbred, who was coming to dine with him next week, and that I should be discharged—James Inwood said the goods were pawned by his wife to pay a fine for travelling on a railway without a ticket.</p>

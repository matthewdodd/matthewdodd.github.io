                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Plymouth Police. On 31st May, the prisoner was given into my custody at Plymouth—I asked where he was stopping, he said in York-street—I searched a room in York-street, and found this leather (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I charged the prisoner at the station with stealing it of his master, Mr. Smith, in London, and he said he bad it of a man named Bradshaw, who belonged to the firm of Mr. Smith—I brought him to London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Smith, stationer and bookbinder, of Long-acre. The prisoner was in his service, and left at the beginning of May—I believe this leather to be Mr. Smith's—this sprinkled sheepskin is our own manufacture, and has "J. S." on it, but I cannot swear to it—sup<lb></lb>posing it to be ours, the prisoner had no right to it.</p>

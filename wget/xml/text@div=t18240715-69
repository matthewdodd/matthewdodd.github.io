            . I went to Mr. Berman's for a clock on a Saturday evening; I saw the prisoner there, and Berman - I did not know but that they were partners. I said I wanted a clock; they said I could not have it that night, as it wanted regulating, but I should have it in the morning - I received it about eight o'clock in the morning, of Sunday, the 30th of May, and gave the prisoner a sovereign for it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I gave him the money; I gave him 2 l. 5 s., and 6 s. the same afternoon - Witness. He paid me that on the 5th of June, for other accounts which were in the book; this is my writing, (producing a book;) here is Mr. Stone's direction, No. 17, Rathbone-place, but nothing is paid. I can swear he never paid me for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. But here is 4 l. 12 s. received on the 5th of June, is that true - A. Yes; he gave me 2 l. 5 s. 6 d., and I allowed him the rest for his expences, but he did not account for the sovereign received of Stone; I am quite sure he did not give me the sovereign he received from Stone on the 30th of May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—about 12 o'clock on 9th August, I was in Aldgate standing looking in a toy-shop window—two females came to the window and stood on my left side, and then the prisoner, who was one of them, went to my right hand side—in my right hand pocket I kept my purse—I felt something at my pocket, and I saw the prisoner's hand draw from my pocket, and she went at my back to the other woman—I caught the prisoner, I seized her arm, and said, "You have got my purse"—she said she had not—the other woman went on, but I kept the prisoner—I had in my purse three sovereigns and two half-crowns—I am quite sure I</p>

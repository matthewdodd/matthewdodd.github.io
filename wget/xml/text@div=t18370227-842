                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and am daughter of John Parsons, a carpenter in Ball-alley, Long-alley. I was on my way home from Crown-street on Wednesday, the 1st of March, and when I toned the corner into Long-alley I missed my shawl—I did not feel it taken off—I did not drop it—Mrs. Bowyer came up to me and gave me inform<lb></lb>ation—I went up to the prisoner William Chappell, and asked him for my shawl—he called roe a bad name, and struck me in my stomach—Mrs. Milward came and spoke to him, and he told her I was his sister; she then went away, and my mother came up—I saw him throw my shawl on the pavement to the female prisoner, and she picked it up—when my mother came up she dropped it, and Mrs. Bowyer picked it up—I met the officer and he took the prisoners into custody—this is my shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Bowyer, and live in Rose and Crown-court, Long-alley. Between ten and eleven o'clock I was crossing the end of Sun-street to Long-alley—the prosecutrix was going along about four yards before me—I saw William Chappell take the shawl off her shoulder, and give it to the female prisoner—I turned round to him and said, "Don't take the girl's shawl"—he kicked her and ill used her, and said she was his sister, and so I did not interfere further—the female prisoner dropped the shawl from under her own shawl, and I took it up and gave it to the girl—the male prisoner said the prosecutrix was a b——young cowl, and to go home; and he kicked her in her stomach with his knee.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had she walked a long distance before you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not long—she did not go by the prisoners in my sight—they ran into the side-door of the Black Dog public-house—the child said she would call her mother, and they ran into Sun-street—he took the shawl the moment he came into the street—it was alldone in a moment—the male prisoner ran out first—he did not throw the shawl on the ground; he gave it to the female prisoner—I have heard the girl's evidence, but I assert what I have seen myself—the female dropped the shawl when he gave it to her—no conversation could have taken place between them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Clifton-street, Finsbury. I just turned the corner of Long-alley, and saw the prosecutrix crying—the male Prisoner was near her—I asked what she was crying for—she said, "That</p>

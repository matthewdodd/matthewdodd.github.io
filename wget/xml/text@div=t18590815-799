                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Richardson-buildings, Woolwich—on 13th July, in consequence of some information I received, I went to the dead-house in Woolwich, and saw the body of a man there whom I had known twenty years; he used to go by the name of "Shefford Tom;" he enlisted in the Royal Artillery as Joseph Lancaster; he is known by that name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Woolwich—on this 12th July I was at the Three Marines public-house; I left a little after 12—I was drinking with the deceased, Joseph Lancaster—we left the house together, and walked on into High-street; I there bade him good-night—soon after that the prisoner passed me; I was too far off to hear whether he spoke to Lancaster—I then heard a noise, in consequence of that I went back—I heard the prisoner ask the deceased what he was making a noise about—the deceased said, "A slap on the nose if you like"—with that they both stripped, and began fighting—the deceased made the first attempt to strike the prisoner, but missed his blow; the prisoner then butted the deceased with his head, on the lower part of his stomach—he fell down on his back, and after he was down the prisoner kicked him, somewhere about the neck—after he was knocked down I did not see him move—I only saw the prisoner kick him once; after that he went away and left the deceased on the ground—</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police force at Woolwich—I accompanied the policeman, 63, to the dead-house at Woolwich on the morning of the 14th, the next morning—my assistant saw him before that—I examined the body externally; the only external mark of violence was on the left side of the neck, where there was a bruise, and the skin slightly raised; it was below the ear, and behind the corner of the lower jaw—blood was rushing from the nostrils, but no other external violence—I began my internal examination by examining the head—I found all the vessels of the brain congealed with blood, and on the surface were large clots in two or three different places; and on opening the brain, there was a large clot on the left side—on removing the brain from the skull, there was also a very large clot of blood pressing on the spinal marrow—the result that I drew was that he died from rupture of the brain, from pressure on the brain, and apoplexy—it might be the result of a blow or a fall on the ground—the vessels would rupture, the blood would be effused, and death would ensue from pressure on the brain—if a person had been drinking, and had received a blow in the stomach, and had fallen down on the ground, it would be very likely to bring death.</p>

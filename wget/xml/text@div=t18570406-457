                  </hi>. I am a detective City officer. On Saturday evening, 21st Feb., I went with Thain, a brother officer, with Mr. Scott to Mr. May's, and found about half a ton of type (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); some is new, and some old—in consequence of information, I went the same evening to No.</p>

               <p>11, Rose Alley—I remained there some time, and then saw the prisoner; she was spoken to by a boy from Eyre and Spottiswoode's, about some manuscript—I did not speak to her then, nor did Thain—she said that she had not got it; I said, "You had better go and explain about it"—on the road, in shoe Lane, I said, "You are accused of selling a quantity of type to Mr. Mays, of No. 18, John's Square, Clerkenwell"—she said, "Me? Lord bless your soul, I never had any type; if I had, I could not get a farthing a pound for it"—I said, "You must accompany me to Fleet Street station," and sent for Mr. Mays' son, who said, "That is the woman and boy that I have bought type of"—the prisoner said, "Yes, I have sold you type, and you paid me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it, and you have bought of other women besides me"—she said that she used to take her bag and hang it on a nail, in front of Mr. Mays' window, and the boys used to empty it, and she could not tell what they put into it—the prosecutors. did not press against the boy, he being of very tender years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal storekeeper to Messrs. Spottiswoode. The prisoner had the privilege for years of taking paper from the dust hole, but not of clearing the sweepings from morning to morning—I have looked at a quantity of type, and recognize nearly the whole it as the property of Messrs. Spottiswoode—some is old, but a portion of it is quite new; some of it has marks of mine on it—in it's present state it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, a little more than the value of the old metal—it is not worn out or use<lb></lb>less—the price when new is from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—it is not type which we should have sold as useless.</p>

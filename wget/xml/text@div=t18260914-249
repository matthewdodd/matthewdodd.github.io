               <p>JOHN HURST. I was in the tap-room of a public-house, in St. Giles'. On the 23d of July, in the evening, the prisoner came in with one or two more persons, who went out again - she came and sat down by my side a little while, and then went out; she had some of my beer when she returned, and sat by me again, and then we went to another house and had some porter; I then went to a room with her; I sat down on a bed; she turned herself, and put her hand into my trousers pocket, and took out my purse, which had one crown, two half-crowns, five shillings, and two sixpences in it; I felt her hand coming out of my pocket, and said "You hussy, you have robbed me of my purse;" she denied it, and went to quit the room; the people below asked what was the matter; they then sent for an officer, who searched her; but I have never got the purse again.</p>

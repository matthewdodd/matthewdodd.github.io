            . I have the care of the Adelphi Theatre. On the 3d of October I was coming down Broad-street, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240043"></xptr>saw the child surrounded by the three prisoners - I am sure of them - they pushed the child against a hoard. I was crossing over to see what they were doing, when they all three ran off up Compton-street. The child put her hands up to her face and began crying; and in consequence of what she said I went after them, leaving her in care of a woman. I overtook them all three at the Seven-dials - Anderson slipped away, but was stopped and brought back immediately. The other two said they did not take it, but Anderson did - and he said it was the other two, but they wanted to lay it upon him, because he was the least, and if he attempted to say any other way they would wallop him. A mob collected, and the street-keeper came up. I picked the necklace up in the Green-yard (near the church), where the prisoners had been put. Pendergrass came and said if I would forgive him he would tell me where it was - and that Anderson took it, and threw it in the dirt, where I found it.</p>

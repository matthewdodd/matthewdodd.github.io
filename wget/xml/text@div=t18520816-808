                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. In consequence of missing some property I spoke to the prisoner about it—she said she had not got it, and she had lost the key of her box—she burst the box open herself, took the things out herself, and when she came to the bottom she came to this decanter stopper and brooch, which are mine, but I did not know I had lost them—I went down stairs and found they were mine—the brooch belonged to a young lady who had been staying at our house, but who left before the prisoner came—I locked the room door and sent for an officer—when he came, the prisoner said, "You are a detective officer; you do not search my boxes without your warrant"—the officer insisted on searching her boxes. and in every thing of her own, there were some of mine pinned up—I never gave the prisoner any of the things.</p>

In consequence of instructions I went to Mr. Gooch's, and went into the room where the prisoner was—she objected to my searching her box, but Mrs. Gooch searched it in my presence—I took this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of the box, and she said, "That is mine"—I asked if there was any mark on it—she said, "No"—I looked, and found Mr. Gooch's name on it in ink—I told her I should take her into custody for robbing her master, and she made no reply—I told her husband, who was down stairs at the time, that she was in custody for robbing her master—the husband said, "I did not think it would come to this"—the prisoner said, "I did; I told you so long ago, and I do not care what becomes of me."</p>

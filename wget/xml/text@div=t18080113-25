               <p>Q. Was she a work woman there. - A. I am informed she had worked before I was warehouseman; I never saw he before, I catched her as a thief; I saw the cotton in her arms; when she saw me she let the cotton fall down; going out of the door she fell down, I picked he: up, and brought her into into the accompting house, till my master came home; then he sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, me and my husband had worked for Mr. Taylor many times; I asked Mr. Taylor in the morning, if he could get me employ; I went to the west end of the town, and drank with two of my shopmates: then I went again to Mr. Taylor; after I had been in the accompting house and could not see him, I went up into the warehouse; that bag of cotton stood by me; thinks I, I will not be caught with this; I took it in my arms and threw it in doors. My husband is a wicked man; he has made Mr. Taylor believe I wanted to rob him; I have two children, and a bad husband that would do me all the harm in his power, though I have done him no harm, God forgive him; Mr. Taylor is a worthy man, he would not have done what he has, if it had not been for my husband; my husband was an Irish fortune hunter. I had a few hundreds a few years ago, when he had me; I believe him to be an honest man to his master, but I may say he is the worst of his country; he was in a little business of his own, when he got acquainted with the woman he now lives with, and him and her eloped away together; for months I have not received a farthing from him; I believe him to be an honest man in many respects, but he is an unworthy man to go to Mr. Taylor and get him to do what he has to me.</p>

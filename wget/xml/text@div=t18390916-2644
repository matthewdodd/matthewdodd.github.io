About half-past one in the morning of the 20th of September, I was standing in Twine-court, talking to Rathbone—I saw the prosecutor come down the court with Smith—they went to the door of a house—Smith asked Estenberry for the key, and they all three went in together—in five or six minutes after the prosecutor came to the door by him self, and said he had missed his watch—Smith said, "It is not I that have got it, it is a girl that came with you with a new shawl and blue ribbons"—(Smith had had such things on, but she took off the bonnet and shawl, and put them into another house)—Estenberry then took the prose<lb></lb>cutor down the court—Smith followed them, and as she was walking she put her hand into her pocket, and I saw the seal of a watch, it junked as the was putting it into her pocket—the watch had a black ribbon—when they got to the bottom of the court they both left the man, and ran away—I went for a policeman—when Smith was following them she saw me, and said she would make it all right with me, and they would give me some money if I would not tell.</p>

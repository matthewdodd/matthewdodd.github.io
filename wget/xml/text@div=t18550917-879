                  <hi rend="italic">conducted the Prosecution</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">PATRICK M'DONALD</hi>. I first took notice of the condition of the child about three weeks prior to the prisoner's apprehension—as I went into the room I missed the child, and as I was coming out I found it under an old coat, in a very bad state, dirty, covered with sores, and very sickly—I had it washed by my wife—there was no furniture or food in the room, except a piece of crust unfit to eat; no animal could eat it—I saw the child three times—it always laid in the same corner—prior to the prisoner being taken, I told him on Tuesday night that I would give him in charge if he went out and left the child in that state, and that I had been from 4 till 9 o'clock hunting the public houses for him—he said that he would go out if he liked, and I could not do anything to him for it—he was not drunk or sober then—he is a very hardworking man, and if left alone by his wife would work six days in the week, but I never knew it to be so—when he did work, and had anything for sale, I have seen her out in Petticoat-lane selling the things—I have known that she has taken money for them—I have seen a good deal of money, time after time, with her—there is one instance when I lent the prisoner half a crown, and he acknowledged to me afterwards that he had over 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods to spare after supporting themselves—that was three weeks previous—I knew them when they lived in Reeve's-rents—the child was awfully treated there, because they left it without a fire, in the frost and snow, in the dead of winter.</p>

               <p>at first—it was very thin indeed—on the Tuesday night, the prisoner came in about 10 o'clock—he was not sober, but was not so much in liquor at I have seen him—I asked him if the child had had anything to eat to day—he said, "No, not since yesterday, or longer for what I know"—I asked him the cause of it—he said that the mother was out drinking with her sister, and he could not get any money from her—he wanted my husband to buy a coat, but my husband said that he never bought anything for drink, and the prisoner went out and sold it for a few halfpence, I believe—I did not see him next morning till the policeman was in the room—he was not at work—the sister fetched the wife out at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the prisoner followed, but I do not know at what time—I found the child in the same state, and M'Donald fetched the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Caledonia-place, Caledonia-road, King's-cross—the prisoner was in my employ—I sent him out on the 24th of March, a little after three o'clock, to Ullmer and Watts, in Little Britain, for some type—I gave him half-a-crown—he did not bring the type—I found him the next day in Brewer street, Somer's-town, and gave him into custody—he said he did not know me, and had never seen me before—I con<lb></lb>fronted him with a boy who had been at work with him, and the prisoner said he did not know him.</p>

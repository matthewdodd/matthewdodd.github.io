                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Tritton, of 9, Crescent<lb></lb>terrace, Millbank. On Wednesday, 27th Aug., about 2 o'clock, I was at Paul's Wharf, which is a steam-packet wharf—I felt something touch my side—I put my hand into my pocket, and somebody's hand touched mine—it was coming out as my hand went in—I saw the person whose hand it me—it was that woman (<hi rend="italic">pointing out Yardley</hi>)—I had in my pocket a purse, containing half a sovereign, and some silver, and also two pocket-handker<lb></lb>chiefs—after Yardley took her hand out of my pocket she went and spoke to Thompson, and gave her something—Thompson immediately turned round, and was going off the pier—I told Yardley that she had taken my purse from my pocket—she said, "I have not got it"—I said "You have given it to that person who has just left the pier," and I turned round immediately, and called to a man to stop her—she was brought back immediately—I have since seen my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am money-taker to the Citizen steam-boats, at paul's Wharf Pier. I saw the two prisoners there on Wednesday, about 2 o'clock—I noticed Thompson going away with one of the Company's tickets in her hand, which is contrary to the regulation, sit ought to be delivered up on landing—as she was passing my box I heard the prosecutrix call out—I called out to her, but she took no heed—as she turned sharply round I noticed something that she appeared to throw away similar to paper—I stop<lb></lb>ped her, and looked over the bridge, and saw as I thought a piece of paper</p>

               <p>floating I showed the officer, Edwards, where I stopped her, and the purse was found within a few yards.</p>

Q.</hi> You did not see the prisoners come from any boat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were on the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi>—there were not many people there, I think only four or five besides the pierman—Thompson did not answer when I first called to her, and I went and tapped her on the shoulder, she turned roond, and I told her the lady wanted to see her—I was asked by one of them whether I had seen her throw the purse, and I said, "No; I could not swear to that, and I cannot now—I could not swear positively whether it was a purse or not—I did not to my knowledge say that I did not see her throw anything away—I cannot say positively whether I did say so or not—I saw her throw something away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a capmaker, of 46, Cannon Street, St. George's-in-the-East—on 3rd November I shut up my house—the doors and windows were safe at 11.30—I was awoke at twenty minutes to three by my servant crying, "Master, master, get up; there are burglars"—I opened the front window and called "Police"—I opened my bedroom door, and found that other doors were open—one of two boxes was broken open, and the things strewed about the room, the window of which was open—I looked out and saw one of the prisoners descending a ladder—I went down stairs, opened the middle room door and the shop door, and found Mahoney in custody in the street, next door to my house—the second box had been tried to be forced, but they had not succeeded.</p>

I am the prosecutor's servant—on 3rd November, early in the morning, I was disturbed, and found the two prisoners inside my room with a light in their hand—I am sure they are the men—I screamed for my master, and called "Police;" they put the light out, and ran out at the back window—I heard a smash of glass, but cannot say what it was.</p>

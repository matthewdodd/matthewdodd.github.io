               <p>When did you see her afterwards? - When she was taken up, I saw her go into a house, in Black-horse-alley, and I stopt her.</p>
               <p>What did she say for herself? - She said she had done the like before, and she would do the like again, and good luck to her for it.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. If you please to ask him where he slept that night.</p>

            , who keeps a house in my neighbourhood; my young man took the watch and asked her whose it was, she said it was her husband's; seeing him make inquiry, I stepped forwards and took hold of the watch; upon that, this Murray says, it is my watch, you need not be afraid. I lent him two guineas on it, and gave him a duplicate in his own name.</p>
               <p>What is Murray? - He is a man that sells goods in the market.</p>
               <p>What is he to the prisoner? - Nothing at all that I know of, I never knew him any ways connected with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who brought the watch in? - The prisoner brought it in first.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bevan and I had been acquainted together for about three months, or not quite so much, he wanted to be concerned with me as with other unfortunate girls, and he had no money; he put his watch down my bosom and insisted on my taking the watch; next morning at six o'clock, he asked me for the watch again, and I told him that as he had no money I would not give it him. I went with it to Fleet-market, and Murray pawned it, and I gave him 25 s. of the money back again.</p>
               <p>To Bevan. Is it true that she gave you any of the money back again? - I never saw her from the time I lost it, to the time she was taken up in Black-horse-alley.</p>

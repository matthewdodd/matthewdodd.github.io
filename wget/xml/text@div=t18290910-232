I left my dollars in a trunk in my cabin - I left it on the 4th of August, and the last thing I took five dollars out of the bag, and gave them to a doctor to take to a man who was going to the hospital; there was no one present; next morning one of the men was searching my box, and said, "Here are a great many wax candles;" I said Yes; he said, "We burn a great many in our lantern, I will take one;" I said, "Do;" the prisoner was second officer of the ship - he was on board when I left; I missed the dollars about half-past five o'clock, on the 5th - the prisoner had gone on shore that day about nine o'clock in the morning, and returned about three; I did not know then that I had lost them; he came on board the next day, and said, "Is it true you have lost the dollars?" I said, "It is too true;" he declared that he knew nothing about them; the next day he came on board again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100114"></xptr>and went below - a person came to inquire for a package, and it was not found; in looking for it, I saw the prisoner in the larboard after-cabin, stooping down; I asked him if he knew any thing of the package; he said No; I was then coming up again - he said, "Look here;" he pointed down, and lifted up a night-cap with fifty-eight dollars in it; it was under his couch; I desired him to let it he till I had called one of the Dock clerks - he appeared as if he had accidentally hit upon it; he said he was looking for his shoe, and found the night-cap under the coach; the whole crew on board the ship, were thirty-seven or thirty-eight, but they had all left the ship except some boys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you bring a prostitute on board to sleep with you in your cabin? A. Not in my cabin, in one of the other cabins; I did not say any thing against the prisoner - there was much said against him, but not by me; he came on board the ship from time to time; the Magistrate admitted him to bail; he never slept in the same cabin with me - he slept in the cabin in which the dollars were found; it was sometimes open and sometimes shut - there is a water-closet in it for the passengers; it is not open to all - the prisoner had gone on shore three times before he found the dollars, but I do not think he had an opportunity of taking them on shore; prostitutes are often thieves - I was not in her company the whole of the time she was on board, but I can swear she never left the cabin, because the door was kept locked; I had gone on deck, and while I was there I could not see the cabin door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did that woman come on board? A. About half-past eleven or twelve o'clock at night, and staid till six the next day; the trunk was not kept locked, but the door of the cabin was; the prisoner had complained of the Custom-house officer going into that cabin to the water-closet - we had other passengers on board, but not in that cabin.</p>

            . I am third officer on board this vessel. I was ill and on my couch in a cabin opposite the one the dollars were found in; about ten o'clock Briggs went on shore, and in about half an hour I heard a person, who I thought was the prisoner, come down the ladder with an immense quantity of dollars - he was emptying them out; and the next day I heard Mr. Briggs say he had lost a great number, unless Mr. Martin had taken care of them; I said he might make himself easy, for Mr. Martin had taken care of them; I did not speak to the prisoner at the time I heard him; I believe he slept in that cabin, because I heard a midshipman come and call him about ten o'clock the next morning - I heard a Custom-house officer come to that cabin; Martin said, "Who is that?" he said, "It is I;" and he told him to go on deck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time did the witness bring the woman on board? A. I think about an hour after I heard the prisoner come down; I slept in the starboard after-cabin; I could not see the prisoner, but I heard him; if any person had asked me, I should have said it was Martin; I heard his foot, and heard him cough - I never said though I was not certain, yet I would swear to him; he was called at night and went on deck, and then came down again; it was a passenger's cabin, who had left at Dover - I did not suspect him; he came on board, and eat and drank with the prosecutor; they were on the closest intimacy the whole voyage; he has been appointed chief officer of the ship.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand you said the dollars were safe because Martin had taken them? A. Yes; I thought he took them to take care of for Mr. Briggs, as they were so intimate; I told Mr. Briggs of it when he came on board, and he inquired of Mr. Martin when he came on board; the cabin in which the dollars had been was on the deck on the larboard side - I heard that door shut, as I suppose, and a person come down and go into the other cabin - he was afterwards called and went on deck; it was after that I heard the dollars taken, and some one come down from the awning after-cabin; I do not think I had been asleep for three nights.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you any reason to suppose that it was Martin that came down, otherwise than by supposing he had left the cabin? A. I supposed it was him; I expected he would have remained on deck, but I supposed he came down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it his duty to remain on deck? A. Yes; he was called to look out - there would have been no person on deck with him but the Custom-house officer.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When Fell told you your money was safe as Martin had taken it, did you speak to Martin? A. Yes; when he came on board he said, "Is it true that you have lost your money?" I said it was too true; on the Saturday after I had been at the Thames Police, he said he had received an anonymous letter - he showed it to me, and asked if I knew any thing about it; I said No - but I suspected him, and there was evidence which I intended to have looked into as soon as I had time; he said he had not taken the money, and had not so much, or he would pay it me rather than have his name made public; when I went on shore that night, I told a boy to give Mr. Martin the key of my cabin - when I returned I got the key from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where did you pay the woman from? A. From the desk, in dollars; after the letter had been received the prisoner left me, and on Monday I went to the Thames Police.</p>

I was required to go on board the ship on Monday, the 24th - I found the prisoner and the two witnesses in the cuddy: I was talking to Fell, and the prisoner came out - I called him, and said, "I understand there has been a robbery committed;" he said Yes - I said, "Do you know any thing about it?" he said No; I said,"There is some suspicion attaches to you, have you any objection to go before the Magistrate?" he said he had not; he said he could swear the money was safe in Mr. Briggs' trunk - the next day he went before the Magistrate, who admitted him to bail.</p>

               <p>MR. HUNGERFORD. I live in Newton-terrace, Kennington, and am a tide-surveyor of the Customs. On the 4th of August I was on board the vessel, and heard that Mr. Briggs had lost his property; some hints were thrown out that the Custom-house officers or searchers, had taken them - I said, "If you suspect any of them, let me know, and I will represent it to the Board of Customs;" he said,"Indeed, I may blame myself a great deal" - I said, "If you suspect any of my officers, let me have their names, and I will not let them go on duty;" I advised the prosecutor to go to the office, and the prisoner offered to go for him: I asked him if he suspected the prisoner - he said he did not; when it was said that a person had been jingling dollars in the cabin, Fell said it was not Martin, if it had been him he should have known him.</p>

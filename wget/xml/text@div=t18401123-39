                  </hi>. I reside at No. 4, Park-terrace, Islington, and am a member of the College of Surgeons—I am acquainted with the prisoner and Mrs. Pearse likewise—her Christian name is Elizabeth. On the 16th of October they lived at No. 23, Bedford-place, Kensington—I called on them there about one or two o'clock that day, and found them at home—I staid dinner with them—we sat down to dinner about two o'clock—the table was in the centre of the room—there is a conservatory behind the room, and opposite the conservatory at the other end of the room is a window—Mr. Pearse sat down at the bottom of the table with his back towards the conser<lb></lb>vatory—Mrs. Pearse sat opposite to him with her back to the window—I was sitting on Mrs. Pearse's left-hand with my back to the fire, and my right-hand to Mr. Pearse—there was a sofa on the other side opposite me—we sat down to dinner—I was helped to a mutton-chop, which I passed to Mrs. Pearse—I took the next plate that was offered, containing a mutton-chop—Mr. Pearse took a portion of a chop himself—he put two portions into his mouth at separate times, and spat each portion out of his mouth</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230021"></xptr>
               <p>on to the plate—he then got up suddenly, and said it was sultry, that he was suffocating, and the window must be opened—he rushed to the win<lb></lb>dow, passing on the side opposite to me where the sofa was—when he get to the window he stood behind Mrs. Pearse, and I heard him exclaim, "you have been poisoning me for some time," or, "Some days, I shall be dead in three days"—I then heard the report of a pistol—he was at that time standing close behind her—I saw a flash behind Mrs. Pearse on her left side, and heard her cry out, "Save me," of "Protect me," or some such ex<lb></lb>pression—she then slipped from the chair on which she had been sitting—I immediately jumped up, and stood face to face with Mr. Pearse, and endea<lb></lb>voured to occupy his attention while Mrs. Pearse escaped—the crawled from her position on the ground to the conservatory behind—I did not see any pistol at the time—I asked the prisoner if it was real, or meant as a feint—he said, "No"—I said, "What, loaded?"—he said, "Yes, by G—d"—I then went into the conservatory after Mrs. Pearse, and saw her in the garden—she had descended the steps of the conservatory—I then went back into the room—I found Mr. Pearse still there—he was very much agitated, and struck his head with his band—he said he was poisoned, and should be dead in three days—I then looked out of the window, and saw Mrs. Pearse in the road—I went out to her, and found the cook with her—I observed her dress was smouldering like tinder—she cried out to extinguish the fire, which I did—she was then taken to a medical man—I returned to the house, went into the nursery, and saw the children—Mr. Pearse was not in the nursery—he was in the parlour—he asked where Mrs. Pearse was gone, and I told him—I asked to see the pistol—he ob<lb></lb>jected at first, but on my pressing he showed it to me—I found it had been discharged, and returned it to him—I then went to Mr. Taylor's—the pri<lb></lb>soner followed me—I found Mr. Taylor at' home, and had some conversa<lb></lb>tion with him and Mr. Pearse—Mr. Pearse then left Mr. Taylor's—I did not follow him—I think I remained at Mr. Taylor's with Mr. Pearse near half-an-hour—he left the house first—I followed Mr. Taylor's son, who went for a policeman—I did not return to Mr. Pearse's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many children has this unfortunate gentleman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three—he has been married, I fancy, four years—I believe the youngest is a baby at the breast—Mr. Pearse was at home when I went there—he opened the door to me—the eldest little boy was present at the dinner-table—I believe he is turned three years of age—he was in the room at the time Mr. Pearse discharged the pistol, but was not at the table—he was on the opposite side of the table to me—it is a moderate sized parlour—he was at the right band side of his mother, close to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any thing about the apartment, or in the atmosphere, to warrant the supposition that he was in a state of suffocation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The day was certainly a very close one—I cannot explain his feelings—I knew Mrs. Pearse before her marriage, and have known her during the four years she has been married—I have never observed any thing in her con<lb></lb>duct to warrant any conclusion, but that she was a tender, affectionate, and kind-hearted mother and wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the unfortunate gentleman himself, when collected, was he a kind father, and affectionate to his children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My visits were at such long intervals, and so short, I have not had the opportunity of judging, but I never saw the contrary—he never showed me his boots for the pur<lb></lb>pose</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230022"></xptr>
               <p>of having my opinion whether they had been saturated with arsenic or not—I had no idea that there was any thing like poison in what we had for dinner—I had partaken of a portion—there was nothing to excite such a suspicion—the chops were well cooked, and in an ordinary manner—there appeared nothing in Mrs. Pearse's conduct to justify any excitement or violence in him—my visits there were at long intervals, twice this year—I have not seen Mrs. Pearse since this—I am decidedly of opinion that she is in every respect an irreproachable and well conducted person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> A view appears to be taken of my case by both parties, which I hope to prove to the Court is perfectly unfounded—I wish to put a few questions to the witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> After Mrs. Pearse went into the conservatory, and you followed her, do you remember what she said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think there was any exchange of words—when she got into the garden she said she was shot—she might have said, "He is mad—he is always mad, "but very indistinctly, if she did—I think it is not at all unlikely, but I am not very quick of hearing—I do not remember her passing through the par<lb></lb>lour from the garden—I know I saw her in the street when I returned from the back of the house to the front parlour, and I said to you, "There is Mrs. Pearse."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She went into the garden, and returned up the conservatory steps into the parlour, and in doing that she must of necessity have passed me—there was no means of her getting into the street except through the parlour, and if it was my intent to do her any serious injury, or any bodily harm, could I not have effected that purpose when she' passed within two feet of me? Just previous to my entering the room you were having a conversation with Mrs. Pearse, of a particular nature, will you be good enough to state what that conversation was; I heard the termination of it, which threw me into the state of excitement in which I was—I heard a few concluding words, which showed me what the nature of the conver<lb></lb>sation was; was not Mrs. Pearse putting questions to you as to the preg<lb></lb>nancy of her sister, Mrs. C——? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Not a word—I will swear it—I have heard reports of your jealousy of a person, but I do not know the Individual you allude to, without you point him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> May I be permitted to name the individual I suspect? my jealousy of him is notorious to my whole house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any reason from any thing you know, to place the slightest reliance on those reports? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—it appears that they have been circulated by Mr. Pearse himself—I do not believe there is the slightest foundation for any such supposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> But you do not believe, I presume, that I do not believe it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot answer that—no conversation took place between Mrs. Pearse and myself respecting what you have said—I most decidedly say it must be a delusion altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> My Lord, the name of this person must be produced, I have no hesitation in saying, because that is the main feature on which I ground my defence, and the unfortunate cause of this desperate assault; the gen<lb></lb>tleman I allude to, is Mr. R——B——C——he is the person who I have every reason to believe has been instrumental in seducing my wife's affections entirely from me, and leaving me in the wretched state in which you see me here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in Mr. Pearse's service. I received Mrs. Pearse's clothes, I observed marks of burning under one of the arms—I searched the dining-room that evening, to try if I could find any shot, but found none—next morning I trod on something, which turned out to be a bullet—I gave it to Mr. and Mrs. C——the policeman has it—I know where my mistress had been sitting—the bullet was near her place, near the window.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you lived in the family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three months and three weeks—I was not aware that Mr. Pearse kept loaded fire-arms about the house—Mr. and Mrs. C—were both there to tea on the day I found the bullet—Mrs. C—was sitting in the chair mistress had sat in that day—the officers had been look<lb></lb>ing about before that—Mr. C——is an independent gentleman, I think—I do not believe he has been guilty of any impropriety whatever with Mrs. Pearse—I only saw him once before the accident occurred—I have no reason to believe he was separated from his wife—they were there together when I found the ball—I do not bear the least ill will towards Mr. Pearse—if he has a delusion that I am one of his bitterest enemies, there is no foundation for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you recollect, a few nights before the unfortunate occurrence took place, my having a dispute with Mrs. Pearse, relative to some silver plate, which was not in the house, I begged of Mrs. Pearse, and importuned her to let me see into the box—if the plate was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You did desire her to let you see into the box, you said you thought it was her intention to run away in the morning, and take the plate with her—she would not suffer you to look into the box till the morning—she did not call you a nasty stinking old beggar—she said you were mad to ask her to open the box at that time of night, she bad no objection in the morning—that was between eleven and twelve o'clock, when they were going to bed—mistress had gone up to bed—she did not call you a pock<lb></lb>marked wretch, and an ugly old hound—Grace, the nursery-maid, did not say that when Mr. C——visited at the house he was mistress's friend, and not master's—you always kept your bed-room door locked, and would not permit any body but me to make the bed—your jealousy of Mr. C—was not notorious to my knowledge—I never beard it mentioned in the kitchen by the servants—I never heard it from the girl who left—I never heard that it was feared, three or four weeks before this happened, that your son John had swallowed a bullet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in High-street, Kensington. On Friday, the 16th of October, between two and three o'clock in the day, Mrs. Pearse was brought to ray house—I had her taken up-stairs and stripped, and found there was a pistol-shot on the left side, under the arm-pit—I do not mean that I found the actual shot there, but the explosion of gunpowder, and a great deal of coagulated blood—it was black for two inches round—the clothes were burnt—I attempted to probe the wound, but found nothing had entered it—it was quite super<lb></lb>ficial, and a slight wound—the prisoner came to my house soon after, and appeared very agitated indeed—he asked whether Mrs. Pearse was hurt—I said, "Yes" (this was not in her presence, but down stairs)—he was very anxious to go up, very importunate indeed—I refused to let him—he said she had been poisoning him, and they should both be dead in about three days, or that be should be dead in about three days—as he importuned so much to go up, I felt in his pocket, and found a pistol—I examined it, and it had been recently discharged—I returned it to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four years—I attended his wife with three children, and have seen a good deal of him—he was in a very ill state of health from about October last year, to January this year, and he was ill previous to that in 1838—he was attended on the last occasion by Dr. Marshall Hall, Sir Charles Scudamore, Dr. Kerrison, and myself—I cannot define what his illness was, more than general excitement, first on one subject, and then another, particularly about the state of his heart—he complained very much of his heart, and I consider it excited his mind—he was in a very disturbed state of mind—there certainly was fever, which I thought of the rheumatic order—in the course of my professional attendance on him I found he had occasional delusions on given subjects—in my opinion he was wrong in his opinion of his disease—he went to excess in the opinion of his complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was his delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He thought his disease more important than it was—he considered he should die, and he had sleepless nights—I thought there was no foundation for it—I considered that he was labouring under a great deal of nervous excitement—that state existed nearly the whole time I was attending him—he used to say he and Mrs. Pearse did not agree, but nothing else—of course I wished to keep his mind off those things, as I consider they add to the excitement—he did not seem under excitement as to his wife's conduct—he did not speak of her conduct in particular, but said, unfortunately they did not agree—I have had opportunities of observing Mrs. Pearse's conduct in many in<lb></lb>stances—her conduct was unexceptionable, as far as I know—I never saw any thing to justify any suspicion—I have seen him in bursts of crying—he would come to my house and talk of his indisposition, and suddenly burst out crying.</p>

               <p>question was first put to me by you, and I replied, it Was unfeeling, but I was not privy to the fact—I think I once found Mrs. Pearse in your room when I called, but there was a servant in constant attendance on you—I was only there occasionally—I attended you for nearly six weeks the last time—Dr. Kerrison was there when 1 saw Mrs. Pearse in your room—I cannot tell whether she came in at his desire—you have told me Mrs. Pearse had independent property of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—you have com<lb></lb>plained of Mrs. Pearse persisting in dipping her children in cold water in the winter, and making them ill by it, but I did not know it for a fact—I think, as a medical man and a husband, what you said ought to have been attended to on such a point—the children are quite well now—I have not seen Mrs. Pearse for a fortnight—I believe she is at Kennington—the children are at home with the servants, except the infant—that is with Mrs. Pearse—you did not tell me of Mrs. Pearse cutting your cheek open with a stick at Boulogne, soon after your marriage—I have called you in to assist me with your advice, as a medical man, when Dr. Kerrison was attending a young man who had mortification in his arm—I have called you in to see three of my patients—one was a person who fell down sud<lb></lb>denly with cholera—I never heard the servants say that Mrs. Pearse had threatened to send you to die in a mad-house.</p>

On the 16th I saw the prisoner at Mr. Taylor's—I searched him, and found a pistol, which I produce—it had been discharged—I went to his bed-room, and found the fellow pistol to it in the drawer, loaded with ball—it is loaded now—I searched the room below to see if 1 could find any bullet, but could not—I found marks of shot on the wall.</p>

I am a police-sergeant Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on Friday the 16th of October, I was at the station-house—Mr. Pearse came to me, and said be wished to see me in private, as he had something to state of a painful nature—I heard him in private—he stated that he fancied Mrs. Pearse had been endeavouring to poison him by putting poison into his coffee, and also into his pudding, and he asked me to go and search her boxes—he laid although he had not any proof he felt so unwell for the last fortnight from palpitation of the heart—I told him I thought it was only fancy—he said he fancied his sheets bad been damped when he slept apart from Mrs. Pearse—he thought they had been sprinkled with water in the day-time, that he might catch cold by it—I told him it was a case I could not interfere in, and he must apply to a solicitor—between two and three o'clock the same day I received information, in</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Mr. Pearse's service for four years, and left five months ago—I had opportunities of observing the manner in which Mr. Pearse conducted himself—he was sometimes quiet in his conduct—he was very irritable at times—I have seen him in a passion and violent, but that was very seldom—he was very often irritable—I have heard him say he thought the sheets of his bed were damped in the former part of the day, and that Mrs. Pearse had done it—he did not say why he thought so—he always kept his bed-room door locked, and did not permit persons to go in to clean it—on the Friday before I came out of the house he took his bed off the bedstead, and put it down on the floor—he did not say why he did that—he brought a bed out of the servant's room up stairs instead—he brought it down to his own room with my help—he said he wished to have it changed—I suppose he thought I had damped the bed on the Friday, because he would not suffer me in the bed-room after I had scrubbed the room that Friday—the room was in a filthy state through his not allowing any one to go in and clean it—I once heard him say he thought Mrs. Pearse had damped the bed—that was about two months before I left—I do not remember hearing him express any other suspicions against Mrs. Pearse—as far as I could judge she appeared to be attentive and affectionate—there was no foundation for supposing she had damped his bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Bell-yard, Carey-street. I have known the prisoner many yean—his first wife was my cousin—I have been on friendly terms with him and his wife—I remember his illness at the latter end of last year—I have observed a very consider<lb></lb>able change in him since then—I always thought him particularly mild in his conduct until after that illness, and since that he has appeared remark<lb></lb>ably irritable on very slight occasions—I never heard until very lately that he entertained any suspicions of his wife—very lately I heard him say he suspected she had put arsenic into his boots from the colour of his stock<lb></lb>ings—he said they were of a reddish brown—since this charge he has several times expressed a belief of his wife's infidelity to him, repeatedly within the last fortnight—he mentioned Mr. C——as the person to whom lie attributed the seduction of his wife—I think he said he suspected her with other persons also—I have observed the conduct of Mrs. Pearse to<lb></lb>wards him—she always appeared to me a kind affectionate mother—Mr. Pearse always appeared to be nervously anxious about his children—if they cried he always thought she did not pay sufficient attention to them, and appeared to be in a great state of excitement—his excitement did not appear at all warranted by the cause assigned—I told him the contrary—when he is self-possessed and collected, he is remarkably quiet—he was always fond of pistols from a youth—I believe he used to practise shoot<lb></lb>ing at a mark—I know he had pistols when he was a medical student—In ever observed him guilty of any violent acts towards persons, except towards Mrs. Pearse, he appeared violently irritable on slight occasions—in my judgment there has been no foundation for that irritability—the time I saw him most violently excited was when a child was crying, and he said, "I know you are not having that child attended to properly"—she maid, "Don't fidget about it, I have told the girl to attend to it"—he ap<lb></lb>peared dreadfully excited at being answered in that manner, and said Mrs. Pearse would not care if the children were dead—this was about the begin<lb></lb>ning of last year—he continued to fancy himself ill, but I thought he was well—that was after he bad been taken ill—I did not call there again for six months, I felt so much hurt at what I saw; and when 1 called again a few months ago I told him I was glad to see him in such good health—he said, "Yes, my health is better, but I am as I was when you saw me before, in dreadful excitement"—Mr. and Mrs. C——are very respectable people—I do not believe there is the slightest foundation for his suspicions of his wife's infidelity, or that she intended to poison or do him any injury.</p>

                  </hi>. M. D. I know Mr. Pearse. I have attended him professionally on two occasions. On the 18th of October, last year, I paid my first visit to him, and attended him, as well as I can remember, about a fortnight, regularly—I called to make inquiry occasionally after<lb></lb>wards—my last memorandum of a visit, is the 2nd of April this year—at the latter end of last year I found him labouring under much general fever, much heat of skin, a very loaded tongue, a full and quickened pulse, a countenance exhibiting considerable wildness of expression, and the eyes suffused, with considerable redness—he represented that his heart was the seat of disease, and complained of violent palpitation, which he said was sometimes so excessive that he thought it would burst—he was persuaded that he had a dangerous state of disease of the heart, and he thought he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230028"></xptr>
               <p>might die suddenly—he described that he had been wholly deprived of sleep for several nights—I examined him carefully, both by queries and by my eye, to ascertain whether his representations were correct or not—I exercised my best judgment in the remedies I applied for the complaint, but the result of my opinion was, that there was not the disease he sus<lb></lb>pected, namely, an organic affection of the heart—the action of the heart, it is true, was very unnaturally increased, but I thought that the brain was the chief seat of morbid excitement—I had not been made acquainted with his delusion respecting his wife's infidelity, or attempts to destroy him; if I bad known it, it would certainly have strengthened my opinion that the brain was the seat of disease—I treated him regularly for a fortnight—after that my opinion was that there was a general and very marked disturbance of the whole nervous system, indicated by the remarkable absence of sleep on most nights, by the most gloomy state of spirits, by the most unreason<lb></lb>able ideas of the nature of his case, having still a fixed persuasion that his heart was incurably diseased, notwithstanding his acute fever had passed away in consequence of the treatment I had employed; in fact, he passed into the chronic state of the same malady—all that I saw wrong with regard to his mind, related to his own disease, of which he had the strongest misconception—I did not perceive any act of his denoting de<lb></lb>rangement, but from the state in which I left him, it was probable his mind would be affected.</p>

               <p>blood does not of necessity bring on a nervous disorder—I considered the indication of the brain, at my first visit, to be of an inflammatory nature, and with which I thought the heart sympathised—I judged it expedient and necessary to direct the removal of blood—although you never re<lb></lb>covered, you got into a better state of health—the medicines were admi<lb></lb>nistered on the same view of the disease as that on which I directed the abstraction of blood—it was not to be expected, that in the highly irritable and disturbed state in which you were, you should coincide in opinion with me—except as related to your disorder, I did not find any irregularity of mind—but on my visits the conversation was confined to your case—we did not discuss general subjects—you did not put me in possession of any opinion you entertained of the infidelity of Mrs. Pearse, nor of her doing you any harm.</p>

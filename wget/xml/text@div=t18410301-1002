                  </hi>. I am shopman to Joseph Pobjoy Harvey, a linen-draper, in the Westminster-road, Lambeth. The prisoner was in bis em<lb></lb>ploy—on the morning of the 15th of February, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner go from the shop down to the lower warehouse—I there heard him open some parcels, and on looking down, I saw him with a paper open, containing some challi dresses—I went down—he met me, and appeared confused—I made some remark to him, and then re<lb></lb>turned to the dwelling-house, secreted myself on the landing of the stain—soon after, became up in a great hurry, and I thought I observed some<lb></lb>thing bulky under his coat—I mentioned my suspicion to Mr. Tomlinsin about half an hour—on the 17th I again saw the prisoner go down to an<lb></lb>other part of the warehouse, and open some galloon papers, he bad got his blouse coat on, as he had before—I told Mr. Wilson.</p>

The wit<lb></lb>nesses spoke to me—I had the prisoner before his master—Mr. Harvey told him that he suspected him—he said he did not know what he alluded to, did he suspect his honesty—Mr. Harvey said yes—the policeman was sent for, and then the prisoner desired to speak to Mr. Harvey, which Mr. Harvey declined—the officer then desired him to go to his sleeping apart<lb></lb>ment, which he did, and pointed out his boxes, and gave up the keys—there were several articles taken out, some of which I knew myself—he went to the other side of the bed while the search was going on, and, from some exclamation, the officer went round and found him in the act of cut<lb></lb>ting his throat—the officer seized him, and he dropped the razor.</p>

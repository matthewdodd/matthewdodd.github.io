On Tuesday night, 11th Oct., I went to bed about a quarter of an hour before papa—I came down before him on the following morning, about 7 o'clock—the drawing room door was open, the cupboards were open, (he decanters taken out, and the stopper was out of the wine, and a little distance from it—I went down stairs to the kitchen—as I went to the window, I stumbled against something; I saw it was papa's double barrelled gun—the kitchen window had not been opened—I went to the scullery door; it was wide open—I did not go in—I stayed in the lobby, and ran back and went up stairs, and called papa—I first went into my sister's room, and found that it had been ransacked in the same manner that the others had—my sister was not at home—the front door was unbolted, top and bottom—it was not open; it had been shut, though not bolted—the scullery door leads to the garden; it was wide open—the door shut the window out from my view—I made a communication to my father, and he came down stairs—amongst the property taken away there were some spectacles—I saw them on the evening before; mamma used them—on the Tuesday, they were lying on the table—two pairs were taken—I only saw one on Tuesday—I should know them if I saw them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">as Amicus Curiae, suggested that as the two counts in the indictment were antagonistic, the prisoner, Edward Smith, by pleading Guilty to the second count, had exhausted the whole indictment, and was not and could not be charged to the Jury on the first count for burglary.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COMMON SERJEANT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">after having consulted with the learned Judges</hi>) <hi rend="italic">said there was very great difficulty in the case; not so much in the antagonism between the two counts, but because the prisoner had never specifically pleaded: he had pleaded Guilty to the second count, and the first was only got at by implication; as he had not pleaded Not Guilty to it, he could not be charged; the whole case must therefore be tried over again, or a verdict of Not Guilty must be taken on the first count.</hi>

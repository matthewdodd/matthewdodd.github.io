            . I am a footman to Mr. Holt. On the 1st of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I admitted some visitors; I shut the door after them, but omitted bolting it - I am certain it was fastened by the latch, and between one and two o'clock, I heard a noise, and went out to the fore-court - I do not know of any body having come to the house in that interval; I heard my fellow-servant scream in the hall; I was sitting in the kitchen, and saw here coming down the steps with the prisoner before her from the front steps I could see the steps from the kitchen; I went out at the side door to the gate, and pursued the prisoner; I saw him with the plate-basket in his hand - the prisoner is the man; there was a cart at the gate; I saw the prisoner get into it; he was driven off by a body who was with him; I was close to it when the prisoner got in, and pursued - I saw him give the boy the plate-basket; he took it, and put it down on the near side - as soon as the prisoner got one foot on the cart, the boy drove off at full speed: I was then laying hold of the tail of the cart; the prisoner then took the rains and the whip, and drove, and after a bit, be turned round, and began to horse-whip me; I had got hold of his coat: he then took the butt-end of the whip, and hit me on the hand, and over my head; I put my hand up, and he cut my hand, and two of my knuckles; he then threw the basket of plate out, saying"Take it you b-g-r;" I still continued to pursue him; I had hold of the skirt of his coat at that time - it gave way, and I have the piece here; it came off in my hand; I then let go of the cart, which went off at full speed; I have not the least doubt of prisoner's person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You let the company in between eleven and twelve o'clock? A. Yes; I let in two ladies; my master has three servants in the house, also a coachman and gardener; he has a son and two daughters - I had not been out myself; whether any of the family had gone out and left the door unlatched I cannot say - the skirt of the prisoner's coat came off in my hand; I was rather confused, but am sure of him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Have you the least doubt of him? A. Not the least; I took particular notice of him while he was whipping me,</p>

            . I am a farmer. I was on horseback in the Tottenham-road, and saw Ray, my servantand, from information, I went in pursuit of a cart, and come up with it between four and five miles off, at the end of Duvall's-lane, at Holloway; I road very fast, and met the cart; Holloway is out of the road from Tottenham to London; I went that way in consequence of information, through Newington and Islington to the Greenlanes; the prisoner, and a boy were in the cart - on coming up I held up a stick, I had in my hand and said,"Young man stop, I want to speak to you;" he said,"D - n you, what do you want with me, get out of my way;" and struck his horse; I turned my horse and road before him, and told him he should stop; he drove the wheel of his cart against the haunch of my horse, and by that means broke one of my traces; I still kept my seat, and began to cry Stop thief! he went a few yards further, then turned up a road out of the high-road - I still followed close at the tail of the cart; he went up the road about two hundred yards, then he and the boy jumped out of the cart together, and both went up a street - I passed the boy, and kept following the prisoner close all the way, and at last came up to him in a place which is no throughfare; he tried twice to get over a wall but could not - Chisnall came up directly.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had the prisoner a coat or jacket on? A. No; he had disposed of the coat, he had a tight waistcoat with sleeves, such as I have seen many people wear; the cart was not in sight when I first started - I met it; some apples and walnuts, and two coats, were found in the cart - they were entire coats.</p>

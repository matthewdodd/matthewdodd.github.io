             Daniel. About the middle of December last, betwixt 11 and 12 at night; three men were in the star in Star street; they deluded me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110004"></xptr> out of the house; the landlord said I should not go out that night; I went out with them, they push'd me into an alley before me, they strove to get my handkerchief from me, I went to prevent them, and in the bustle I lost my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the prisoners there?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I think I remember something of Robertson's face, being one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ask you for your money?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they show you any weapon of any kind?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. No, they did not; I was so surpriz'd, I don't know how they parted with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out for help?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I can't say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober ?</p>

               <p>M' Daniel. I believe I was the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking in the house?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I had been drinking two full pots of bear with them; they told me they belong'd to a man of war at Chatham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take notice of them, so as to know them?</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I did not, nor had not seen them before</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Briant.</p>
               <p>M' Daniel. I can't say any thing of him.</p>

            . The two prisoners and I were in company about the middle of December, about eight or ten days before Christmas; we were near an hour drinking with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of liquor did you drink?</p>
               <p>Barber. Three full pots of beer; we told him we belonged to a man of war at Chatham, and that if he would come along with us we would treat him; so he went out with us. Welch swore he would have what he had; I said, he is a seafaring man, and desired not to take any thing from him; he took the man away, and gave him a blow or two; he got hold of his handkerchief, and the man resisted; in the mean time I took the hat off his head, but the watch coming by we all three ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man cry out?</p>
               <p>Barber. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any weapons?</p>
               <p>Barber. No; but we brought him out in order to take what we could from him. After this, Briant and I went to the night-house near Billingsgate, where we quarrelled; Welch wanted to have the hat to himself, but we said he had got his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the hat?</p>
               <p>Barber. We sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor in liquor?</p>
               <p>Barber. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. from Welch. How did the quarrel begin ?</p>
               <p>Barber. He wanted the hat from us.</p>
               <p>Welch. He told me he had a hat, and I asked him where he got it. I have been at the prosecutor's lodgings oftentimes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was he ever at your lodgings after ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Welch's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never drank with Barber, only I met him in East-Smithfield, and he asked me to drink; he gave me some gin and beer, and I have been sick ever since. He told me he belonged to an India man.</p>
               <p>Briant's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of Barber; I hear he has been guilty of a robbery in Drury Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. from Welch. Ask Barber whether he did not meet me in Wapping and ask me to drink with him, and I would not.</p>
               <p>Barber. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Welch. Did not I ask him to fight him there ?</p>

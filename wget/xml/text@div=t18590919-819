                  </hi>. I was Inspector of G Division of police—on 4th Septem<lb></lb>ber I went with several officers to the White Horse, Baldwin's Gardens, which is kept by the prisoner—the door was closed—Inspector Briant knocked at the door, and it was opened by the prisoner—there were seven or eight officers—we entered, and several of the officers rushed up stairs—the prisoner said to me, "Are you Mr. Brannan?"—I said "Yes"—she said, "What is the matter?"—I said "We have come to search for counter<lb></lb>feit coin; I have instructions to do so."—She said, "O dear me, you will find nothing of the kind here"—I said, "Come with me, and be present at the search"—she followed me up to the one pair landing—I was preceding her, and I heard a rustling noise—I looked back and saw her running down stairs—I immediately followed her, and found her inside the bar in a stoop<lb></lb>ing position—I then saw her stand up with this bag in her right hand, which she concealed in the folds of her dress—I went up to her and asked her what that strange conduct meant—she pushed me away, and said, she was a lone woman, and the house was frequented by gay characters—Mr. Briant was standing by me, and I saw her throw the bag from her hand on a chest near the beer-engine, and she pushed a drawer in with her elbow—she was then taken to the bar parlour, and I proceeded to make a further search—at that time I was called to her; she said she wanted to speak to me—I said, "If it is anything relating to this case, what you say, I shall name in evidence"—she then said, "If you will go to <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Burns' house, in Laystall-street, you will find what you want. I will be upon my oath, I did not know where they were made till yesterday; I was never in his house myself, but my lodger, Mrs. Westgate, has been, and she will show you"—Mr. Everett and other officers accompanied her, and I took the prisoner to the station in Old-street, and while the charge was being taken, she requested to speak to me, and said, "The fact is, these things were made in a street in Camberwell; I don't know the number nor the name of the street, and I forget the man's name; but I should know it if I were to hear it."—I said, "Is it <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Burns;" she said, "O yes, Sir, that is the man"—I found the bag; we placed it on the bar parlour table, and it contained two sovereigns, twenty-two half-sovereigns, all wrapped in separate papers; eight crown pieces, nine half-crowns, thirteen florins, and sixty-seven shillings, in packages—these are them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, G</hi>). I went with Brannan and other officers to the prisoner's house—on the door being opened, I saw the prisoner—I went up stairs with other officers—while I was searching the second-floor landing, I heard a noise down stairs on the ground floor—I went down and saw Brannan scuffling with the prisoner—he told me she had a bag in the folds of her dress—I assisted him to try to get it, and she threw it on a shelf near the beer-engine—I then took her in custody and conveyed her to the bar-parlour—I had seen her push in a drawer with her elbow—it was a little open, and she closed it—I searched that drawer, and found in it a paper packet containing sixteen half-crowns, another packet with twenty shillings, all in one piece of paper, and another lot of nineteen shillings loose; and there was a piece of paper in the drawer which had apparently been round them—I have heard Brannan's evidence as to what the prisoner said; it is quite correct—I searched the bar-parlour and found three memorandum books—one is for rent received from, a lodger, named Westgate, and signed J. Hatton—there were some receipts for rent—I showed them to her—she said they were paid, and the brokers were put in on 29th August.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear her say that Burns had left the coun<lb></lb>terfeit coin there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am quite sure I did not hear anything of that—I have been looking after Burns in consequence of the statement the prisoner made to Brannan—I know that-the license of the house is granted to her father—I was present when it was granted.</p>

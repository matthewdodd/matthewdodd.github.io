            . I live in Bridewell Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. You have your table beer of Mr. Levasque; did you make any payment for beer on the 6th of October last - A. Yes, I paid it to the prisoner, he gave me that receipt for the ten shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. LEVASQUE. Q. Was the prisoner in your employ as <rs id="t18080406-91-deflabel519" type="occupation">drayman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18080406-91-defend873 t18080406-91-deflabel519"></join>, in October last - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to look at that receipt and tell me whether that is his handwriting - A. I have no doubt of it, (the receipt read.)</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner carried out beer on the dray, when he came home at night he was either to account with you for the beer or bringing the money A. By bringing the account where he left the beer, or by bringing the money; this is the book that we keep for the purpose; in this book there is an entry of beer delivered to Mr. Owen, not paid the book is all in his hand writing; when he comes home at night; that book is the account he renders.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that sum of ten shillings ever paid - A. No. On the 15th of March, I informed him of this charge; he at first denied it. I shewed him his book and the receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Has it not happened repeatedly in your business, the men have omitted to render the exact account, and on some future day has it not been rectified - A. Such a circumstance has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not happened with the prisoner that he has made a mistake with one customer for another; and on a subsequent day he has rectified that mistake - A. It has not been so in that case.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, sir; you must tell me upon your oath - A. He has done so.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had accounted with your partner, Mr. Paulin jun. that would have been an answer to your complaint, are your books here which contain the entry's of different payments, to this man that have been accounted - A. I have the books here.</p>
               <p>Q. In that book that young gentleman who has been examined he has made entry's of money paid as well as you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PAULIN, JUN. - Mr. Gurney. You have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060064"></xptr>looked at the entry in that book - A. Yes, the prisoner's book. He did not account any thing with me for that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. All that you can say according to your recollection; the man has not accounted to you - A No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They make a great many mistakes I can prove it clearly they have made mistakes in the book and have scratched it out themselves. Mr. Levasque has said he never saw books kept like these, for they was always scratching and altering them; if I did not pay Mr. Levasque, I paid Mr. Paulain, or Mr. Cook. Mr. Thompson in Giltspur street, it was down paid, they sent the bill in again and I could recollect forty places. I never kept a sixpence belonging to them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

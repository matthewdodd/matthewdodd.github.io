                  </hi>. I am a stock and bit maker, and live in Little Peter-street, Westminster. On the 16th of April, about one o'clock in the morning, I was walking down the Strand from Temple Bar—I got near to Somerset</p>

               <p>house, and turned into a night house, and got a drop of half-and-half—the prisoners joined me at the door, and asked if I would give them some half-and-half—I said I had no objection—they went in, and there was some cold beef there—they said they were hungry—I gave them some beef—we drank the beer, and then they said they were hungry, and I gave them more beef—when we got to the door they wanted me to go back to Temple Bar with them—I said, "No, I shall go home" got me into a court—I felt Neale's hand at my breast and about me—she went off, and I missed my watch, chain, and seal—I said to Smith, "I will not leave you till I have got my watch"—I said I would go back with her, and when we got to the corner of Star-court I said to her, "If you will let me have my watch again, I will give you all the money I have got"—she said, "What will you give me?"—I gave her half-a-crown, and she said I had got more—I then gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she agreed I should have the watch when she had got all the money I had, but she then turned restive, and would not give it me—I then gave her in charge—the policeman went with me to Star-court, and found Neale—he knocked at the door, and Neale came—I did not think it was her, but the policeman almost persuaded me to take her—he said if I took her, there would be nothing amiss at the station—immediately she was brought to the light, and had her "robes" on, I said, "That is the person," and she was taken to the station—the policeman searched for the watch, but never found it—I suppose I was with the prisoners half an hour before the watch was taken—I had not been out of the public-house two minutes when it was taken—Smith was in front of me at the time—they were both teasing me to go with them to Temple Bar—the watch was in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and my coat was open—I am certain I felt Neale's hand in my pocket, and the moment her hand was gone, I clapped my hand, and missed the watch—she and Smith had both hold of my coat—Neale was gone off—it was very dark, and I am very short-sighted—I do not think I could have caught her if I had run after her—Smith had acknowledged they were sisters, and I considered that if I kept one I should be doing right.</p>

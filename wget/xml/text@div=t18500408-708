                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of High-street, Poplar. On 11th March M'Donald came to my shop, between five and six o'clock in the evening, for half an ounce of tobacco—my lad served him, and he gave him a bad shilling—the lad called me to give change—there was no one but the lad and M'Donald there—I found the shilling was bad—I told M'Donald so—he said he had been on <hi rend="italic">tramp,</hi> and a man had given it to him—I sent for an officer, and he was taken to the station—I gave the shilling to the sergeant—I did not press the charge, and M'Donald was discharged—I saw him come out of the station, walk up the street, and in five minutes afterwards he joined the prisoner Sullivan—I had followed him beyond my house—when they got to Limehouse I called a policeman, and he took them—eleven sixpences and three shillings were found on Sullivan at the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 321.) On the night of the 28th of Nov., between twelve and one o'clock, I was on duty in Marl<lb></lb>borough-street, Greenwich—a person came by in a marine dress—I asked him how long he had belonged to the marines, seeing him so low in stature—he said, "These things don't belong to me, but to my brother"—a person came up, and said he was his brother, and he had put these things on him for a joke, and he struck me—he ran and I pursued him—while I was struggling with him on the ground the prisoner came up, and I found I had nine cuts in my great coat.</p>

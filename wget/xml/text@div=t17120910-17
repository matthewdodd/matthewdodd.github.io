                   was indicted for Aiding, Abetting, Comforting and Maintaining the said Johnson, alias Holloway in the said Murder
            </rs>. They were also both indicted upon the Coroner's Inquest for the same. It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner Holloway being a Convict in Newgate, for stealing the Lord Pierpoint's Horse, receiv'd the Benefit of Her Majesty's late gracious Pardon, upon condition of being Transported; but about five Weeks ago broke out of Newgate; and on the Day aforesaid, having the Confidence to come down to the Old Bailey, (where he was drinking within the Wall by the Hole) one of the Turnkeys went with a Constable and a Warrant from the Lord Chief Justice Parker, and telling him he must take him into Custody, he refus'd to surrender himself whereupon the Constable shew'd him his Authority, which he also refusing to obey, was seiz'd upon by one belonging to the Prison, with whom he struggl'd a pretty while 'till they both were down together, at which time a Pistol (which he had before in his Hand) was beat down upon the Ground. After a while he got up again, and had got his Pistol, and being still held fast by the Person who had seiz'd him, he was very strong and unruly; whereupon a Prisoner who was in the place, catch'd sold of one of his Arms; by which he was something master'd, and got in at the Door of the Hole, when the deceas'd Mr. Spurling, coming to help the others to get him quite in, he fir'd over the Shoulder of him who had seiz'd him, and then had him about the Middle, and shot the Deceased as is mentioned in the Indictment. The Evidence was very plain and full in all particulars. And as to the Woman, it was sworn, that she kick'd and beat the Person who first seiz'd him, and had him down, and us'd all violent means possible to procure his escape; and also, that when the Pistol was out of his Hand upon the Ground, she convey'd it to him again, and that was the very Pistol which kill'd the Deceased. They made no Defence to the purpose; and upon a full Hearing, were both found <rs id="t17120910-17-verdict66" type="verdictDescription">

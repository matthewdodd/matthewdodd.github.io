                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, King's Court, Minories, and am a tailor—at ten o'clock on the morning of 3rd October I saw Mr. Millard's truck in the Minories, containing some boxes of tea—I saw Smith behind the truck—Roberts was by the side of the truck, on the pavement, with his coat over his shoulder—Smith took the box of tea, Roberts throwing his coat over it—Roberts took it from Smith, carried it across the Minories, and laid it down on the pavement—Smith took it down Whitechapel—I fol<lb></lb>lowed, and gave him in charge of the police—I lost sight of Roberts—I did not see Roberts again until the officer told me he had him in custody—I then went and saw him in custody at the Mansion House, at the bar—I identified him—I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Elliott—he is a private in the 2nd Regiment of life Guards—I live in Edward-street, Regent's-park. On the 3rd of February, about eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, I was standing at the comer of Charles-street, Hampstead-road, look<lb></lb>ing at a show—I felt a hand in my pocket—I looked to see who was near me, and saw the prisoner—he moved his hand from my side—I laid hold of the tail of his coat, and felt in my pocket—I missed my purse, which contained four half-crowns, five shillings, and three sixpences—I told the prisoner he had taken my purse—he said he had not, and got from me, and ran—I called, "Stop thief"—he threw something away—I followed him till he was stopped—I came up to him, and said he had robbed me—he said he had not—I said, "Then you have thrown it away," and a little girl came up and said, "Here is the purse that man threw away"—he begged of me not to expose him to the crowd, and for God's sake to forgive him, as he had a wife and two children, and was distressed—he said he lived in the next street but one, and if I would go with him he would make me any recompense—I told him it was all I had in the world—I went with him to the street he had mentioned, and then he said he lived in the City-road—an officer then came up and took him—this is my purse.</p>

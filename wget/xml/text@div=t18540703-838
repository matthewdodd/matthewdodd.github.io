                  </hi>. I am a mail contractor. I contract largely with persons at Lowestoff and Yarmouth, to take fish which they send up to Billingsgate—I am responsible for any fish that may be lost in transit—Driver has been a carman in my employment twelve or fourteen years, on and off—on 16th June it was his duty to be at the Shoreditch station, to take a wagon load of mackerel from there to Billingsgate on my account—they were packed in baskets called pads, each containing about sixty fish—the pads were covered over with paper and straw, and the covers then tied down—I did not recollect Ivans at the Mansion-house, but I find he has been in our employ, and was discharged the week previous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Eastern Counties Railway Police. On 16th June, about 20 minutes to 5 o'clock in the morning, I received instructions, and saw Driver on a van with two horses, which was coming out of the terminus, loaded with packages of fish—he took up Ivans on the van, and then drove at a very rapid pace along Norton-folgate and Bishopsgate-street; there was nothing unusual in the pace—Ivans seated himself on the back of the load; I ran all the way, and saw him open several packages, and put what he took out into something which he had—he then shifted his position about on the top of the load, and continued opening the packages until he got into Houndsditch, when Driver putted up the horses by Aldgate church, and Ivans handed him a large bundle of something, which he put under the footboard; I afterwards found a sack there, which I believe to be what I saw—Ivans did not get down, but he moved on to the box and rode with Driver; he got down at the top of St. Dunstan's-hill, locked the wheel, and then went to the bottom of St. Dunstan's-hill; when the van got there, he took the chain off—I then saw him looking towards me, and I think, from his sudden disappearance, that he saw me, for he ran into the market—when the van stopped at the market, I went to the footboard, took a bundle from the driving-box, just behind the driver's feet, and found twenty-one mackerel in it, which were afterwards produced at the Mansion-house—I asked him how he came to have them there; he said he did not know; he knew nothing at all about it—I asked him where the boy was, who he had taken up; he said he had gone somewhere, he did not know where; that the boy threw a sack up on the load, at Shoreditch station, as soon as the van was loaded, and got up himself; and that he did not put the fish there, and he did not know who did—I took him into cus<lb></lb>tody—I took Ivans three days afterwards at his father's house, and told him</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear any conversation pass between the prisoners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was at some distance—I did not hear the boy say, "Will you take me up, and take me to Houndsditch?"—he might have said so without my hearing it—the van was loaded up perhaps two feet above the sides—Ivans was sitting behind; he was not concealed from the driver; he was on the top of the pads—I believe it to be a sack that he handed to Driver—I have seen numbers of vans go without having boys with them (<hi rend="italic">Mr. M'Namara here stated that it was usual for van drivers to have a boy with them</hi>)—Ivans got down and unlocked the wheel, and locked it again at the bottom of the hill—I cannot swear that he saw me, but he disappeared—he was then very close to the market—Driver drove the van into the market—when the boy was by the side of the driver, the bag was as much at his feet as at the drivers; it was in the centre, within an inch or two of each of them—the boy did not get off to hand the parcel to Driver—he worked himself to the top of the load—if he had said anything I could not have heard it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Eastern Counties Railway. I was with Gavin when Ivans was taken—on the way to the Bishopsgate-street station I walked with Ivans, and he said, "I was innocently drawn into the affair, as the carman gave me the sack, and told me to put the fish in it"—he also said that he had a good deal to say, and should speak the whole truth to the Court.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were here read, as follows:</hi> "Driver says, 'I am perfectly innocent of the affair that occurred; I was not aware of the transaction.' Ivans says, 'Last Friday I went to the Eastern Counties station, about half past 4 o'clock; I went up to the fore-man, named John Turner, and asked him if he could give me a job, and he said he had got enough men, and I was standing alongside this gentleman's (<hi rend="italic">Driver's</hi>) van, and his van was rather full behind; he asked me to help him load, and whilst I was doing so there was a mackerel half out, and I was knocking it in, and he said, "Don't pull it out you can get enough on the road;" I went down when it was loaded, and unlocked the wheel, and got up, and pulled out three mackerel; he then gave me a sack to put them in, and when I had got six in he said that was not enough; I put them in, but I do not know how many there was, and when I got up to St. Dunstan's-hill I got down and locked the wheel, and when I got to the bottom I unlocked the wheel, and tied the tail rope, and went away.'

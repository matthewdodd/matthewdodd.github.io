               <p>introduced to me by my son Edward, who is nineteen years of age—the prisoner said he was the proprietor of the Yarrow Steam-packet hotel, at Port Philip, that he had come from there to London to receive from 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when he had settled his business and received his money, he intended to take some young persons back with him to Port Philip, and to get situations for them, and as my son had been speaking to him about it, he asked roe whether I was agreeable for him to go—I said as he wished to go, and he had met with so respectable a person as I understood him to be, I was agreeable to trust him under his care—he said he would take him, get a situation for him, and be a father and a friend to him—we had three meetings—I do not know that he told me all this at the first meet<lb></lb>ing—he afterwards told me that he had agreed with the owner of a ship to take seven passengers, and the next time I saw him he said the ship was the <hi rend="italic">Pathfinder</hi>—he said he had paid a deposit on each passenger, and he was to pay 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the seven—I agreed to give 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my son, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the passage, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for extras—it was to be paid partly in goods—the prisoner said the goods would be of more service to him at Port Philip than the money, for he could make more than double on the goods there, than he could on the money—I made him several presents' to induce him to be<lb></lb>have well to my son—he said a great deal about the country, about its being a very prosperous place, and that my son could get a situation with-the out any trouble the moment he got there—I settled with him on Saturday, 9th of October, and the vessel left the Docks on the Monday week fol<lb></lb>lowing—we went to take the luggage to the docks, and found the vessel was gone to Gravesend—the prisoner, my son, and myself, went by the steamer to it—he did not mention what money he had paid—I thought every thing was all right with him and the ship's owners—I remained on board the ship for some time—I said nothing to the captain—I merely saw all my son's luggage placed on board, and then came on shore—I saw several boxes on board, belonging to the prisoner—he said nothing to me about them—the <hi rend="italic">Pathfinder</hi> sailed next afternoon—three weeks afterwards I went down to Plymouth, and there found my son, young Williams, and his wife, who was the prisoner's sister—I had known Williams some time—he introduced the prisoner to my ton—all their money was gone—I brought Williams's wife home, and kept her at my house for a long time, till I got her into the Union work-house, and she died a few days after—I heard no more of the prisoner until six weeks ago, when I received this letter from him, enclosed in one directed to young Williams—I know them to be his handwriting, and he acknowledged before the Lord Mayor that they were so—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. J.

Oh, that I could recall the past, and restore to you that peace of mind and comfort you enjoyed before the unfortunate circumstance occurred which caused my ruin and wretchedness to you. Believe me, John, sincerely, as there is an Almighty God in heaven to hear what I now say, that not in the least had I any intention of deceiving you or any one; bow it has all occurred, and the principal cause of my downfall, I should wish to prove</p>

               <p>to you if you would allow me to see and speak to you. Sincerely do I entreat your pardon, and that of your mother for what I have done, but believe me I am not so culpable as you imagine. I enclose a note to Mr. Marklew, if you will be kind enough, if I may ask such a thing, to deliver; and likewise permit me to see him, if he will consent, at your house; per<lb></lb>haps things may be better arranged by what I propose; still if not, I will then on to-morrow morning go to the Mansion-house, and then trust to Him above.

                  <hi rend="italic">Letter to Mr. Marklew.</hi>—"Wednesday morning. Sir,—You will no doubt feel much surprised at having a note from me, but I write to you with the hope that however culpable I may appear, yet on hearing some circumstances from me you will find I am not guilty. I have arrived in London with the sole purpose of letting justice prove the truth; and though I would fain the matter might be settled if possible in a different way, yet should you not be enabled to listen to what I can say in palliation of what has occurred, I am determined to abide by the laws of the country. Allow me to say, Mr. Marklew, that you are indeed very much mistaken in supposing I am the villain stated in the public papers. I can prove, I trust, to your satisfaction, if you would hear me coolly and dispassionately, that no intention ever existed in my mind of injuring any one party. 1 could also prove, if matters were now settled peaceably, how much better it would be for all parties concerned. This I can do if you would con<lb></lb>sent to meet me alone at seven o'clock this evening at Mr. Williams's. I have many persons to prove the truth of what I might say to you, and all I ask of you is to hear me first; all may yet be able to go well without loss to any one; and such is my earnest wish that it may. Should you refuse to see me, I can only add, the thing must take its course, and no benefit to any one will then ensue; acceding to my request of conversing together for a short time may prove of mutual advantage. I must again state that you are very much deceived in judging me as you do. I enclose this in a similar note to Mr. Williams, begging him to be kind enough to present it to you, and all I entreat of you is, to beg you will hear me.—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">continued.</hi> I found the prisoner at William's mother's, and apprehended him—he made me several offers not to prosecute—he said he had not had much more than a fourth part of the articles, and I should have them, and he would make up all the money if I would not prosecute—I have found part of the property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. I was intro<lb></lb>duced to the prisoner by Williams.

               <p>not meet us at Plymouth—we went on shore there to the Royal Hotel as he had directed us, and stopped there two days, but he not coming, we went on board again on the Friday, when we were informed that only 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid as a deposit for our passage, and if he was not forth<lb></lb>coming with the rest, 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, we could not be allowed to remain on board—they would not allow us to remain—I received a letter from the pro<lb></lb>prisoner of the Royal Hotel and went back there—Williams and his wife went to the Brunswick Inn—my father came down on the Wednesday evening—I was put to great inconvenience, and was in a state of distress, disappointment, and anxiety—when we found the prisoner was not forth<lb></lb>coming the captain took on himself, in our presence, to break open hit boxes to see if there was anything in them worth the passage-money—the two first boxes contained a little wearing apparel, but nothing like the quantity which ought to have been in them—the third contained old colo<lb></lb>nial papers, log-books, and some wood, bone, and iron, not worth a penny to us, and more especially if we had taken them to Australia—they were not worth anything either in Port Phillip or anywhere else—when the pri<lb></lb>soner left us he said, "Take care of that box, for in it is all my hopes."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I was present at the prisoner's examin<lb></lb>ation at the Mansion-house—I do not think what he said was taken down—I stated there, in his hearing, that he had told me he came over here to receive 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he kept the Yarrow Steam Packet Hotel at port philip—the prisoner replied, "it is false," and called me a false perjured villain for stating that he had ever said any thing about the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for he never had stated such a thing, and that I should suffer for it on my death bed—he said he never was the proprietor of the Yarrow Steam packet Hotel, and he had never stated to me that he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I stated that I was never the proprietor, but that I kept the hotel. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He said he never was the proprietor, but he was always there to manage the business—I am sure he did tell me that he was the proprietor in the first instance—it was on Saturday, the 9th of october, that I gave him the goods and money and it was on that day that he told me he had paid the deposit.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner read a long defence in which he stated that he had been en<lb></lb>gaged by the agents of the ship in which he first left England to manage the hotel at Port Philip—that his health obliging him to return to England, he with their consent transferred his licence to another party, who agreed to take the house at the rent of 700l. per annum, and he came over with the money he had obtained, intending to take back his poor relations to settle at Port Philip, where he had sufficient influence to procure them good situations. He denied ever representing to any one that he had to receive 700l. or 800l., or that Mr. Marklew gave him the money and goods stated. He declared that he had no fraudulent intention, but that being unable to obtain sufficient money to pay the remainder of the passage-money for which he had become security he was induced to leave the vessel with his wife, and proceed to Caen, in Normandy, where his step-father resided, in hopes of procuring it from him, but without success, and that his return to England was prevented by a severe attack of illness; had his intentions been not to have gone with the vessel, he should not have paid any deposit to the owners, nor have gone to any expense in fitting up the vessel for the accommodation of the passengers; that the contents of his trunks were not rubbish, but of much greater value and importance than was stated; he produced several papers, the inspection of which, he said, would corroborate the truth of his statement.</hi>)</p>

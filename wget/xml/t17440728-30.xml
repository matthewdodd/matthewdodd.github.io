             and I were going down Holbourn, and offered the things to the Prisoner to sell. Smytheman and my husband asked him to buy a knife, the things were done up in 4 parcels - There was a razor, and I believe 5 or 6 pair of white metal buckles; I don't believe there were more, and some other odd things; they were done up in a bit of a rag.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they new things?</p>
               <p>Haycraft. They were rusty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to have been used?</p>
               <p>Haycraft. Yes, they had been cleaned up several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your companions in ragged cloths?</p>
               <p>Haycraft. Yes - he said he did not care to buy such things, for he always bought them wholesale.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to buy them at last?</p>
               <p>Haycraft. They egged him on, so that they would force him to buy them, and he was willing to buy a bargain if he could, for he might as well buy them as another.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was your husband?</p>
               <p>Haycraft. He was a Chimney-sweeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in a Chimney-sweeper's habit then?</p>
               <p>Haycraft. Yes - Smytheman was in a Chimney-sweeper's habit.</p>
               <p>Council. I understand at first he was unwilling to buy these goods; did not he ask them how they came by them?</p>
               <p>Haycraft. Yes; and Smytheman said he had them of an acquaintance of his - he did not say how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he got them from a workman in that way?</p>
               <p>Haycraft. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought these goods of them in a publick house in a publick company, and after I had bought them, put them into my show-glass directly - it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Haycraft. We went to his shop first, and then to an alehouse and had a pot of beer.</p>

On the 19th of February I missed eight pigs out of the back part of my premises; on the Saturday following the constable came and said there were some pigs lay dead in a stable in Caroline Court, Saffron Hill, and desired me to come and look at them. I went; there were four of them; they were stuck. I went down and looked at them, and swore to them by the marks and colour, it was a particular mark that they had wrung in their nose. I never had any other pigs with such a mark.</p>

               <p>I and the two prisoners, Edwards and Dockham, were the persons concerned in stealing these pigs: we were at a loss when we got them where to put them; we met Hodge, who said he would help us to a place to put them in, and went with us, and we put them in a stable in Caroline Court. On Friday Hodge told us he could help us to a customer for some of the pigs; he said, his brother would buy two or three of them; and we hired an ass of one Fennell to carry two of them to Hodge's brother, two of them were killed in the stable, and removed to Boiling-Alley, and the next day were removed to Hodge's house, in Crown Court, Grubb Street. Hodge had part of the two guineas: he received of his brother for the two pigs, and helped in carrying the others; the pigs that were owned by Mr. Sebbon were never at Hodge's, they were in the stable.</p>

               <p>I have a stable in Caroline Court: I came to the stable on Wednesday morning, and found eight pigs in it. I asked a man who has part of the stable with me, how they came there: he said, Edwards, Williams, Dockham and Hodge brought them there over night. I went to seek after them: I found Williams and Dockham in Smithfield, and told them to come and take the pigs away, or I would turn them out of the stable; they all four came down after me, when I went to the stable; I saw Hodge and Edwards with a sack and an axe, and I told them they had no occasion to bring them there, for nothing should be done to them in my stable; then Dockham and Edwards turned them into the next stable, and they all went in after them: that is the stable where the four pigs were found afterwards; they wanted to hire my ass; I would not lend it them; they hired Fennell's ass.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you first learn the bill was a forgery? A. I think on the 12th or 13th of May - I know that a bill of exchange is not negotiable without an indorsement - I put it into Mr. Williams's hands to try to get the money, but I received nothing for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Long after you had ascertained that this was a forgery, did you not take from the prisoner a written agreement to return the public-house, and fixtures, and all the property you had sold him? A. No, I did not; Mr. Handley took it for me; he is a gentleman, who did live at the Hope, and now he lodges at my house - I know Mr. William Pinks, I don't know that he is rich, they told me he was godfather to the prisoner - I don't know when I went to Mr. Pinks to try to get the money, it might be a week afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. When you sent Mr. Handley to get re-possession, did you not engage to hold the prisoner harmless? A. I cannot charge my memory; I did not propose it; I caused it to be proposed, and he entered into a written agreement, but I never said it was because I thought I could get the money of old Pinks; I had received the 30l. of him in cash at first, but I should have been no great gainer if I had had the rent and taxes to pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not afterwards fly from that agreement, and say you would not do it? A. It was proposed to Mr. Usher, and I would not accept it, because I understood he had given a cognovit to pay so much a week to somebody.</p>
               <p>Q. If you found out in May that the bill was a forgery, please to give the jury some honest reason why you put it off till September? A. He promised he would pay me if I would not proceed, I said if he would pay me the 40l. I would forgive him the 30l. - I went once to Mr. Pink with Usher, and Usher asked him if he would assist Holloway- I told him it was a forgery, and if he could not settle the bill, he must take the course of the law - I don't know that I told him I would prosecute Holloway, but I think I said if he would pay I would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to Holloway, after you had ascertained that the bill was a forgery, and after you had agreed to take back all the property, and sacked the 30l. which he had paid - did you not say that you could not make up your mind to do it, because you had lost your wife in the house? A. I might have done so, I would not swear that I did not; I don't recollect it; I have said so to other persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not afterwards propose that he should execute a bill of sale to Usher of all the property, and that Usher, whose name was forged, should befriend him in consequence of it? A. It was proposed in the presence of Usher and me, but I would not accept of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the condition that the man should deliver up all the property in the public house, to be followed by giving up the bill of exchange? and after having bound him by an agreement in writing, and led him to expect that you would deliver up the bill you are now prosecuting him for it? A. Certainly, I should be very happy to get the money.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of July did you go to the prisoner's wife in his absence, and ask her if old Pinks could be induced to make up this bill? A. I don't know that I used the word "Old Pinks," I might have said, Mr. Pinks, but I don't recollect it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you satisfy us, why you, who knew this bill was forged in May, should now appear to prosecute in September? A. From an impression that he would furnish means to take the bill out of my hands - if he had paid it, I would not have prosecuted him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I live upon my means - I did keep the Hope Tavern - I took the agreement to the prisoner for him to sign it, to give up the house to Mr. Dring again - I will not swear whether it was Mr. Dring's writing or mine - I cannot call to mind whether the condition was that if the prisoner signed it the bill should be given up - I took it and I think the prisoner signed it, and I think it stated that if he gave up the house, the bill should be given up - I don't know what I did with the agreement - Mr. Dring would not agree to it.</p>

I cannot say the sum, it was never uttered - it was destroyed in my presence by the prisoner - I never gave an acceptance in blank - I took a bill of sale of the prisoner, of all the things in the public-house, because I lent him 55l., and had to pay 30l., which I was bound for him to the distiller - I did not tell the prisoner if he would give me a bill of sale I would befriend him - I did not know, but that he had paid Mr. Dring - I took the bill of sale about the 26th or 27th of May - I have sold the property - I went to old Pinks with Mr. Dring to speak to him because I understood he was a friend to the prisoner; I did not ask Pinks for the money - I cannot recollect going to the prisoner's wife when he was not at home.</p>

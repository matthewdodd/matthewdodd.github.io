               <p>Q. What was it worth?</p>
               <p>Maidman. But a mare trifle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it worth a shilling?</p>
               <p>Maidman. It is valued at twelve shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Really and truely was she worth above a shilling?</p>
               <p>Maidman. I would not take a hundred for it. I was told on Wednesday my mare was gone: I went to Hockley-in-the-Hole, to one Mincher's who keeps a dog house, and buys horses to kill, and left a description of the mare, and desired him if it was brought there to stop it; that was the same morning I lost it; in about an hour after Mincher and his master came to me; I was not at home; I went there and saw the prisoner and the mare. Before I saw the mare the constable asked me if I should know it; I said yes, and described the marks beside her ear: she had a running like an evil, had been blooded and it had festered, and one of her legs behind had a tread of another horse and was lame. I secured the prisoner.</p>

            . The prosecutor came about half after five in the morning, and desired if his mare was brought to stop it; he had not been gone above half an hour before the prisoner brought the grey mare; he asked 15 s. for it; I agreed to give him half a guinea; I told him to stay while I got change for a guinea; I went out and got a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Scott, of Clerkenwell—he is infirm, and not able to attend to business—the prisoner had been in my service nearly four years—on 24th Jan., my attention was called to a ring by a lad named Popkins, who is in my service—I confined myself at home that day, watching the boy, fearing he had misinformed me—in the evening, after the prisoner and the other men had left, the boy remained, and I went in the shop, and found the ring where the boy had told me, hanging by the side of a bench, in a secret place, where it had no right to be—the prisoner worked in that shop, and could work at both the benches—I took the ring out, marked it with a file, and replaced it where it was—this is it—it is my husband's—I never gave the prisoner permission to take it off the premises—it was the prisoner's duty to pack clock cases, and to carry them out—on the 24th I directed him to take some, with two spring dial cases to Mr. Schwabe's in the London-road—they were in the shop from which he would have to take them—I went in before he began packing, to look at the goods—when he had got them packed, I went into the shop as he was tying the basket down, and I ordered him to take out two frames, which were to go to another customer—I said, "They are not to go till to-morrow, when I have more goods to send"—he took them out—I did not count the goods in the basket—this is one of the nine inch frames—I have marked it since—it has been given me by the policeman since—I know it to be my husband's—it is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the ring about 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner had no right to have more than one dozen frames.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nephew to the prisoner. I was working at Mr. Scott's with my uncle—I made a communication to Mrs. Scott on the Wednesday, about a ring—I found that ring placed by the side of the bench—it could not be seen there—that was not the proper place for it—I had not put it there, or seen any one put it there—it was a ring like this—I was in</p>

               <p>the shop on the following day, when my uncle packed up the basket—I then saw the ring on the shelf—it had been removed—there were frames on the bottom shelves—the ring was on the top shelf, it could not be so well seen there—I did not see him put the ring into the basket—if it was in, I do not know how it got there—I looked at the place after he had gone out, and it was gone—I had seen it there in the morning, and my uncle went out with the basket between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I gave him about half of the frames to put in—he was to put in a dozen of nine-inch frames—I do not know anything about his putting in thirteen—it was not done with my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was the basket packed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At night, just before it went out—it was packed with hay—I helped to pack it—my uncle brought it out to be packed—it was not in the shop all day—I had seen it down stairs before it was packed—I bad been in and out all day—Mrs. Scott threatened to flog me—I was to be flogged if I did not tell her all about this—the said she would give me a new suit of clothes—that was at the time she threatened to flog me—I have been flogged for telling stories before—my mother has charged me with stealing, three or four times—I have been whipped for that.</p>

On Thursday an application was made to our office, and I and Jenkinson were on the watch outside the prosecutor's house—between six and seven o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner come out with a basket—he was alone—I followed him, and asked what he had got in the basket—he said some goods he was going to take of over the water for his master—I said, "Have you any more in your basket than what your master sent you with?"—he said, "Certainly not"—I then took him into custody, and told him he was charged with stealing two clock-frames—I searched his basket at the station—it was a deep one—the things were packed with hay—I found this ring completely at the bottom—the other articles were clock-frames—I said to Mrs. Scott, "Does this belong to you?" she said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "I am completely <hi rend="italic">stunned,</hi> "or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—I did not count the frames at that time—the basket was kept in the station all night.</p>

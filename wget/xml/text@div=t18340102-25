            . I had occasion to remove some property last November - I employed the prisoner to take five trunks, containing clothes and linen, from No. 238, Oxford-street, to my solicitor, Mr. Gibbs, No. 42, Jermyn-street - I don't remember on what day it was - I went to Mr. Gibbs' in the evening, but they had not been taken there - when I saw the prisoner he said they were taken to Mr. Gibbs - he then said they were at Mr. Fisher's, in Park-lane - he then said they were in Fleet-street, in the City, and somebody had laid an attachment upon them - I did not go to any of these places, because he afterwards told me that they were at Oxford-street, that the weather had been so bad he could not take them away - when I took him into custody he said, "For God's sake don't do anything against me: I am a married man, and I am willing to give them up" - that they were in King-street, somewhere by Grosvenor-street - the officer found them there and took them away - I took the prisoner into custody - I got him through Piccadilly, and by Hyde Park he leaped over the bars, and ran away as hard as he could - I cried, "Stop thief," and a countryman stopped him - the prisoner said, "It is all a joke," but another man stopped him, and the officer took him - I have received the property, one of the trunks is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known this man? A. I had known him before on the Continent for a short time - I had only met him two days before this in London - I had not been intimate with him - I employed him to remove my goods, as I had no servant but a man who minded my horse, and a girl - I had lent the prisoner 4l. or 5l. before - I am not in his debt, upon my oath - I gave the landlord a written notice to quit, and I sent 13l. odd shillings by the prisoner to pay the rent, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020016"></xptr>he paid - I did not go with him to pay the rent, because the prisoner frightened me from one place to another, and got me arrested for a debt, because he instigated a person against me - he did not arrest me; Mr. Clarke, a tailor, arrested me for a bill of my own, which was not due- I don't recollect the amount of the bill - I accepted it about four months ago, it was for 32l., it had about two months longer to run - I state that the prisoner instigated a man to arrest me, because through him they only could know my residence - I kept my lodging private on account of the bill, which was not due - I owe other debts in London - I was keeping out of the way of my creditors, because the prisoner frightened me; he said, "For God's sake leave your lodging, there are sheriff's officer's after you," and that was the only reason because he drove me away, and it was only to get my luggage into his hands - I have no ill will towards the prisoner, nor no anger against him - I was angry when he got my clothes, but I have got them back, and I don't care - I am angry that he went to my creditors; no one knew where I lived but the people at my lodging and the prisoner - I had been at Dover and round Kent since May, but I came to London about July - I had only been in one lodging and the hotel - I had only kept my lodging secret for two days - I can't tell how many persons the prisoner went to - I have two or three creditors - I don't know how many creditors I have - the prisoner said I should have my trunks again, but he had a claim on them, and when I paid him what was due, 17s. 6d., I should have them; but he was in my debt 4l. or 5l. - he had had money of me; and the day he took my trunks I gave him money - I had not given bills for all my debts - I gave the prisoner a sovereign when I was in a cab in the Park - I have been to law respecting my wife's property; she is an English lady - the prisoner met me and my lady in Park-street; he told me the luggage was gone to Mr. Gibbs, and, if I looked sharp, I should catch it; but the luggage was not there - I can't say what situation the prisoner was in; he borrowed money at different times of me in London, about four days before he removed the goods; I can't recollect exactly the time - I gave him 4l. or 5l. - I presume if he borrowed money he was not in a very glorious state - he was nothing when he was on the Continent - I don't know how he got his living; he was not a companion of mine; he did not pass as a gentleman, quite different - I gave him a dinner, in London, at my table and my lady's; he was at first respectable on the Continent, but not so afterwards; and when I met him in London he said he was in difficulty, and had not much money; I said,"If you want a dinner, you may come to me," so he came; he dined with me once or twice - I took the prisoner when I was in a cab in Park-street - I took him into the cab - I said, "Come in, don't make any row" - I said, "For God's sake come in;" and when he got in he wanted to get out, and I took him by the arm in the cab; my lady was sitting there; when he was before the magistrate he made a claim on me of 17s. 6d.; he did not claim 5l. 18s. 6d. - I had never been in England before this - he did not tell me if I had anything against him to give him in charge.</p>

               <p>MR. DOANE. Q.When you took him into the cab it was to prevent his escaping? A. Yes: he did not say a syllable about this claim of 17s. 6d. before he was in custody, and he had before that given me the different accounts of where the things were - I did not owe him this 17s. 6d., on the contrary, he owed me money - Mr. Clark's bill was not due, and had not been presented - I paid it when it was presented, and 10l. more - it was by the prisoner's representation that I kept away from my lodging.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you swear that to the best of your belief nobody but the prisoner and your wife knew where you were? A. Yes: the prisoner said it was not safe that I should stop longer in my lodging - I had not employed the prisoner in any other transaction in London - he borrowed 5l. of me - I had not had any intimacy with him abroad.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You have most grossly perjured yourself: was it not agreed between you and I that the goods should be removed to Grosvenor-square in my name? Witness. No: Mr. Cobbett did not know my lodging - I gave you £4 or £5 at different times out of charity to you and your wife - you were not on the Continent on my father's business - you did not always dine with him - you were not detained in town on my business, seeking a lodging for me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square - prisoner was brought to the office - I found the property at No. 2, King-street, Park-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not tell you where they were? A. Yes: he was locked up for re-examination - I went to him and asked him where they were, and he told me without hesitation.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS called</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. I am landlord of the house No. 238, Oxford-street, where the Count lodged - I have an order in the Count's handwriting for the delivery of the goods.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not state to you that they were only going to Park-street? A. No: I did not know where they were going - the address of the witness is to this order - I delivered the goods to you, and you paid the rent - you slept there one night, but I believe that was after the Count was gone - Mr. Cobbett had a bed-room there which the Count paid for - I think the Count meant that Mr. Cobbett did not know where he lodged during the two days he was away from my house - when he lodged at my house he was known, and tradesmen were coming to him continually.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the Count attempt to conceal himself? A.No: I received a large sum of money from him, and I knew he had sufficient property.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Was the prisoner in the habit of dining there? A. He came backwards and forwards several times, and might have taken dinner with them.</p>
               <p>COURT to the Prosecutor. Q.You say, nobody knew where you were; did you allude to those two days? A. Yes; I was at the Elephant and Castle; when I was in Oxford-street, every one knew where I was.</p>

            . I went with the prisoner to witness the delivery of the goods from Mr. William, they were taken to my father's at No. 2, King-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.What did I say to you? A.He said the things did not belong to him, but to a Count, who owed him a little money, and he felt himself justified in detaining the things until such time as the money was paid.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What are you? A. A servant; I have been out of place about nine months.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his defence stated, that he had been put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020017"></xptr>to considerable expense in travelling and hiring lodgings in London, while he was engaged in going to different solicitors and tradesmen on the prosecutor's business, which had left a balance in his favour of 5l. 18s. 6d.; and that he had detained the property till he had an opportunity of seeing his solicitor, as he had lost money by the prosecutor's father, and he knew that if he had given up this property he should not have received a farthing; in the mean time the magistrate, (before whom he had voluntarily surrendered,) decided against him - he had stated without hesitation where the goods were, and there they were found; and if he had done wrong in detaining them, it was from an error in judgment, but with no criminal intention - he had told Mr. Ford that he only wanted the room for a day or two, and he had told the carman the goods were to go the next day to Jermyn-street; and that the prosecutor had told him to keep them till the next morning, and take them away by day-light, as it rained so fast he could not take them that day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; I told you whether it rained or not to take away my luggage, that I might not begin a fresh week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I live on a small annuity, derived from my wife, about sixty guineas a year - I went to the Continent purposely on business for the Count's father, and was with him three months at Antwerp.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My father is at Paris, the prisoner could not live with him, that I will swear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What was the value of the property in your trunks? A.About £300 - the prisoner knew what was in them.</p>

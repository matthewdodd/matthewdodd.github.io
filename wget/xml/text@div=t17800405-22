               <p>How do you know you left it on the board? - I remember putting it on the board while I took the papers; I left the bag on the board and went about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards and then' bethought myself where I had left it.</p>

               <p>Was there no-body attending at the place for the papers but you at the time? - No; there was one man went away before me; there were two of us there together; but he was served and went away before I took my money out.</p>

               <p>Was the bag ever found again? - I found it in the prisoner's pocket at another office.

               <p>Was the bag you found in the prisoner's pocket, the bag you carried your money in? - Yes. (The bag was produced by the constable). That is my bag; there was a hole in it; and I got a needle and thread and mended it myself.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I was sent for to the Green Dragon to take charge of the prisoner. I searched him, after a deal of trouble, and found the bag in his pocket, he was very turbulent. He said; he would not be searched, and that if any body searched him he would swear a robbery against them. I got three or four men to hold him, and then I searched him by force; he had the bag in his hand in his pocket. I wrenched it out of his hand. I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Was any thing in the bag then? - Nothing at all; when I had got the bag, he laid himself almost on the ground and would not submit to be searched any further; the room was full of news-people. I thought, if I took him to the Compter he would be more submissive. I took him and searched him, and found two guineas and a half in gold, and about forty shillings in silver, and a quantity of half-pence, upon him; when I turned the money out, Farmer, the father, pitched upon one sixpence, which he said he could swear to.</p>

            . When I took the bag out of his pocket he asked to look at it, and snatched it out of my hand and said, he had it before; that it was his. When I knew he had the bag I would not leave him; I followed him as far as the Green Dragon in Fleet-street, before I could get a constable.</p>
               <p>How far is the office, where you left the bag, from the office where you found the prisoner? - The one is in Paternoster-row, the other opposite St. Dunstan's church, Fleet-street.</p>

               <p>What was the amount of your money in the bag? - Seven guineas, two half-guineas, and about ten or eleven shillings. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050038"></xptr>prisoner owned before Mr. Alderman Wooldridge at Guildhall, that he had paid away six guineas to a man in the time I was pursuing him from one office to the other; and that the man was gone into the country.</p>

               <p>Do you know the bag? - Yes; he told me his sister was not in the way on Sunday, and that he mended it himself.</p>
               <p>What pieces did the money consist of? - Seven guineas, two half-guineas, and ten or eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>You could not know any part of the money? - No; only one sixpence which was very black. I took it of a gentleman for a book. I disputed it. He said it was a very good one, it had only been among some gunpowder. I rubbed it in some sand, and saw it was silver.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing you could know that sixpence by? - Its being black.</p>
               <p>It does not appear to be blacker than any other? - It may be wore off a little.</p>
               <p>Nothing else? - There was a scratch or a crack upon it. I was present at the prisoner's examination; he owned before Mr. Alderman Wooldridge that he had paid away six guineas to a man, who, he said, was gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Where did he say he got the bag? - At this office.</p>
               <p>Did he acknowledge taking the bag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What words did he use? - He owned having the bag and the money; he was asked what he had done with the money? He, said he had paid away six guineas of it.</p>
               <p>To Penn. Was you present at his examination? - Yes. He said he found the bag at the door. The alderman interrogated him; he then denied it. The alderman asked if there was any money in it? He acknowledged that the money was in it; that he paid away six guineas to a man who was gone into the country. The alderman asked what the man's name was? He said, it was no matter what his name was, he was gone into the country. The alderman insisted upon his telling him his name, he then said, he did not know his name himself.</p>

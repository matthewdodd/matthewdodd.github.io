                  </hi>. In the afternoon of the 22nd of Jnne I was at a beer<lb></lb>shop in Bishopsgate-street. I observed the prisoner in company with the prosecutor—they were sitting together on a form, in front of the bar—I saw the prisoner kiss the prosecutor, and put her hand on his person, in a very unseemly manner, and with her right hand draw a paper ont of his left-hand pocket—I then told the landlord—she opened the paper, and took out a shilling, and gave it to the landlord to pay for some ale, and some bread and cheese—he looked at the shilling very minutely, and the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "It is all right; I have just made it"—she said the man was her father—I said, unless she returned the money I would fetch a police<lb></lb>man—she abused me—I left her in custody of the landlord, and four other gentlemen, and fetched a policeman, who found the brown-paper parcel in her left hand, after a considerable resistance—she tried to kick and fight him—he found in it one sovereign, two shillings, two penny-pieces, and four halfpence.</p>

I was called in by Jinks—the prisoner was standing by the side of the prosecutor—I asked him if he had lost any money—he said he did not know—I asked what he had got in his pocket—he said 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he tried to put his hand into his pocket, and his left-hand pocket was turned inside out—I asked the prisoner what she had got—she said it was no business of mine—I took this paper from her, and found one sovereign, two shillings, two penny-pieces, sod four halfpence in it—she made a great struggle, and called me very bad names.</p>

On the 26th of May, between five and six o'clock, I was at the King's Head public-house, at Stratford, and saw William Rudd there—I did not know him before—the prisoner came in after him, and a pot of beer was handed round to her twice—she then went and sat by the side of Rudd—they went to the bar and had two glasses of gin-and-water—I saw Rudd pull out half a crown to pay for some beer, but I saw no gold—they had two more glasses of gin and water, and then the pri<lb></lb>soner put her right arm round Mr. Rudd's neck, and her left hand into his left-side waistcoat pocket—when she pulled it out it was closed—she pulled her clothes up, felt in her pocket, and then she <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> two half-pints of rum—she then said she must go, and went away directly—after she was gone Rudd made a complaint and went for the constable—he was not sober.</p>

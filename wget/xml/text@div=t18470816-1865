                  </hi> I am assistant to William Kenyon Bateman, fish<lb></lb>salesman, of Love-lane, Billingsgate—the prisoner was in his service—in cones<lb></lb>quence of information I watched—there were baskets there, with salmon in them—I saw the prisoner watching for about an hour—he then came, took two baskets, and took them into the Rose and Crown public-house, close by—I followed, and asked what he had got there—he said, "Nothing"—I took the top of the baskets off, and found two fish—I said, "Where did you get these, George?"—he turned to a man standing by him, and said they belonged to him—that man said nothing—I stood by the door; when the man went out, I said, "You had better stop and take your fish"—he said, in the prisoner's presence, "They do not belong to me"—I referred to the prisoner, and said, "Do they, George?"—he said, "No, they belong to me"—he did not say at the time how come by them, but afterwards said he bought them—I gave him in charge—I did not search him—on returning from the station we searched the place, and found three other fish in a basket—they had no business there, they ought to have been in the salmon-box—he had no authority to take them.</p>

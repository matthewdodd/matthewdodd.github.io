                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker of John-street, Am well-street—on a Saturday night, at the end Of March, between half-past 11 and 12 o'clock, as I was passing along, the prisoner and two others stood by the side of the kerb—the prisoner, who was the nearest to the kerb, hit me on the back of my head with his fist—I turned round to ask him-what he had done that for—he put his hands up, <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> back, and I made <hi rend="italic">grasp</hi> at him, to get hold of him, but one of them took me up by the back of my trousers, and I was thrown down—while I was down the prisoner was in front of me, and I felt his hand in my left-hand trousers pocket—he had then come for-ward in front of me, while the other men threw me down—they all made off, and I missed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of that pocket, which was all the money I had—it was safe hardly a minute before, I had only been next door to get some beer for my supper, and was going home—I went up Crown-court into Chapel-street, and saw the prisoner leaning with his hand against a lamp post—he saw me, put his hands to his face, and tried to <hi rend="italic">slear</hi> away—I said, "You are the person I want, and the person I will have"—he bolted away, and I after him, hallooing, "Stop thief!"—two men stopped him—I collared him with my right hand, with my thumb outside, and he sent his teeth right to the bone of my thumb, kicked me on the legs, and I have got a scar now—I have been laid up ever since—here is my certificate from the hospital—I gave him in custody—I saw his face close to the lamp-post—I am certain he is the man—my money was a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, two shillings, and a sixpence.</p>

            , at his house at Theale, aforesaid, until this deponent had an opportunity of disposing of the same. And this deponent further saith, that the reason of this deponent's not attending personally before the Magistrates at the Town Hall of Reading, to claim his property, and make out his legal right thereto, was, and it is inconvenient to this deponent to leave London, where his attendance at this period is particularly essential to his interest, and would also be attended with an expence which he is unable to bear, and is at the present time a considerable loser by the detention of his said property.</p>

               <p>MR. MALTBY. I have compared the account in the schedule; most of them tally with what I lost - they are cut about the lengths I should sell them in my shop. I have every thing entered that is sold, and appoint a young man to receive the money. I have not taken stock for twelve months. The prisoner sent me a pair of scissars which he used to trim the lamps with, and said he should not be able to return so soon, and I must look out for another porter. When he left in December, he said his father was ill; and in January, he said he was dead. I do not think the trunk which contains the property was ever in my house. The shop is part of the dwelling-house; I sleep there only - it belongs to the firm.</p>

On the 16th of April the prisoner came to my shop—he said he had come from one of her Majesty's steam-boats, that he had not long arrived, and he was going on the following day to the Admiralty to receive his wages—he said he wanted lodging and assistance, and knowing me he came to me—I had known</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the Grove Farm, Kentish-town, for my father—about half-past 2 o'clock on 1st January, my attention was called, by a maid servant, to one of the stacks in my father's yard—I ran to the spot, and found it on fire, on the side farthest from the house—there were two more stacks in front of it—the thatch of the stack caught—there was not much of the stack itself actually burnt—about two loads were destroyed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 100). On 1st January, about 2 o'clock, I was on duty in the Kentish-town-road, and saw one of Mr. Jelly's ricks on fire—in consequence of information, I stopped the prisoner—I said I believed he was the man that set fire to the stack—he said, "Yes; I did it through want."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). I have been for six years employed in Her Majesty's dockyards, Portsmouth and Woolwich, but marrying young, and having a sickly wife, I was unable to save but little of my earnings; so, when the Admiralty came to discharge so many of us, it found me with a wife and two children dying. I buried them, and endeavoured to get em<lb></lb>ployment, but could not. I applied to the parish; they gave me stone-breaking. I earned eightpence in four days, and was then obliged to give it up, my hands being so bad. Hearing that my mother's brother had a farm at Highgate, I came to find him out. I went into this field, where the hay<lb></lb>stacks belonging to the prosecutor were standing, for a necessary purpose. After that, I was lighting my pipe, when the stack caught fire. I was frightened, and ran away. I pray you to have mercy on me; I have three small children, and no one but the parish to see to them when I am gone.</p>

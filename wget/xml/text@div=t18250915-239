On the 8th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went down stairs. I shut my room door, but did not lock it. The clock hung by the side of the fire place. I came up in about ten minutes, and found the door open, and the prisoner in the room with the clock in his hand. I said "My God, what are you doing;" he said "I beg your pardon;" he put the clock down on the table, and ran away, but was brought back to me in a quarter of an hour - he had cut the weights off the clock.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in the next room to Wood. On the 8th of September, I heard four knocks at his door, but no one answered. In a few minutes I heard a person cry "Stop thief! I then ran out, and passed Mrs. Wood in the passage - the street-door was banged to. I went out, and pursued the prisoner to Baldwin's-gardens, but did not see him till he was stopped; he was asked if he he had been in the house - he said Yes, and he wanted to know where Mrs. Wood's sister lived.</p>

I went up and knocked at her door. I saw a woman come out, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150090"></xptr>I went in and staid in the room. When Mrs. Wood came up, she accused me of having stolen the clock; I said I had not, but I would fetch the woman who I thought had taken it down. I ran down after her and was taken myself.</p>

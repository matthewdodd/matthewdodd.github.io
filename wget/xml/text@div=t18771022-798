I examined this wall—it is seven feet high—there were marks where a person had got over—there is a closet at the back of a public-house which joins a window, one of the panes of which was broken, and the sash was hanging by the cord—it is an empty beerhouse—I went upstairs and saw two small ladders, one on the ceiling and one on the roof—I got on the roof and saw that some person had gone over several tiles and slid down—the outer skylight had been taken off and the inner one broken, and a trap-door in the ceiling removed, so that access could be got to the landing.</p>

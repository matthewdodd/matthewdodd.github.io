            . I am cooper to Mess. Cousemaker and Co. who serve the prosecutor with beer. I was starting beer in this store-cellar on the 18th of March, and found several of the butts were peg'd clandestinely, the beer was much of it gone. I started two barrels of beer into four butts, to fill them up again; the next day I went there again, and found the butts had been peg'd again afresh; I then look'd about, and found the broken place where the persons had got into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the beer was missing?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I can't tell; but I found out of two butts there were near 18 gallons missing in two days time; which were two of the butts that I had fill'd up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of the cellar?</p>
               <p>Edwards. Either Mr. Cumberledge or I always kept the key of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the place that was broke open.</p>
               <p>Edwards. On the Saturday night the 19th of March, Mr. Cumberledge and I went into the cellar together, and found a board broke up in the floor over it, and laid down in its place, but not fasten'd. I got some nails, and nail'd it down.</p>

            . I am a soldier. I was quarter'd in Dean-Street, Soho, and had money quarters; so William Dobins and I lodged over this cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe it was in February when the board over the cellar was broke open; I don't know exactly the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at the breaking of it open?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Rivers, Dobins, and myself.</p>

               <p>Taylor. They both did; I lay on the bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went down into the cellar?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did that night, and fetch'd some beer up, and they pull'd me up again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get at the beer?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I tap'd one of the butts with a gimblet, and drew it off into a little brass kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you deliver it to?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I deliver'd it to

            ; they were both in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might the kettle hold?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It held about a full-pot, or a little better.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might you fill it that night?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe about eight or nine times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down after that?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did, in about two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there at that time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Rivers and Dobins were then in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor might you draw at that time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Much about the same quantity as we did before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the board loose then?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was, we only laid it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Rivers and Dobins go down into the cellar?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, they did not; I went down and drew the beer, and deliver'd it to them, and they emptied it into another thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might you go down?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe I went down six or seven times, and drew near the same quantity cach time. We had an iron pot to put it into, that would hold about five quarts.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you fill that in a night?</p>
               <p>Taylor. We fill'd it twice in a night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the other three prisoners with you there at any time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. They were all of them drinking with us there at different times; and they all saw the beer deliver'd up. Burch and Yates have been down in the cellar and drawn beer themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did they go down.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yates went down twice, and Burch might go down six or seven times; they both deliver'd up beer as I had done; and after we had done, we laid the board down again in the same manner as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the five prisoners and you all there at one time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, we never were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other of the prisoners down in the cellar?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No. Sawyer once tried to go down, but could not; but there were two pots of beer drawn that night, and he drank part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think you drank in the whole?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I think there might be a butt and a half drank and wasted in the whole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. I was at justice Carkass's, when the evidence and all the prisoners (except Dobins ) were there, he was ill in the Infirmary at that time. They were charged with robbing the cellar of beer; they all own'd to the drinking part of the beer, and that they knew it was stolen. Taylor said then he thought there were two butts and a half drank, I said it was impossible it could be by six men in five weeks time; he said there was some wasted; after that he swore to a butt and a half.</p>

               <p>Yates's defence. I was going down the street. Taylor call'd me and ask'd me if I would drink, he had got a full-pot of beer on a chest of drawers; so I went in and drank some, and we had three fullpots, but I knew not where it came from.</p>
               <p>Rivers's defence. I went up to my quarters and received my money, Dobins was with me. We brought some bread and cheese with us, Taylor was drunk on the bed; he said he was glad we had got some bread and cheese, for he would help us to some beer, which he did.</p>
               <p>Sawyer's defence. After Dobins was in the hospital he wanted me to go and lodge with him. I went with him, and drank part of a pot of beer. In two or three days after I went there, and drank part of a pot more with him.</p>
               <p>Burch's defence. I went into Taylor's room and enquired for Dobins; then he ask'd me to lodge with him. I went with him, he had some beer in a cupboard; he said he had had a friend with him overnight, and it was dead in the pot.</p>
               <p>Dobins's defence. I lodg'd with Taylor. Rivers and I went up to my quarters to receive my money. I found at my return Taylor drunk in bed; he said as you have got some bread and cheese, I'll take care you shall have some beer; he had beer by the bed-side, and we drank some of it.</p>

             about the beginning of August came to me, saying her husband had left her, and she was in a deal of distress.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose the money. - A. On Wednesday, the 9th of September; she left me to go to look after a place, she told me that she had seen lady Shepheard, No. 31, Half Moon-street, she was to engage her for a house maid; she asked for the key of my bed room, to go up and get her clothes; I gave her the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her clothes there. - A. Yes; she had slept in my bed during the time she was in my house; she brought this shawl down, she said she should take the liberty of borrowing of it for the last time; I took the pattens off my feet and lent her; she promised she would return to engage a child of mine to go as a nursery maid; she did not return at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your money. - A. I missed it that evening; I went to put my clothes in the drawer, and in the box where I had eight pound fourteen and sixpence, there was only three pound nineteen shillings and six pence left; I found this pocket book was opened. I have a son on board a man of war, I receive his half pay. I missed thirteen half guineas out of this paper. My son-in-law allows me it monthly for my own use. I was laying it up in case he should come home distressed.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen this money. - A. Tuesday night after dark, I counted it. The drawer was locked: it had been opened by a key and locked again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had access to this, had your husband. - A. No. I have been separated from my lawfull husband fourteen years. He is in Hoxton workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Another person who lives with you as a husband had access to it. - A. Yes. I have been fourteen years with him. I pay the rent and taxes for the house in my own name.</p>
               <p>- I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner and searched her; I found on her one shilling, one penny piece, and a halfpenny, and a small key. I asked her how she could behave so to her friend;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280009"></xptr>when her friend had behaved so well to her; she acknowledged it was wrong in her doing so, but she did not think it was so much money as they represented it to be; she said the drawers were open, and she took it out of the drawers, and she had been to Portsmouth to find her husband if she could; she had staid there till she had spent all the money except enough to take a coach and bring her back to town.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to tell you all this. - A. I asked her, and she told me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had the money; the constable promised getting me through the piece if I would acknowledge, and that my mother would forgive me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you related to this woman. - A. I always counted her a mother in law; she is not married to the man that she lives with; I called her mother in law; the man that she lives with was the father of the son that I lived with.</p>

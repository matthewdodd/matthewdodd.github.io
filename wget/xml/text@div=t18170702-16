The watchman came up, and secured the prisoner - He was rescued from him and secured again; he was rescued a second time, and I took him the third; he was then rescued from me, and got off. I am sure he is the man that the watchman laid hold of; I did not point him out. I did not say that he took the seals, but he put his hand round me at the time that my property was taken.</p>
               <p>SHELAH FRANCIS. I am a watchman. I saw a mob in the road fighting-Sanders went to look atthem; the mob came round him - I went up; he said he had lost his seals, and I secured the prisoner. I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not examined before the magistrate - A. Yes. I thought I saw him make a snatch at him. I have known the prisoner from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you see the prisoner make a snatch at Sanders - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you see him put his hand into his own pocket - A. Yes; I laid hold of the prisoner. He was rescued twice from me and once from Sanders. I gave information to Coombs.</p>

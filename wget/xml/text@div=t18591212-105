                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. William Mc Cullock, and another, 95, Bishopsgate-street, chemists—the prisoner was in their employ—on 29th November, the prisoner came to the chemical room where I was working—the other young man had left the room as did I, and on my return I saw the prisoner take a four ounce bottle of oil of cloves, and put it into a box in which he was in the habit of carrying empty bottles to the rack—he went out of the room with it, and I followed him down to the lower warehouse—he did not leave the bottle there, but he went up stairs, and I went and gave information—I was returning, and he was coming down from No. 3 Store-room with the box in his hand, and the bottle was not there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask him whether he had taken a bottle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not say anything to him—I have not had any quarrel with him—I am informed he has been there fifteen months—the room that I saw him take the bottle from is a room in which we mix up chemicals—it is about half the size of this Court—the bottles are on shelves—the average size are what are called quart bottles—the one I saw him take was a small one; it was taken off a counter, not off the shelves-it was put there for the purpose of seeing whether that was to go to the customers with some that had gone before—the bottles that are made up are taken from the shelves and filled into small bottles—there was no one in the room but me—as I entered the room, I saw him take the bottle—he is often sent to go there for empty bottles; he has nothing to do with full ones—he has to take empty bottles from the drying-room to the rack—he went down to the lower warehouse, the receiving warehouse—there were several at work there; I dont know how many—that was not his place; he has nothing to do there, except when sent there—he has to pass there, and he may be sent there on business—he is not sent there more than any other part of the premises—he had the box in his hand, and the bottle was in the box—the box was not covered—he was carrying it sideways—I saw it, and any one looking towards him might see it—I never said a word to him about it—this was before 9 o'clock in the morning—I have nothing to do with his leaving—I only saw him take the bottle in the morning—I don't know that he was followed at 1 o'clock—I can't tell what other persons do.</p>

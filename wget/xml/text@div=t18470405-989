                  </hi> I am a carriage-lamp japanner, and live in Great Queen-street. About nine o'clock of the night of the 21st of March I fastened up my shop with a padlock, and a large lock—I went there the next morning—the door had been forcibly broken open, the padlock taken away, and the lock forced—I missed thirteen lamps—there had been fourteen there the night before, and there was only one left—these are two of the lamps—they belong to Mr. Filmer, but were in my charge.</p>

                  </hi> I am a carriage-lamp maker, and live in St. Andrew's-street, Seven-dials. On the 22nd March these two lamps were brought to my shop by Mr. Everett's man, to have tops and barrels put to them, and springs—they were not perfect—Mr. Jackson's man was in my shop at the time, and he said something to me after Mr. Everett's man was gone—I sent one of the lamps to Mr. Jackson's by the man—the prisoner was not there.</p>

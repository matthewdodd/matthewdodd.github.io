                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, at Stratford. On 26th of March I was cleaning the engines in the round engine shed at Stratford—I came out of the shed about a quarter after 8 o'clock in the evening—when I came out I met Barker with three of the tubes on his shoulder—he was coming in a direction from the coppersmith's—I was not half a yard away from him—I said to him, "Halloo!"—he must have heard me, but he never answered me—he went on, and I went another way round the shed, and came to a place where I found half-a-dozen tubes reared up against the shed that was in the direction in which Barker had gone—I did not see Barker again till they brought him into the shed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway. On that Saturday evening, about a quarter past eight, I came out of the engine-house with the last witness—I saw Barker coming across the yard—I had not known him before—I have no doubt at all that he is the man—he had three brass tubes on his shoulder—I called out to him, and said, "Halloo, mate, what is up?"—he made no answer, but went on with the tubes on his shoulder to where the six pieces were found—I went in the engine-house, and informed the night foreman—I then ran with the foreman on the inside of the shed to where the tubes were—I got there before Maddox—when I got there I found the two prisoners standing together, within two or three yards of where there were three tubes against the shed—the six tubes were a little lower down—that place is near the main line—it is the way to get from the railway across into the marshes—I and the night foreman took both the prisoners in custody, and they were gone before Maddox came—all the tubes were taken in the shed—I noticed the shoulder of Barker—it had some of the corrosion of the tubes on it.</p>

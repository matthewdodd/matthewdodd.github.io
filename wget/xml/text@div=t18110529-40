In consequence of information I went with Mr. Elsworth to the prisoners lodgings, 66, Paul-street, Finsbury Square, I there saw the prisoners wife, and upon my going into the shop I saw a piece of print hanging in the window I knew it to be mine, it had my mark on it, I asked his wife to shew me some shawls as soon as I received them I perceived one of them to be mine it was marked with pen and ink that I knew to be my writing that mark was defaced, and I saw several pieces of muslin bearing my mark. I went home and saw the prisoner at my house, I told him I was much surprised to find that he had got a shop and I had seen a great deal of my property there and it remained with him to account how it came there. He said he had acted very wrong not letting me know that he had a shop, and the goods he had bought of me for a friend at Deal, instead of sending them to Deal he had kept them himself. He had represented to me before that he bought the goods for a friend at Deal, but instead of sending them to Deal he had taken them to his own lodgings, I told him if that was the case I would take the day book over to his lodgings and call over the goods, and I went there with the day book, we called over the goods and it pretty well tallied with the entry in the book - the book and the goods nearly corresponded but they were entered in another name.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Is the shawl present. - A. No, he has made away with it.</p>

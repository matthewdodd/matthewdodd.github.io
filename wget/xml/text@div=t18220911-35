On the 7th of August I missed four store pigs and one sow, about half past eight o'clock in the morning. I knew them well by their marks.

            , I am a pig jobber, and live at Shadwell. On Tuesday or Wednesday I was sent for to look at some pigs - I found Mansfield with them. There was a sow and four pigs. They were by the wall in New Gravel Lane. Smith came over, asked if I would buy them, and asked 30 s. each. Mansfield stood by. I said I thought it was too much; he then said 25 s.; I offered them 15 s.; they said I should have them, if I gave them the money; I said I thought they were stolen; he said he did not steal them, but found them on the side of the road straying, and drove them on. I informed the constable, and they were taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, on the 27th of August, I went to the Dock-hills, and found the four pigs and one sow; Mansfield was with them; they did not know me. I asked him if they were his; he said No, he was minding them for a man, and said,</p>

               <p>"Here he comes". Smith was coming up, and asked me 30 s. each; I said I should like to know where he lived, if I bought one of him; he said at Ratcliffe Cross, and was well known there. I called the constable, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think the pigs worth 30 s.?" He said it was a fair price. I turned away to consult about taking them; upon looking round again, I found the men and pigs were gone. We found them six hours after in Stepney Fields, and took them to the office, with the pigs; Sawyer claimed them.</p>

             also lodged at my house. On the 23rd of November, at twelve o'clock in the morning prceisely, I went out with the prisoner's wife; I have no servant - I locked the doors, and left the keys in the room doors; I locked the doors of every room occupied by us, and Warburton's room, the kitchen, dining, and bed-room; I did not know of any body being in the house when I left it - I locked the outer door, which has two keys: I put one into my pocket, took out the other, which was inside the door, out of the lock, and put it into a hole in the passage, inside the house - I took the other with me, as the prisoner's wife said I had better take it to let myself in; she went with me about as far as the New-road, and looked very hard down there; I said, "Mrs. Green, what are you looking at?" she said, "I thought I saw my husband" - I said it was impossible, for he said he was going to the west-end of the town, and should not be back till half-past three o'clock; we were out together for half an hour, and then she left me - she said, "I dare say they will keep me to tea, and I shan't be back till six"- she got about two yards from me, then put out her hand, shook hands with me, and said, "God bless you;" her hand seemed to tremble - I never saw her again till she was at Bow-street: I got home a few minutes after half-past one o'clock - I found the outer door on the catch, not locked; I went straight down stairs to the kitchen, and saw two trunks, which stood under the dresser, all turned out, and every thing taken out except a few papers and rags; they were safe when I left the house - I had locked the kitchen door, and am sure nobody was in there; I sleep in the kitchen - I missed out of the kitchen drawer my gold watch, a pair of ear-rings (which were yellow topaz double drops, pearl and gold) - the watch cost 25l. when it was bought new; the watch and ear-rings were worth more than 20l., I should imagine - I lost a silver 4d. piece of the reign of William and Mary, with a hole through it, and a small crack on the head side; I sent for a neighbour, a lady, and went with her to Warburton's room - I cannot say whether his door was open or shut, for the lady went in before me; I saw Warburton's clothes were taken out of his drawers, which were unlocked - I saw a bundle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140018"></xptr>in the prisoner's room, containing all my wearing-apparel and linen; Warburton's linen, and all his clothes, except what he had on - they were all tied up in three bundles, and put behind the door, in a wrapper belonging to the prisoners - neither of the prisoners returned to the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you since seen any of the property that was taken away? A. None at all, except the 4d. piece - I said I could swear to that at the office, and that it was marked; I told Priece particularly before I saw it, that it had a hole in it, and a scar down the face; I did not say I could not identify the one produced, as it was not marked. I married a Portugues, but am now a widow.</p>

On the 23rd of November I left the house about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; I knew the prisoners by their having lodged there some time by the name of Green - I returned home about twenty minutes past four, went into my room, and found all my property gone; I kept my clothes in a chest of drawers, and saw them there just before I went out that morning; when I came home the two bottom drawers were empty - I had left a pocket-book in my drawer with my linen, and in it was a 20l. and three 5l. Bank notes - the drawer was locked; I had received two of the 5l. notes from my brother George, on the 30th of October, and kept them in that pocket-book; I had seen them there the night before, when I went to bed: I received the other two from Esdaile's bank on the same day, the 30th of October - I found my clothes down stairs, some of them in the kitchen; the bundles had then been opened - I lost three razors.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at Bow-street, where the female prisoner was under examination, on the 5th of December; she had this cloak on, which I afterwards took from her in Clerkenwell prison - she was asked where she got it; she said she bought it in Oxford-road, and gave 1l. for it - I produce a 4d. piece, which I received from Priece on the 5th of December; I traced the male prisoner from the George and Blue Boar on Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140019"></xptr>morning, to Limerick, and took him there - he asked the charge; I told him it was for robbing Mrs. Silva, where he lodged - he said it was true he lodged there, and he had a right to leave her if he thought proper, as he did not owe her a fraction; on the road to Dublin he asked me if there was any other lodger in the house - I said there was another gentleman, but he had left; he asked how long he had left - I said about a fortnight: he then said Mrs. Silva had committed the robbery, and wanted to lay it on him - he said he had slept with his wife at the George and Blue Boar on Tuesday night, and a man named McCormack; I have a letter which I intercepted - I never showed it to him; he said he had sent a letter to his wife: I understand he cannot write - I have the strap and cloth which the bundles were tied in the parlour.</p>
               <p>JAMES REYNOLDS. This is the cloak I sold to the prisoner - it is a particular make.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose there are a great many of the same make? A. Very likely - I have not sold many like it; it was a cloak of this pattern and make - it is made in rather an uncommon way, being trimmed round the cape and down the front with silk; it is a Scotch plaid, but not a common one - I am sure it is the cloak I sold them.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank of England. On the 2nd of November these two 5l. notes, No. 19,566, dated the 7th of August, 1829, and 10,150, 4th of May, 1829, were paid in from the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you receive them yourself? A. No - I produce them from the Accountant's-office, where they are always brought; they are entered in our books as coming from the Stamp-office - my knowledge is all derived from the book; we never produce the books in these cases.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You found those two notes in the Bank? A. Yes, my Lord; I have copied the entry in the book on the back of the notes, in my own hand-writing.</p>

            . On the 23rd of November I was going to see a friend, at No. 13, New Rutland-street, next door to the prosecutrix, and as I drew up to the door, about twenty minutes past one o'clock, I saw the male prisoner coming out of the prosecutrix's door, and shutting it after him; nobody was with him - he had nothing in his possession - as I drew near the door he turned and looked upon me; I thought he was going to speak - he advanced six or seven yards from me, then turned again, looked upon me again, which caused me to take notice of him; I discovered that he was of a light complexion, a long thin visage, and about five feet six inches high; I am certain the prisoner is the man - he had grey trousers, fitting close to his legs, and low shoes; the prosecutrix came home in about a quarter of an hour, and discovered the robbery - I described the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call the prisoner's a light complexion? A. Yes; I could not tell his height to an inch - I never said he had a drab coat and ancle boots on.</p>
               <p>MRS. E SILVA. This is my 4d. piece, and what I lost on the 23rd - I had seen it about a week before; it was taken out of a pertmanteau in the dining-room closet- there is a hole in it, and a crack near the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not uncommon for trinkets of that kind to have a hole? A. It may not be - I never wore it about my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. I am desired to ask if you did not go with the prisoner and his wife to Whitechapel, lock the door, bid them good bye, and ask them if they came to London again to be so good as to call on you? A. I never did, nor did I know but what they were coming back; this cloth and strap were put round the three bundles - I had seen the cloth before on their table; they used it for a table-cloth: it has a blue stripe on it, and is greasy now.</p>

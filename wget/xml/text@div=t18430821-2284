                  </hi>. I am a seaman. In April last I was in High-street, Ratcliff, about seven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner's husband at his shop—I do not recollect seeing the prisoner at the shop that morning—I afterwards went on board a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>, and worked on board four days—the prisoner paid me for my labour—after I had finished, I went to her shop to get paid—I got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account prior to that—the prisoner paid it me at her shop for the work I did on board the Marquis of <hi rend="italic">Huntley</hi>—she promised to get me another ship, and on the 8th she sent me on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt, Junior</hi>, by a waterman—she is a Russian ship—I agreed with the captain, and signed my articles in the usual manner—after signing the articles I returned with the waterman to the prisoner's shop—I asked her for a shilling, to go and release my clothes, which were at my lodging—I went and got them, came back, and got the balance, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for my work on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>—I then went on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—the captain ordered me to return that afternoon, and I was never out of her again till I got to Cronstadt—just as the ship got outside the dock, the boy that took me on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>, who is a shopman of the prisoner's, brought some clothes on board—I did not buy any—he con<lb></lb>tinued on board till we got down to Gravesend—he pressed me very much to take the clothes—I declined, as I could get them from the captain—I knew that, as I had asked the steward—the shop-boy said something about my advance note; in consequence of which, I told the captain about it—I can write and sign my name—I did not put my mark to this note—I never</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What countryman are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was born in Dublin—I have been at sea since the 28th of July, 1821—I was three years at sea then, on board a merchantman, trading to the West Indies—I then left the sea, and went with my father, who was in the corn business in Dublin—I staid with him till he failed, in 1831, and then I came to London, and shipped on boad the <hi rend="italic">Lady Nugent</hi>, to Bombay—I came home in 1832—I went out again in the same ship, and came home in 1833—I then went out to Sidney—I have not had a ship all the time—I was out of a ship from last December, at Shields, till I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>—I have been out of a ship before, but I have always had a ship pretty regu<lb></lb>larly—I lived at the south side of Shields—I forget the woman's name I lodged with—she lived in Lower Thames-street—I came to London from Shields in December—I could not get any work from December to April—I was at the Destitute Sailors' Asylum part of the time—I was without money—I had clothes to cover me—I had no jacket—I was ragged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you apply to Mr. Charles Lavey in April last, begging of him to get you a ship, stating that you were in a ragged and destitute condition, that you had no place to lodge in, and had been walking about the streets all night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never told him I was walking about the streets all night—I did not tell him I would be obliged to him to get me a ship, that I was in a ragged, destitute condition, and had no place to lodge in—nothing of the sort passed—I was spoken to first by the prisoner's husband as I was walking past the shop—I was not walking past in rags and without shoes—I had shoes—I was not altogether in rags—my shirt was not torn—Charles Lavey did not send John Eels on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi> with me to get three or four days' work till he could find me a ship—the old man sent me down that morning—Eels went with me—I had not seen Charles Lavey at that time—Charles Lavey was not in the habit of paying me from day to day my earnings on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>—the captain did not desire me to quit the ship because I was so ragged that he could not receive me—nothing of the sort—he never complained of my condition at all—I knocked off work when I found I did not sign the articles—the captain said, "As you have worked on board the ship, you may continue to work to-day"—he did not say he would not sign articles with me, because I was so ragged—I have never run from a ship—I and three others were sent on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi> at the same time, at Commercial Dock—we were all shipped by the captain there—I had no clothes from Mrs. Lavey, or any of the family, until after I went on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—I was not supplied with any apparel in order that I might be in a condition to go on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—after being shipped, I and the other men returned in the waterman's boat to Shadwell, and went to Lavey's shop—I did not then select clothes for the purpose of my voyage on board the vessel—I did not select things amounting to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe it is the custom to pay the waterman something who gets a man a ship, but I was never shipped in such a way before—I have heard it is customary to give 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the waterman—no articles selected by me were tied up in a handkerchief—I did not go from thence to the Golden Eagle—I did not go to the Golden Eagle at all, nor stay there an hour or an hour and a half—I did not return to the shop by the direction of Lavey, nor did he say to me, "Come, Yates, I want you to sign your note"—I did not say I was all of a shake, and could not hold the pen, and ask whether making my mark</p>

               <p>would not do as well—(I was perfectly sober, unfortunately I could not get otherwise, I had not the means)—Charles Lavey did not upon that say, "That will do, come in, and do it at once," or "do it directly."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Charles Lavey then write something on the back of the note, and did you take the pen and make a mark on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw the note—when I got the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said I was going down to the ship—I never heard him say he would send down my things—two days after, some things were sent on board to me as the vessel was just quitting the dock, by Eels—he did not give me the bundle—I would not have it—he offered it to me—he went on board the vessel to Gravesend—the captain came on board about six or seven in the evening—I do not know the name of the waterman—I never saw him before or since, till I saw him here—I did not select any clothes in his pre<lb></lb>sence—he never came to me as I came out of the Golden Eagle, and said, "I want my 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I did not say, "Stop a bit, I shall get the money for my note"—I did not go into Lavey's counting-house, or back room, with Murgatroyd, the waterman—I was never in it—Murgatroyd did not say, on my putting my mark on the note, "Why, you signed your name to the ship's articles, why don't you sign your name to the note?"—I did not say I could not be bothered to write then, and that my mark would do as well, nor any thing to that effect—Charles Lavey did not pay Murgatroyd 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on my account, in my presence—I do not recollect Murgatroyd saying, when I first saw him that day, "Yates, where have you sprung from?"—I did not reply, "From the straw-house"—I had come from my lodging in Rosemary-lane that day—I do not recollect the party's name—it is a barber's shop, opposite Dock-street—I paid fourpence a night—I'had got work in the Lon<lb></lb>don Dock, now and then, sufficient to pay my lodging—I did not tell Murgat<lb></lb>royd I had come from the straw-house, that I was ready to go anywhere, and would give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if he could get me off—this note is for more than half a month's advance—half a month's advance would be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I know Henry Gardiner—I do not know whether he is the man that took me and the other sailors on board at the Commercial Dock—I had a bundle when I went on board there, containing a shirt and pair of trowsers—I lodge with Gardi<lb></lb>ner now—I do not recollect seeing Gardiner on board—I did not receive a bundle from him on board—I never said to Gardiner, in speaking of this charge, that I had been persuaded to do this; that I would go through with it, as I had begun, as I had an idea of making a good thing of it—I never said, "If I do anything, I shall not take less than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Gardiner wanted me to take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and go away to Southampton; and I was taken by the arm yesterday, and told a lady wanted to see me—I had nothing to drink on the day it is said I signed the note—I was not inside a public-house that day—I paid for one pot of beer for some persons that befriended me, but I did not go after it; they brought it me, and that was all I had to drink—I came ashore from my voyage last Sunday fortnight—I hurt my back getting out of the ship, and did not make any complaint about this before the Magistrate till this day week—I then went to the station.</p>

The prisoner is my mother—my father and her have carried on business in Shadwell, as slop-sellers for seventeen or eighteen years—it is part of that business to supply sailors going on voyages with clothes, and to procure them ships—if they have no money to pay for their clothes, these notes are usually given—they are signed by the Captain of the vessel in which the sailor embarks, and ought to be countersigned by the sailor—these notes constantly come into our possession—I first saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor about a month or three weeks previous to his going with the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—he came to our house and asked if we could get him a ship—he was in a most deplorable state, with neither hat, jacket, shoes, nor stockings—I got him work on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>, for which I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, and his victuals—he was there three days, and a quarter—an applica<lb></lb>tion was made at our office to procure seamen for the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—I spoke to the prosecutor about it, three or four days after he left the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>—he had been sent ashore, and was still in a most deplorable condi<lb></lb>tion—Captain Grotian brought me four of these notes for the purpose of pro<lb></lb>curing seamen—four men, of whom Yates was one, were brought to our shop by Murgatroyd, the boatman—it is usual to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per man to the boat<lb></lb>man for shipping, and their waterage extra—I sent Eels our shopman with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184308210086"></xptr>
               <p>Yates, Murgatroyd and the other three men to the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>, which was then lying in the Commercial Dock—they returned about two hours after, with Murgatroyd, to sign their notes, and pay the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for which we were answerable, for the waterage—the men were all in the shop, and I said either to Murgatroyd or Eels, "Send in the men, and let them sign their notes"—three of them signed their notes—Yates did not at that time—he selected some second-hand clothes which laid about the shop—he was in such a deplorable condition we could not give him new ones to the amount—I had previously lent him a jacket to go in to see the Captain—after he had selected the clothes we missed him from the shop—in consequence of what Eels or Murgatroyd said I desired him to go and look for him—in about an hour and a half or two hours he came out of a public-house—when I saw him I said, "Send that man in; he has not signed his note;" and I said to him, "Yates, come in and sign your note"—he came into the counting-house and said, "I cannot write; a cross will do as well"—Murgatroyd told him that he had signed his name on board the ship in the articles that he had witnessed, and he could write—he then said, "Well, I have just been taking a glass of grog (or something, staggering about,) and my mark will do all the same"—I said, "Well, it will make no difference to me; the note does not require signing," or something of that kind," as it is an order from the Captain to receive the money," (the ship was going to call at Shields, and we often find when vessels call at an intermediate port that sailors run away, and then they stop these notes and cheat us out of the money,) so I wrote his name, Thomas Yates—then held him the pen, and said, "Make your mark"—he said, "That will do"—he held his arm over my shoulder, and I made his mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You wrote his name and the mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He held the top of the pen—he just had hold of it and made the mark with me together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether he had been drinking or not, had he the ap<lb></lb>pearance of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I should say he had been drinking by his appear<lb></lb>ance—the clothes he looked out amounted to 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or I think a little more—he said, "I shall never forget your kindness to me, and I will pay you what I owe you when I come back"—he had had a south-wester, a pot and knife, which came to about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in addition to the 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had also paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the waterman for him, making 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in addition to what I trusted him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that he owed you money instead of your owing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he came back from the <hi rend="italic">Brandt</hi>, after signing the articles, I did not pay him any balance that was due for his work on board the <hi rend="italic">Huntley</hi>—he had had it all a day or two before—I did not pay him—my mother, I believe, paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Murgatroyd, Eels, and myself were present when this endorsement was made—my mother was not—she saw nothing at all of the transaction—the note was in my possession till I gave it up—it was done in my counting-house at the back of the shop—I do not know whether any of the other sailors were in the shop at the time—Yates was either drunk at the time, or pretended to be so; but I should say he had been drink<lb></lb>ing very freely—When I was writing "Thomas Yates" he was standing with his hand on the desk—I was standing up—it is a very small place—he could hardly stand without putting his hand to the desk, or somewhere near—I cannot tell the exact position in which he stood, but he stood very near me—he had hold of the pen—he put his arm over my shoulder—he might have been behind me, or at the side of me—he put his left hand over my shoulder and took hold of the pen—I wrote with my right hand—he laid hold just of the top of the pen as if he had been afraid to touch it, as if he had something going, something which it appears he had in his mind for a long time, as if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184308210087"></xptr>
               <p>he could write and would not, and that makes him bring this case here, I suppose—he did not take it in his own hand—he had the top, and I held the bottom part—I wrote "Thomas Yates" after he put his mark; after he touched the pen to the mark—the mark was made at the same time—the name was written first—we both had hold of the pen at the time the mark was made—I wrote my own name, "Charles Lavey"—I generally write it at the top, and sometimes at the bottom—I wrote that afterwards—Murgatroyd is not in my service—he does a little work for us now and then—he was waiting for his money at the time this was done—I would not give him the money till Yates had signed his note—he was standing leaning against the counting-house door—Eels was about the shop, but I think he brought Yates in, and he then stood alongside at the time—there was one on each side of the door, to the best of my belief—I know they were both present at the time I was writing—Murgatroyd was leaning against the door, and Eels was standing on the left side of him—he was in the shop, because there is not room for three to stand in the counting-house—he was close enough to see what was going on—they both saw it—I would not pay the money till the receipt was on the back of the note—I did not write my name then—I think I wrote that at Mr. Brandt's office—I went there, not with my mother, but alone—I went to re<lb></lb>ceive the money for the note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you write your name on that note at the time Yates and you were making this cross as you represent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what did you mean just now by saying that you wrote it at Mr. Brandt's office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was written at my office, at the time I have been describing—I wrote this, "Charles Lavey," there—I wrote that on all the notes—I wrote that at the same time—if I said just now that I wrote it at Mr. Brandt's office it was a slip, I was thinking of the receipt—my mother's name is on the bottom—all the notes are signed alike—they were signed at my house—as the men signed the notes for the sum they received I placed my name on them—I did not say that I put my name to the note at Mr. Brandt's office—I do not recollect putting my name at Mr. Brandt's at all—I don't know that I did not give my direction to Mr. Brandt, I think I did—I gave my direction, a very short man took it—whether I wrote my name or gave my address I don't know—I did not write my name—I won't swear whether I did or not—I will swear I wrote that name at my office—when Yates made his mark, Murgatroyd said "You can write, why not? "—Yates said, "It will make no difference, my mark is just as good; I scarcely ever sign a note," or something to that effect—eight sailors out of ten make their marks—I made no remark to Eels or Murgatroyd about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether he had the pen in his hand, or whether you and he made the mark, was he perfectly aware that it was made at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that the name Thomas Yates was written as being his name—I am not aware whether he saw me put my name on it or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman. I am in the habit of procuring seamen ships—about April last an application was made to me for the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt, jun.</hi>, in consequence of which I took four men to Lavey's shop—I saw some notes—if this is the same note, it has the endorsement of the Captain, because the ship was going to Shields—it was in consequence of some com<lb></lb>munication between me and the Captain that that endorsement was made—Yates was one of the four I took to Lavey's shop—I picked him up in the street somewhere about the beginning of April—he was very badly clothed—I said to him, "Now is your time to get away"—I afterwards went with them to the vessel lying in the Commercial-dock—after they had signed the articles on board the vessel they all came back with me to Lavey's shop—I was to</p>

               <p>receive 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from each man for shipping them, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. waterage—Yates told me as the other men did, that when the notes were cashed they would pay me—I stopped at Lavey's till Charles Lavey came in—I saw Yates select some clothes—he then went out—Eels was sent out after him—I remained till be came back, to get my 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., when he had endorsed the note—I could not get it until then—when he came back I said, "Come, Yates, I want to get my money, and be done with it; I don't want to be here all day long"—he said, "Very well, come along," and with that he went into the counting-house with Charles Lavey—Eels was in the counting-house—I stood leaning against the counting-house door—Eels had been picking his things out, and was in the counting-house to give an account of things that were picked out, to the amount of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the other men had been settled with—I saw them settled with—I saw Charles Lavey write Yates's name on the note—Yates was standing so that he could see what he was writing—he put his hand to the top of the pen and made his mark—I said to him, "Hollo, Yates, why don't you write your name, you wrote your name on the articles?"—"Oh," he said, "that will answer the same purpose for me, you have got your money"—I said, "I shall presently," and with that Charles Lavey paid me my money—when I first met Yates that day, I said, "Yates, where have you sprung from?"—he said he had been at the Straw-house, but they had turned him out—he said, "I am ready to go anywhere, and would give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get me off."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper. In April last I was in the employ of Mr. Lavey as shopman and porter—early in April Yates came to the shop—his clothing was in a very bad state—he asked Mr. Lavey if he could get him a ship—I went with him on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>—he worked there for two or three days—after that, Murgatroyd brought the captain of the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi> to Mr. Lavey's shop—he afterwards brought Yates and three others—I went with them and Murgatroyd to sign articles—I think it was on the 8th or 9th of April—after they returned Yates selected some clothes, which were afterwards tied up in a bundle—he went over to the Golden Eagle, nearly facing Mr. Lavey's shop—I saw him go in—by my master's direction I was told to inform him when he came out of that public-house—I saw him come out, and told him Mr. Lavey had directed me to bring him to the shop—when he came in, Charles Lavey said, "Come, Yates, come and endorse your note," or "sign your note," I will not be certain which—he replied that he had been drinking, and could not hold the pen to write, on account of his hand trembling—he said afterwards that he supposed if he made his mark it would do just as well—Mr. Lavey, Yates, and I, then went into the back counting-house together—Mr. Lavey took the pen off the desk and offered it to Yates—he refused to take it, and said, "Do not bother</p>

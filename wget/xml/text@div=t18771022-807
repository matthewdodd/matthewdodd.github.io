                  </hi>. I am assistant-solicitor to the Treasury and live at 10, Granville Park, Lewisham—on 28th May last I had been, visiting some friends at Woolwich—at 9.30 in the evening I started to return home in a hired fly, accompanied by two ladies—I don't know the driver's name—we drove along the Dartford Road until we came on to Blackheath—when we got near the Ranger's house we turned to the left across the top of the heath—there is a long, empty gravel pit along the side of the road there for about 150 yards, and when the carriage was about the middle of the gravel pit, on the road side, it suddenly stopped—I was on the point of looking out to see what the cause of the stoppage was when my attention was drawn to the off-side window, which was closed, and I there saw a man standing at the window—it was then about ten minutes to ten; the moon had not risen—the man had a mask on the upper part of his face and a pistol in his hand, which he pointed into the carriage, and I heard him say "Your money, or I'll fire"—he repeated this once or twice, perhaps three times—I thought it was some drunken man, and I said "Go away," and I called out at the same time to the driver "Drive on"—he made no reply, the carriage did not move, so I again said "Drive on "more loudly—he said "I can't"—at that moment, to my surprise, at the window where I was sitting, which was partially open, another man appeared—he had a piece of crape across the lower. part of his face, and a pistol in his hand, which he pointed into the carriage, and said "Your money, or I'll fire instantly"—he repeated this two or three times as I hesitated to do anything—I then put my hand in my pocket and took out some loose silver, I believe 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I handed to him—he took it in his left hand, still holding the pistol into the carriage towards me—he then said "This won't do for me, you have got more than that, you have got a purse; I'll have your purse, be quick"—I attempted to get my head out of the way of the pistol, which he continued</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220260"></xptr>
               <p>to point at me, and in doing so I leant back into the corner of the carriage—he then pulled the door open with his left hand and presented the pistol at my head and said "Your purse instantly, or I'll fire"—this he repeated, and said "Ill blow your brains out if you don't give it me immediately"—under the circumstances I then took my purse out of my pocket and handed it to the man—he took it in his left hand, as he had done the silver, and I saw him weigh it apparently for a moment in his hand—he then said "There are more of you," looking towards the ladies—I said "You have got all I have"—he then shut the door to and said "Go on"—at the time he pulled the door open I saw the other man standing about a yard behind him on the side of the road, which is about a foot higher than the roadway—he held in his hand a pistol, about a yard from me—in a very short time the carriage was driven on—I did not see the driver or hear him—I could not see what became of the men—I was driven to my house; I got the ladies out and immediately drove on to the police station and gave information—one of the men, the first I saw, had on a light overcoat, I can't say anything more than that—the other had a dark coat, and both had low-crowned hats—I did not notice the pistols suffi<lb></lb>ciently to say whether they were revolvers or not, but I distinctly saw the gleam of the barrel of the one that was pointed at me in the carriage, and I should gather from that that it only had one barrel—I have seen the revolver produced—it might have been one of those I saw—my purse contained two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and seven sovereigns, two blank cheques and some postage stamps—I had drawn a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at my bankers, Messrs. Fuller, of Lombard Street, that morning, and I went the next moraine and got the numbers of the notes (<hi rend="italic">notes produced</hi>)—I don't know that I can identify them—these are the numbers the bankers gave me—I went direct to the Bank of England and stopped the notes—I saw the faces of the men, but they were disguised, I could not <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> their features at all—I should say both were slim men—I think the height of one would be about the height of the tallest of the prisoners (Dinham)—it so struck me, but I could not form a very good judgment of their height, because I was sitting in the carriage and just saw them over the window.</p>

Hyslope replied, "I did not have a note in my possession, and I shall be very glad to have it cleared up, as the boys in the street point me out as one of the highwaymen." He was told he would have to go and put on the clothes he wore when in London—he did so and he was then taken to landport station—he remarked before going that the clothing he had on then was exactly the same as he had in London,-even to the necktie—Mrs. Pallant and Tates were left at the hotel near the station—I told the inspector to get six or seven men as like the prisoner as possible in dress and height, and when they were ready in the reserve room one of the constables fetched Mrs. Pallant and Yates—Mrs. Pallant was shown into the reserve room, and immediately she got in she put up her umbrella and pointed to Hyslope—no suggestions had been made to her to pick him out—I then went into my office with Shaw; I did not see Yates go in, I saw him afterwards; he did not identify any one—the prisoners were then charged with this offence—they made no reply—I had pre<lb></lb>vionsly been to the shop where Hyslope was employed, and there received this leaf of a book—I showed it to Hyslope—he said "Where did you</p>

I instituted some inquiries at Ports<lb></lb>mouth on 4th September—about nine or ten that night I saw Dinham at the police-station—I told him I was an officer, and he was suspected of being concerned in a highway robbery with pistols on Blackheath, on 28th May—he replied that he knew nothing at all about it—Mr. Jams pro<lb></lb>the revolver, and I said to Dinham that it seemed strange for him to be in possession of such things as those—he said he bought it in the Strand in London, and gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he said he had never seen the other revolver—he said that Hyslope himself and Hyalope's young woman left Portsmouth on Monday, the Bank Holiday, which was 21st May; that they went to London, and stayed for a night or two at Knight's coffee-house, near the Houses of Parliament; that they then went to King William Street, Greenwich, where they stayed about four weeks—after that conversation I allowed him to go—next day, the 5th, I went to a shop kept by a man named Fitzpatrick; it is a general shop, a baker's, and they sell beer as well—I found Hyslope there—I told him I was an officer, and that I heard he was suspected of being concerned with Dinham in stopping a carriage on Blackheath, on 28th May, where a gentle had been robbed of a purse containing two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and seven<lb></lb>man sovereigns—he said he knew nothing at all about it—on 10th September Iwent again to Portsmouth and saw Hyslope—I told him that since I had seen him last I had seen the writing on the two notes, and the signa<lb></lb>ture to the marriage register; that I thought the writing very much alike, and I should be glad of some further information, as there was suspicion against him—he said he knew nothing of the notes, he had no notes during the time he was in London—I told him that J. Compton, Leslie Street, was written on one of the notes, and J. Compton on the other; that one had been passed in the Mile-end Road to a Mrs. Pallant, and the other to a person named Holloway, somewhere in Portsmouth, but I did not know exactly where—he said he should be very glad if it could be cleared up, because he was pointed at by boys in the street as a person suspected of highway robbery—I said it would be materially in his favour if he could give me a satisfactory account of where he was on the night of 28th May, provided he had not committed the offence—he said he thought he was at the Alhambra, that he went there, I think he said three times—I ultimately took him to the station, and Mrs. Pallant was brought in—Dinham was brought in afterwards—they were put with some other persons in a room—prior to Mrs. Pallant identifying Hyslope I had not communicated to her anything about his appearance, dress, or any<lb></lb>thing to lead her to identify him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. I have only known the man Holloway since this case—I took him to the shop where Hyslope was at work stand<lb></lb>ing outside the door—I had arranged with Hyslope to bring him—I did not tell Holloway that I would show him the man who had passed the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; if he says so it is false—I went three times to Mrs. Pallant's—I have seen Miss Westley once at her house, after the prisoners were in cus<lb></lb>tody; I was there about three minutes, in the passage, I think; she took me into a room, the back parlour; I did not go upstairs to the drawing-room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220268"></xptr>
               <p>—when Mrs. Pallant went into the room to identify Hyslope I was in the passage—she walked in, looked round, pointed with her umbrella, and came out—I did not hear her say anything—I believe Jarvis was in the passage by my side—we went with Mrs. Pallant into the inspector's room for a minute or two—she said he was the man, but she wanted to see him again, because there was something peculiar about his eyes—Jarvis sent her back again—I saw Yates go into the room; I did not see him shake his head in a negative kind of way—I may have told him to another look, I can't say—I did not caution Hyslope—I just put the ques<lb></lb>tions to see if he could explain the matter—he told me that when he went to London he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had saved up—I think he said 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he had no 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note.</p>

                  </hi>. I am verger of the parish church of St. John's, Waterloo Road—on 22nd May I was present at a marriage between the prisoner Hyslope and Ellen Sarah Budd—I saw Hyslope sign the register—I produce it—I signed after him as a witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting, of Red Lion Square—I have for nearly twenty-five years given my attention to the study of handwriting—my attention has been called to certain documents in this case, the page of a book, the signature to the register, and the name <hi rend="italic">" J.</hi> Compton" on the two bank notes—in my opinion they are all written by the same person; if necessary I can point out the similarities I rely upon.</p>

I was first asked to give evidence on Thursday last—I then saw and compared the documents in Mr. Wontner's office—I did not see any other writing—I think I knew it had reference to this case—I have been many times a witness—on one or two occasions I believe the jury have given a verdict against my evidence; I believe you allude to the case of "Davis <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Davis," but in that case I did not give a speculative opinion; I merely said I could not identify the testator's handwriting—I gave evidence in Fullager's case, and he was acquitted—in this case I go by the general character of the writing, as well as by the special peculiarities.</p>

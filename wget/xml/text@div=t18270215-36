            , Tweedy, and Wilson, bankers, of York. On Saturday, the 29th of April, we had occasion to send a remittance to London; I copied the particulars of the remittance into a book, counted the notes and bills, and put them into two packets; I have a copy of the numbers of the notes which I enclosed, and the private marks I put upon them; I enclosed in the two packets, bills and notes amounting to 547l. 8s. 9d. - I cannot tell what amount I enclosed in each; here is my remittance-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this 1l. note, and see if you find a number in your book corresponding with it? A. Yes - that is in another book which I have here; I find on this note a private number, 446, which tallies with the entry in the book, which is in my hand-writing; this book only contains an entry of the Bank notes remitted on the 29th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Do read the entry? (Reads) - "29th of April, C. and Co., (meaning Curtis and Co.) No. 446, 1l.;" I find, by the other, book, that the number of that note was 32,286, dated the 29th of December, 1825 - our private number being 446; this entry is in the hand-writing of Barreclough. I enclosed this note in one of the packets which was sent to Messrs. Curtis and Co. on the 29th of April; we also sent up a letter, containing a power of attorney; I wafered the two packets containing the remittance, and addressed them to A. W. Robarts, Esq., M. P., London - and put them on the counter - it is another person's business to carry them to the Post.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have a book in which you enter all remittances? A. Yes - the entry in that book is my writing - that is "Bank, 7l.," which means that part of the remittance was 7l. in Bank notes - in order to find a description of this 7l. I refer to the Bank note book - the entry there is in my hand-writing; I have there entered the private number of this Bank note to be 446; the private number on the note is not my writing, but I can swear to it, as I examuned the note itself, to see that 446 was on it, and I have entered it in the paid Bank note book, as being remitted to Messrs. Curtis.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did you enclose these notes? A. From three to four o'clock; I did not write the letters - I made them up, and sealed them. The whole remittance was enclosed in two packets, both of which were directed to Mr. Robarts. After wafering the letters I put them on the counter, to wait till Barraclough took them to the Post - they were wafered, and sealed with wax; I always wafer them, but Barraclough sometimes seals them; I never knew it happen that notes selected to be remitted had been left behind by accident; immediately they are entered I put them into their respective envelopes - I never leave them loose on the desk; it is my general practice to enclose them directly. I have no distinct recollection of having enclosed these immediately, but it is my firm belief that I did.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Does the book contain the whole account of the 547l. bills and every thing? A. It does.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the whole of this book entrics of remittances sent to Messrs. Curtis only? A. Yes. I took the No. 446 from the note itself, but Barraclough wrote<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150028"></xptr>the number on the note; the 7l. in Bank notes was put in to make up the sum.</p>

            . In April last I was in the house of Messrs. Wilson and Co., bankers, of York. - (Looking at the note) this note was paid into our house on the 28th of April; the No. 446 was made on it by me that day, and entered in the book; it is my duty to put the letters containing remittances into the Post-office. On the 29th of April, between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I remember putting three letters into the Post-office, directed to A. W. Robarts, Esq. - I cannot say whether I had sealed the letters that day. The post leaves after ten o'clock; I heard, three or four days afterwards, that one of the letters had not arrived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you so well recollect that it was about eight o'clock? A. Hearing one of the letters had not arrived brought it to my recollection; I put the No. 446 on the note, and entered that number in the received note book, at the same time - we put a progressive number on all our notes; if it had been a 5l. note we should have put the same number.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What is the entry you have made? A."446 - 32,286, 1l., 29th of December, 1825;" this is the note from which I made that entry.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When the bag is opened, what is done with the letters? A. They are thrown on a table - there would be no others on the table at that time - other bags had been opened before, but all the letters were cleared away; they would be sorted for delivery four hours after the bag was opened - they would be mixed with other letters; only two persons would have to come to that table, the first stamper, and a messenger to clear the franks - I have been in the office two years and three months.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were there newspapers in the bag as well as letters? A. Yes - the letters would not remain on the table more than five minutes - they are taken away by the messenger and stamper, over to a large table to be sorted.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is that book kept by you? A. No; but I know his writing - he has signed the book, which states that he was on duty that morning - his duty commences at six o'clock; the book don't state that.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man was taken ill, and came at a later hour, would the book tell that? A. No; but there is a book which will tell about his attendance - I think if he had not come in proper time his duty would have been performed by another person, who would have signed the book - if he had been taken ill after he came, a person might take his duty - but in that event, I conceive that person would have signed the book as having done the duty - I cannot say that I know a case in point.</p>

            . I am in the service of the Post-office, and was employed on the 1st of May in facing newspapers, and examining them - the prisoner was employed in collecting papers, and assisting in facing them - there are seven tables, and two baskets attached to each table, which the clerks of the tables throw the newspapers into - he would collect those baskets from all the tables - he would go to the York table - it often happens that franked letters and packets get into the baskets, and sometimes bundles of letters - I was never there but what there were three or four such mistakes, or at times eight or ten - it would be the prisoner's duty when that was discovered, to take the letters back to the several tables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he not an extra man? A. No - a regular man; I sign the book as an extra man - a regular man signs his name as extra, if he was extra duty - his name is under the word extra, but you will find it also under the head of collector and facer.</p>
               <p>Q. Show me his name in the book under that head? A. He should have signed it there - but it don't appear, except as an extra man - he ought to sign the book at the beginning of the duty - I cannot account for its not being signed in both places; no other person would be employed in collecting newspapers but him - there would be two clerks and two messengers to each of the seven tables - I do not swear that I saw the prisoner at the York table - it would be his duty to go there - I will not swear that I saw him in the office - in the hurry of business letters are often thrown among the papers, and papers among letters - I have known a man taken ill, and another coming on duty for him - I have been in the office eleven years - how many times that has happened I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Was the prisoner on duty that morning? A. He should have been; and he has signed his name - he would have gone to the York table for the newspapers.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150029"></xptr>COURT. Q. What is the usual hour for signing the book? A. Six o'clock when our duty commences - if a man is taken ill, and another comes in his place, that person should sign the book as well; but whether that has been done I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a clerk in Sir William Curtis's banking-house. On the 1st of May two covers were received from York - one contained 126l., and the other merely a power of attorney - I have the book in which I entered the 126l.; no other remittance was received from the York bank that day - here is the letter which contained the 126l.; finding only that amount, I sent to the Post-office that one cover was missing - our letters come by the early delivery; those directed to A. W. Robarts, Esq., would come at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where is Mr. Robarts' private house? A. In Hill-street, Berkeley-square - I believe I got to the office at nine o'clock - letters sometimes come before I arrive - they are never touched till the corresponding clerk comes, and sometimes he opens them - I opened the York letter, containing 126l.; it arrived some time after I came - I made the entry immediately, from the contents - I opened it in the presence of Mr. Oldfield; he does not assist in marking the entry.</p>

            . I keep the Queen's Arms public-house, Great Guildford-street, Southwark. I know the prisoner very well - he is a customer; I received this note from him on the 1st of May, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - I have written on it, "Eagles, postman, 1st of May, 1826;" I took it in payment of 2s. 71/2d., which he owed me, and 2d. worth of gin which he had - I know that I paid it to Davies - it is my constant habit to indorse on notes the name of the persons who pay them me - I never changed a note for him before.</p>
               <p>JURY to DEACON. Q. How many collectors of newspapers are there? A. The prisoner was the principal - but if they were heavy, another might help him; I cannot say whether he was helped that morning.</p>
               <p>NEALE re-examined. I know the prisoner's hand-writing; I find, upon examining the book, that his name is signed to the particular duty as facer of newspapers - it is his hand-writing, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear these two signatures are both written by the same individual? A. I do - both are written by one person.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. At what time would these two signatures be made in the book? A. Both on the same day; they ought to be made at the same time - one shows that he was employed on his regular duty, and the other the extra duty; I cannot say whether I was on duty that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your opinion of both the signatures? A. That they are both written by Eagles - I have seen him write his name frequently - he would have just the same opportunity of taking this letter whether employed at one or both duties - his regular duty was a letter carrier; the extra duty he has signed to was a collector of newspapers.</p>

             re-examined. The book would be signed at six o'clock in the morning - I have signed it; here is Eagles' name twice - but I don't swear to the second signature being his writing, and that made me say, I did not see it there; I cannot swear to his hand-writing - but the name on the left side bears a strong similitude to his handwriting.</p>

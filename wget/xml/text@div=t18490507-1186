                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY STEELE</hi> I am a linen-draper, at Richmond. On 5th April I missed a length of watered black silk, about twenty yards—I have since seen it—I have known the prisoner about two or three years as a chance customer at my shops at Hammersmith and Richmond—a piece of mouslin-de—Iaine and some woollen end cotton cloth have also been produced to me which are my property—I had not missed them—I had not sold them or the silk, neither can I find any one in my establishment that has—none of my shopmen are here—the marks ought to be removed by my shopmen when they sell goods—I have seven male assistants and two females—I cannot swear that none of my assistants sold the articles in question—the prisoner was not detained with the goods on her.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody; she refused to give her name and address, but from inquiries I made I found she lodged at Mrs. Peters's beer-shop in the Lower-road, Richmond—I went there, and unlocked the door with a key—the prisoner said in my presence that the key was hanging in a certain place; I did not distinctly hear where—in a box in that room I found this piece of black silk, this worsted plaid, and this <hi rend="italic">de-laine</hi> dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live in Ann-street, Plumstead. On 20th Aug., about twenty minutes past 9 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and the deceased Smale close together—I saw Fabling pull his coat and hat off, and give them to a woman—I saw him give Smale a blow on the left side, which knocked him down—I went for the parish constable, I returned with him, and one of the men was then picking Smale up off the ground; the back of his head was all covered with blood, and he was insensible—when he was struck, his hands were straight down by his side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer living at Plumstead—I knew the deceased. On Sunday evening, 20th Aug., I was coming from Woolwich, and met the prisoner—he was pulling off his coat and saying he would go back and give the b—some more of it—he then put his coat on, and walked on about his business—there was no one there but another young man who was with him—I did not see Smale at that time, but when I walked on, between forty-five and fifty yards, I saw him lying in the road, before the door of the Red Lion—I went into the crowd, and picked him up, and rested him between my knees—I saw that he had but little breath, I could scarcely observe any—he was not sensible—we took him home, and he laid upwards of three quarters of an hour before I could fetch him to, and then after he had revived a little, he said "Fabling" three times, before he could say "Fabling <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it"—he continued very bad; he was in a dange<lb></lb>rous state when I left him—the prisoner walked as steadily as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parish constable of Plumstead. On Sunday evening; 20th Aug., I received information, and went out and saw the deceased lying in the road, bleeding from the nose or mouth—I made inquiries, and in consequence of information, I went after the prisoner; I did not find him till the Tuesday; he was then at his master's, a Mr. Booth's, in a street leading out of the Old Kent-road—I said to him, "How are you Bill?"—I have known him from a child—he said, "How are you?"—I said, "Were you at Plumstead on Sunday night, Bill?" he said, "No, I was not"—I said, "I think you were, for I thought I saw you there"—he Said, "Well, the truth will always go the farthest, I saw you there in the Red lion"—I then asked if he recollected anything about striking a man; he said, "Yes, he struck a man, and knocked him down"—I asked if he knew the man; he said, "No"—I said, "How came you to strike the man?"—he said, "There was a woman running after a boy; my younger brother said, 'Run' (I think he said), Richard, or <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, don't let your mother catch you; the father was passing at the time, and said, 'What have you to do with that, you s—y puppy;' I said, 'I will show you whether I am a puppy,' for that was the reason that caused me to strike him"—I knew Smale—I saw his dead body at his own house after he was brought from the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's. On Saturday morning, 26th Aug., about 8 o'clock, I received the deceased into the hospital—he was suffering from compression of the brain—there were symp<lb></lb>toms of laceration of the brain as well—I could not detect any fracture of the skull externally—the coma became greater on Friday, and he died at 4 o'clock that afternoon—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the follow<lb></lb>ing Monday—I found a fracture at the base of the skull, extravasations of blood beneath the membranes of the brain, and laceration of the two</p>

               <p>anterior lobes, and left middle lobe of the brain—a violent fall on the back of the head would cause those appearances—the cause of death was com<lb></lb>pression of the brain; that compression was produced by extravasation of blood—the other organs were quite healthy.</p>

On the 29th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came, and asked to see a pair of boots, which were in the window, I handed them to her, they were too large - she asked to see a pair of shoes, I turned to reach them; she had a tea-caddy in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010068"></xptr>her hand, which she put on the counter. On my turning again she had put it under her shawl. She walked out, saying the shoes would not do - she had not looked at them. Ransom, who was in the shop, said he saw her put something under her shawl. I looked, and missed a piece of stuff; she went out. A girl said she was gone towards Charlotte-street - I could not see her. On my return I found her in the watch-house with the stuff.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM RANSOM. I lodge with the prosecutrix. I went out, and found the prisoner struggling in the street with the prosecutrix's daughter, who had the stuff. The prisoner charged her with stealing it. I gave her in custody.</p>

            . I live within four doors of Edwards. The prisoner brought the stuff into my shop and offered to sell it for 4 s. She was intoxicated - I would not buy it. A little girl said the prosecutrix had lost a piece of stuff. I told her which way she was gone, and she went in pursuit of her. While she was gone I saw the prisoner come up Cumberland-street again to the next house to me; she offered it for sale there. I went to the prosecutrix's daughter, who tried to take it from her, she would not let her have it - I took it from her. She said I stole it from her, and was very insolent.</p>

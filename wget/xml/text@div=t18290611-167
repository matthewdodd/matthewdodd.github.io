On the 16th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night. I went round the rooms, to see if all the plate was put by, and saw several of the men's bundles - I went into another room, and as I came back I missed a bundle, which appeared larger than the rest: the prisoner was gone - I went out after him; he had not gone more than four minutes: I called after him near Ave Maria-lane- he was stopped, and asked what I wanted; I told him to come back, which he did - I told him to open his bundle- he untied it, and in it I found two tumblers, rolled up in his apron; I called to Mr. Leech, and the watchman was sent for - he was taken to the watch-house; there was some broken victuals in his bundle, which was his perquisites; I knew the tumblers by the pattern, and being very large and strong - they were quite plain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were not all the occasional waiters' bundles in one room? A. Yes; I should not think this was a joke played by some other waiter; he could certainly have taken articles of more value - he had 3s. a day: Mr. Leech had a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>HENRY WAKE. I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged with stealing two rummers - I sent him to the Compter; I searched him there, and found a pair of glass salts, one in each of his coat pockets - he said nothing to it.</p>

               <p>"The Royal Saloon," Piccadilly, and made some observation upon</p>
               <p>"The Hermit in London:" the prisoners were there; Druid said that his friend on the left was the author of that work - upon that we entered into conversation on the nature of the work, and I asked him to drink some wine, which he did - this was about twelve o'clock at night: the Saloon is a tavern. Captain Duncan, (as the prisoner M'Donough was called) gave me an invitation to go and see him; his address was</p>
               <p>"Captain Duncan, Petersburg-hotel, Dover-street" - Druid gave his address</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jones, No. 15, Newland-street, Kensington." I have enquired at Kensington, and could not find that such a person lived there. I left the Saloon in company with both the prisoners - I was not drunk: I was elevated with wine, but not so much but that I knew what I was about; we had a coach; Druid and I went on the coach box, to the <placeName id="t18240715-171-crimeloc912">Bell inn Holborn</placeName>

I was going to sleep at the Bell, as I was going to Abingdon next morning:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150070"></xptr>they said they were going to Oxford, and went there to sleep also. I rang the Inn bell, and then found I had lost my watch: I had then discharged the coach, and paid 3 s. - upon missing my watch I called back the coach, which was going down Fetter-lane, and asked the coachman what he would take me back to Piccadilly for; he said 9 s.; I said it was an exorbitant demand, the fare being but 3 s.; I gave him a sovereign, and he gave me 17 s. - I intended to go back to see if I had left my watch at the Saloon, but I did not state my loss till I had got upon the box of the coach, and the captain inside - I then requested the prisoners to accompany me, as I had lost my watch: Druid immediately called me from the coach, and said,</p>
               <p>"You need not trouble yourself, I have taken care of it," and gave it to me - I had not given it to him. A watchman came up, and requested we would not disturb the people at the Bell inn - I told him I was going to sleep there. I then told the coachman to give me back my sovereign, and I gave him 1 s. or 1 s. 6 d. for his trouble. Druid then pulled down a sign-board by the side of the inn: the watchman said he would take us to the watch-house, and a scuffle ensued - the watchman sprung his rattle, and a second watchman came up. After waiting some time with them, Druid and myself were taken to the watch-house, but not M'Donough. Next morning, when I arrived at the Compter I discovered that I had lost my pocket-book, containing property to the amount of about 100 l.; it had been in my left hand coat pocket - there were four 5 l., and two 10 l. Abingdon notes; one Oxford 10 l. note; one Wallingford 10 l. note; and one 5 l. Bank of England note, with some others that I cannot swear to. There were some letters in it, addressed to myself. I mentioned my loss to Druid about seven o'clock in the morning, who replied,</p>
               <p>"We know the number of the coach, and I have no doubt we shall find it." I do not remember saying anything more about my loss till we were going to Guildhall, when I again named it to the constable, and asked if he had seen a pocket-book - Druid said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you make yourself so uneasy, we know the number of the coach, and doubt not when this affair is settled at Guildhall that we shall find it." We were taken before Mr. Alderman Thompson, and M'Donough appeared, and said he came to speak for the young man at the bar, and stated his name to be Captain M'Donough - the Alderman asked if he knew Druid; I believe the clerk took down what he said, but it was not read for the prisoner to sign; it was read to his solicitor at the second examination - he said he had known him for twelve months. The Alderman directed Druid to be searched, but I was not present - Fogg, the marshalman brought me the book in about five minutes afterwards; it was then empty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What is your name - 
               <persName id="t18240715-171-person1478">A. Thomas Weaver</persName>
            . I have never gone by the name of Charles. I have never been further in France than Calais. I have lived at Abingdon twelve years - I am not married. I have been in business on my own account nearly four years. When I came to London on the 27th of June I had about 190 l. I have never said my loss was 300 l., upon my solemn oath, neither in the Compter or elsewhere. I had come to town on business, and intended to return the next day, if I had not had this loss. I had taken my place, and intended to take this money home with me. I had a letter of license from my creditors three months ago - I do not know Mr. Gibson of Newgate-street - nor that there was a bill of 20 l. of mine out in London, and unpaid: there was a bill of 20 l. returned from Leeds after my return to Abingdon, which I paid - it was not returned because it was alledged to be a forgery - but there was a bill of 97 l. returned three months ago (which I had endorsed,) because the acceptance was forged: I paid it afterwards - I did not get Mr. Baker to pay it. I did not dine at the Saloon on the 30th of June, but at the Swan, public-house in Arundel-street, between three and four o'clock. I went to the Saloon between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; I had been attending to my business in the interval. I had made some purchases; one was at Messrs. Gillman and Lucas, in Newgate-street, which was the last I made - that was about half-past nine o'clock. I must have been walking about. I was in company with some ladies at the Saloon; one female was addressed by the name of 
               <persName id="t18240715-171-person1479">
                  Mary

            ; I do not know her other name - it might be Clark. There were many ladies and gentlemen there. A person of the name of Westbrook was at the Saloon before the prisoners came - we were taking some champaign with some Ladies; I paid for it out of my own money, which was in my pocket: we had three bottles of champaign; there was some Bucellas drank, but I did not drink any. I retired for a short time from the Saloon with

             about one o'clock, but I will swear I had the pocket-book when I returned. I did not say I went there between eleven and twelve o'clock: I was absent with her probably half an hour, and she returned at the same time with me, but did not sit down with me. She did not leave the Saloon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not accuse you of behaving ill to her, and give you a blow on the nose - A. No; I said if the landlord did not send for an officer to take her away, I would report the house - she made my nose bleed - the place is very well lighted, there was a gas chandelier nearly opposite the box - there are boxes on each side, and seats on each side of the boxes, the back of the boxes are from three to four feet high, and there are curtains to them - I do not know what is become of Mr. Westbrook, he is now out of business - I believe I saw him at Abingdon, a few days prior to my coming to London, it was yesterday week; I did not know that the prisoners wished him to be brought here - I know an affidavit was made to postpone the trial on account of the absence of four witnesses, but I do not recollect Westbrook's name being mentioned, or that my attorney undertook to bring him here - Westbrook resides at Abingdon, he did not attend any of the examinations - I told him on Monday week that I was going to town on this trial - I did not see him last Thursday - I did say I had left my watch in possession of Westbrook, when I retired from the Saloon till my return - it was returned to me, and Westbrook retired from the Saloon before I did; he had not dined with me; he came into the Saloon while the ladies were there; I do not know that he belonged to either of them; they appeared to be the companions of the prisoners - they were not in our company before the prisoners came - when we were going from the Saloon I paid the bill - it was between two and three pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150071"></xptr>Q. When you was going away with the woman did you not put your pocket-book on the table, upon one of the prisoners saying you had better - A. No. I said I was going to Oxford the next day, though I had taken my place for Abingdon - I swear I did not say I had a coach in readiness to take me down, and had relays of horses on the road; or that I was a Fellow of Brazen Nose College, that I recollect - I might have said some such thing in levity at the Compter, but do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the woman gave you the thump on the nose did you not say you was a nephew of the Lord Mayor, and would play the deuce with the Saloon and the keeper of it - A. No, I said I would report it to the Lord Mayor - I did not in the Saloon or any where else say that I was a Fellow of Brazen Nose College, a nephew to the Lord Mayor, or a man of large property; of 5000 l. a year - I never said so to my knowledge, but I will not take an oath of it - I was perfectly sober when I went to the Magistrate - I cannot recollect whether I said so or not - I was elated with wine, but I knew perfectly well what I was doing - I drove the coach - I was nearly three quarters of an hour going to the Bell - I did not when I was going away with the lady, put down my watch and request Druid to take care of it - I told them I should be happy to see them at Oxford or any where else - I do not know their motive for going to the Bell; they said they would sleep there, but I do not recollect that they said it was in consequence of my invitation - when we got to Holborn there was some disturbance between the watchmen and Druid, and I missed my watch; in consequence of that, I went to the end of Fetter-lane, and took the coach again - they had accompanied me to the coach, but it was afterwards that I told them of my loss - I had a small paper parcel in my hand - it were a part of my luggage - I dropped it, and it was picked up and put somewhere, and brought to me again at Guildhall; but I do not know who took it; we might be three quarters of an hour at the Bell; I paid the person who attended us at the Saloon - I do not know whether it was the landlord or a waiter; I paid with money which was taken from my trowsers pocket; I had some one pound Country notes there, but the five and ten pound notes were in the pocket-book; I have never said my loss was made up partly of sovereigns, and partly of notes, nor that sovereigns were in the pocket-book - I believe I said at the Compter that I lost my pocket-book containing one hundred pounds in cash, notes, and sovereigns; but there were no sovereigns in the pocket-book; if I stated so it was incorrect; I had sovereigns in my pocket when I went to the Saloon; I did not say my pocket-book had sovereigns in it; I did not pull down the board at the Inn myself; it was Druid; the watchman did not take me into custody till he had taken him - I do not think he had an opportunity of getting rid of the pocketbook, as the watchman was close at hand; the prisoner Druid sat by me; his father, who is the other prisoner, sat inside; the book was in my left inside pocket; the coachman sat behind; I sat by the fire at the Compter, and went to sleep; I was taken to Guildhall between eleven and twelve; I did not request the officers not to make the charge against me which had been made by the night officer, but only to say I was tipsy, and I would pay them for it; I asked him what was the charge, and he said</p>

               <p>"Disorderly;" I did not see the board in the coach; when we got to Guildhall, we were permitted to walk up and down the street for some time; Druid's father did not join us before we went to the Alderman; there was an examination on Wednesday and Thursday; the father attended voluntarily on the first day, and I believe the Alderman remanded him for re-examination; I believe they were ordered to be kept separate. I have never stated that my loss amounted to 300 l. or nearly that; that I repeat deliberately, and swear that I had my pocket-book when I returned with

            . I am a hackney chariot driver, and lodge in Titchfield-court - my number is 722 - I took up these three gentlemen at the Saloon on the morning in question, about half-past three o'clock - I rode behind,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150072"></xptr>and Mr. Weaver drove to the Old Bell, Holborn: it must have been past four o'clock when we got there: Mr. Weaver paid me, and I was discharged, and called back in about ten minutes after, by him; he wanted to take me back to the Saloon - he said he was going back for a watch and something else: Druid produced a watch in about five minutes after; Weaver took it, and gave me 1 s., and discharged me, saying,</p>
               <p>"You are a good fellow." I saw Mr. Druid at the Saloon, with a pocket-book, trying to put it into his pocket; it was a leather one, with a steel clasp - it was unclasped: M'Donough was close by him - I never saw the book afterwards to my knowledge: I saw Fogg with one afterward; but when I first saw it, I was at my horses' heads, and could not be positive that the one I saw afterwards was the same - it was similar to it: Mr. Weaver called the coach - the doors of the Saloon were shut, and I did not see the landlord; Weaver was not so drunk but he knew what he was doing: he took the right change for the sovereign.</p>

             then read a very long defence, stating that he had not wished his name to be known, from being in pecuniary embarrassments; that if the prosecutor had ever had the notes in his pocket-book, it was very doubtful after he had been for hours in suspicious company, if they had ever reached him; and if he had taken them, it was not likely he should have kept the book; that when the prosecutor left the Saloon with the woman, he left his watch and pocket-book on the table; and it was entirely through his having forgotten the book, that he had not returned it to him with the watch.</p>
               <p>M'DONOUGH's Defence. I took the earliest opportunity of stating that this was my son, soon after we got to the watch-house; when I entered the Saloon it was from curiosity, being a depicter of the scenes of life; we were invited by Mr. Weaver to take some wine, and were introduced to the women as his old acquaintances; he stated that he was a fellow of Brazen Nose College, and being myself brought up at Oriel, it was a sort of tie to me, and I sat down with him. A crime of this nature was not likely to be perpetrated in the broad light of day, and while exposed to the gaze of suspicious watchmen.</p>

            . I am one of the watchmen of Giltspur-street Compter. I remember the prisoner and the prosecutor being brought there - the prosecutor stated that he was going down to Oxford the next day, to take out his degrees at some College, but I don't remember which; he said he was worth 5000 l. a-year: I don't know that he said he was a nephew of the Lord Mayor - I remember his sending me to the Queen's-head Tavern with a letter: I gave it to the waiter, who took it to the landlord, who was in bed - he sent word down that it should be attended to; he then sent me back there again to borrow ten sovereigns - the answer was, that the landlord would get up and wait upon him; I heard him say he had lost 300 l. in notes and sovereigns and bills; he appeared a little intoxicated; I said the notes and sovereigns he might not get back, but the bills he might, if he knew the names on them; I heard the subject of the pocket-book mentioned several times in the coach; they were not much intoxicated then; the night before they were able to talk and walk.</p>

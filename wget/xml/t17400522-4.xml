When I returned, I missed four Books, mentioned in the Indictment. In the Afternoon I enquired after them, and heard that such Books had been offered to be pawned at Mr Stone's, in Long-Acre. I went thither, and found four Books of the same Title; I believe they are mine, but I have no private Mark in them, so I cannot be positive to them. I am sure I had four such Books in my Shop when I went out; and when I returned, they were gone.</p>

            . I live at Mr Stone's, the Pawnbroker. On Saturday the 26th of April, the Prisoner brought me these four Books to be pawned, and I took them in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not disown that I pledged them.</p>
               <p>Balderstone. These are the Books the Prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>Rial. I believe they are mine, but I am not positive to them, because there is no private Mark in them.</p>
               <p>Balderstone. The Prisoner pawn'd them to me for 7 s. I asked him whose they were, and he told me they were his own. After I had taken them in, I had some Information that they were stole, and the Prisoner coming again, to pawn another Book, I stopped him; and the Book he brought the second Time, belongs to another Man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Day before I pawn'd these Books, I met a Man, who hawks Books about the Streets, and bought the odd Book of him: Then I asked him about these 4 Books, and he brought them to me the next Day, at an Alehouse, and I bought them; but afterwards wanting Money, I pledg'd them. As to bringing my Friends to my Character, - the Prosecutor lull'd me up, in Hopes that I should not be prosecuted, and I did not care to disgrace my Family, by letting them know of this Misfortune. When I was sent to Newgate, the Prosecutor maintain'd me, and I was remov'd from the Common, to the Master-Side, and should have had nothing but the Prison-Allowance, if the Prosecutor had not given me Money.</p>
               <p>Rial. I did go to see him in Prison, and gave him a Shilling.</p>
               <p>The Titles of the Books were read, and agreed with the Description in the Indictment. <rs id="t17400522-4-verdict21" type="verdictDescription">

I was about half an Hour from my Stall, and when I return'd I miss'd the French Dictionary, and got a Porter to look after my Stall, while I went about among the Trade, to desire them to stop it, if it should be offered to Sale. On Monday Morning Mr Wright, a Bookseller in Exeter-Exchange, inform'd me, that he believed my Book was at Mr Stone's, the Pawnbroker's. I went thither, and saw it, and told him it was my Book. The Book which I lost, I found at Mr Stone's. This is the Book, I believe 'tis mine; there were two Marks in it, when I lost it, which were made with a Black-lead Pencil, on the 2 Covers, at the Beginning and End of the Book; but they are now rubb'd out, and so they were, when I saw it at the Pawn-broker's. I can't swear positively to it, because the Marks are rubb'd out; but I believe 'tis my Book.</p>
               <p>Balderstone. The Prisoner brought this Book to me to pledge, on Friday the 25th of April.

I can't say I looked on the Covers of the Book, but it has been in my Custody ever since that Time, and I rubb'd out no Marks. Mr. Warr found it at my House, the Monday after I took it in.</p>

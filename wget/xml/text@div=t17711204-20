On Saturday the 16th of November I was in the counting-house at Bennett's Hill; about one o'clock I heard the maid talk of a strange man coming down out of the men's room. I asked what was the matter? The maid said, a strange man came down out of the men's room. I said, why did not you stop him? She said she did not think of it, but told Sykes, and he was gone after him. In about ten minutes I saw Sykes bring him back. We brought him into the counting-house, and asked him what business he had there. He said he was not there. I said I wou'd prove that. I bid the men go into their rooms, and see what they had lost.

             had the care of that money, because the man it belonged to had no box; he it was that said he had lost his money. I shook the prisoner's pocket, and Mr. Sykes, that brought him in, said he has a pair of silver buckles in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040012"></xptr> pocket. I asked the prisoner where they were? He took them out, and gave them to me. (The buckles produced.) I sent for a constable. He said he had no money; he said he had had nothing to eat for several days, and that, he said, was the reason of his coming there. When the constable came, he examined his breeches pocket; he found two-pence halfpenny only. I told him we must have some more money. In shaking of him, we found, in the lining of his waistcoat, two guineas, six shillings in silver, and nine-pence in halfpence; and we found the thimble, which is

               <p>Q. Which way did he go?</p>
               <p>Evans. He stood on the stairs about the third step; while I turned to the kitchen, he went out; I run and look'd after him, and went and told the head clerk, Mr. Sykes, to see after him: He was brought back to the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same man that was brought back?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes.</p>

               <p>Evans. He had it in the lining; we were going to cut the lining, but he said he would shew us the way into it.</p>

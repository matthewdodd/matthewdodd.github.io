At 6.30, on Saturday, 3rd October, I was in Lambeth Walk—I was called to Burdett Street—I found the prisoner sitting down up stairs, and she was given into my charge by Mrs. Bliss for causing the death of her child—I asked her what she had to say—she said, "I did not intend to do what I did when I threw the knife across the table"—I went down stairs, and saw the child lying dead—there was blood on his left side—it was a boy named John Buckney—I took the prisoner to the station—she said she was very sorry.</p>

I am the landlord of 5, Burdett Street—between 5 and 6 o'clock on this Saturday evening, I heard screams, and ran out of the room, and saw the prisoner in the passage, holding the deceased—he was bleeding—I asked her what she had done, and she said, "Good God! I have stabbed my boy"—we carried the boy into the yard for two or three minutes, and then I brought him in again—I said I believed he was dying, and sent for a doctor—he died before the doctor came—I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Messrs. Roth, of Switze rland—my place of business is in Queen Victoria Street—I have had business transactions with the defendant—he traded as Casper and Co., hardware merchant—in August, 1879, he owed my firm about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods supplied, and on 12th August he gave me this bill for 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., drawn on 8th August, on Jasper and Co., and accepted by his brother, payable at three months, at the Central Bank, Newgate Street branch—on 17th July I had another bill for 309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>;. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from their firm at four months—the first bill fell due on 18th November, with the three days' grace, and the second on 20th November—about 10th November the prisoner called on me in Victoria Street and said that he could not meet the bill of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which fell due on the 18th, as he had not enough cash at the bank, and asked whether we would assist him to take it up—after some conversation Mr. Shaffler, who was there, allowed him the money, and 434<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was. paid to him, for which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188009130014"></xptr>
               <p>these are his receipts. (<hi rend="italic">These were dated July 1st, for</hi> 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 279<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">making together</hi> 434<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) On 15th November he came again and said that he would bring the money from Birmingham for the bill of 309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 19th, but he could not promise it for sure, and we should have to renew it like the other—I saw him again on the 19th on his return from Birmingham, and he said he had only received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we should have to assist him again to take the bill up, and asked for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he had a small balance in the bank—Mr. Shaffler asked him if the former bill of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—he said that it was, and it was all right—I asked where it was—he said it was in his possession—I then gave him this open cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the London and Westminster Bank, which I had received from Mr. Jones, a customer, and he gave me this receipt—this endorsement on the cheque is the prisoner's signature—I saw him again that evening, but not afterwards till he was in custody in June—the bill for 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was returned, and the firm had to meet it—Mr. Shaffler took the other bill up for honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Shaffler has become a partner since the beginning of this year—Mr. Roth, Mr. Adler, and Mr. Vigier are the other partners—none of them are here—we keep no banking account in London, all banking business is done through banks on the Continent—Mr. Shaffler was the representative of the firm when I first had to do with it—I was a clerk under his control, and we lived together some time—I became agent before he became a partner—I was on intimate terms with him for a long time before—he was there before me—Charles Julius Casper attended to the hardware business in Germany—I have brought the bill book to-day—I did not produce it at the last trial—the first transactions were for small quantities of watches, and the credit was a fortnight or 30 days—Charles Julius Casper was on intimate terms with Mr. Shaffler, and in August, 1879, he went to Switzerland to see the firm—it is not a fact that instead of paying 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—Mr. Roth and Mr. Adler came over to see Mr. Casper in August, 1879, and I was present once at the Charing Cross Hotel—I was not there when a proposition was made that Mr. Casper should be the representative agent of Roth and Co. under my supervision—I never heard Casper propose that Mr. Roth and Mr. Adler should go and examine into the state of his business in Germany—Mr. Ellis is employed by Mr. Dobree, the pawnbroker, of Fitzroy Square—I was confronted with him on the last occasion when the Jury did not agree—I never knew of Casper pawning watches with Mr. Dobree till after<lb></lb>wards—I only know of one pawning, that was in the beginning of June, 1879, but I found afterwards that he had pawned watches there in June, which had come from Roth's on approbation, and I discovered other pawnings a long time afterwards—I have got the book at home of watches passed on approbation to Casper—Mr. Jones is not here, but his manager is—Jones's cheque was not for a pawning transaction, it was for watches sold—he is a gold refiner and jeweller—he does not make advances on watches to us—he did so once—he lent us money and had the watches; he could sell them on our account—I made inquiries about Casper's family in Germany—his father is a most respectable person—watches were not con<lb></lb>signed to him at double the market price in London, always at a very low price—I do not deny that he complained of the prices as every other customer does—I have not been present time after time when Mr. Shaffler</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188009130015"></xptr>
               <p>made him write acceptances to send to Switzerland—there was no such thing as an accommodation bill for Roth and Co., there was no drawing on him, and no request for other persons to give bills—I know Holford; he is not here—he is a friend of Casper's; he did not say that Casper had written to him to come and see him at the Horseshoe and Magpie, but I saw the letter—I never saw an acceptance signed by him for the accommodation of Roth—Shaffler was in London during these transactions—the only com<lb></lb>plaint against Casper is in relation to these two bills—I know nothing of Casper telling Shaffler that it was impossible to go on having these charges made against him to meet bills, and that the matter must come to an end—I know nothing of a conversation like that—Roth and Co. were never in difficulties; I know nothing of their requesting that Shaffler should draw if possible for only 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as their credit was not sufficient to get bills discounted for a larger sum—Mr. Wenge was at the police-court but was not examined—it was arranged in August, when Casper said that they could not meet their bills, that they should be renewed from time to time, and Charles Julius Casper proposed to take the agency for England and put me in as stockkeeper, but nothing was said about paying off the amount run up against him—he was not to give the security of the hardware business, but I believe it was said that it was like putting the two businesses together—I saw bills drawn by Casper and accepted by Young, of Leadenhall Street, but I do not know whether they were accommodation bills—they were posted off to Switzerland—this bill for 309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is in English, but it has on in German "In need with" so and so—that means that if the bill is not taken up by Casper and Co., it goes back to the bankers—it happened several times in September and October that bills after they fell due at the notary's were taken up—they may have been for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I have seen a letter written to Mr. Adler which was found on Casper, but Wroth and Co. did not communicate with me as to anything found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> All the bills the prisoner accepted were for goods supplied to his firm by ours—this is the ledger containing the transactions between us and the prisoner—we had dealings with Mr. Jones, and got a cheque from him for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the very day that we gave it to the prisoner—it was not a pawnbroking transaction—Mr. Vigier is in Switzerland; he had nothing to do with the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Switzerland, and am a member of the firm of Roth and Co.—I knew of these two bills being accepted by the prisoner's firm—before the bill of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. became due in November the prisoner called at our place of business in London, and told me that he was unable to meet it, and I advanced him 432<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards it, so that it should not be returned to our firm—he said that he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his own—the bill became due on 19th November, and on the 18th he said "I have not got sufficient to pay this bill," and asked me if I could advance him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards it—I said "I can do so if the bill of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been paid"—he said that it was paid, and it was in his possession—I believed that state<lb></lb>ment, and gave him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I got from Jones and Son, as we have no banker in London—that was a trade transaction; we sold them some watches for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., got an open cheque, gave it to the prisoner, and he gave us his receipt—that was the last time I saw him—I found afterwards that the two bills had not been taken up, and we had to take them up ourselves—I</p>

               <p>remained in London till December 31, 1879—I tried to find him, and had got a warrant from a Magistrate—besides these two bills he owes us between 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Vigier's position was inferior to mine—I do not get a commission on sales—I guaranteed bad debts to the amount of half only on salary—I was very intimate with the prisoner's brother, Charles Julius—he came to Switzerland for a holiday in August, 1878, but I did not propose it—I introduced him to the partners—I did not press large quantities of watches upon him, or point out to him watches which would not sell there, being unfinished, which he was to take and do the best he could with—Roth and Co. did not say that they would take bills for six months and renew them; the rule was for thirty days and sixty days prompt—I obtained from Casper his acceptance, and sent them to Switzer land—Casper's bills are not kept separately; they are mixed—this bill is dated November 26th, 1877 (<hi rend="italic">The witness picked out all the bills of Casper and Co.</hi>)—it is true that we only complain with regard to the two bills which are before the Jury—no bill of our firm was dishonoured by Casper and Co, and afterwards taken up with cash when in the hands of a notary or an English endorsee, before June, 1879—it is impossible for me to tell how many bills were taken up from the notary—I always sent the bills to Switzerland; there never was an acceptance signed by him and given to me—I first saw Mr. Ellis I believe in June, 1879; he came and said that Casper had shown him an invoice and receipt of our firm, and asked if he had authority to pawn the goods; I said that he had—I have supplied him two or three times with watches to meet acceptances, by pawning—I do not know whether Wenge knew that they were to go to the pawnbroker; he may have—the entries are made in the appropriation book, where we enter every watch that goes out, and we have a special book for Casper's—Casper never told us what he got for the watches, and it was immaterial to us so long as he was solvent—he pretended that in three or four days he was getting money from his bankers in Germany, and he represented that a friend of his was going to advance the money—Mr. Roth and Mr. Adler did not come over in June; I believe it was August or September; Mr. Vigier did not come to London in 1879 I believe; he came in 1878; we spoke of business at the Charing Cross Hotel—Vigier was here, but he was never put in the witness-box—Mr. Lewis was in the case last September and Mr. Kelly—I was not desirous that the prisoner should obtain goods, from other persons and pawn them and redeem the pawnings at Dobree's—I did not propose that he should get goods from Mr. Perrier, of Crosby Hall Chambers, or from Mr. Hine, of Thavies Inn, or from De la Volta, or from Mr. Chaplin, of Rienne, and turn them immediately into money, so as to clear the pawnings—I did not give him the address of parties in Switzerland—I was there two vacations—I mean to say that the names of a number of watchmakers at Solure, in Switzerland, were not given to him; I did not swear so at the last trial—I never suggested that they were to get watches—the bill of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. does not refer to a special parcel of watches given to Casper Brothers for the purpose of pawning; that parcel was bought by N. Casper, of Switzerland, without my knowledge—we never entered these bills in our bill-book in Switzerland; it is not advised as being done on 15th November under date of 8th August; it is not entered at all—I knew that the bill was current; I have not got it because</p>

               <p>it has nothing to with our English business—he received the last amount on 15th November, and the bill was due on the 18th—we were in such a condition of finance that we parted with the money three days before it was wanted—November 19th was the last day he saw me, not November 17th; I swear that—I did not say on the last trial that the watches were placed in the hands of Jones for him to give us the money on them with a right for him to redeem them, paying our money—we did not let Jones have watches on that occasion with a right to redeem them—I admitted on the last trial pawning watches with Jones—we have pawned less than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of watches with Jones—I do not believe I told the prisoner that until I got the cheque the watches were Jones's, and I could not let him go—I sent the cheque after Casper at 4 p.m.—I do not know that I sent it by Vigier or that Vigier brought the receipt—I saw him on the 19th, but not on the 18th—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Casper's father dated 29th July, 1880, inviting him to meet me at Cologne—I say in it (<hi rend="italic">In German</hi>), "Nevertheless it even now pains me much to have to open my hand to the criminal conviction of a dear friend"—I saw the father—no proposal had been made as to how much the friends would pay—this is a correct translation (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a parcel of musical boxes was consigned to us from Switzerland early in 1879, and in October we passed them on to him and took the bill—the goods were sold to Beaumont, of Goswell Road, but we did not have the money—it was proposed at Charing Cross that we should take the agency of Roth and Co., and he might place Mr. Wenge in as comptroller, but we never had the least idea of doing that; we saw it was a swindle—I have sworn-that up to 15th November we had perfect confidence in Casper Brothers, but we never trusted them after October; we had confidence that they would pay their debts—I said that I would not allow them to be the representatives—I was not a partner then; I was made a partner in 1880—I was married in March, 1880—as early as September or October, 1879, I told Casper Brothers that it would ruin me if these pawnings were not cleared up, and Wroth was to know nothing about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner's firm always met their acceptances up to June; after that some of them had to be taken up by Casper Brothers at the notary's—I know that the firm was pressed for money—the prisoner was to get money to pay the bill from a friend in Germany, on the security of the watches he had from us—Mr. Ellis came to know whether he was in lawful possession of the watches, and we said that he was—after he got his money from Germany he was to redeem the watches—if he had not taken it up we should have had to take it up ourselves—I was not a partner then, but I had full power to do what I liked—I made Roths acquainted with it in September or October—I saw the prisoner on 19th November; I am perfectly sure of that—the letter in German is dated 29th July; that was after the prisoner was in custody—I had given evidence then, and gone back to Switzerland—I was at one time on very friendly terms with the prisoner—I thought in November that he was solvent, and able to meet the bills—I have never received one farthing from him since he went away, or from his bankruptcy estate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present at the last trial at the defendant's request—the prosecution have not been to me since asking me what I can prove—when Casper came to give me his card—I am almost certain he came first in June; he had a parcel of watches, and I took them in, and gave him the money—he showed me Roth and Co.'s invoice, and my impression was that I was taking them from them—I only saw Shaffler—I only went to Roth and Co. on that one occasion; there was another person there, but I cannot recognise him—I was not called at the last trial—it is usual for me to make inquiries—Jones paid me back my money.</p>

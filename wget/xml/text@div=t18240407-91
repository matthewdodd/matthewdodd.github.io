            's canteen, as my son had missed it. I asked him whether it was a single plate - he said he believed it was. I noticed that he appeared agitated, and said I should be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070044"></xptr>there presently, and that it was all right, thinking that he would then go back to my son, which he did. I followed him - I called him into the counting-house, and asked him if he knew any thing about it, as I missed a great number of things. My son told him it was only three weeks ago since he had ordered that canteen to be locked up in the warehouse; he said he had never seen the canteen open. I said I should endeavour to find it out. I went for an officer, who came and apprehended him. He denied every thing. We searched his lodgings, and found a waistcoat. We took him before a magistrate, and he was committed - and on the 20th I received a letter from him, and in consequence of that letter, I went to him in Tothill-fields, with my wife. I asked what he had sent for me for - I did not threaten or promise him at all. He said he had sent for me to ask if I would forgive him, and that if I would, he would tell me all the truth, and keep nothing back. (I had found two of the spoons then.) I began to tell him what I had found, and said, I wondered that he could ask me to forgive him. I asked what he had done with the rest of the plate, saying, that we had found a portion of it, and it was of no use to deny it; he said he had every reason to believe that the rest of the plate was melted - that he had met a man in the street who took him to a jew named Philips, in a court in Poulteney-street, where he had sold it in small parcels - that he at first took six large table-forks, for which the man gave him 2 l. 7 s. I wrote down in pencil what he said, and my son copied it.</p>

             continued. He said he sold the six forks on one day for 2 l. 7 s., on another day a waiter, four tea, two salt, and four egg-spoons, for which the Jew gave him 1 l. 19 s.; the next lot he said he had taken was six desert orks, for which they gave him 18 s.; that he afterwards took sugar-tongs and tea-spoons, not mentioning how many, and he did not recollect the price they gave him. I asked what he had done with the five duplicates which we had traced to different pawnbrokers', where the plate had been taken out the week before - he said, that on being introduced to this Jew, he made him a present of the duplicates to give to a friend of his, who was to use them - that his own wife had pawned the things, and said one of the duplicates was lost; he told me where one of the whips was. He sent for me again on the Wednesday following; I then told him we had found a quantity of other things, and did he mean to tell me who took him to the receiver's - he directed me to Vine-street, but we did not find the man.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner took me to his lodging on the 16th of March; his wife was not then living with him - he said she was dead. I searched his box, and found a waistcoat, which Mr. Pratt, sen., who was present, claimed. I found a doctor's bill, at the back of which is a memorandum, which led me to Morrit's and other pawnbrokers. I found a new pair of men's shoes in his box - he at first said that they belonged to a woman who came to see him, and perhaps would be his wife, but afterwards that they were his wife's. I found his wife in another man's room, and afterward accompanied her to Notley's. I found some duplicates in her box, also a brush and a pair of scissars.</p>

            . The brush is my father's, and I believe the scissars to be so; the whip is his. I manage the business in Bond-street. The lowest value of the six large table-knives and forks is 6 l. The value of the lot he said he sold to the Jew for 1 l. 19 s. is 5 l. 4 s.</p>

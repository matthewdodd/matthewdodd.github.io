               <p>Q. Did you lose a horse at any time? - A. Yes, I lost a white chesnut horse between the 11th and 12th of last month, I missed him on the 12th out of 'squire Budgeon's fields, about a quarter of a mile from my house; I bought him on the 13th of December last, he was very poor when I bought him, and I turned him out to grass.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100058"></xptr>it was taken - A. No; I owned the horse when I saw him at the livery-stable, at Worship-street.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On Tuesday night, the 11th of June, me and Bishop went out on duty in the streets; we were in Shoreditch about two o'clock in the morning returning home; on Wednesday morning, the 12th, as we were coming just past the turnpike-bar, within about thirty yards of the bar, I saw the prisoner riding this said horse, it is a bay or a chesnut, I am not a judge of the colours of horses, it was a gelding; he was riding it without a saddle, with this cloth buckled on it, it is a piece of an old horse rug, with an old sirsingle, made of a piece of leather belonging to a coach bridle; he got up to the turnpike-gate, and the bar was shut; I then with Bishop went up to him, I asked him where he was going with that horse; he said he was going to take it into the Borough; I asked him whereabouts there; he said, to Mr. Huggins, at the Catherine Wheel inn; I asked him where he had brought it from; he said, from Kensington; I then asked him from whom at Kensington; he said he could not tell; I told him he must come four miles out of his road to come from Kensington through Shoreditch to the Borough; he said he did not know; I asked him which way he had come; he could not tell, he pointed out some different roads that I did not know the names of; I then asked him if he had any turnpike-tickets that he had passed through to come from there; he said he had, he produced me this ticket; on this ticket is Old Road toll, Ball's Pond, No. 619, with a one on it; one penny it appears to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the direct road, supposing he came from Stoke Newington? - A. It is the direct road from the field into town from where these people have told you, and within about four hundred yards distance from the field, and this gate is but a little more than a quarter of a mile from the field. I then told him, without he gave me a better account of it, I must detain him; I then took him to the watch-house; I took the horse to a livery-stable right facing the Office, and left it in the care of the head ostler there. On the next morning I took the prisoner before the Magistrate, and before he was brought to the Office I saw him in the public-house adjoining; I said to him then, Buckman, have you any better account to give of this horse to-day; Bishop was then standing by me; he said, I will now tell you the truth, I met a man at the Catherine-Wheel inn, in the Borough, last night about five o'clock, (meaning on the Tuesday night, this was on Wednesday morning I was asking him,) and the man desired him to go to the Queen's Head, in the Green-lane; he went there, and waited till eleven o'clock; the man did not come while he was waiting, but as he was coming from the house, at a small distance, the man met him, and the man desired him to wait in the road, and he would go and fetch him a horse; he went away from him a little while, and returned to him with this horse, and desired him to take it to the Catherine Wheel inn, in the Borough, to Mr. Huggins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he walked there, or rode there, to the Green-lane? - A. His stockings were so clean, I did not think he walked there; I asked him if he had ever seen him before; he said, never till that day; I asked him if he knew where he lived, and he said, no; the horse was kept three or four days in the stable where it was first put; the officer and we were making inquiry about it, to hear if any body had lost a horse; Mrs. Crawley's foreman inquired first, and when Mrs. Crawley came, the horse was in a square stable, with eight or nine stalls in each angle; there were thirteen or fourteen, or more horses in it; she knew the horse perfectly well, although its tail had been cut considerably since she saw it, and when she called him Jack, he turned his head to her; from the appearance of the horse's tail it had been cut with a knife, by the haggled appearance. I asked the prisoner where he lived himself, and he said, at the Black Horse, at Stockwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he was? - A. He said he had been a post-boy; I asked him what road he had drove, and when I put that question to him, he did not answer me; he said that he came out of Kent formerly, and that he had lodged at this house two years and a half; I then told him I should go and inquire his character; I went there, and could not find him out.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the same horse that you shewed Mrs. Crawley? - A. Yes, the very same.</p>
               <p>- BISHOP sworn. - Q. Do you know any thing more? - A. No; I assisted Vickery in taking him into custody, I heard the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutrix.) The horse that you were shewn by Vickery, are you sure that it is your horse? - A. I am quite certain of it, I could tell it from five hundred.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100059"></xptr>and called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I occupy No. 6, Hare-court, and have done so for five years, during all which time No. 2 has been a brothel—I knew Mrs. Robin<lb></lb>son, who was convicted here in March; and at the latter part of the time that she was there, I have seen the prisoners there—I have seen men, and women who I knew to be prostitutes, go in together at different times of the night and day—I was never in the house—I have seen Jones there for three years off and on—I have heard most ridiculous conversation there, and most undoubted bad language—the neighbours have complained—I have been aroused in the night many times by the rows—the house is a nuisance to the neighbourhood, and I have complained of it as such—the younger prisoner has been there since May, and I have seen her take money from prostitutes of Aldersgate-street—I have only seen Jones acting as servant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 125). I have known the house, No. 2, Hare-court, since 1848, as a common brothel—Mrs. Robinson, who was convicted here last March, was the lessee, and is now—the prisoners acted as servants—it was still a brothel up to last Saturday, when I took the prisoners into custody—I have seen prostitutes go in and out repeatedly both with and without men—I have seen both the prisoners take money—there have been complaints continually about the <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> there, and the house has been indicted six or seven times—I went into the house in March last, and saw what was very improper; a person named Curtis was keeping the house then, and Howard was there.</p>

I knew Mrs. Robinson well, and the prisoners as servants to her—I had Howard in custody before, on a charge against the same house, at the London Sessions, and she had three months—the house has been indicted a number of times—I was in the house once when two people were found in a most improper position—I ap<lb></lb>prehended another woman named <hi rend="italic">Kitty</hi>, who is since dead—Jones was there then, but she was not named in the warrant, and I did not take her—the prisoners have managed the house lately—I told them the charge, and Howard said that she had two small children, and was obliged to do some<lb></lb>thing for a living—Jones said that it was not their house, they were only acting for others—I have seen the lease, it is dated 9th Feb. 1849, and is in the name of Ann Robinson—inspector Brannan produced it at the Old-street police station; he found it in another brothel.</p>

I was down at the Admiralty; he was about the place; I asked him who he belonged to; he was close to my stall; I asked him to go of an errand for me; he went; I asked him if he had any parents, he told me he had a grandmother that lived in Holborn; he lived with his grandmother; I asked him what he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before you asked him to go of an errand for you - A. Yes. I asked him whether his grandmother would be uneasy if he went of an errand, he told me no; that his grandmother went out a charing, that she paid for his lodging, that she was a week sometimes before she came home, and that he ran of errands for any one for a little victuals; he had nobody to give him any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ him to go on errands for you - A. Yes, on that day; not to give him any wages; I gave him lodging for two or three nights; I took him to lodge with me on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue to lodge with you till the Thursday - A. Yes, and I employed him some way or other.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thursday morning what time did you leave your lodging to go to your stand - A. About eleven o'clock; the prisoner went with me, he helped me to carry some of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him his victuals - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you left this room of yours what had you left in it this morning belonging to you - A. I left three pound in my box; I had counted it the over-night, intending to go to market, but I did not; the box was locked, I took the key with me. The lock of the box was not broken open, it was the hinge that was undone; I had locked my room door and taken the key with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you did with the key of your room after you got to the stall - A. I left it on my stand; I usually placed it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner his victuals with you there that day - A. Yes, at the stand, near about two o'clock; he had not finished his dinner when he went away from my stand; he went away of his own accord. I was not advised of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went away did he say that he was going - A. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before you went to your room - A. It may be about ten minutes after I missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been absent from your stand when you missed him - A. About ten minutes after he was gone some suspicion struck me; I immediately went through Scotland-yard to my lodgings; it was within five minutes walk to my lodgings from my stand. When I got to my room I went to my door, it was locked the same as I left it; I looked through the window, I saw my box in the middle of the room, on the floor; I had left it underneath the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your key with you to unlock your room door - A. No; I had left it on the stand; the boy had that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you went to your room to see for the boy, you did not take the key with you - A. No, I went back to my stand to look for my key, I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you looked in the window, did you get in the window - A. Yes; after I got back from the stall the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something about the hinges - A. No, not the hinges; the hasp was loose; two small nails were drawn from the hasp, by which means the box could be opened. I missed out of my box all the money I have mentioned; there were none left behind, and I missed two silk handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they good ones - A. Yes, pretty good ones. There were other things in the box, but he had not meddled with them; only a small window curtain that the money was tied up in, the curtain had money in it. I was coming out of the window again, there was a small pane of glass out, I looked down and saw the key on the floor; there was a basket there, it had dropped in a small-basket; it appeared to me to have been broken through the hole in the window into that basket; I then went into Holborn, to where he told me his grandmother lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he told you what part of Holborn - A. No, he had not. I found him about the middle of Holborn, it was then between four and five; he was then on the contrary side of the street; I crossed the street and laid hold of him, he did not see me; he had one of the handkerchiefs tied about his neck, and the other handkerchief he had a shirt in. As soon as I took hold of him he got away from me: he had the curtain, and some of the money in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw a handkerchief about his neck, and another handkerchief that he had, did you see the curtain at that time with something in it - A. Yes, he had it on his arm; when he got away from the gentleman he fell down, then I got hold of him again; I got him further on and then I saw Hancock the officer.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any thing of this boy - A. About four o'clock in the day, in Hatton Garden, I saw Mrs. Saunders and the boy, they were making for the office, he was delivered to me with this little curtain, containing penny pieces; I searched him on the spot; I took this silk handkerchief off his neck, and a quantity of penny pieces and halfpence in his breeches pocket; I took this silk handkerchief and shirt from him; he had bought the shirt somewhere, it seemed as if it had been laying in a shop window, by the flies being upon it. I found to the amount in halfpence of one shilling and seven-pence halfpence, and six shillings in his breeches pocket, a good and a bad sixpence, which the prosecutrix swore to before the magistrate, and a piece of paper, which she said was part of the paper which the silver was wrapped up in, in her box; the curtain was delivered up to me, in it was seven shillings and eleven-pence halfpenny in copper, the major part good, they have been in my custody ever since, and he confessed having done the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about his grandmother - A. No, nor he would not say where he lived before he went to this woman; he would not answer any question.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at the two silk handkerchiefs - A. This is the handkerchief that was taken off his neck, there is a mark of paint on it in the middle, I know it to be mine; I have had this handkerchief a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the handkerchief that contains the shirt - A. This other handkerchief is mine, there is a small hole torn with a pin; there is none of the money I can speak to except that sixpence, this I had by me a good while, it is a very bad one, with two or three little notches in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday night Mrs. Saunders had been out all night and got tipsey, she came home at night and had her pockets full of halfpence; she pulled her halfpence out of her pocket, and laid them on the table, and let me count them. She immediately felt in her pocket for the key of her box, she could not find the key of her box; she got a knife and wrenched the hasp of the box open; she pulled the halfpence out of the box and bid me count them: I counted them and there were only fifteen shillings; she said in the box there ought to be three pound; she said I had taken the rest all but fifteen shillings, and she said she would have me taken before the justice the next day; I told her I had no more; she searched me all over, and then we went to bed that night. Then the next day she took her stall out about eleven o'clock, she had been telling me she would get Mr. Hancock to take me up. About two o'clock we had our dinner at the stall, and then she began correcting and beating me, she would let me have no dinner hardly, then I said I would not do any thing without I had my dinner; she said I should have no more dinner, and if I did not do as I should do she would have me taken up, then I told her I had none of the money, I said there were only fifteen shillings in the box. Then she sent me home with a bundle that came from the washerwoman, she gave me key of the door, I unlocked the door and put the bundle in; I brought the key back to the stall, then she sent me home again with one of the fruit baskets; I took the fruit basket down in the cellar in Mr. Constable's house; she told me to bring some apples with me as I came back, and coming back I had the misfortune to let the apples down, then she said she would take me up for letting the apples down, then she went home and got the money that I had counted the over night out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with her then - A. I was left behind wiping the apples that I had let down. She went home and got the money in her pocket; after I had got all the apples up she said she meaned to take me to Worship-street, or some other place, and have me tried; then she and the woman at the next stall were going to to lock me up in the parlour untill she had got her stall away, and got her fruit in to take me to the office. I ran away from her, and she followed me into Holborn, about Leather-lane, she stopped me there, then she was taking me to Hatton Garden, down Leather-lane she met Mr. Hancock, and she gave Mr. Hancock the fifteen shillings in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that she produced the fifteen shillings in halfpence - A. Yes. Then Mr. Hancock searched me, Mr. Hancock found in my pocket six shillings and six-pence, the six shillings and sixpence was what I took in the course of the day time at the stall in fruit; she told Mr. Hancock that I had broken open the box and took the money; then they went to a public house, and there they sat and drank together for about half an hour, Mr. Hancock and the prosecutrix, and then I was locked up at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mrs. Saunders, did any thing pass with the prisoner about your money - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him say that you came home on the Wednesday night tipsey - A. It was no such thing, no: he never saw me count my money, I opened my box; I unlocked it, I had they key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull any halfpence out of the box to count - A. Yes, but he was never within, I never let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310021"></xptr>him see the inside of my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull any halfpence out of the box to count - A. Yes, but he was never within; I never let him see the inside of my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him on the Wednesday night of having taken any money - A. No, nor I never threatened him with taking him to the justice, I never threatened him with sending for Mr. Hancock; I never knew him, I had nothing at all to accuse him, I had missed nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you had missed or not you had not told him so - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When at dinner did you correct him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you refuse to let him have any more dinner - A. No, he left part of his dinner on the stall. I said nothing to him about having him taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him home with any bundle of any washerwoman - A. No, I have no washerwoman, nor did I give him the key of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him home with a fruit basket - A. No, nor was he to bring any apples; I never sent him home by himself; I never saw him again until I saw him in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you give Hancock the halfpence - A. He fell over some stones, and the curtain with the halfpence fell out of his hand, I picked them up and gave them to Mr. Hancock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take money for you at the stall - A. No, I never left him at the stall, he was only to run of a few errands. I am sure I had this money in my box on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call the value of these two handkerchiefs - A. About three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they worth twelve pence together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Constable, what parish is your house in - A. St. Martin's in the fields.</p>

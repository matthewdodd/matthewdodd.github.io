On the 5th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, and locked my room door; I left the two tea-caddies and petticoat safe; I returned between six and seven o'clock, and found the door unlocked, but closed - I am certain I had locked it; the street door is kept open. The witness Lock gave me information - I then missed two tea-caddies from the bureau bedstead, and the petticoat off the back of a chair; I have only one room - the prisoner was in custody; the articles are worth 1s. 6d. - he is a stranger. I heard Mrs. Brady and her children up-stairs when I went out, and they were at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070045"></xptr>home when I returned - they might have gone out while I was away.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner about four o'clock last Tuesday afternoon, in Whitecross-street. I first saw him in company with another man, about thirty yards from Brady's; I followed, and took him with these caddies and petticoat under his arm - I said, "What have you got here?" he said, "Why, a tea-caddy, which I have brought from my mother;" I looked under the petticoat, and saw another caddy - he said he had brought them both from his father, who lived in Clare-market, but gave no account of the petticoat.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

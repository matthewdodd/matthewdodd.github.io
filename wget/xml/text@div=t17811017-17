               <p>I am wife of the prosecutor. On the 27th of last month about four in the afternoon, the prisoner, North, came into my shop first, and enquired for half a yard of very rich silk. I shewed her a piece she did not seem very well satisfied with. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170018"></xptr> reached her a second piece. In the mean time the other two prisoners came in together, as I believe. Cook I am very positive to; the other I am not so clear to. They asked for a piece of velveret to make a little boy a waistcoat. I reached down several pieces. They found fault with them, and said they were not rich enough; they were too thick; and asked the quantity that would make a boy a waistcoat, about eleven years of age. I said I could not tell, as Mr. Haines was out; he would be at home about six. At that instant North went down to the bottom of the counter, where there were some brown Hollands, and said she wanted some of those brown Hollands. I desired she would chuse out what she thought would suit her, as I was serving the other persons. She said, No, Ma'am; if you please to look. I stooped down to look. At that instant the other two made a courtesy, and wished me a good day, and said they would come again at six o'clock, and went out. The moment after they were gone, I cut her a yard of Holland, at 15 d. I crossed the other side of the counter, to give her change. She observed the other women had behaved exceeding rude to her, and snatched every thing out of her hand. She said she looked upon them to be sailors wives. I said I was sorry; and then she took her change and left the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any appearance of these women being acquainted, when they were in the shop? - Not at all; the other two came in together, and seemed to be acquainted. I went to put the things in their places, and missed a piece of silk. I went to the door. I thought I could have overtaken the last woman, but I had nobody in the house but a little child, and could not leave the house; and I thought the other two must have taken it, because the other was not at that end of the counter. It was black Florentine silk, between fifteen and sixteen yards. It is worth 5 l. and upwards. I could not follow them, having nobody in the house. They were taken up ten or twelve days after this affair, but not on this account.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure Cook was one of the two women that came into the shop? - Quite sure. The other prisoner I verily believe to be the other that was with her.</p>
               <p>Did you see that piece of silk on the counter after North went to look at the Holland? - Yes, I did: There were but two pieces on the counter when she went to look at it.</p>

               <p>I know that the prisoners are acquainted one with each other. The night they were taken up, I saw North go up to the other two, and speak to them, in Covent Garden. They walked up James-street together. Mr. Bates said those were the persons that stole the silk from him, and a constable and I took them, and they were brought to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Davis. It is so late, our friends did not think our trial would come on.</p>
               <p>North. We were told we were not to be tried till morning; that is the reason our friends are gone.</p>

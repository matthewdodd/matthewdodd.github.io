On the 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. t of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was crossing Westminster-bridge—I felt a tug at my pocket, and missed my hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I looked round—the prisoner and another young man were close by me—the prisoner was moving away from my side—I followed him, and in going across the bridge I saw him putting his hand into his breast pocket—I went up to him and said, "You have got my handkerchief"—he said, "Yes, sir, I have just picked it up"—I said, "I should rather say, picked it out"—I followed him, and gave him in charge.</p>

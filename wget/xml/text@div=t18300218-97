            . I am foreman to Mr. King. I went to the prisoner's father with the officer, and found a great many tin goods, particularly in the parlour; I found some tools up stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This was at the father's - did the prisoner lodge there? A. I suppose so - I do not know; the father did not come to visit him, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. For aught you know his father might have come to see him? A. I am sometimes out - I never sold the prisoner any thing, nor gave him any thing to my knowledge - I gave him a dripping-pan and stand to take to my house, which Mr. King gave me; I did not tell him not to say where he had been - when I was in business I had a boy from the parish as an apprentice; he was a very bad boy - he had nothing to complain of from me; I am married.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PIKE. I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's father's. and found a great number of tin articles, which I produce.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The father might have brought them to the place? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you have any conversation with the prisoner? A. As we were going along he said, "The prosecutor has two other apprentices, and there will be something found on them as well as me."</p>
               <p>MR. KING. I have looked at these articles, and know they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not miss them? A. No - I missed a great many things; these might have been taken when I had a partner- the prisoner has a brother an apprentice to me; I do not think but what he took some of the things.</p>

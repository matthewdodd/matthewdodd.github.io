                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in High-street, Shadwell. I was in my parlour on the 20th of February—there is only a glass par<lb></lb>tition between that and the shop—I can see every part of the shop—about a quarter-past one o'clock I saw the prisoner go out of the shop, and his hands were closed up to his person—he crossed the way, and I went after him—I missed a pair of boots—he turned towards Shadwell-market, and from thence to the wooden bridge—I then collared him, and accused him of stealing the boots—he gave them to me, and said, "Take them, I have plenty of money to buy more"—I look him back and sent for a policeman, and gave him the prisoner and the boots—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—they are not saleable, as they are not finished—the prisoner was searched, but he made a desperate resistance—it took three officers to search him—there was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and nine duplicates—he said he had bought the boots.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had been drinking with three or four men, and a man in the street said, "Will you have a pair of boots?"—I said I did not want them—he said, "You shall have them a bargain"—he wanted 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I said I would give him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "No," and I went away—he came after me, and let me have them for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got drinking again, and I cannot give the least account of what I did. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I discovered the boots were gone before I followed the prisoner—I had put them down half-an-hour before—I had a suspicion from seeing his arms closed—he said he had bought them for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he ran as well as I could, and did not seem the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the K division of police. I was at the station-house when the prisoner was given in charge—he said he bought the boots in East Smithfield, of a man, opposite St. Katherine's Docks—he did not appear in liquor—I sent him to the Police Court half an hour afterwards, and followed behind him—he afterwards assumed the appearance of being intoxicated, and they did not examine him till the next day.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, residing at Heligoland; the prisoner lived in the same house with me, in the next room, there is only a thin partition between the two rooms. On the 21st of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard the prisoner and his wife quarrelling, she said "dear Ball," dont strike me; I heard a knock on the floor as if somebody had been knocked down, I heard groaning or snoring, and thought she was asleep. At eight o'clock, I heard a noise got up and went into their room, and saw her lying dead on the bed, and five or six people in the room; the prisoner was on the bed, with his hand round her, apparently attending her; he was crying and appeared concerned.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. They very often quarrelled.</p>
               <p>MARGARET M'OWEN. I lived at Heligoland, next door but one to the prisoner. On the 21st of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was alarmed by a heavy noise, I opened my door and saw the prisoner run out of his house, and call out</p>
               <p>"what shall I do, my wife is dead;" I asked him if he had struck her, he said, no; he returned home and I followed, when I came into the room I found the body lying across the floor, she laid on her back, not near the bed - She was quite cold; I went and called my husband; Mrs. Newman came back with me, we laid her on the bed; there was a small cut on her right brow and blood on it; the prisoner was crying and in great trouble; I asked him what I should do, he said, do what you like; I went for the surgeon, the prisoner remained in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was very much agitated, and gave the alarm himself; he washed her temples himself.</p>

            . I am surgeon to the garrison. On the 21st of October last, I was called to look at the deceased, I found her on the bed; understanding that she was senseless, I tried to bleed her but could not; she was quite dead, and cold. I noticed a lacerated wound about the right eye-brow, and several severe contusions above and below both ears and on her neck, and bruises on her neck and chest; she had a small cut below her ear, which appeared to be the marks of finger nails, and had penetrated through the skin; I opened the body the next day and fond a considerable effusion of blood on the head, upon the vicia, which is sufficient to produce death; there are other causes which could have produced death. I found a great quantity of extravasated blood on the chest, which I attributed to the violence of the blows; it might have been from other causes; the prisoner laid on his left side crying over her, and it was with difficulty I persuaded him to leave her; he said if he had been beating or ill-treating her, he should not have been surprized at her death; the wound was from an inch to an inch and half long below the ears, which I should have judged had been given by some weapon; the fist might have produced it, and so might a fall; the whole of the bruises could not have been produced by a fall.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. The mark over her right eye-brow might have arisen from the fall. Supposing a person had been intoxicated, and had repeatedly fallen down, it might have produced the wound on the eye.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think could not have proceeded from the falls - A. The contusions about the ears could not have proceeded from the fall and would have caused death; if a person had been convulsed and had struggled, it might possibly have had that appearance. I have attend

             the deceased often-from what I have observed, she was addicted to intoxication, and rather inclined to be plethorical; with that inclination, encouraged as it must be by extravasation of the brain, it might have produced it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you conceive the extravasation of the brain to have been the immediate cause of her death - 
               <persName id="t18170702-59-person516">A. </persName>
            Either would have caused it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bursting of the vessels of the brain, the immediate cause of death - A. Drinking alone might have caused extravasation of blood on the brain.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing an extravasation of blood to be caused by a fall, would the party be able to walk afterwards - A. A very short distance; they would retain strength for a short time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The two women who came, said there was no blood; it is very strange that there was no blood on the body or the floor, as she had cut her eye.</p>

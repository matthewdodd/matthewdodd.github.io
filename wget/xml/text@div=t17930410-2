               <p>I am a servant; I saw the clock that evening between four and five; I shut the windows that night; there is a stable yard communicates to Lady Godolphin's house, in this yard there is an access immediately to the house; in consequence of the clock being missed, we searched the house immediately, but we could find no clock, nor any body in the house; there was no other step taken then; I did not see the prisoner till the day he was taken; I believe he was apprehended near Monmouth-street. I did not go with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a clock was this? - I cannot describe the clock, but it was in a black case, it was a table clock; I don't know the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Axford. The maker's name is Knibb.</p>

             did, and the prisoner was present, when they placed it on the table, I told them it was an old family piece, they said, it belonged to Penry Jones, the prisoner at the bar; with that, I asked the prisoner at the bar how long he had had this clock? he said, he had had it three weeks, I told him, that never could be, for I knew it was an eight day clock, and it was then going, and that he must come dishonestly by it; then they asked me if I would make a winder to it? I told him no. I asked Penry Jones if he knew the consequence of it? and I told him to take the clock back again to the right owner of it, then they both laughed at me, and said, would I not make a winder to it? I said no; and I had no further discourse with them till I saw the prisoner at Bow-street. This clock was in a black ebony case. The name I verily believe to be Knibb. I observed the name at the time, and I verily believe it; the circle of the clock was pierced. They came afterwards to the public house where I was, but we had no conversation there about the clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a perfect recollection what the boy said there? - He told the magistrate that he had stole the clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where? - He said, he had stole it of his mistress our Lady Godolphin, and that he had given it to a coachman to sell.</p>

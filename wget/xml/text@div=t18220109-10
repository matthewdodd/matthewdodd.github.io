He had two cart mares; I saw them last on Thursday afternoon, the 13th of December, about four o'clock, in the field which was fenced round, and the gate fastened with a with. There were four horses, these two were chestnut cart mares, one was six years old, and the other nine. They had no shoes on then, but had worn shoes for years. I missed them the next morning, and traced them out of the gate, but no further; I have seen them since.</p>

I saw the prisoner Home at the house about six o'clock in the evening, in company with another (not Cutts), he left at eleven o'clock at night.

            . I am proprietor of the two mares. On the morning of the 14th, I was informed they were stolen; they are worth 25 l. each. I made the best of my way to London, and in consequence of information which I received, went with Rice, an officer of Union Hall, to several places in Paddington, and enquired if any horse-dealers lived there - we went to No. 8, Canal wharf, Paddington, to two stables, one was locked and the other padlocked; the door of the padlocked stable was partly open. I looked in, and immediately recognized one of my mares, I could see her distinctly, and the other behind it, I thought was mine, but could not see that distinctly. In consequence of information, the officer sent for Cutts, who came; he was known there by the name of Smith, only. I told him I and my man were going to town to buy a cart horse (my man was with me), I asked if he had any thing of that description to sell; he said he had, and opened the stable which we had not looked into - there were four nags, and one horse of rather the cart kind; I said they would not suit - we came out and asked if he had any thing of the cart kind, he said</p>
               <p>"No." I then asked if that stable belonged to him, pointing to the one which we had looked into, he said</p>
               <p>"Yes." I asked if there was not any cart horse there; he hesitated, and said no, only two colts that had never been shod, and a nag that belonged to a gentleman, and was rather lame. I said I sometimes bought colts, and asked if he could not shew them to me; he hesitated, and appeared conscious of what we were searching for. He unlocked the stable, I went in, and immediately said</p>
               <p>"Here is one that will suit me, and here is another, they are both stolen, and are my property." Rice said he belonged to Union Hall, and must take him in charge; he said,</p>

               <p>"But you will give me a chance to get my money back, I will go and shew you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090006"></xptr>the man I received the horses from." I gave the horses in care of my man. It is impossible he could mistake them for colts which had never been shod. He took us to a public-house at Paddington, the other prisoner came to the door; he pointed him out as the man who brought them to him - the officer said he apprehended him for felony; he scarcely said a word. We asked how he brought the horses into town, he gave no answer. Cutts was then very anxious to go home to change his clothes, and asked if we had not done with him - we took him to Union Hall, the Magistrate was not there. Hone was locked up, and Cutts taken to a public-house; a person came in and called him Cutts, before that, we understood his name to be Smith. They were afterwards examined, what they said was not taken down - no promise or threat were held out to them. Cutts said the horses were brought to his stable the night before (this was Saturday) by two strange men, that Home was one of them, that it was late at night, they could not go to a public-house, and they brought them to his stable, engaged it for the night, and brought a truss of hay for them. He said nothing about having bought them. Home said he came from Shropshire. The Magistrate asked what he had been doing lately; he hesitated, and at last said,</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge that I stole the horses." The horses appeared to have been brought a considerable distance, they could scarcely walk, their feet were pared down, and could not walk on the road without pain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far is Godstone from town - A. Twenty-three miles. Paddington is about twenty-six miles from Godstone. I was directed to Cutt's stable as a horse dealer. I saw my horses by pulling the door a little open. None of the horses in the other stable were exactly of the cart breed, but one was rather heavy. He did not say they were not his; Home did not deny it. Cutts said</p>
               <p>"The men who brought them were entire strangers, I received the horses as if for sale."</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutors to several places, we came to No. 8, Wharf, Paddington, and found two stables locked - the one padlocked, was rather loose; I opened it a little, the prosecutors looked in, and knew one of the horses; I enquired whom the stables belonged to, and sent to the prisoner; I accosted him as Smith, and asked if the stable, No. 8, belonged to him, and said a friend of mine was waiting to buy a horse, if he had any for sale; he said he had, and came to the yard, and found the prosecutors there; we first went into a stable, where there were four nags, and one rather a heavy horse, the prosecutor said he wanted a horse that would work immediately; Cutts said that would suit him - the prosecutors declined, we asked if he had any more, he said,</p>
               <p>"No, no more mares in the cart way." I pointed to the other door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Does this stable belong to you," he said it did; we asked if had anything in the cart way there; he said, No; there was nothing but one nag belonging to a gentleman, and two colts, they had never been shod yet. I asked if he had the key of that stable; he said he had - he hesitated, and at last opened it, the prosecutor went in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is two that will suit me;" I said,</p>
               <p>"It is no use, Mr. Smith, going on any further, those two are stolen; I am an officer, and shall take you on suspicion of being concerned." He was very much embarrassed, and said,</p>
               <p>"God bless me, I can shew you the man I had them of; give me an opportunity of getting my money back;" I said I would give him every opportunity I could - they appeared like two cart mares; no one could mistake them for colts never shod. He talked very fast, and took us about three hundred yards, to a public-house, and Home came out, and stood still a moment, he said</p>
               <p>"That is the man that brought them to my stable;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, I charge you with horse stealing;" he refused saying any thing about them, he only gave me his name, and Cutts gave me his name as

               <p>"I may as well tell you," his wife said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not, I will;" he then said a man came first of all, and engaged this stable for the mares; I asked who the other man was, he said,</p>

I took them to Union Hall, locked Home up, and took Smith to a public-house, a man came in, and addressed him as Cutts. They were examined in the evening, what Hone said was taken in writing, in the minute book, and the final examination was taken on paper.

After the examination I enquired of the prisoner Home, about Hunter; he said the man who was with him, when he took the horses out of the field, he knew nothing of, nor his name, but that that man told him he knew a man in London, who wanted two horses, and persuaded him to take them from Getting's field. He always said he would give me every information he could.</p>

I went to Home in prison, and asked if he had seen any of the party who was with him when the horses were stolen, he said No, and if he could tell me where to find the man, he would, and if he came to see him, he would tell somebody. The mares feet appeared to be recently cut down. Cutts walked very slow towards the public-house. I have had information about another man, who has absconded. When Cutts came to Home, he did not say a word about his money.</p>

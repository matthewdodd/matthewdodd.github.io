               <p>Court. Was this a private waggon? - It was James's flying waggon of Bristol,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100120"></xptr> the prisoner said he knew nothing at all of it, he went to look behind the hay-bag, and shewed me a bit of a cut, about a foot long, and told me somebody had been there, and cut my property out behind the waggon.</p>
               <p>Court. Could they have taken it out of that cut? - No, Sir, they could not, it was not above a foot long, and my bundle was a yard long, and there was a stick that went through it, which never could be taken out of that cut; then I followed him to Smallbury Green turnpike, there they watered their horses at the Castle, and I offered the waggoner a shilling and a pot of beer if he would let me and another man go into the waggon, and search for my property, he damned me very much, and said he would not, he said, how could I think my property was in the waggon, when he put it in the hay bag behind, I then insisted on following the waggon, I followed them over Hounslow Heath, and the guard that was with the waggon had a blunderbuss, he said, if you do not get away from the waggon I will put a pill in you, upon which I was frightened, I then walked on as far as Colebrook, by this time it might be about four o'clock in the morning, I then knocked up a constable, he asked me my business, I told him I had been defrauded of my property, and desired him to come down and take the waggoner into custody, says he, my friend, I can do nothing in it, it is in the county of Buckingham; I went to a public house and had a pint of beer, and the prisoner came up, says he, damn you, what do you charge me with taking your property, I said yes; on Saturday I came to London and told the gentlemen belonging to the Three Cups in Bread-street of it, they then told me he should go before the Justice; I took the waggoner and the guard before Alderman Boydell in the city, (the prisoner was then come back, he goes no further than Maidenhead) the Alderman examined him, and he owned that he took the property away from me, and put it into the hay-bag behind the waggon, and the Alderman told him, says he, my friend that was not a proper place, as you took this man's property from him, that was not a proper place to put it in, you ought to have put it into the waggon, and he told him to appear before him when the waggon came there again, and bring my property, or make me some restitution for it, I was then contented, thinking I might get my property again, I came up to town the Saturday following, and went before the sitting Alderman at Guildhall, the man never appeared at all, I told the Alderman the story, and they told me to go to some Justice of that county, and take out a warrant, and bring it to them and they would back it, I went to the Rotation office and got a warrant, and the Alderman backed it, I took a constable to the Three Cups in Bread-street, when we came there we shewed the warrant to the bookkeeper, I took the warrant from him and finding I could not take him, I gave it to Mr. Lowes belonging to Isleworth parish, and he took him on the Sunday night as he was watering his horses, I do not know the day of the month, I never got my things, he is the man that took my things away from me, and he has defrauded me of it I do assure you; I am a poor man, he has distressed me to the lowest degree in life.</p>

               <p>Where do you live? - At Isleworth and sometimes at Brentford, I lived at the sign of the Man in the Moon in the market place at Brentford.</p>
               <p>You say this was on the 6th of August last? - Yes, when the man took my property.</p>
               <p>It was about eight or nine o'clock that you met with this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you say at that time? - I have told you.</p>
               <p>But we must have a little more from you? - I asked him how far he was going, he told me to Maidenhead; I told him I was going to Brentford, and I asked him what I should give him to go to Brentford, he told me to go on to the White Horse cellar, and he would take me up there.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he could not take you any part of the road? - He never told me any such thing, I went to the White Horse cellar, and there I staid till he came up.</p>
               <p>You say, you offered to give him a bundle? - I never offered any such thing, he said, let me have your bundle.</p>
               <p>What did he do with it? - He took the bundle from under my arm to put it into the waggon.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with him and see it? - No, I did not, nor never saw what he had done with it.</p>
               <p>Was there nobody with the waggon, or about the waggon? - There was people about, there was people going in the waggons, there were people doing business about the waggon.</p>
               <p>Were there any passengers in the waggon, as you went to Smallbury Green? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>And there was a guard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At Brentford you asked for your bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you, at that time, make a demand of money of him? - No, as I hope for mercy.</p>
               <p>Did you at no time make a demand of any money from him? - Never in my life, as I hope I may see the face of Almighty God, I never did.</p>
               <p>How came you to go before Mr. Alderman Boydell? - To examine him.</p>
               <p>Had you any warrant? - No.</p>
               <p>Any summons? - No.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of your going there? - I was willing to have him before the Justice to examine him.</p>
               <p>And he was willing to go with you? - Yes, he went.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing said, that if you and the guard will go before a magistrate and swear you know nothing of the bundle there should be an end of it? - Nothing at all about making an end of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100123"></xptr>When you went before Alderman Boydell, did not you say, if you will go before a magistrate and swear that you know nothing of the bundle there shall be an end of the matter? - I do not remember it, I offered to pay for the oath if they would go.</p>
               <p>How came you to pay for it? - The man took the oath before the alderman.</p>
               <p>What were they sworn for? - I do not know, the alderman put the book in their hands and they said they would swear.</p>
               <p>Then you swore nothing? - Nothing till they swore they knew nothing at all about the property.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that if they would take their oaths before some magistrate there should be an end of the matter? - No, I never did, they insisted upon taking the oaths themselves.</p>
               <p>And you paid for that oath? - No, I did not, I offered to pay for it; I got a warrant against this man before a city magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did you take a warrant out from a magistrate in the city? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What Justice did you go before? - At the Rotation Office.</p>
               <p>What became of that warrant afterwards? - I took it down in the country, and this man served it of a Sunday night, about half past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then before that warrant was executed on the prisoner, did nothing pass between you and the prisoner with respect to any payment of money? - No, Sir, there was never any money mentioned.</p>
               <p>Not two guineas? - No, nor one guinea, nor half a guinea, he never made any proposals, I only wanted my property.</p>

               <p>Do you know the name of the guard to this flying waggon? - I do not, I saw him that night, I know him by sight, he said he would put a pill in me.</p>
               <p>Had he any gun or any thing of that kind? - It was dark.</p>
               <p>You never offered at any time if the man would pay you two guineas you would put an end to it; will you swear that? - I will swear, Sir, I never made any such agreement, nor the thing never was proposed either of his or my side since I lost my property.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not promise that if they would go before the magistrate, the prisoner and the guard, and take their oaths that they knew nothing of this bundle, that there should be an end of the matter? - As for saying that, I do not remember any thing about it, I might say such a thing, but I do not remember any thing at all about it, to the best of my knowledge I never said so.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. He said he took the property from him in Piccadilly, what did you understand by that, or what do you mean should be understood by it? - He did not say where he put it, he said he had the property from this man, and he had put it into the hay bag.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say that before; have you known that man any time? - Never, I have no acquaintance with either of them.</p>

               <p>I met with this man just by St. James's Church, he asked me what waggon it was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100124"></xptr> and I told him it was the Bath waggon, says I, are you going to Bath, he said, no, to Brentford, says he, can you give me a lift, he asked me once or twice and I denied him, as he was at the White Horse cellar I denied him twice or three times, he said, put my bundle up for me, I said, I will have nothing to do with you nor your bundle, he said, put it any where, says I, you must mind him, I shall take no charge of him; he walked by the tail of the waggon till we came to the King's Arms at Brentford, says he, I will take my bundle out, then I said, I would take it out; I went to the tail of the waggon and he with me, says I, you have got your bundle have not you, it is not here, says he, if you have lost it you shall pay for it, I said I should not I had taken no charge of it, I asked him the worth of the bundle, says he, I have two new suits of cloaths, a silk waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a shirt; says I, you must be a very bad man to say so, your bundle was not bigger than my hat; says he, thee wilt not pay me for the bundle wont thee, I said, no; says he, thee art not the first man I have swindled, and I will swindle thee before I have done with thee; then when we came to Smallbury-green he offered to take two guineas, and on Hounslow-heath he offered to get upon the waggon.</p>

               <p>I have been guard to the waggon four years, I go constantly, I was with it on the 6th of August last, I was at the White Horse cellar when the prosecutor came, when he came there he offered the waggoner the bundle and wanted to ride to Brentford in the waggon, which he denied him, and said he had no room for him; he then said, could he put his bundle any where, says he, put it some where, and he went to the tail of the waggon, and the waggoner said, you may put it in here if you will, in the tuck, in the hay bag, behind the waggon, which he did and he skewered it up, and he asked the prisoner if it was safe there, and the prisoner said he could not tell, he might mind it himself as he was going to walk; then he asked the waggoner to have something to drink, which he denied, at last he said, if he drank any thing it should be a glass of gin; they went in and came out, and the waggon went off, the prosecutor walked sometimes behind and sometimes of the side till we came to Hide Park Corner, the other side the turnpike, then the waggoner got into the waggon, as he said he was tired, and I got upon the nagg, and I drove the waggon all the way to Brentford.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the prosecutor all this time? - He was walking behind the waggon or of one side of it, he got on the shafts sometimes, I cannot tell, there was another man walked by the side of me to Smallbury-green, when we came to the King's Arms at Brentford, he said, I will have my things out, then he said, no, I will not, I will let them abide till I come to the market house, then he said, I will have my bundle out, he said, I will take it out, it is here you put it, so then he went round, and there was a hole in the tuck, whether he took it out himself, or who took it out I cannot say, I never saw the bundle after it was put in, when we came to Brentford, he said, the waggoner should find his bundle, he said, he would make him find it, the waggoner said, he could not, then he said, he would follow him to Colebrook and have him taken up, when we came to Smallbury-green, I got into the waggon, and the waggoner drove, and when he left the waggon I do not know, but it was somewhere on the heath, he was at Colebrook when we came there; I had no conversation with the prosecutor at all after I came from Smallbury-green, I saw the prosecutor afterwards, the next Saturday he came to our inn at the Three Cups, in Bread-street, then he said, if we would go to any Justice any where and be upon our oaths, only just go and swear that we had never seen the bundle since it was put into the tuck, he would think no more of it, and we said we would.</p>
               <p>Did he make that proposal to you? - Yes, he did, and there is another witness or two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100125"></xptr> that heard him, we went to Alderman Boydell.</p>

               <p>Did you take your oath to that purpose? - We did.</p>
               <p>Who paid for that oath? - I do not think he took any thing.</p>
               <p>That was at the prosecutor's request? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said before you went, about any money? - No, nothing, since the night he came to Smallbury-green to take the waggoner up; he came to the waggoner before he served him with the warrant, and asked him if he would make it up for two guineas, the waggoner said, no, he asked him if he would make it up for a guinea and a half, the waggoner said, no, and then he took him up directly, that hindered the waggon from going an hour and a half, and I was obliged to drive it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How big was it? - Not so big as a hat.</p>
               <p>Was there a stick in it? - There was, as if carried on a shoulder.</p>
               <p>Did you see the hole that was cut? - I do not know whether it was cut, or whether it was tore, it was large enough to be taken out, but I do think it could fall out.</p>

               <p>You went at the desire of the prosecutor? - I did, I said before the Alderman, says I, Mr. Boydell you know me very well, I come on behalf of this man, though at the same time I thought the men were as innocent as myself, and I really think so now upon my honour.</p>

               <p>Court. How came the prosecutor to apply to you? - He came to the house to enquire for an attorney, and I happened to be in the house where he came to, I went down to the book-keeper with him, and the prosecutor said he should be satisfied if they went before an Alderman and took their oath, I did not go with them.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. What is the value of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100126"></xptr> these things? - The value of the whole is about forty shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he leave these articles in your possession, or did he carry them away with him? - The old gentleman kept them.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Where is your house? - No. 20, in Mortimer-street; when we came into Bond-street, I said, this is Bond-street, and that the King's jeweller lived there; the prisoner at the bar said, hush, never mind; then we went from there to my own house in Mortimer-street; but before we came to my house, at the top of Bond-street, we turned on the left hand side, and went into a public house, all three of us, they called for a pint of porter, and drank, and they asked me if I would drink any thing; I said I would drink a glass of cider, if they had any there, they had no cider and I drank a glass of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing more passed? - No, nothing passed; then we went to my house, when we came to the door they asked me who I had in the house?

               <p>Q. Then I understand you that that hundred pounds was to be paid as a deposit for the security of the trinket, for your delivering this thing again? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Q. And what was the information you received from your son? - Before my son came home, my daughter asked me to look at it, she said she had never seen a diamond, and she thought it looked common. My son is a painter and glazier, he took his diamond that he cuts the glass with, out of his pocket, and he tried these diamonds with the diamond he had about him.</p>

               <p>Q. Look behind you, and see whether you can find out a person who found this prize in Parliament-street? - Yes, it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing further? - Nothing further than when he was brought before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got the notes back again? - No, I have not got the notes back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mrs. Smith, I believe you was the first person that spoke; you spoke to the prisoner before he spoke to you, did not you? - No, the prisoner spoke to me first.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said when the prisoner took up the prize, you called out halves? - He said, he had found a prize, he throwed away the brown paper, and produced this pocket book, and then I said, halves.</p>
               <p>Q. And this led to all this further conversation about it? When these notes were brought down, and laid on the table, he took them, in consequence of a previous agreement that he should take them? - Yes, that he should have a hundred pounds till on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. So you gave a full consent for him to have these notes? - I put them on the table, and he took them up.</p>

            , the younger, sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the daughter of the last witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In August last did your mother come with any persons to your house? - Yes, the 27th of August she came with two persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, was he one of them? - I cannot say; I did not look at them, I remember two men coming, but I don't know who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - About four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. You was alone in the house then? - Yes, no one else.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and your mother when they came into the house? - My mother came down to me and said, Mary come up, for I want you, I went up stairs with my mother, and she desired me to look out a hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look out a hundred pounds? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In money or in notes? - Bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the identical notes? - I know to the quantity of notes, but not to the number of them, there were two tens, two twenties, one twenty-five, and one fifteen; six in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these notes? - I gave them to my mother, and she took them down to the men, and put them on the table, for them to take.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what your mother did with them? - I did not, no otherwise than what I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the men take these notes from the table? - No, I did not see either of the men take them off from the table; my mother told me I might hear what they said, and so I did, I stood on the stairs. When my mother went down to take the notes, they desired my mother to shut the parlour door; she said she would not; then they asked my mother if there was any body that would hear their discourse? and my mother said no, nobody in particular; with that they asked my mother what time my father would come home to breakfast; they made my mother promise for nobody to see the note that was in the pocket book, till the next morning; they asked if they could not put it in some place of safety till the next morning, my mother brought the tea chest to put it in, and gave them the key of the tea chest to lock it again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by the note? These bank notes amounting to the hundred pounds, or did you conceive that these notes was any thing else? - I did not know then, my father being in business, and I don't know what it might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that tea chest which your mother brought down, left in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was opened did it contain anything? - Nothing in short, but tea and sugar, except this pocket book, containing the trinket; I did not see it open till after they were gone, I asked my mother to let me see it; and she had said she had promised that she would not, and she was very dubious to forfeit her word; and I asked her to let me have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080008"></xptr>the key of the tea chest, and she agreed to it, and I unlocked the tea chest, and when I see the locket, I said to my mother that I had never saw a diamond, but I thought it looked very common; when my brother came home, he said it was nothing but paste stone; with that I went with my brother to a silversmith, and he said, it was not worth more than five shillings and six-pence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>It was my property that was taken away, I know nothing of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of the old gentlewoman at all, I never remember seeing her till I was taken; I had some witnesses to call, I beg your lordship to put off this till the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys contended that in this case the prisoner had not been guilty of any felony, because the woman had parted with her property freely, and with her own consent, and she had delivered to the men an hundred pounds, which they were to redeliver to her, on their coming to claim this jewel; and it appeared to him, that the terms on which this money was to be delivered to her was never executed, and she had parted with it voluntarily on her own part.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Perryn observed that she certainly parted with it voluntarily, for the purpose of having it restored to her the next day; but the question was, whether the commencement of this transaction was not when the brown paper was picked up; whether from that period they had an intention to rob her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys observed that the terms on which this was to be returned to her, was on their coming to demand that jewel.</p>
               <p>Mr. justice Grose observed that it appeared to him, she had never parted with the property, but put it as a deposit; and then the question was, whether it was not all a trick to rob her.</p>
               <p>It was finally agreed to refer the case to the opinion of the judges, if the jury should find the prisoner guilty of the fact.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. To Smith. Have you made any enquiry with respect to this jewel? - It is valued at five shillings and six-pence, by a silversmith and jeweller that looked at it.</p>

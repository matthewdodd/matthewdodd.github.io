I did not miss any table napkins until the policeman came on Monday, 4th Oct., I then examined our stock—we had only three pieces, and I missed one—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I cannot tell when it was taken—I can swear to its being in the shop on the Wednesday previous, it was placed on a row of linens in front of the window, inside—a person could get at it by reaching over—I do not recollect seeing the prisoner in our shop—I know this by our private mark—it con<lb></lb>tains</p>

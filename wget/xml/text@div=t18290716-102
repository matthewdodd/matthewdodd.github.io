               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know he took out more beer than the persons actually received? A.According to his statement, and my booking it at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say that you saw him take out all this beer? A. Certainly; I drew it when he called for it; here is April written the margin of this book - that is the way we put it; we are not very particular when we have no doubts - here is an entry of the 6th of April; I drew the beer for Miss

             that day, and have a distinct recollection of it - my wife sometimes might draw beer when I was ill; she is not here; my son sometimes does - he is not here; I kept the prisoner in my service for eight days after this, thinking he would be sorry for what he had done; and he knew the customers - he appeared to be sorry, and said he would behave better, but he did not - I did send him round to shew another boy the customers; I did not take him up for almost five weeks - I did not wish to hurt him.</p>
               <p>Q. I will give you a second opportunity of considering that answer; what was the reason you left it five weeks before you took him? A. His sister came and cried to me - then he came and insulted me; I did take money of his sister - this receipt is not my writing; I think it is my wife's; I did not take the money myself, but I understood we got it; I think it is my wife's writing, but I never saw it before - my wife is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the insult you speak of? A. He came and demanded wages of me - there were a good many people standing at the door and the back garden.</p>

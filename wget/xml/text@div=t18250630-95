I am married and live in King-street, Drury-lane; I had seen the prisoner before - she dealt in fish - but I never spoke to her till the 24th of June, at eleven o'clock at night, when I was coming home - she asked me to treat her - I would not - she then asked me to give her a pint of beer, which I did; she followed me to my own door, and asked me to lend her 2 s., to buy mackarel, at Billingsgate, the next morning. I said, if she would go in doors with me I would give her the 2 s. - she agreed to go with me, and was with me in the room for about a quarter of an hour; my wife was not at home - the room door was locked while we were there: I gave her the 2 s., and had all this money in my pocket, which I missed when she was gone: it was in a bag; I went out and found her in a cook-shop in George-street; I called the watchman, and she was taken to the watch-house; the money was found on her there; I went before the Magistrate at Marlborough-street - I do not know whether he dismissed the charge.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George's, Bloomsbury. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house about a quarter before three o'clock in the morning; the prosecutor was there with the watchman and the officer; I asked him three times what he had lost, he said twelve sovereigns, a half sovereign, and some silver, but he could not say what. I searched her, and found twelve sovereigns, a half sovereign, and some silver, which made 14 l. 12 s. 3 d.; she said some of the silver was her own - she did not say whether she knew the prosecutor or not.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you say the prisoner said she had never seen you? A. I believe she did deny knowing me that night, but she appeared a little in liquor; she said next morning, if I had been sober she would have given it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor, who asked me to have something to drink - he then wanted me to go home to his place, and wanted to inveigle me to stop away from my husband, he put the money into my hand to entice me away - it was in my pocket all the time - I meant to give it to him again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a military man. On Friday night, the 8th of Aug., I got into an omnibus about nine o'clock at the Euston-square sta-tion—it was going in the direction of Piccadilly—I think the prisoner is the man who was in the omnibus, and sat on my right-hand side—nobody tat on the other side of me—I had my dog there—before I got into the omnibus I had my purse which contained 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in sovereigns, half-So<lb></lb>vereigns, and silver—I had put my purse into my coat pocket—I had not heard the prisoner say where he wished to be put down—the omnibus stopped to put down an outside passenger, and when it stopped the prisoner got out—I had his bag in my hand—I was endeavouring to keep up the bag and the little cage which had my dog—the prisoner called quickly for his bag and his portmanteau—when he was gone the conductor spoke to me, and I found a hole in my pocket—some keys which had been in my pocket were on the seat, and my purse was gone—some said the bole in my pocket was cut, some said it was torn, and some that it was worn—I can positively swear I had no hole in it before I got into the omni-bus—the hole was two inches long or more—I got out and went with the conductor to endeavour to find the prisoner, but we did not succeed—I afterwards went the same evening to a house in Macclesfield-street—I saw the prisoner there in the parlour—the house was represented to me as an improper house—I told the prisoner if he was a respectable person to give</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180100"></xptr>
               <p>me an address or reference—I felt very unwilling to give him in charge, because I thought he looked such a respectable man—he would not give any address or any name, and I was compelled to give him in charge—I was present when he was going to the station-house—he ran away, and we had to give chase after him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say your purse was safe before you got into the omnibus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I had placed it in my pocket ten, fifteen, or sixteen minutes before—the dog was in the omnibus before me—the prisoner got out at some place near Regent-circus—I have not the coat here with the hole in the pocket—the policeman did not tell me it would be desirable that the jury should see whether it was cut or worn—to the best of my recollection I had examined my coat pocket before I put my purse in, and I put a great coat over my other coat—I was not con<lb></lb>scious of any interruption, if I had I should have taken notice of it—I found my keys on the seat by my side, where my pocket was—I cannot remember whether it was the policeman or the conductor who told me that the house in Maeclesfield-street was an improper house—it looked a sus<lb></lb>picious house—when I got in, the people and altogether looked suspicious—the prisoner said, "You may search me and my baggage"—he had a port-manteau as well as a bag—his luggage was searched afterwards—I did not decline to give him into custody—I was unwilling—I merely said I was sorry to give such a respectable looking person into custody—I did feel a hesitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not tell you that he thought the inquiries were extremely improper, and that he should give no answer to persons who came to take him into custody, and then asked him where he lived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He seemed to resent it very slightly—he walked through the street with the police<lb></lb>man—to the best of my belief the policeman had not hold of his collar—I walked about a couple of yards behind them—I did not find my purse—I believe there was 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found on the prisoner, but no sovereign or half-sovereign—he was taken about eleven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the conductor of the omnibus—the pri<lb></lb>soner and Mr. Blake both got in at Euston-square—Mr. Blake was the last person who got in—the prisoner sat next to him—I wished to ask the prisoner where he wished to be set down, but his face was turned towards Mr. Blake, and I asked a gentleman near the door to ask him—he said it was immaterial—when we got near the Circus, at Piccadilly, the omnibus stopped to put an outside passenger down—the prisoner then got out in a very hurried manner—he called several times for his portmanteau, and my driver gave it him—he ran off towards Regent-street, turned, ran down Coventry-street, and got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the Haymarket, and drove off—I inquired if Mr. Blake had been robbed, and then went in search of the prisoner, but was not successful—it was about half-past nine o'clock when we got to the Circus—in consequence of some information, I went by myself about ten that night to a house in Maeclesfield-street, but I did not see the prisoner then—I went again to the same house in company with Mr. Blake, about eleven, and saw the prisoner in a room—Mr. Blake had two policemen with him—he charged him with this robbery—I spoke first—I said to Mr. Blake, "That is the man"—the policeman asked Mr. Blake if he would give him into custody—Mr. Blake said if he would give him a reference to any respectable gentleman, or shopkeeper, or trades-man, he would not, but the prisoner would not, and Mr. Blake gave him into custody—there was a search made, but nothing was found, and they</p>

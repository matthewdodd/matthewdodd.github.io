In consequence of something, I watched him a few days before this happened, and on the 15th of March, at a little after twelve, a customer came into the shop, and I served her, and gave her change, and saw that there were two dollars, two three-shilling pieces, and some smaller silver in the till. In a short time after, a gentleman came in, and bought half a chest of oranges; he paid the prisoner for them with a one-pound note, and a three-shilling piece. The prisoner took the note to the desk, and wrote on it, and put his hand into the till, and pulled it out again shut, and went up to the desk. About a quarter of an hour after that, there was a customer came in, and wanted three pennyworth of oranges, and I went to give her change. Nobody came in during the intermediate time. I then went to the till, and observed there was only one three-shilling piece. I said to the prisoner, Joseph, did not that gentleman give you a three-shillings piece; and he said, yes, and I put it into the till. I said, he could not have done so, for there were two in before; that he still stated he had put it in. Mr. Jolley came in, in a quarter of an hour afterwards. I asked him. (so that the prisoner might hear me,) if he had taken any money out of the till, although I knew he could not, as he was not there; he said, he had not, and the prisoner rushed out of the shop directly. I then told Mr. Joiley what I had observed.</p>

            . On the 15th of March, King began to speak to me in the prisoner's presence about something; the prisoner immediately went out, I had told him to go to Mr. Clarke's, and he staid ten minutes longer than the porter King, whom I sent after him to Mr. Clarke's. On the prisoner's return, I told him if he had been an honest man, he would not have left the shop when King began to speak to me. I asked him what made him stay so long, and he said, he had been for a walk round the market. I then charged him with having stolen two three-shilling pieces out of the till, and he denied it. On his being searched by an officer, he had nothing about him, but seven pence. In consequence of what I had heard, I told him he had another lodging, and that it was very strange, a young man who boarded and lodged with me, should have one. After he was gone to the Compter, he said that he had some keys up stairs which he wanted. I took possession of those keys. After a great deal to do, he told me his lodgings was at No. 3, Liquor-pond-street, he said, at a Mrs. West's. I went to Liquor-pond-street to search for his lodgings. He had described Mrs. West as washing for him; and on my going to No. 3, Liquor-pond-street; there was no such person lived there. I enquired at all the public-houses, chandler's shops, and grocer's shops, with as little effect. As I was returning home, I saw a board hanging out, with a mangle painted upon it, and on enquiring there. I was informed, a person of the name of West lived at No. 3, Bedford-street, which is near Liquor-pond-street. When the prisoner gave me the direction, he told me it was No. 3, Liquor-pond-street, and not in any of the streets or courts leading into it. In consequence of directions Mrs. West gave me, I went to a room in her house, and found a box with the prisoner's name written on a card that was nailed on it, and I think the hand-writing was his. One of the keys I had taken possession of, opened this box. I found in it, a large quantity of silver, silk stockings, and a receipt for gloves he had purchased after having been in my service; the silver amounted to fifteen pounds twelve shillings and sixpence; looking over that silver, I saw two shillings, which I am positive I had put into my till myself, which were missed on the same evening they were put in. The money has been in the custody of a police officer eve since. The prisoner came to my service from that of a person named Kipling, a hosier, in the Po ltry.</p>

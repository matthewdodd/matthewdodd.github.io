                  </hi>. I am a musical instrument maker, and live in Vauxhall-road. On the 17th of April, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at Greenwich fair—I felt a tug at my left coat pocket, turned, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand—it had been in my pocket some minutes before—there was a constable behind me, who took the prisoner—this is my handkerchief.</p>

I was on duty in Greenwich fair on the 17th of April, and saw the prisoner take the prosecutor's pocket in his hand, and feel if there was anything in it—he then put his hand in, and took this handkerchief out—I took him into custody—the crowd was very great—I could not keep hold of him—another constable took him before he got out of my sight—he did not get more than two yards from me.</p>

               <p>named Millingham, was in my company—I do not know his number—he belongs to the B division—the Magistrate did not require his evidence—he was before the Magistrate, and gave his evidence, but his deposition was not taken—he is here now—I did not bring him—he has other cases here—I saw the prisoner make two or three attempts to pick pockets—I can swear to three times—I have inquired after his character—I have not found it a very good one—I went to where he had been in service nine months—the policeman, D 146, stated that he had been the constant associate of thieves—I do not know that I ought to have taken the prisoner into custody for at<lb></lb>tempting to pick a pocket—I have been in the police eight years—if there was nothing in the pocket, he could not take it—I know that attempting to pick a pocket is a misdemeanour—I have had such a case—I know there was nothing in the pockets that he could take, because nothing was taken—I did not con<lb></lb>sider that he had committed any offence for which I could take him—we sometimes get expenses on summary convictions before a Magistrate—we do not for misdemeanours—we, of course, get expenses here in cases of felony—I have heard that I could have taken him for merely lifting a pocket up, but I did not consider it sufficient for me to take him—I did not run after him—I took him on the spot, as soon as he took the handkerchief out—there was a great crowd—I had been following him about the fair—I first saw him in the crowd, within about a hundred yards of where he stole this handkerchief—there were a great number of persons between me and him, as I followed him through the fair—he escaped from my hand after I seised him, but the other constable seised him, without my losing sight of him—some of the persons in the crowd came between me and him, but he did not get two yards from me—the other constable was on my right side, the side nearest the prisoner, and close to him—as soon as he got out of my hand the officer laid hold of him—the signature to this deposition is mine—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"I took the handkerchief from the prisoner, who escaped in the crowd; I did not lose sight of him, and the prisoner was taken by another constable."</p>

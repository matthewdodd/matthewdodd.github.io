               <p>Q. Do you give him authority to take out potatoes upon the orders of persons, without mentioning it to you? - A. No; I told him that was an old story, and that I was convinced I was a very great sufferer by the depredations that have been committed upon me by my servants; I told him, he might depend upon it, I would punish him; he then put his hand together, and said, he hoped I would pass it over; I sent for a constable, and gave charge of him, but previous to this, the potatoes were taken to my dwelling-house, and weighed; there were sixty-three pounds weight of them; the sack had my own name upon it; when the constable came, the prisoner dropped upon his knees, and begged that I would not take any further notice of it, and he would take care that nothing of the sort should ever happen again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you they were for my own family's use, that I had a wife and four children? - A. He said no such thing; he said he was going to take them out, according to order.(

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have a large family, and every necessary of life is excessively dear; and it is in the habit of the trade to allow men potatoes for their family's use; I was taking these home for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you ever authorize the prisoner to take home potatoes for his family? - A. Never, unless he asked for them; I paid him sixteen shillings and sixpence a week, besides potatoes for his family's use, when ever he asked for them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it usual for your servants to carry out potatoes through that passage? - A. No.</p>

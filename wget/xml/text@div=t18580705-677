On 9th March, the prisoner Emily came, and offered me this locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in pledge, and asked 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I asked her if it was gold; she said, "Yes, the best gold," or, "the best of gold; it was given to me by an old sweetheart, before I was married"—on that repre<lb></lb>sentation, and her appearance being respectable, I took it for gold, according to her word, and lent her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I had never seen her before—on 22d March, she brought this locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with a piece of tape on, it exactly corresponding with the other, and asked me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I said, "Is this the one you brought before?" she said "Yes, it is the same one; I have no other; I redeemed it"—on that representation, I lent her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I should not have done so if she had not represented it as the same—on 9th April, she presented me with this locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), told me that it was the same one which she had pledged before, which I understood to mean the first, and asked for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, which I lent her—on 23d April, I saw her again; she pro<lb></lb>duced another locket, similar to those I have produced, and I said, "Is this the same one that you have always pledged?" she said, "Yes," and repeated that it was given to her by an old sweetheart—I asked her if she had</p>

               <p>redeemed it; she said, "Yes," but not having delivered it to her myself, and supposing she had pledged it two or three times previously, I directed a search to be made, and found these three lockets—I said, "How do you account for this?" she said, "I do not care; it is my own"—I said, "You had better give me some account of yourself; how did you become possessed of them?" she said, "I shall not tell you anything about them"—I sent for a constable, and she was going to rush out of the shop, but I caught her by the arm outside—she tore my face with her nails—a constable came, and I gave her into custody—after the first hearing at the Police Court, I tried the first and second lockets; the first was base metal, there was two or three grains of gold in one part of it, and that of the commonest description, 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce; there is not above 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gold in it, but as a locket it would probably be worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are all of the same value, and each has a piece of black ribbon to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a working jeweller, of No. 11, South Street, Chelsea. I was requested by Hall to test this locket (<hi rend="italic">One offered in pledge on 23d April</hi>)—I found it to be composed of two portions of gold—(pawn<lb></lb>brokers do not test articles in front, as it destroys their value)—it weighed 2 dwts. 12 grains, with the box and glass, about two grains of which were fine gold; the gold, including the gilding, was worth 5 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if the locket was 15-carat gold, it would be worth about a half guinea—I have offered to make these lockets at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, if I have a quantity to do, and they would be sold at about a half crown—this is worth about 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to sell at a pawnbrokers' auction, but I would not offer it it pledge.</p>

               <p>it is always alloyed; you could make one of fine gold, but it would be very soft—if made in India, it would be made of fine gold; but, in this country, we ask whether it is to be 12, 13, 14, or 15-carat—these are made for the purpose of deception; this dome is carried round underneath; if I take the box out, and scrape the centre, it proves that that part is not plated, and therefore I should conclude that the other parts are not plated—in making these brooches, I should put just as much gold in as I was ordered to put—if you will allow me a light, I can tell you what proportion of gold there is; it will fall to pieces with the slightest heat—(<hi rend="italic">The witness withdrew to make the experiment.</hi>)</p>

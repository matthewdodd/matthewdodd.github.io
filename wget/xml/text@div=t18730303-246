                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the London Joint Stock Bank, Princes Street, City—Mr. Jabez Tuck, a stationer of Old Broad Street, keeps an account there—on Thursday afternoon, 30th January, between 3 and 4 o'clock, the prisoner came in and presented a cheque purporting to be Mr. Jabez Tuck's for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a doubt as to the genuineness of the signature, and asked him what he would take for it, he said "Three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes"—I then compared it with the signature in our book, and showed it to our chief cashier, who sent to Mr. Tuck to ask him if it was his signa-ture—it was brought back with Mr. Tuck—the prisoner stood at the counter part of the time, but when we thought there was a chance of his escaping, we invited him into the private room, but previous to that the chief cashier asked him whether he knew the drawer or the payee, and said "Where did you get it?"—he said "From a gentleman round the corner"—he said "What do you mean by round the corner?"—the prisoner said "At the public-house"—I think he said in King Street—Mr. Tuck then returned with the messenger, and had an interview with the prisoner—Haydon, the detective, who had been sent for, asked the prisoner how he got the cheque—he said from a person whom he met at a public-house—he was then asked if he knew the person—he said that he did not know his name or address, but he had had two or three transactions with him in the way of business—he was asked what they were—he said he had made him a small table or desk as he was a cabinet-maker, but he did not know who he was or where he lived—the chief cashier told him he must consider himself in custody for presenting the cheque, as it was forged, and Haydon then went with him to a public-house, but not to the one he named—the messenger brought back Mr. Tuck's cheque-book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—this cheque is one which has been taken out of it about a dozen pages on beyond the place where the counterfoils have been used.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Several other persons were standing at the counter—I had half-a-dozen yards to go to the cashier—I was talking to him a few minutes—I had to find out the signature taken in the book on opening the account, and to compare it with the cheque—the cashier and I then went back to where the prisoner had been left, and we found him in the same place—the cashier invited him into his room—Haydon arrived in about ten minutes.</p>

               <p>—I saw the prisoner at the counter, and asked him if he had got the cheque from Mr. Tuci—he said "No"—I asked him if he knew who he got it from—he said "From a gentleman"—I asked him where he was—he said "Round the corner at a public-house"—I asked him if he knew Mr. Wilson, the payee—he said that he did not—I asked him to wait, and sent to Mr. Tuck to ascertain if it was right, asking one of the messengers to go to the door—when I ascertained that the cheque was incorrect, I asked the prisoner to go into the waiting-room, where I told him that there was a great doubt about the cheque, and left Haydon to ask him questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My opinion at first was that it was Mr. Tuck's writing, but that it had been done with a steel pen—I certainly should not have paid it because the genuine ones have the appearance of being written with quill pens; they are thicker writing—it appears to have a resemblance in the termination of the surname—the figures are not usually filled up by Mr. Tuck—I was on one side of the counter and the prisoner on the other—I asked him to wait, and he showed no disposition to go—I said "Will you step this way?" and I walked on the inside of the counter on the private side, and he walked on the public side—we joined at the end of the counter, and went into the room together.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I went into the private room of the London Joint Stock Bank, and saw the prisoner—I said "You have been told that I am a police officer—it will be my duty to ask you for the best explanation you can give with reference to this matter—the cheque which you have presented is, as you have been told, a forgery"—he said in substance "I had an appointment at 1.30 this afternoon with a gentleman at the public-house, at the corner of Coleman Street; I have known him about twelve months, and have had two or three transac-tions in business with him; I don't know his name or his address or occupation; I kept my appointment and waited a considerable time, and was leaving the public-house and met him coming in; I went with him to a public-house, at the corner of the street, just round to the left; he asked me to have some refreshment, and then asked me take this cheque to the London Joint Stock Bank to cash it, and bring the money to him at the public-house"—he said that he had on one or two occasions done business with him—I requested him to point out the public-house, and went with him to the Three Bucks Tavern, at the corner of the Old Jewry—I asked the barmaid in his presence if she had any recollection of his being there with a gentleman—she said "Yes," and that she overheard some conversa-tion in which mention was made of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she did not know which—the prisoner questioned at the Mansion House the accuracy of part of my evidence—he said that he did not say he had known the gentleman twelve months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer of Union Court, Old Broad Street, and have an account at the London Joint Stock Bank—this cheque has not my signature, nor is it written by my authority—I do not know Wilson—I find the form has been taken out of the middle of my cheque-book—I have not <hi rend="italic">the</hi> slightest idea how.</p>

I had to meet him on Thursday, and he walked as far as a public-house at the corner of the Old Jewry, where he asked me to have something to drink. I was to get a table from him, which was not ready. He said how much shall it be, 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,? I said "No. 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; "I then had a glass of beer with him. While I was agreeing with' him as to the price, he took me off my guard and asked me if I knew the London Joint Stock Bank. I replied I knew almost all the banks, but not by name. Then I went with the cheque, which the bar-maid saw him give me. I wfas told at the bank it was a forgery, and the officer came in, and I took the officer back with me to the public-house. The barmaid then told him that the gentleman did not stop long after I went.—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner received a good character.</hi>)</p>

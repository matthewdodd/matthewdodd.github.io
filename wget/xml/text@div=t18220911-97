The prisoner absconded on the 10th of July, and never paid me Perdue's money. His wages were paid every Saturday night - he did not ask for them. I afterwards applied to Perdue for the money. He had 15 s. a week, and only worked part of the day.</p>

He gave me the bill, which I produce. I did not ask him, nor did he write a receipt. Mr. Taylor came about a week after, and I told him I had paid the prisoner.</p>

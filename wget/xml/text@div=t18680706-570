                  </hi>. I live at 27, Anchor Alley, St. George's—on 20th June, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Red Lion Alley alone—I had been drinking a little, but was not drunk—I met the two prisoners and another woman—one of them said, "Now let him have it"—upon that, Calman struck me two violent blows in the face, and I was on the ground in a moment—I put my hand to my watch, and kept that from going—the chain broke off—I thought at first my watch was gone, but afterwards found it was only my chain—I saw Calman afterwards, and identified him—I had seen him before—he only lived in the next street to me—I never talked to him in my life.</p>

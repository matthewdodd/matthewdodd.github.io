(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "White Hart Hotel, Brent-wood, 9th September, 1876. I am unable to send your orders to-day, it being Saturday. I am very sorry not to have them forwarded Mr. Simcox, of Rumford, will give me an order at Chelmsford on Tuesday.

A telegram was sent on 13th September—I got the telegram produced, from Sudbury "Your telegram addressed to Halstead forwarded; reply will be sent by first post"—one letter besides came after—I think the letter of the 13th is the last; that is the day after I sent the telegram to suspend business and come home—from that time I got no in<lb></lb>telligence of him—after we had a letter from the Bell Hotel, Chelmsford, I sent Mr. Baohelor to see where he was—we sent him to Chelmsford once and to Colchester once—we had a letter about his being at the hotel at Bury St. Edmunds—I got this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 8th November, from the County Gaol, Essex, after his committal for trial (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>"Messrs.

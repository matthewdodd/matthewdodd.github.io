             sworn. - I am one of the patrol belonging to Bow-street: Between twelve and one o'clock at night on the 25th of April, I was standind at the corner of the Angel at Islington, when a man came past me with a bundle in his right hand, and these three plates upon his left arm; I ran up to him and stopped him; I asked him, what are you doing with those plates; he said, they are my own; I asked him how he came by them, and he said he bought them of a man at Enfield; I asked him who, and he could not tell me.</p>
               <p>Clarke. These are my plates; they are marked J A C, and J M C.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you loose a pair of trowsers at any time? - A. We did, on the 20th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, they were found on the prisoner. The prisoner had been in our service many years. I had him stopped, when he was going to leave the warehouse at night, from information that I received from Mr. Steel. He was brought into the counting house to me, I told him that I had reason particularly to suspect him, that we had lost au article that could not be taken out of the warehouse by fair means, he said he knew nothing about them, I was welcome to satisfy myself that he had not got them about the warehouse in any part that he was employed. I told him that I must first be satisfied that he had not got them about his person; upon which he immediately said that he had, and put his hand under his apron, and apparently from the forepart of his breeches; he took them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. Seven shillings; I knew them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What could he earn? - A. He lived with us about twelve years, he had standing wages, twenty-five shillings a week, besides an handsome acknowledgement at Christmas; his pay was constant, whether ill or well.</p>

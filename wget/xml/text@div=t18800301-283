                  </hi>. I live in Bath Road, Chiswick, and am in partnership with Richard Freeman in some building operations—the prisoner was our clerk about six weeks—on 26th January we owed Mr. T. W. Far<lb></lb>milce, of Rochester Row, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I handed this crossed cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the prisoner and told him to write a note stating that he enclosed the cheque, and I saw him put the letter with the cheque and seal it in an envelope which he placed in the office, for posting—the office is a temporary building on the estate—it was the prisoner's duty to post the letters—on 2nd December I received the cheque back through our bankers, and we were debited with the amount—this endorsement, "F. W. Farmiloe," is to the best of my belief the prisoner's writing; it corresponds with this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I saw him write—he was supposed to hand me the letters for the firm unopened, whenever I went into the office—I was there on 4th Feb., and saw him there—he handed me this letter of Feb. 3rd on 7th Feb. open—he had no authority to open it—I had asked him half a dozen times if he had posted Mr. Farmiloe's letter, and he said he had, and I asked him several times whether he had received a receipt—he said "No," and I told him to write for one on the 4th—I got this letter from Mr. Farmiloe—I had given no authority to the prisoner for it to be written: "Gentlemen,—A cheque was posted to you on January 24th, Saturday. "We are now making inquiries, and will settle the matter in the course of a few days.—Yours truly, Barnes and Freeman, per R. G." On 4th February I told him to write for a receipt—I was at the office again on Saturday, February 7th, and asked the prisoner if he had received a receipt from Familoe, and he brought me this letter open: "Dear Sir,—In reply to yours, no cheque has yet reached us, and we shall be glad to have same by early post.—T. W. Farmiloe." I have not changed any cheque at Mr. Suter, the grocer's, nor have any of my cheques been sent down there, but I have drawn small cheques, which I believe have been changed there—on 9th February I gave the prisoner in custody—I heard him ask Sergeant Francis to let him look at the endorsement on the cheque—the inspector asked him why—he said "I thought it was written with a quill; a quill is sometimes used in our office"—he told me half a dozen times that that letter had been posted with the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am the senior partner—Mr. Freeman looks after the practical part—I cannot swear that the endorsement is in the prisoner's writing—I was there every day from 27th January to 7th February—when I was not there the prisoner was not entrusted alone to pay the wages of 90 workmen, Mr. Howard, the foreman, assists in paying on Saturdays—the prisoner was trusted with money to a large extent, sometimes 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—we pay about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—on the 24th, in the afternoon, I told the prisoner I had lost my key of the office, but I found it about a fortnight afterwards—I sometimes posted letters myself if I was going to the station—there were other letters on this day, but I did not post them—I saw them on the desk—I had no letter to post that day with a cheque in it—there was no cheque that day payable to a Mr. George Wright, dated the 24th—I do not recollect Mr. Freeman asking me as to the posting of that; cheque, or my telling him that I had given it to a page boy to post—I had no reason to be angry with the prisoner—he had been employed to check</p>

               <p>the accounts of the firm, and he came to the conclusion that I had had more than I was entitled to; that was a fact, but it was with the consent of my partner—no cheques were ever drawn out without our mutual consent, and they were all payable to order—Mr. Farmiloe's initials are S. "W., and the endorsement looks like F. and W.—I gave the prisoner the cheque at 9.30 or 10 a.m, and business was over by 1 or 1.15—I did not open the letter of 3rd February in the prisoner's presence—I did not instruct him to write this letter—I think I said at the police-court that I had told him to write for a receipt to Farmiloe—I may have said that that was the letter I instructed him to write to Mr. Farmiloe, but that was a mistake on my part—the prisoner only opened invoices which came in halfpenny envelopes—I never bad an open letter handed to ma</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I subsequently found my key in an old pair of trousers at my private house—none of the workmen could get it there—I had no feeling against the prisoner for finding out that I had drawn more than my share—as far as I know I never had a letter handed to me which had previously been opened by the prisoner—Messrs, Farmiloe's envelopes do not bear their stamp outside—this letter was handed to me, but I swear I did not read it—Mr. Suter is not a friend of mine, but I have heard that he has changed our crossed cheques for our workmen—I never saw him till 9th February.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Barnes—I was present on 24th January when a cheque for Mr. Farmiloe was handed to the prisoner—I saw him write a note and place it in an envelope and put it in front of his book on his desk at 1.15 on Saturday—he afterwards asked me for the key of the office—I said, "What do you want it for?"—he said, "I have left my coat in the office"—I said, "I am going that way; I will go with you"—I was then at my residence—when we got 100 yards from the office he said, "You need not go any farther; I can go and get my coat if you will give me the key; you need not go; I don't think I have posted Farmiloe's letter"—I said, "If you have not there will be a tremendous noise about it"—he said nothing—I went as far as the door with him and tamed the key myself, and he entered about 2 yards, and said, "It is all right"—I thought he meant that the letter was there—we went back together part of the way—on the Monday or Tuesday after that I asked him if he bad posted the letter, and he said that he had—on the 30th I asked him again, as we had a letter from Farmiloe's saying that they had not had the cheque, and he said he had posted it—on the 7th Mr. Barnes asked him again if there was any receipt—he said "No"—all letters, except invoices, are opened by Mr. Barnes or myself—the prisoner's instructions were not to open any, and he has never handed me any opened—I did not give him authority to write the letter of the 4th, or any letter whatever excepting for orders—I know Suter, the; grocer; I have changed from 30 to 50 cheques there; I deal there, and my daughter changed them for me—I cannot say whether the prisoner knew that, but he knew that the other workmen changed their crossed cheques there—the endorsement to this cheque is in the prisoner's writing, to the best of my belief; I have seen it on several occasions, and I believe this to be a T—Mr. Barnes has drawn more money than his share by mutual arrangement, and I have not taken offence at it; nothing has been said about it; we are going on in our usual way.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The reason he gave for not posting the cheque was that we were short of money and we must keep it back till Monday—that was not true.</p>

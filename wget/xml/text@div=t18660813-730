                  </hi>. I live at 64, Denbigh Street, Pimlico—last Wednesday evening, the 8th August, I went to Guildhall yard—a large meeting was being held—I felt a hand that pulled my watch out of my pocket and loosed the watch from the chain—the prisoner had been close to me—I put my hand upon him, saying, "You have robbed me of my watch"—two gentle<lb></lb>men seized him and said they saw him do it—I saw the watch lying on the ground about two moments after.</p>

                  </hi> (City Policeman 280). Last Wednesday evening, about half-past eight o'clock, I was in the Guildhall yard with Hoby and Smart—there was a crowd there—after watching the prisoner some minutes I saw him go up behind the prosecutor, and put his right hand round the prosecutor's waist, taking hold of his watchguard and drawing the watch from his waistcoat pocket—I was close behind him—at the end of six or seven yards he got his left hand to his right when I heard a click—I laid hold of him by his collar—the prosecutor, turning round at the same time, said to the prisoner, "You have got my watch"—I handed him over to the custody of Hoby, who was with me, and with the assistance of Smart and other officers we cleared a path back—Smart picked up the watch within a yard of where he was standing—I took him to the station—he was wearing a metal chain—that was all I found on him.</p>

                  </hi> (City Policeman 899). I was with the last witness in Guildhall yard about a quarter-past eight—I saw the prisoner follow up behind the prosecutor—I was close to Green—I followed him and saw his hand round the prosecutor—he walked some distance, and then Green said, "He has got it"—the prosecutor turned round directly and said, "You have got my watch"—Green held the prisoner some time and then handed him to me—Smart and Green then together got the people back, and Smart came back to me with the watch.</p>

I was with Green and Hoby in Guildhall yard, a little after eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner pushing up against the prosecutor—I saw Green catch hold of him by the collar just at the time I saw the prosecutor lose the watch—I found the watch on the stones close by my feet—the glass was broken.</p>

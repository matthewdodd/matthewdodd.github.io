               <p>Did she tell you who she was? - She first said her name was Forbes, but before the Justice, she said her name was not Forbes, but Cummins; I do not recollect seeing her before; but when she came into the shop, she said she had been in the shop a year ago, and bought a parcel of goods, and paid ready money for them; and one of my clerks says, he recollects her; nobody came with her or after her as I can recollect; nobody appeared connected with her, or belonged to her; she passed entirely, and acted in looking out the goods, as a woman that knew business exceeding well.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to the last witness; the prisoner came to our house, on the 1st of January; I was to serve her; she first of all wanted something in the millenery line of one of the ladies in the back warehouse; on returning out of the room, I asked her if there was any thing I could serve her with; she said she wanted several articles in the haberdashery line, she kept a shop at Winchester; she said first ribbons, she looked out a considerable quantity; I turned to reach a different colour that she wanted; and when I turned back, I missed some pieces off the counter; I had every reason to suspect the prisoner guilty, there not being another customer near me at the time.</p>
               <p>What did you miss when you turned back again? - Two half pieces of ribbon; nobody was near but her and me, except two or three of the servants in the shop that were passing and repassing; I did not find the colour that she wanted; I informed her I would look into the drawer of cut ribbons; I reached that out, and she fixed on the colour that she wanted.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take any thing? - I cannot positively say I saw her take any thing, but I thought I saw her put something into her pocket, which I took to be the end of a ribbon block, which is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701120014"></xptr>white paper put over the end of the ribbon; she fixed on two or three different colours of ribbons which she liked in the drawer, which were cut; I informed her if that was not a sufficient quantity, I would get her a piece of the same, she said she would take what there was of them; I then went and informed my master that I suspected her; I immediately left him and went and shewed her more pieces of ribbon.</p>
               <p>Did you then tell him you had seen her put something in her pocket that appeared to you like the end of a ribbon block? - I did not.</p>
               <p>But are you sure that you saw it? - I am sure that I saw it; after I had done serving her with some ribbons, she asked to look at some lace, and I shewed her two or three different drawers, and she looked out a very considerable quantity to a very considerable amount; they were not measured; after she had looked out what lace she wanted, she said, I will not look out any more now, can you measure these things over now while I am here; I said it will take some time to measure them; she said if you will be so obliging to do it immediately, I will call in the course of two hours, and I beg you will have a bill made out of the lace and ribbons, and to mark the ribbons that I may know what to sell them for, and the lace likewise; she begged I would not delay any time, as she was under the necessity of returning to Winchester that evening; this was the morning of the first of January; I cannot say the hour; she begged I would get them all ready to pack up in a chest, and get the chest ready, and a bill and receipt, and she would pay for them on her return, I then suffered the prisoner to go out of the shop; after she had got about eight or ten yards, I went after her, and told her that there was some part of the ribbons that I was not sensible how she would have them charged; I begged her to come back and tell me; she came back, and I desired her to walk up stairs in the dining room; and the constable went with me; immediately upon her entering into the room, she took from under her cloak, upwards of forty-nine yards of lace, a large card, I saw her take it from under her cloak; I did not see her take any of the lace in the shop, and I had not the least suspicion of her taking it: at the time she took the lace from under her cloak, she was amazingly confused; I begged she would put her hand in her pocket; the constable was then present, and pulled out the ribbons which she had taken of Mr. Dyde's property; she pulled out all I believe she had.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing? - She was very much confused, and hoped we would not expose her; she delivered up the whole of the property that she had in her possession, and begged we would let her go; she was immediately taken to the Justice's where I was present; she was examined there.</p>
               <p>Was that examination taken in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before? - Never in my life to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Were these pieces of ribbon and the lace together? - She had them in her possession.</p>
               <p>Were they in the same drawer? - No, they were in separate drawers; she looked them out separately.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take any of them out of any of the drawers? - She took them, I imagine, from off the counter after she had looked them out of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Were they all upon the counter at the same time? - She had not done looking out the whole of the ribbons before I missed some.</p>
               <p>Did you shew her the lace after she had done looking out the ribbons or before? - After.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; I was sent for to Mr. Dyde's; when I came there the prisoner was in the shop; the shopman ordered me to wait at the door; I waited at the door a considerable time; when she came out of the shop, and Mr. Smith followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701120015"></xptr>her, and he and I brought her back again; we took her up in the dining room, and in searching her I found this piece of ribbon, and the lace; I stripped her almost naked, as far as decency would permit; I searched her; the first pull I made, was getting the lace from under her cloak; some she pulled out, and some I took out of her pockets; the lace and ribbons have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Smith. I know the whole of them to be my master's property by the private mark; except two half pieces of ribbon which are not marked.</p>
               <p>Was it the seeing her have the end of the block in her hand as you thought, that gave you the suspicion? - No, I suspected her from missing two pieces of ribbon; I did not see her take the lace; I had not the least knowledge of her having it in her possession.</p>
               <p>Was what you saw any thing wrapped up in paper? - It was like the paper at the end of a piece of ribbon, her hand was over it.</p>
               <p>Could it be the lace? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say in my own defence; I rely on the mercy of the Court and Jury.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses? - Nobody knows any thing of my situation.</p>

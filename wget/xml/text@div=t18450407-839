                  </hi>. I am a Pole. I live at 5, Plough-street, White-chapel, and am a labourer in the London Docks. Last Friday week, when I came from work, I missed my wife and children, eight sovereigns, some silver, some bed-furniture, blankets, bacon, and other things—I knew the prisoner before that day.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps No. 5, Plough-street, Wbitechapel. On the morning of last Friday week I saw the prisoner come up stairs—he felt about for the key, found it, and opened the prosecutor's door—he went into the room, and came out again—I came down myself at twelve o'clock—the door was shut then—I went up again at two, and found it open—I saw the prisoner again about six o'clock that evening—he came into our shop, and inquired for Mrs. Soswinskie—he said he wanted her, and asked if she had come home—I asked why he asked the question—he made no answer—I said, "You had the key, and entered Mrs. Soswinskie's room this morning"—he said, yes, he knew he did—I said, "Yes, I saw you"—he said, "Yes, I know you saw me, and I saw you"—he said he was sent for the piece of bacon—that Mrs. Soswinskie sent him, and told him if he would fetch it, she would give him 2lbs. of it—that he took it, and he also confessed to leaving the door open at the dinner hour, and that he partook of the bacon and eggs with Mrs. Soswinskie.</p>

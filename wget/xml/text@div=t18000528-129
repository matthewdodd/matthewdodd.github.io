             sworn. - On the morning of the 14th of April, about half past three, I went to my father's house, with my husband, to lay a watch, as we had been robbed before; we staid till almost six o'clock, inside my father's house; then I doublelocked the door, and came away; I saw the back-door with the bar up, and screwed; I made a mistake, and left a paper at home that I wanted, and I returned about a quarter past seven; I found the street-door locked as I left it, and as I unlocked the door, I saw the prisoner in the house; he fled towards the back-door, and got out side-ways, he stooped to get under the bar; it was quite light enough for me to see who it was; as I advanced towards the yard-door, I saw the bag lie at the threshold of the door, I did not see him drop it; the drawer was left quite open; I locked the door, and went to a neighbour; I told him what I had seen, and he went with me to the boy's father; I said, that is the boy, I knew him perfectly; I used to employ him in a morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That was without your father's knowledge, I believe? - A. Yes; if I was in a hurry, he would go with a paper or two for me, and I used to give him a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband entrusted with the key of your father's house? - A. My father does not so particularly give him the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father desire you not to deliver it to him? - A. No, he never did; I generally kept it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or not, intrust him with it? - A. Sometimes I might.</p>

               <p>Q. With your father's knowledge? - A. My father never asked me about it.</p>

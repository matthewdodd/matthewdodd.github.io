            Perfectly so; the servant shut the door after me.</p>

            How soon after you had been in bed were you alarmed? - A. I went to bed about a quarter before one; I was alarmed about half past three; I thought I heard a noise, though not a very loud noise, it was an unusual one; I got out of bed and looked out at the window which looked into the court-yard before the house, which is inclosed with folding doors; it was formerly a shop, which I knocked down for my own convenience to make it more airy; I saw a strong light either in or upon the office of Mr. Mangnall; we had a pair of large reflectors; I was not certain whether it was from that, or what it was.</p>
               <p>What connection had this office with the office that you bolted yourself? - A. It is no more than a large closet; in that office one goes out of the other; they all communicate and form a part of the house; I was not certain whether some of the servants might not be up; I desired Mrs. Welch to pull the bell; I immediately saw four men run down the yard as hard as they could run.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they appear to be running from? - A. I saw them run from the steps of the office door; I called out thieves, and recollected I had a rattle immediately under my hand, and sprung it.</p>
               <p>Court. How was your office situated? - A. The house door and the office door are together from the court-yard; there is only a partition between; they had some difficulty in getting out, the gates being new and swelled with the wet weather; they

             the gates some time before they could get out; I dressed myself as soon as I could, and went down stairs; when I got down stairs, I went to the door that I had bolted with two bolts the night before, and found that some of the people, that had been in the pursuit, were in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the names of those persons? -

            Peter Bricknell, belonging to the Aldersgate-street Coffee-house, and one of the watchmen; when I came down stairs, I unbolted both the bolts; the door that I bolted was the inner door of the office; I found the outer door open; but the inner door was in the same state that I had left it; I unbolted it and opened it; it fell, having been wrenched off the hinges; some person, which I believe was the waiter, caught it upon its falling; on the inside of the door there was a piece of iron that is termed a dog, or otherwise upon the hinges being wrenched off, the door must have been opened; it prevented them from drawing the door off, and prevented it from being pulled away; then I got into the clerk's office, and there I found that one of the desks that was locked was broke open, and all the papers in confusion; I went into Mr. Mangnall's office; we have three offices, which are all connected; the clerk's office is nearest to the street door; it opens upon the steps where I saw the persons running down from; then we go from there to Mr. Rutherfords's office; Mr. Mangnall's, which has a sky-light in it, is to the left; Mr. Rutherford's is at the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Which of these was the one that you bolted? - A. The clerk's office; the door which leads into the clerk's office, from the court-yard, was made by me; there was only one door till, for my own convenience, I turned that window into a door; I went into Mr. Mangnall's office, and found two panes taken out of the sky-light, and the remainder of the glass lying about; I discovered, likewise, the print of the foot of some person upon the inside cell of the window, and upon an armed leather chair that Mr. Mangnall sits at his desk to write in.</p>

            Was the aperture large enough, that was occasioned by the breaking of these two panes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020039"></xptr>to admit any body coming in? - A. Yes; there was plenty of room, for they were lap-lights, not cross framed; but the same as green-house lights; I observed upon the plaister stucco work that goes up to the window where this sky-light was, at the top, something like a man's foot, that had scratched it a great deal; it was only done a few days before; I saw a mark of dirt upon the iron railing in the front of the window; the sky-light is at the top, and the windows of the office meet it; it leads into our court-yard; when I made further observation, I found that the outer door of the clerk's office had been attempted; and part of it broke to pieces; the pieces were laying about; I then went into Aldersgate-street, and in consequence of some enquiry that I made, I went to the watch-house, and there I saw the prisoner Jones, in a very dark coloured coat, and boots.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were making away from the steps, as you have described, did you see them beyond your gateway? - A. No, I did not; I found some watchmen in a passage leading to a warehouse belonging to a man of the name of Wyllie, a paper man; we heard a noise that seemed to proceed from the back of that warehouse, as if somebody was clambering over; in consequence of information from some of the neighbours, we went into Golden Lion-court, which is in Aldersgate-street, nearly opposite our house; the waiter of the coffee-house, and some watchmen, went with me; the court has a very narrow entrance for near twenty yards, so narrow that two people can hardly stand a-breast; it then opens into a wider part of the court, and there are houses on both sides of the way; the back of which houses look into Parliament-court; we were then in pursuit of them; I saw the two prisoners, Smith and White, in their shirts; Smith, the middle man in the dark hair, was without either coat or waistcoat; White had his waistcoat on; they were close to a man of the name of Spires, who lives in the court; somebody said out loud, these are the thieves; upon which, I challenged them, both of them said, they were not thieves; that they were looking for thieves; they had all three of them boots on. The prisoner Smith, the middle man, was in a most excessive heat, the perspiration ran down his face; I never saw a man in so great a heat in my life; White was very hot too, but not so hot as Smith; Smith was remarkably hot, as if he had ran a race of twenty miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they hats on? - A. I cannot be sure; Smith had not, I think; White, I believe, had, but I will not be sure; Smith, I am almost positive, had not; but I think White had; I then took them from the spot to the watch-house; I then went back again home: with respect to the office door, we have a bar, two bolts, and a chain; they were all open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that door in that state before you went in pursuit, or did you observe it when you came back again? - A. Before I went in pursuit of them; I wanted them to give some account of themselves at the watch-house, but they would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house is this? - A. Mine; I hold it of the Wax-chandlers' company; and for my own convenience, as well as the business, I made these offices, meaning, upon the settlement of our accounts, to charge something for it; but that is not yet settled; I never had any acknowledgement yet, and it is possible that I never shall.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay the rent and taxes? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the property? - A. No; I did not miss any thing of my own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Shephard. - Q. I believe I understand your description of the house, but I should like to be sure that I do; there is a court-yard before the whole building? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it there is a door to your dwelling-house? - A. Yes; and there is a door to the office, leading to the same stairs that the hall door does; there is an outer door to the office that comes into the court-yard, so that you can go directly out of the court into the office, without going into the dwelling-house, which communicates with the door that I bolted; I bolted the side of it next the dwelling-house, that nobody in the office could come into the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. That inner door you found bolted in the same state, after the alarm? - A. Yes, with the hinges wrenched off; I found in the yard a dark lanthorn, a crow, and a picklock.</p>
               <p>Q. The inner door had not been opened, whatever attempts might have been made? - A. It had not.</p>

I have not ascertained it with them, between the Midsummer and Michaelmas quarter; we found it convenient to move our office into our house; it was before carried on in Mr. Rutherford's house; we found it more convenient for business to remove it to our house; I told Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Mangnall, I should wish the business to go on there; and with respect to what the business was, to pay me for the use of the offices, we would settle that at some other time; the lease cost me above two thousand pounds; I proposed that they should pay me the rent and taxes, and in our books I debited to the partnership the rent and taxes; I pay for the whole house; I consider the dwelling-house as an equivalent to the purchase of the lease.</p>

               <p>Q. So that in fact the result of the whole enquiry comes to this, that for the use of these offices and carrying on the business, they are to contribute something towards the rent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you must have had a very transient view of the persons you saw running away? -

            Certainly.</p>

            After you had seen the four parties go from the steps, you dressed yourself and went to the watch-house? - A. Yes: the watch-house is about thirteen or fourteen doors, or rather better, from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Although the partners have not ratified the terms you mentioned, in point of fact, are not these the terms upon which you carry on your business? - A. I have entered one of the taxes, which I paid the other day, and no objection has been made.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. - Q. Can you recollect whether it was before or after that robbery that you mentioned this to Mr. Rutherford? - A. I had some conversation with Mr. Rutherford, and he rather conveyed the idea that he did not agree to it; and I firmly believe now, that they will not agree to the proposal that I made.</p>
               <p>Q. You considered, and they considered, that something was to be paid? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The objection that they made was so the quantum that they were to pay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time of this robbery your partners were liable for part of the rent and taxes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time of your seeing the four persons go from the courtyard and seeing Jones in the watch-house? - A. Seven or eight minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. After this you went in search of other persons; what time was it after that that you saw the prisoner Smith? - A. It might be about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BURTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am in the service of the East India Company: I was a supernumerary watchman in Aldersgate ward; on the night of the 23d of October last, in the discharge of the duty of a watchman, about half past three in the morning, I was coming up Aldersgate-street, I heard a cry of watch; I stood still, considering where the voice came from; I thought it came further up the street from where I was; but almost instantaneously I heard the screech of a rattle; I thought the noise of the rattle came from the same place that I heard the voice from; I was proceeding up the street, but hearing a very great noise at Mr. Welch's gate, I made a stand, and in the space of one minute out rushed three or four men, I cannot be positive which, from within the gates; as they came out I made a seizure of one of the persons; but, owing to the velocity with which he came out, I could not keep any hold.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020042"></xptr>Q. Look at the prisoners, and see which of them you laid hold of? - A. That is the man, Jones; I caught hold of him somewhere about his breast, but could not keep him; they made their retreat across the street; they ran up a court nearly opposite to the gate; I followed after them; I saw him afterwards in the watch-house, and to the best of my knowledge he was nearly the same stature, that is all I can say about it; one of the watchmen got into the court before me, and got hold of the man; I attempted to seize him, and when I came up to him, the watchman made use of an oath, and told him, if he stirred, he would cut him down, nothing more transpired, but the other watchman took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. - Q. Did you see Jones in the court? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the same person you saw afterwards in the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Shepherd. - Q. You were the watchman that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the person you saw in the court you afterwards saw in the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that man was the man you attempted to seize? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your going up to the prosecutor's gate three men pushed by you with the utmost velocity? - A. Yes; I could not keep any hold, by the velocity with which they rushed out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he walking or running? - A. He stood up against a dead wall, and said, what do you want with me? - I said, I will let you know what I want with you, upon that I seized him with my left hand, and delivered him to another watchman, and he was conducted to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got into the court did you see any other man doing any thing? - A. No; only the neighbours out of the windows; after this. I saw some ladders moving; the ladders laid over the wall, I suppose about two yards high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any persons get over? - A. No; it leads over yards, and yards that belong, I believe, to five or six houses; over one gentleman's garden and another; the back windows of Parliament-court look into this yard; they were very poor, mean sort of places.</p>

On the night of the robbery, about half an hour after three o'clock, my wife waked me, and I heard an alarm of thieves; I got up and struck a light; I opened the door, and in came two men with the watchmen, and a great many others round the door; to the best of my knowledge the two men were the prisoners, Smith and White; as soon as I opened the door they holloa'd thieves, thieves, and ran; the waiter of the Aldersgate-street coffee-house came in; I said, for God's-sake, let no thieves in; the men said they were no thieves, but came to look for thieves; they ran out again and I ran out with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were their coats on when they came in? - A. Yes; they went out with their coats off; they chucked them on the ground in my room; one had a brown coat on, and the other a blue one; I cannot say whether they had boots on or not; the waiter said, don't let these men go, they are the thieves; Mr. Welch said there was another, and they laid hold of me, but the watchman said, no, I was an inhabitant of the place; I did not particularly observe them till they got to the watch-house; I saw my lodger pick up a hat in the court, after they were gone; I saw the prisoners at the watch-house; they are the same persons I saw in my house; one had a waistcoat on, the other had none; one of them asked for a hat, I don't know which; I said it was given to the watchmen, and they all had boots on.</p>

            What is the value of it? - A. I gave four guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. My Lord, it is not for the fake of occupying the time of the court, to have an opportunity of making a speech to the jury, or to combat any one single fact that I now rise, but to address you on a legal point as it arises on a part of the evidence. The indictment, in the first count, charges the prisoners with breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch; and in the second count, laying it to be the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch and partners: one of these propositions must be made out, either that it is the dwelling house of Mr. Welch, or of the partners. Mr. Welch describes his house thus: he had the whole house; he has made a part of it into offices; there is an inner door which communicates with the offices, which he found unbolted and the hinges broke; but as far as relates to that door there was no burglary committed; the part he inhabits was not broke, but only the offices, which I submit are no part of the dwelling-house either of Mr. Welch, or of Mr. Welch and the partners. If I take an outhouse or shop to my separate and distinct occupation, and the rest of the house is occupied by others, my shop is not a part of that dwelling-house; it can only be a dwelling-house as there is an unity of occupation, the dwelling-house of one person; the dwelling-house here is of one person; the offices belong to others; and if the dwelling house is that of one person and the adjoining part that of another, it will become a question, whether the persons occupying the adjoining part have any right in the occupation of the house at all? Mr. Welch does not left out parts of these offices to Messrs. Rutherford and Mangnall, but takes them in as joint temant of the offices, and there by they become so much joint possessors, that neither could bring an action against the other. The landlord of a house, who letts out a room to an individual, is occupier of the whole, and not a tenant in common. Now here Mr. Welch takes these partners into the offices, and proposes that they shall contribute something to the payment of the rent; this proposal has never been executed, either by writing or agreement, but they are let into possession, and therefore he has done that which, in point of law, would amount to an agreement; a proposal is made on one side and assented to on the other; the only thing not agreed to is the quantum that shall be paid; that is an agreement on which an action would lie. If a man offers me a house at a certain sum, I say, no, I will not give that sum; but, says he, take the house, and at Midsummer we will settle the sum; certainly that is a contract to become a tenant, an acquiescence to pay something, but not an adjustment of the sum; that makes no difference in point of law, the contract is the same. Then, if it be so, the question is, whether a man possessing a dwelling-house, and having let in two partners as joint tenants, can bring an action against the the others for entering into these officers, if he had chose to have fastened the door against them. He cannot if they are joint tenants; and this office, which is only and adjunct to the other part, cannot be the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch.</p>

               <p>My learned friends will say then, it is the dwelling-house of all three: that I deny, because it can only be a dwelling-house, as it is an adjunct to a dwelling-house; but to make it the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch as an adjunct it must be in the same occupation as the dwelling-house; and if this office were in the possession of other persons, it could not be their dwelling-house; if this dwelling-house be not the dwelling-house of Messrs. Welch, Rutherford, and Mangnall, neither can the offices be the dwelling-house of Messrs. Welch, Rutherford and Mangnall. Suppose there were a brew-house and a dwelling-house upon the same premisses, or a dwelling-house and a mill, it the mill were in the occupation of the man that had the dwelling-house, it would be a part of the dwelling-house; but if the mill were in the occupation of three partners, it would not be a part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020046"></xptr>The question then is, whether, when an outhouse is in the occupation of one person, and the dwelling-house in the occupation of another, you can state the outhouse as a dwelling-house? Does not Mr. Welch let these persons in as joint tenants? if he does, it is not Mr. Welch's dwelling-house; the office bears the character of dwelling-house, merely from its being a part of the dwelling-house; is then that part of the dwelling-house the dwelling-house of all three? Certainly not, because they have no part of that dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys and Mr. Knapp, on the part of the prosecution, contended, that the office was a constituent part of the house; that it was not parted off from the house; that Mr. Welch has the lease to himself alone, and pays the rent and taxes himself; that no contract had taken place; that a proposal had been made, merely that they should pay something, not for occupation, but for coming into Mr. Welch's house to do their business; and that if Mr. Welch had put a turn-up bedstead into the office for his servant to sleep in, it could not have been contended that it was not a part of the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, on the part of the prisoners, replied to the arguments of Mr. Knowlys and Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Court. - This case has been argued with great ingenuity, by Mr. Shepherd, on the part of the prisoners, but I cannot agree, that there is any separation in these premisses. The question is, what constitutes a dwelling-house. Now what is the case with this house as proved? Who takes the house? Mr. Welch; he takes the lease and occupies the whole. Has he divested himself of the occupation of any part of the house? But, because he has his business carried on in this house, it is contended, that that is a separation of the premisses; I cannot agree in that; I consider it as not being out of his occupation; he resides there himself and his servants.</p>
               <p>The next question is, whether the partners have any share in the house? do they contribute to the rent? do they contribute to the taxes, or to the servants? Now let us see whether the servants of the partnership are confined to this office; so far from it, that one of the clerks sleeps in the house of Mr. Welch. That does away the separation: I am of opinion it is to be considered as the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch, because neither of the partners are bound to pay rent nor taxes; and to consider them as occupiers of this house, it is necessary not only that they should have a servant sleep in the house, but that they should contribute to the rent and taxes; they do not pay rent and taxes, and therefore it is in the sole occupation of Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>If it were a fact that they are to contribute to the rent and taxes, that would let them in, and the second count would apply, for then it would be considered as the dwelling-house of the three partners; but, I think, upon this evidence, it is not made out to be the house of the partners, but the house of Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones's Defence. - I was passing by this street, on the morning that Mr. Welch says his house was broke open; I was going from Cheapside to the Jolly Carpenters in Old-street-road, to meet my brother, who is a news-carrier; I heard an alarm of fire; I asked the watchman where it was; he said he did not know; I saw a number of persons going up this court, crying fire; I went up, and the watchmen surrounded me; one laid hold of my hand, and another threatened to knock me down; I said I should make no resistance, but go with them; I then asked them what was the matter, and they did not know; I heard afterwards, that a house had been broke open; I am innocent of it; I was only passing at the time of the alarm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner White. - My Lord, I understood the trial was to be put off till to-morrow, and have sent home the witnesses to my character; I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. - I have not any thing to say; I am perfectly innocent; I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

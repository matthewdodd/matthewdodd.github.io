                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Buckley, a warehouseman, of 61, Basinghall-street—there was an account due to our firm by the prisoner, somewhere about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 19th March he called at our warehouse, and brought us this acceptance (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), as part cash payment, to take up a bill that was then a little over-due—so much money was paid in cash, and Mr. Gillman asked me if I would take the bill as payment for the remain<lb></lb>der—I said I would, subject to the approval of Mr. Buckley—I took it upon those terms, which Mr. Buckley afterwards approved of, and returned Mr. Gillman, as far as my knowledge goes, his bill—it was accepted as part pay-merit of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was due—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, March 17th, 1863.

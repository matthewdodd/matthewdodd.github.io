                  </hi>. I am a guard in the employ of the Great Eastern Railway Company—on 16th September I was guard of the 11.40 am. train from Yarmouth, due at Liverpool Street at 3.24 p.m., and which arrived at 3.36—on arriving at Ipswich the prisoner was given into my care and was going to London—at Colchester Miss Kew, a passenger, said she had got in at Yarmouth and her box was labelled to Liverpool Street, and I got it for her and the train then went on and the box in it—on arriving at Liverpool Street I took the box out of the luggage van and gave it in charge of Harber, a porter—the box was on the platform and the prisoner was by my side and could hear what was said—I said to Harber "Take care of this box belonging to Miss Kew; she will arrive by the slow twin, she got out at Colchester</p>

Mr. Rogers, at Ipswich, gave her into my care—he said she had never been in London before and required taking care of—he did not say she was but a child—I have been up and down from Ipswich three or four times this week, Mr. Rogers, the Master of the St. John's Home, at Ipswich, has not brought the prisoner backwards and forwards with my train—on 24th September I called upon him at the Home—I had heard that the prisoner was in Mr. Cocksedge's service—I asked Mr. Rogers whether he had sent a girl to service who went to Liver<lb></lb>pool Street from Ipswich, and he said "Yes"—I asked him for her name and address and he wrote it down, "Kate Keys, at Mr. Cocksedge's, Long Ditton, Surrey"—he did not ask me if anything had happened to her—I do not remember his asking why I wanted the address—he might have asked if she arrived all right or whether anything had happened to her—I said nothing about the box—this was eight days after the lx>x was missed—I had not heard that it was Mr. Cockpedge who fetched her from the station, but I heard some gentleman had fetched her—I do not remember telling Mr. Rogers that a box had been lost at Liverpool Street, and that I thought the gentleman who fetched her away might have confounded the two names of Miss Keys and Miss Kew—I did not mention those names, but I will not swear I did not say there might have been some confusion by the gentleman who fetched her at the station—I did not tell Mr. Rogers I thought so—he seemed anxious about the girl, and I told him there might be a little mistake—Harber and I have talked this matter over since it came on, but I have not asked him whether he stood by the box and was in pos<lb></lb>session of it from the time it was left with him till it was given to Keys, or whether anybody else had charge of it—I asked him what he had done with it when I heard it was lost—he did not say he gave it in charge of somebody else—he told me he had delivered it to the young lady—I know Joseph Hedington, the inspector—when the train arrived I had to see my van cleared of all the luggage, and was the only guard in charge of that van—it was an express, and a good many people came by it—when I spoke to Harber about this box the van was entirely cleared and the people were taking away their luggage—there were two luggage vans—Small, the under<lb></lb>guard, had charge of the other—I should have care of the parcels sent without passengers, and deliver them to the parcels porter and see them signed for.</p>

I am a lantern cleaner for the Great Eastern Railway, Liverpool Street—I was on the platform on 16th September, between 3 and 4 o'clock, and on the arrival of the Yarmouth train the guard Moye handed me a box and said "Will you give it to a young lady, Miss Kew, who is coming up by the 4.22 slow train?"—the slow train arrived from Colchester about 40 minutes after the fast train, and Keys came up to me on the plat<lb></lb>form, and pointing to the box Moye had given me for Miss Kew, said "I want that box," and put a pardel on the top of it—I said "What name, miss?" she said "Kew"—the box bore a label and I had read it—I said "Can I take it anywhere for you?"—she said "No, I am waiting here, and can I wait here till some one comes to meet me; can I stop about here?"—I said "Yes, you can stay here as long as you like, you are not in the way there, and I then left her with the box, and did not see who took the box away.</p>

I am police inspector at Liverpool Street, Great Eastern Railway—on 25th September I went to Mr. Cocksedge's, 6, Trem<lb></lb>lett Terrace, Long Ditton, to make inquiries—the prisoner was sent for, and I said to her, in the presence of the master and mistress, "What luggage had you when you left Ipswich?"—she replied "A brown paper parcel and a bandbox"—I said "You brought a box with you; how do you account for that?"—she said "A porter gave it to me at the Liverpool Street Station-.; I thought some one had given it to me"—I then identified the box, and said "Where is the label?"—she said "I don't know; I tore it off; I think it has been swept out with the dust"—I then said "I shall take you in custody for stealing this box, the property of the Great Eastern Railway."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Iver. On the 26th of August I bought these trowsers, handkerchiefs, and other things, of Mr. Gideon, at Uxbridg—I then went to the prisoner's house, on Uxbridge-moor, to sleep that night—I threw the bundle containing these things on the floor—at half-past five o'clock the next morning I got up, and the parcel and handkerchiefs were gone—I asked the prisoner where it was—he said I did not bring them there—these now produced are them.</p>

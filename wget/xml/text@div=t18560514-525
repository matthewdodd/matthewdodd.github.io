                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Well-street, Cripplegate. In the afternoon of 30th April, I came out Of one room into another, on my first floor—I saw the prisoners there, and they had got these three dresses, a shawl, about twenty yards of calico, and some other things—each of the prisoners had some of them in their arms—they saw me, and dropped them down—I asked them what business they had there—it was about half past 1 o'clock—my house is under repair and the painters had just gone—Quick said that one of the painters had sent her up for half a crown—I had seen these articles safe not ten minutes before, they were then in the further side of the room—I never saw the prisoners before.</p>

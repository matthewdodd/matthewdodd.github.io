I live at 26, Claremont Square, Islington—I am a Theatrical manager—I have held appointments as manager at Convent Garden Theatre, assistant manager to Mr. Charles Rice, manager to Mr. Charles Hengler, of Hengler's Circus, and Newsom's Circus, and I have also been An actor at the Adelphi, the Olmpic, and the Lyceum—I was two years with Mr. Fechter at the lyceum—I have also acted at the Opers Comique—Altogether I have been associated with the theatrical profession about 12 or 13 years—in October last year I arranged to get up a dramatic ball—a great number of ladies in the theatrical profession that I knew asked me to get up a ball—I arranged that it should take place at the Cannon Street Hotel, of which Mr. Rand is the manager—this is one of the tickets I had printed for the purpose of advertising this ball. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Great Hall, Cannon Street Hotel.—Mr. Hodson Stauley, at the request of numerous friends in The theatrical profession, has arranged to give a grand dramatic full and fancy Dress ball at the above hall on 28th October. A full quadrille band of the Orleans Club. Ladies' tickets half a guinces. Dancing to commence at 11.") For the purpose of selling the tickets I left some at Olliver's, in Bond Street, some at Lacon and Ollier's, Austin's at St. James's Hall, Bubb's Library, in Bond Street, and Hayes's at the Royal Exchange—all those Different offices undertook to sell these tickets—I gave instructions to each office not to sell them to ladies, if a gentleman wanted a ticket for a lady he could let him have them, as the gentleman would be guarantee to the lady's respectability—I have an office in Regent Street—I left tickets there for sale with the housekeeper—she was not to sell tickets to ladies—I took precauytions to prevent improper characters coming to the ball—hearing that some questionable characters might attempt to get in I engaged a pensioned superintendent of police named Limeburn, who was stationed at the door, and who was four years manager of the auditorium at the Alhambra, and</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter signed "Cannon Ball," and the articles containing the alleged libel, were read.

               <p>tell you with accuracy; more than 220—I can't say whether 250 were; between 220 and 250 were sold—about 18 or 20 were sold by Olivier's about the same number by Lacon, about 12 or 16 by Austin, about 8 or 10 by Bubb's and something like 20 or over by Hayes; that would be about 16—I sold a great many myself, and I think 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken at the door—I sent some tickets to Mitchell's for sale—I did not mention that, because I had a communication from a gentleman who had applied at Mitchell's for tickets, and they said they had not got any—it is not a fact that Mitchell's returned the tickets and refused to sell them, giving as a reason the charac<lb></lb>ter of the women who applied for the—that comes to my ears for the first time to-day—it is a fact that they returned them—they said they had rather not sell them—they did not give me any reason—I allowed 10 per cent—I did not ask Mitchell's the reason why they refused to sell them, because I went in in a lage—I had a letter from a gentleman living in Queen Anne's Mansions—I have not got the letter with me—he is not here—he was subpœnaed on the last occasion—he had applied for a ticket, and the clerk told him I had put Mr. Mitchell's name down without asking his permission—I paid 14 guineas for the room at the Cannon Street Hotel—the supper was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., wine and spirits were extra—I made rather a good thing of it—I don't know that it was in the interests of the profession; it was partly in my own interest, not entirely, but substantially, yes—the profits all went into my own pocket—there was no contribution to any dramatic fund for the relief of poor and distressed players—I sold the bulk of the tickets to gentlemen I am acquainted with—I sent them in envelopes to gentlemen I am acquainted with; having been acting-manager at three places in London, I know a great may people who are under oblig<lb></lb>ation to me, that I have given orders to; and when I have a benefit, or anything of that sort, I should send them tickets; I looked on this as a benefit—there were a few tickets on sale at the Navel and Military Club in Piecadilly, Lord Palmerston's old house—the hall-porter there had charge of them—I was to allow him 10 per cent commission, and I did so—I have not yet been to see how many tickets he sold—I have not got a running account with him—one of the waiters at the London Pavilion sold some—that is place frequented both by ladies and gentlemen—I did not sell any at Evans's—I did not put any of my bills on the tables at Evans's—I swear that I did not—I caused them to be put there—I left some of these circulars with Newby, the head-waiter, to pace on the tables for me—I should not think of being my own bill-distributor, that would be decidedly unbecoming the dignity of the profession—he had no commission—I asked him to oldige me as a customer there—ladies do go there, or did go there; not for some consider<lb></lb>able time though, I believe—at this ball thore were no members of the <hi rend="italic">demi<lb></lb>monde</hi> that I am aware of, not that I personally knew—my knowledge in that direction of socieity is not extensive, not more so than most people's I should think—I don't think there were many of that class there, or I should have had my attention called; there might be many—the waiters at Evans's gad no tickets to sell, so I could not have paid them for selling any—they have not said to me "We have sold a ticket to Mrs. So-and-so," nor have I paid them two shillings for doing so; that has happened at a former ball, not at this ball—I have not sold tickets at Evan's through the instrument<lb></lb>tality of Toome and Slack and paid them for selling them; that I swear, in no case—in my former ball Newby sold them—he was the only one I paid</p>

Rosa, once a <hi rend="italic">premier danseuse</hi> at the Alhambra—the ballet was very strong at the ball—they are very fond of dancing—there was also Miss Ash, and numerous others, mostly chorus singers—no more actresses—my name has always been Stanley since I have been in the profession; it has not always been Stanley—my name is C. H. Hodson—I took the name of Stanley for family reasons—my relations objected to my being in the profession at all—I was formerly a solicitor's clerk—at one time I was a comic singer—I sang comic songs—my name was then Harry Don—my first venture in organising theatrical parties was at the Theatre Royal, Colchester—I was lessee of it—I engaged Charles Mathews, a very unfortunate speculation for me—I lost a great deal of money—it was fortunate for Mr. Mathews—he always got his money; he always took good care to have it—I organised a concert to be given at Tunbridge Wells and Sittingbourne last December twelve months—Madame Brooke, Mr. Cheshire, the harpist, Mrs. Cheshire, and Mr. Sidney were among the troupe—I was the manager—I engaged them at a salary—I took the money at the door—I always do when I embark in any undertaking—I had a handbag with me—the members of the Company very unreasonably requested me to give them some money before they would go on the stage—the thing did not collapse in consequence of any refusal to give them anything—they took it in their own hands—I did not before that bolt to the reilway station; it was after that that they took it into their own hands—I was followed to the railway station by the indignant husband of one of the ladies—I was not found behind the door of one of the out-houses at the station—I was waiting for the train on the platform, not behind the door—the gentleman gave me into custody as he alleged for swindling him and his wife—I was not taken to the police-station—the officer refused to take me, and I went off by the train in question—at that time I was a member of the Junior Garrick Club—that is a club that is supposed to have some representatives of the dramatic profession among its members—after the incident at Tunbridge Wells I was expelled from the club—one of the members of the company I took down was a member of the club, and he brought it before the committee—I can explain the whole of the occurrence—I gave instructions to the booksellers not to sell tickets to ladies, and I myself did not sell tickets to ladies—I supposed that the ladies to whom I had sent invites would attend, that was the only thing I intended—I expected that a few of the gentlemen would bring ladies, their wives or their sweethearts—I decidedly thought that probable—I thought that the members of the Naval and Military Club would bring their wives or sweethearts with them; ladies in their own condition</p>

               <p>of life—I mean to say that decidedly, and so with those who bought tickets at Lacon and Ollier's and the other whose names have been mentioned; that was my idea—I think that idea was realised—the gentle<lb></lb>men of the Naval and Military Club brought ladies with them—I did not ask them for their certificates; I took it on trust; you are obliged to—I has only given one ball before—I have given two before—I am quite sure only two—I did give, or attempt to give, a theatrical entertainment at Tun<lb></lb>bridge Wells at Christmas about five years ago; the company that I engaged unfortunately, I believe, were not what they should have been; they did not come up to the expectation of the audience; I engaged artists, and if they did not turn out what they professed to be it was not my fault; there was no incident on that occasion about a money bag—I don't know that the police were called in; it might have occurred when I was absent—I went in the mail cart from Tunbridge Wells to get to Tunbridge to get to Brighton; there was no train—the proprietor of the hall spoke to a friend of his, the postmaster, and got me a seat on the mail cart—that must have been about 9 o'clock—the entertainment commenced at 9 o'clock; I was entrepreneur—the house was full; there was no more chance of any money coming in, and I wanted to get to town—I did not leave the money behind me, not likely—I took that with me in the mail cart—it paid very well—I gave a ball at the Assembly Rooms at 29, Vauxhall Bridge Road last year—I cannot exactly fix the date—I don't know whether that was attended by the <hi rend="italic">Elite</hi> of society—it was not a dramatic ball; it was not a ball given at the request of numerous friends of the theatrical profession; that was my own private spec for my own benefit—I don't know whether it was largely attended by the members of the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde</hi>, it might have been—I know Mr. Best—I can't swear that the women who attended were principally members of the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde;</hi> they might have been; I don't know; some of them might have been—I have a doubt; there may have been some unquestionably—my first ball was at the Freemasons' Tavern—Mr. Best is the proprietor—it was a dramatic benefit ball: for my own benefit; very much resembling the ball in Cannon Street—I did not take the same means of selling tickets for that ball that I took with reference to the Cannon Street ball—I took much more precaution at Cannon Street; that precaution was urged upon me by my previous experience—the Freemasons' ball was not wholly satisfactory—it was not such a very great success in point of money—there was a fair trade profit—some of the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde</hi> got in there; that was my first experience in giving a ball, and I did not know how to work it, I had been advised that if I went to the Freemasons' Tavern and one or two previous balls I might find ladies there to whom I could give complimentary admissions, I went to two balls there, and I gave my com<lb></lb>plimentary admissions away to ladies I saw in the room, and a great number of them happened to turn out members of the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde</hi>—I worked my ball at the Freemasons' from the Freemasons—I mean that I went to previous balls at the Freemasons' Tavern before my ball took place—I distributed my complimentary admissions to ladies I saw there, presuming they were fit to come to my ball, but a great number of them happened to turn out members of the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde</hi>, so I took the precaution at Cannon Street that nothing of the kind should occur again—my complimentary admissions were dis<lb></lb>tributed at the Freemasons' ball for other balls to ladies whom I had seen before, but whose names I did not know and did not ask, whose pro<lb></lb>fession</p>

               <p>I did not know and did not ask; I was taken by their appearance as likely to be attractive features at the dramatic ball; there is generally a dearth of ladies at balls—there was a large sale of tickets in that case just as there was in Cannon Strect—Mr. Best did not, in consequence of the number of ladies of that class that were let in the room, refuse to allow any more to come in; he closed the doors, but he did not give that as a reason; he gave me no reason—I had agreed to pay ten guineas—I refused to pay when he closed the doors—I asked him what the meaning of it was, but he gave me no reason, and afterwards when I went to settle with him I asked him to justify his conduct, and he said "I don't choose to justify my conduct in the least"—I heard from friends of mine that he said he did not like the people that were coming in, that they were prostitutes; they were ladies that I had met there before—I sold tickets for that ball at Evans's and also for the Assembly ball in Vauxhall Bridge Road, not always to gentlemen on those occasions—I sold to ladies at Evans's, and to gentlemen; I did not sell them, the head waiter did; I supplied them, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ticket—I did not give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to any one who sold one, only to the head waiter—I can mention names of other gentlemen besides Mr. Villiers who were at this ball; Mr. Charles Tritton, who holds a very good position at the Criterion Theatre as an actor; Mr. Goldsworthy, a member of Mr. Wyndham's Pink Dominoes Company; Mr. Charles Harris, stage manager of Covent Garden and the Adelphi—I don't know whether he is here; I subpœnaed him on the last occasion—Mr. Arthur Roberts, one of the principal comic vocalists; he is playing the principal part in the pantomime at Brighton; there were no very great stars there; I cannot mention other names that you would recognise—I engaged the room of Mr. Rand; he is the manager there—I heard that he was advised that the ball was likely to be of a questionable character; that it was going to be attended by people of the class alluded to—I might have told him that Messrs. Mitchell were selling tickets for me; at that time they had not refused to sell them; I swear that—I said I had sent invites to Messrs. James and Thorne, "Our Boys," and no doubt they would attend—I said I expected they would attend—I had no reason for saying so except that I had sent them tickets—Mr. Rand did not after that object to let me the use of the ball-room—he referred me to the solicitor of the company, Mr. Mortimer—I told him I had sent Mr. Hollingshead, of the Gaiety, a ticket—I did not say he would be at the ball; I could not vouch that he would—I said I expected he would—I had no reason to say so except that I had sent him a ticket—he kept the ticket, therefore I made sure that he would come—he subsequently returned it—I have said there were about 100 ladies present; that is a guess; there might have been more or there might have been less—I had nothing to do with the fancy dresses—people came in what dresses they chose—one was a naval officer that "Cannon Ball" so animadverted on—it was a very correct dress—there were costumes, but I really cannot describe them—there were two ladies as sailors—there were two romps, I believe; I mean with skipping-ropes and short frocks; you always see them at a fancy ball—there were people in fancy costumes, but I was too much taken up in seeing that everything was going on properly to notice the dresses—one of the hotel officials was cash-taker at the door—I don't know his name or whether he is here; he was not here last Session—Mr. Rand placed him there—the great majority of the women there were certainly not of the class you have been talking</p>

               <p>about; that I swear positively—from their appearance I should not imagine they were—they must have been either ladies in the profession—I sent invites to ladies in the profession, and if they gave them away I was not to know who they were—there were five librarians who had tickets, and the whole they sold were only four ladies' tickets each—of the 56 sold all were gentlemen's tickets but 20—I will pledge my oath that to the best of my opinion the majority of the women at the ball were properly conducted women, women of good character, and they were mostly ladies of the profession.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been connected with the theatrical profession for 40 years—I was at the Haymarket seven years performing in tragedy, light comedy, and walking gentleman—Mrs. Villiers and I carry on the entertainments at the Royal Hotel Assembly Rooms, Margate; also dances every evening during the summer season; they are admitted to be most respectable, and have had the criticism of the <hi rend="italic">Times, Daily Telegraph</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>—I have opened the Canterbury, and latterly the London Pavilion, and in these different undertakings I have endeavoured to keep the audience respectable—I have known Mr. Hodson Stanley about seven years—he sent me a ticket for this ball and I went to it, to the best of my recollection I arrived there about 11.45, and I think there was about 150 people dancing then; they were dancing most properly—I remained till 3.45—I saw Mr. Ledger there and spoke to him; I think it was then about 1 o'clock or 1.30, it is difficult to be positive to time—he said "How do you do? you have come here," and I don't think he said anything more the first time—I think I saw him again after the supper; no, pardon me, it was before; Mr. Stanley asked me to take the chair, being the oldest dramatic person present, and I said to Mr. Ledger "I have been asked to take the chair, but I don't see any necessity, because they surely don't require speeches as they come here for dancing"—Mr. Ledger said "Oh! I certainly should not take it if I were you"—he gave no reason—I did not take the chair—I told Mr. Stanley it would be unadvisable for any public man to take the chair, because it would only entail a lot of speechifying, which was not necessary at a public ball; and I don't know whether it was taken, I did not observe—at any rate nobody spoke as chairman—I remained after the supper, but did not notice anything unusual—I have attended many balls, and I may say that the impression I formed was that it was most orderly and respectable as far as a public ball would go—I did not notice any painted harlots, but I certainly noticed seven or eight or what we politely call the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde</hi>, but I see them in all assemblies that I go to; there was nothing in their demeanour or manner that was insulting or offensive—the whole thing was thoroughly well conducted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of the Cannon Street Hotel at which this ball was held—Mr. Stanley came to me in September last with a view of engaging the room—he produced to me a card with "Hodson Stanley, Junior Garrrick Club" on it—I did not know at that time that he had been expelled from that club—I have not got the card now—I engaged to let him the room—he represented it to be a dramatic ball—after I had to let him the room I received a communication giving me a warn<lb></lb>ing on the subject, in consequence of which I wrote to Mr. Stanley—I after<lb></lb>wards saw him, and referred him to my solicitor—he afterwards gave me the going to attend the ball, Messrs. Gatti, James, and Thorne, Mr. Willing, the advertising agent; I think that is all I necessary for me to see Mr. Stanley again—up to that time I did not know that he was not a member of the Junior Garrick Club; I knew before I heard it yesterday in Court that he had been expelled; I knew it before this case came on, but not till after what a dramatic ball is—I have no means of saying whether it was a ball largely attended by women of the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde</hi> class—I understood that 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken for tickets at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dramatic critic and author; my profession is that of literature; I have pursued that profession for some 20 years—Mr. Ledger consulted me about this ball, and I attended it at his request—I had Personal objection to going there myself, but he said I might be doing some good to the dramatic profession if I went there and reviewed it candidly, and gave a description—I attended, and I wrote almost all the letter singed "Cannon Ball;" it was altered editorially when it went in; there were one or two rather important alterations—I never mentioned Mr. Hodson Stanley's name at all; I thought it better to treat the fact generally; his name was put in afterwards—there was no other material alteration—I had written it as a general criticism without mentioning the name, and editorially it was altered so as to appear that Mr. Hodson Stanley gave the ball—this is the letter, there was no editorial comment by me—in writing that letter I was not animated by anything but a desire to give a correct account of what I saw—it is a perfectly accurate account of what I saw—a women there was pointed out to me as Mrs. Jeffreys, of Church Street, a notorious procuress; she was holding a semi-levy of young men and young women.</p>

I found I had lost 5 s. which I had seen safe in my left-hand pocket when I left the White Bear, in her company. I stated to the watchman that I had been robbed; he went in search of the girl and she was brought in a little time afterwards; I saw the half-crown taken from her bosom, and some copper - there was no mark on it, but I know I had it while I was in her company.</p>

I was on duty and heard a talking down the court - not quarrelling; I went to see what was the matter, and saw the prosecutor there, and the prisoner had hold of his waistcoat which was wide open - he had a bundle in his hand - I told them to go on about their business - I did not know what was in the bundle - I took the prosecutor to the watch-house - he then told me of the girl having robbed him; I pursued her and brought her in - the prosecutor had been drinking but knew what he was about - she said she had but 9 d., but the officer found 2 s. up in a corner.</p>

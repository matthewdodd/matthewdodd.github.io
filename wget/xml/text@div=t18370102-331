                  </hi>. I am servant to Thomas Carr and others, woolen drapers, 15, Warwick-street, Golden-square. On the 3rd of December the prisoner came to our shop about ten o'clock in the morning, and brought this order—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Gentlemen, please to send by the bearer 2 1/2 yds. of rifle-green Harrington, for J. G. Foster"—we have a customer named Foster, of Aldgate—I gave the paper to Richard Ward, the clerk, after executing the order—I gave him 2 1/2 yds. of Harrington—it is a kind</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020028"></xptr>
               <p>of cloth which gentlemen wear very much—I delivered the cloth to the prisoner, and he took it away with him—I have been in the habit of exe<lb></lb>cutting genuine orders like this, without their being addressed to cur house—it is not addressed to any person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where were you when I gave you the order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the shop, at the desk—I fetched the cloth from the top of the shop—the clerk never had the order in his possession till after I had executed it; I cannot say how many times I have served you before for Mr. Foster, but to the best of my knowledge I have seen you several times in our shop—I do not recollect serving you with 2 1/2 yds. of Harrington before—I do not know that you gave any name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I worked for Mr. Foster six or nine months, but never went to this shop but once—I took an order for the cloth—I was remanded two or three times, but they could not produce the order fur the Harrington which Mr. Foster had received—I fetched that, and took it to Mr. Foster, and they cannot find that order—it is very probable the one they have produ<lb></lb>ced here may be the one I took then—I was at work at Mr. Foster's at the time they say I brought this order, and Mr. Foster's books will prove it—I was not in their shop at the time. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I am positive he is the mar who brought the order, and I executed it with my own hands—I stated that before Sir Chapman Marshall at Guildhall, and it ought to have been put down in my deposition.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Carr. I saw the prisoner at our shop on the 3rd of December—I did not observe whether he brought any thing with him—this order was given to me up at the desk—it is the only one we had—it has been in my possession ever since it was delivered to me—it has been filed—I took it off the file after the first day it was brought, and kept it in a drawer—I took it before the Magistrate, and brought it back—I did not give the prisoner a bill of parcels of the goods—I made out an invoice, and gave it to Poulter—I saw him deliver the cloth to the prisoner—I signed my name before the Magistrate—this is my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>) I stated before the Magistrate that the other witness executed the order—not that I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to sign your name as if you had executed it your<lb></lb>self; look at your deposition, you have put your name to that as if you handed him the bill of parcels, and gave him the cloth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not give him the property—I do not know how I came to sign my name to this—it was read over to me—I did not hear that particular word used—I could not say I gave it to him, because I did not—(<hi rend="italic">deposition read</hi>)—"Robert Ward says I know the prisoner to be the person who brought the order on Saturday, the 3rd of December, for a cut of Harrington—the order was brought to me, and I gave the property to the prisoner, with a bill of parcels, in the name of Foster."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. They do not know what they swear—it is all false I had three or four examinations before the Alderman would commit me—Mr. Foster's books will prove I was at work at the time, and they cannot pro<lb></lb>duce the other order. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There is no other order for two yards and a half—I have several orders in my pocket for two yards—they are all genuine orders—I cannot say who brought them—some of them are with<lb></lb>out dates—I am certain I saw the prisoner come into the shop on the 3rd of December, and this order was given up to me at the desk—it was on Saturday, and I think inquiry was made on Monday or Tuesday—I do not recollect having soon the prisoner there before, but I am sure he is the man who came that day.</p>

Q.</hi> Where was the last witness When I gave him the order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot exactly say, but he was in the shop—there are several young men; when they see a customer come in, the first at liberty goes up to serve him—I cannot recollect that I saw you come in—I recollect seeing you in the shop—I did not see you give the order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in High-street, Ald<lb></lb>gate. This request is not my writing, nor was it written by any body authorized to write in my name—the prisoner was backwards and forwards in ray employ as journeyman about the 3rd of December—he had no work out on the 3rd of December—he had absented himself a few days before that from my shop altogether—he had an opportunity of seeing me make out my orders—the nearest resemblance to this writing in our house is my brother's, but it is not his, I am quite satisfied—he was examined at Guildhall—it is not like his writing, but more like it than any other—the prisoner has taken orders to Carr's two or three times for me, but I never sent him for this length of article, nor any body in my employ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Mr. Bell swore at the office he had sent me for two yards and a half. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. The other orders produced are my clerk's hand-writing, whose name is Brown—he had authority to write for me, but the order in question is not his writing—the prisoner was apprehended on the Monday morning, before he was up, at his own house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Had not I been in your shop since the order was pro<lb></lb>duced, before I was apprehended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw you there—he had had a garment out, and a circumstance connected with that excited my sus<lb></lb>picion—I sent for him to come to the shop, but never ecould get him there—he did not come on the Saturday to receive his money—he sent his mother-in-law, and then his wife—I tried various ways to get him into the shop, but could not—I sent him a job to do, and while he was doing it I lad him taken—I was aware the forged order had been uttered before I took him—in consequence of what I heard I went to Can's to inquire—there was wages due to him on the Wednesday evening, and he did not come even to receive them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Pray, how came you to think it was me that forged the order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the description given of the person, by both the witnesses—I went round to all my tradesmen to caution them—from the description given me, and from his absenting himself while the other prisoner was in custody, I suspected him—I never sent an order for two yard and a half—I believe I once wrote for two yards and three-eighths.</p>

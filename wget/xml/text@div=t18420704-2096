                  </hi>. I live with my father, Benjamin Rebbeck, an oil<lb></lb>man, in Cambridge-road, Mile-end-road—he has a candle-manufactory in Globe-road—I slept there, and took care of it—on Saturday night, the 2nd of July, I went to bed at ten o'clock—I was disturbed about eleven—I had not been to sleep—I heard a noise in the yard, in front of the house, and a noise in the road also—I got up, and went down the ladder, out of the loft where I slept—a wooden fence separates the yard from the road, and a gentleman's house adjoins the factory—there is a brick-wall between six and seven feet high between the yard and that gentleman's house, and the fence is the same height—I looked through a hole in the factory door, and saw the prisoner Robert jump over the wall—he came into the yard, ran to a tub of tallow, and began to put some into his bag out of the tub—I opened the door, and laid hold of him—he said, "There are more besides me"—I saw nobody else—I asked him where the others were—he said, "Outside"—I went into the road directly, and called a po<lb></lb>liceman, but did not see any body—a policeman came, and took him into custody, with a bag containing 7 1/2 lb. of my father's tallow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Globe-road, about eleven o'clock at night, and heard a cry of "Police"—I went up, and saw Rebbeck with Robert Poplar—I took him in charge, with the bag, which was lying on the tallow-tub, with tallow in it, and a piece of iron, which he had to dig it out with—it weighed 7 1/2 lbs.—I afterwards went to Whitechapel-road on the Monday, and found the prisoner Samuel—I told him I had his brother in custody for stealing tal<lb></lb>low, and took him on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery—he said he got over with his brother the first time, but did not get over the second time—as I came from the station with it he said as <hi rend="italic">Puffy,</hi> his brother, had <hi rend="italic">split</hi> against him, he should <hi rend="italic">split</hi> against the other, and showed me a party that he said was concerned with him.</p>

                  </hi> I have resided in the New-road very nearly thirty years, and have carried on the business of a coachmaker the whole time. In the course of the year 1835, I determined to carry on also the business of a wine and spirit merchant on my premises—the prisoner introduced himself to me, and proposed to take the cellar, if I would advance him the money to any it on—we entered into terms, which were reduced to writing—he came to my premises on the 1st of January, 1835, and was in the cellar acting as my servant—the first thing he did was to select goods from wholesale dealers, in order to put into the collar, and they were sent in—it was then his duty to draw spirits, serve customers, and attend to the business generally—it was his duty to receive money when he served the customers—the beer and spirits in those vaults were mine—I did not begin the wine business for six months after—I think it was in September or October—I had books for the entry of all transactions which took place in the cellars—they were in the hands of the clerk, Mr. Dearie—the name of James Graham and Co. was over the door—there was no such person as James Graham—I assumed that name for the purpose of carrying on that business—no person except myself had Any property in those cellars, and the persons who sent in the barrel which contained the liquors—the prisoner paid me money while he was in the cellars on account of the sale of goods—I used to pay him money, and to allow him to deduct from the receipts in business, for the wages of himself, the cellarman, and occasionally a man to wash bottles—the first two or three weeks I paid the prisoner 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was au<lb></lb>thorised to send out goods to customers—I was acquainted with very few of the customers—I did not know Mr. Harrison personally, nor Mr. Jones, nor Mrs. Shaw—the prisoner made entries in the books relating to the busi<lb></lb>ness which I have spoken of, regularly every day—he sometimes paid me money—whenever he had a surplus that was not employed, he handed it over to me in sums of from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on those occasions I referred to the hooks which he kept—On the 16th of December, 1836, I called on him to make up his accounts—Mr. Hare had been employed to assist in making them up—I found in the books entries of certain sums having been received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030214"></xptr>
               <p>and forty or fifty entries of money due, in the prisoner's handwritings while he was at my cellars he accounted for sums received from particular customers in the regular day's business—I never had any convensation with him respecting any sums of money due or received from Mr. Har<lb></lb>rison or Mr. Jones—I mentioned to him in the early part of February last that Mrs. Shaw had paid some money which did not appear in the boob—he would not believe it, and I fetched him up the books to show him that it was so—I do not recollect any thing that passed after that—he never accounted to me for 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he received from Mrs. Shaw on the 3rd of December, 1836, either verbally or by the books—here is the day-book—on the 3rd of December, 1836, here is no entry of the kind—I find on the 22nd of August, 1836, there were goods bad by Mrs. Shaw, of Priory Cottage, Kilburn, to the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the entry is in the prisoner's writing—and on the 25th of August goods were had by her to the amount of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner never accounted to me for these sums—this is one of the bills used in my wine and spirit business, and it is filled up in the handwriting of the prisoner—on the 19th of September, 1836, I find in the prisoner's handwriting—"Harrison, Esq., 9, Cambridge-terrace, one gallon of brandy, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is no sum appears in the books as having been paid on account of that brandy—he never accounted to roe for the receipt of that sum of money, or any part of it—this is another of my bills of parcels in the prisoner's handwriting—here is a total of "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and by cash 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—leaving a balance of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never accounted for either of these sums—on the 24th of November, 1836, here is an entry in the name of Jones, but that is not in the prisoner's writing; it is the cellarman's—this is another of my bills in the prisoner's writing, and with his signature, "Jones, Esq., three bottles of whisky, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—settled, Graham and Co., <hi rend="smallCaps">R. DEARIE"</hi>—I have since ascertained that Mr. Jones is a surgeon—the prisoner never accounted to me for this—he conti<lb></lb>nued acting in this way up to last December. I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the first two or three weeks, and after that, I allowed him. to deduct from the monies he received—it was with my consent that he received these various sums of money—I remember his leaving ray cellars on the 31st of December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the longest interval that ever occurred between one period and another of his paying you cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A fortnight, 1 suppose—here is one instance of three weeks—the average period was very nearly weekly—he paid me on account of particular sums received—he never paid me any sums of money on any other account than that received in the business—I have an account in the book of the sums received by me from the prisoner—when I gave him notice on the 16th of December to leave me on the 31st, I told him there would be a fortnight for him to make up his books, and to render me an account—on the Monday after he left me on the Sa<lb></lb>turday I said to him, "I hope your accounts are all correct, if not you will have to answer for it"—he said nothing to that—I do not recollect that any thing occurred particularly after that—he left me very abruptly—on the 28th of January I saw him at my cellars—I told him about the several sums I found missing—he said he did not care about it, I could not prose<lb></lb>cute him under the firm of Graham and Co., as there was no such firm—while the prisoner was with me (I think it must have been some time in October, 1836) I was desirous of disposing of that business—I explained to him that I had applied to Messrs. Ray, my wine-merchants, to know if any persons were desirous of buying a business of that kind, and if so to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030215"></xptr>
               <p>recommend them to me; and they sent up a Mr. Sow<lb></lb>erby—I explained to Dearie the terms on which I had agreed to let the business to Mr. Sow<lb></lb>erby, and said I had recommended him to Mr. Sowerby, that I had told him the terms on which he was in my service; and in the event of his closing with me, he would find him an excellent servant, at far as I knew, and an acquisition; and that if Mr. Sowerby called, he was to show him the books, and give him every explanation—the prisoner did not say any thing to me about the business at that time—but in the course of a week or so after, he said, if I was disposed to part with the basinets he thought he should be able to find friends who would be able to raise money suffi<lb></lb>cient to enable him to take the business if I had no objection—I told him the terms on which I had offered the cellars to Mr. Sowerby, and if he could make up the money I should certainly give him the preference—he told me that a person of the name of Ray had offered to lend him 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that probably by other channels he might be able to raise the re<lb></lb>mainder, but he wanted time to consider of it—he afterwards said he had been speaking with a person of the name of Moule I think, who would be able to advance a sum of money, as Mr. Ray had refused to let him have 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till he got possession—that went off for a few weeks, and then he proposed to take it on his own account, as he found Mr. Moule could not raise the money he had expected, and if I would take it on bills he would take it—I said I would not have any thing to do with any thing but money—I bare subsequently seen the prisoner at No. 1, Union-place—it is a very good house, where he has established wine cellars, five doors from my own house—the name of Dearie and Moule was up there at first, bat since the examination, Moule and Co. has been substituted—during the whole time I have known the prisoner he has never had any interest in my busi<lb></lb>ness as a partner—he has not had the slightest interest in the property that was upon those premises—I do not know whether he had any other income or means of living, except the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week that I have spoken of.</p>

ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are a coach-maker, you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was in partnership with my brother, but not in the wine sad spirit business—I had no partner in that—there was no such person as James Graham—I have signed the name of "Graham and Co."as my name—the prisoner was at first serving me under a verbal Agreement—I was not restricted by any agreement with my brother, from going into any other busi<lb></lb>ness while I was with him—I did not tell my brother that I went into this whiskey and ale business—we were not on good terms, and have not been for many years—I have been a proprietor in the Marylebone Joint Stock Bank since September—the prisoner paid monies over to me, and on those occasions I have gone over the books myself—I have gone over them with him several times, when I wanted money, I looked over the books, and asked him for money—he was aware that I was going over the books, and I have asked him to account for sums of money—I have several times gone over the accounts with torn, and said, "You have so much money in hand"—I cannot tell any time—it was the general way—some times I vent over the accounts myself, and found there was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in his hands, and I asked him for money, and he pulled out his purse and gave it me—that was both for general and particular accounts—I cannot name any one occasion, it was so general—I knew the books were asked for by letter—they were put into Mr. Hare the accountant's hand—I did not direct him to let Dearie see the books, but I had no objection to it—I never said any thing. one way or the other—there was a balance drawn up to Christmas, 1835, by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030216"></xptr>
               <p>Mr. Hare in the early part of 1836—he made it out as an accountant—at that time there was an account made out from the books—it was cleared and checked by Dearie, and bis salary, and commission, and all—I do not know sufficient of the books to tell you where to look for it—I was not a party to it—the monies put down here, were paid to me at the times here put down—they were paid generally every week, some times a fortnight might elapse—it was sometimes leu than a week, but the date will tell you—whenever I found there had been a sum of money received, I asked him what money he had, and he handed me over 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as it happened to suit him—I generally used to do it every Sa<lb></lb>turday—I have many times asked him when I have not received it, and I asked again for it—I generally went to him every Saturday to ask him what money he had, and to get money—I looked at the books to see what money there was, probably twenty times during the time he was with me—none of these payments took place between the 7th of February and the 19th of October, because there was very little, I should apprehend, to hand over—it was all outgoings—there was very little to expect from the business the first year—the prisoner was not at that time in Scotland—on the 19th of October 1 received some money—I should think these figures refer to the folio of the journal—I received money on the 19th of October, on the 24th, and on the 26th—it depended on the money he had received—I used to apply to him generally every week, but it did not follow that I had the money every week—it was his duty to enter the sums received in the course of the day, and to hand the surplus to me every Sa turday; but it depended on the monies that were paid into the concern—he was to account whenever I chose to ask him for the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does Saturday occur, now for example, twice in one day, because. I find here, "April the 16th, £45," and again the same day "£25?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All these things are depending on the sums received—when I called on him it was his duty to account for it to me—it was on Saturday generally—I was desired not to touch the books after the prisoner left—the last. entry in this book in the prisoner's writing is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 22nd of October—he remained in my service till the 31st of December—there is no other entry in this book in his handwriting after that—there is in the day-book—• here is the writing of Mr. Hare, the prisoner, the cellarman, and myself in this day-book—whoever receives the money marks the receipt of it—Dearie took care to go over them every night—he might be out all day, but it was the custom to be out till two o'clock, and then to remain at home all day up to eight o'clock—that was the general practice—he has gone to the docks and to many other parts, in the course of business—I have never come to any final settlement with him as to any money there might be between us—I believe he understood the business perfectly well—I did not understand a great deal about it—I bought the goods—it was his duty to wait on the customers, not to get customers—they came as a mat<lb></lb>ter of course—I did not know a great many of the persons—some of them were private friends of my own—he used to give the orders and inspect the goods, and I used to pay for them for the first twelve months—after that I purchased myself of different brokers—he might purchase in the last twelvemonth—it is impossible to say that he did not buy half a dozen hogsheads of ale—he never went to Scotland for me—he went in search of his wife and family, who deserted him—I do not remember that I said in the course of last summer that Dearie was crone to Scotland, and I hoped he was not going to cut, as he had got 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine—I have no recollec<lb></lb>tion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030217"></xptr>
               <p>of saying so to Mr. Bank—I will not swear any thing of the kind—I think if I bad said it, I should have remembered it—I cannot charge my Memory with ever having made use of such an expression—it might have been so—I never told any body that Dearie was gone to Scotland to pur<lb></lb>chase whiskey for me—I have no recollection of telling Mr. Sowerby so—it might have been so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you advertise that your whiskeys were come from Scotland, and that the King of Belgium and all the rest were very fond of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was at the request of Dearie—when he returned he brought me an account that he had got several very fine whiskeys, so that it was not alto<lb></lb>gether a fraud—I inserted the advertisement, thinking it might be profit<lb></lb>able—I had no intention of fraud—I did not instruct Dearie to purchase any whiskey—I know Sarah Mills, who is Dearie's landlady—I have seen her coming there—I have had some conversation with her about him, many times—I do not recollect that I wrote her a letter about him in February last—this is my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—when I had got out my warrant, and was taking my proceedings against the prisoner—Mrs. Mills called on the 1st of January, and related a long story of the injury she had received at Dearie's hands, and asked me what was the best course to get the money that was due to her—I told her that Dearie had now money, and I thought if she pressed for it that he would pay her—that was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not recollect advising her to proceed against him for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or to sue him for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for a gallon of gin—I will not swear any thing about it, as I do not recollect it—I did not say I would recommend her to an attorney in Grays Inn, who would do it for her without expense—she did not tell me she was not rich enough to sue—I do not recollect that she told me that she was not inclined to sue Dearie at all, and that she believed he would pay her as soon as he was able, nor any thing of the kind—she was in the habit of coming down to complain of Dearie—I am not in the habit of having to do with other people's concerns—I might have told persons that Dearie was Graham—I do not remember any particular circumstance—I never told Mr. Kerslake that he was Graham—parties have frequently come in and addressed him by that name—I never introduced him as Graham to Mr. Hibble or Mr. Kerslake—I always said, "There is Mr. Dearie, the manager"—I cannot recollect that I ever committed myself so far as to introduce him as Mr. Graham—I do business with Mrs. Wilson, of Alsop-terrace—I will not swear that I did not introduce Dearie to her as Graham—I do not recollect that I have, in the presence of Mr. Bell, addressed Dearie by the name of Graham—I will not swear either one way or the other.</p>

               <p>I do not recollect that I cut them out—to the belt of my belief, I did not—the bank in which I am engaged, is the one in which my brother-in-law is a partner—I made an application for my situation, which was submitted to the Directors in general—I cannot tell that there were no entries on those leaves that have been cut out, nor for what reason they were cut out—in 1836, when I was going through the accounts of 1835, Dearie was near me, and checked my proceedings as to the, cash—I found there were many errors in the account, that could be set to rights on an explanation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Knowing all that to have taken place in 1836, did you in 1837 make any application to Dearie, or seek for any explanation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did those mistakes that were for and against the pri<lb></lb>soner in 1835 refer to entries that were made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did—I do not recollect an instance as to sums received and found not to have been en<lb></lb>tered—in some instances there may have been.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Court-keeper and usher at the Rolls Court in Chancery Lane—I was there on Friday morning, 22nd February, and saw the prisoner coming towards the Court door, about 9.30—as soon as I unlocked the Court door he came in—I had seen him several times before in the Court—I think the first thing he said was "What time does the Master of the Rolls arrive?"—I said "Usually from 9.40 to 9.45"—he then asked if he was punctual in taking his seat in Court—I said "Yes, at 10 o'clock, or a few minutes after"—I then asked him, being motion morning, if he had a motion to move—he said no, but he had some particular business in the neighbourhood—he then turned round in the Court, and pointing to a large portrait on the wall, asked me if was a portrait of Lord Romilly—I said no, it was a portrait of Sir</p>

               <p>William Grant, one of the late Masters of the Rolls—he said "I thought it was, as he was a great man here"—he had got a note-book in his hand at the time—he walked up and down the Court once or twice—I thought he appeared rather excited—he was looking out of the window—he then immediately turned round and walked out of the Court—I saw him pass the window down the yard, making his way for the Chancery Lane entrance, and about 10 minutes afterwards the Master of the Rolls drew up in a Hansom cab—I went out of the Court hall door down the steps to meet the Master of the Rolls, to receive him out of his cab—I was assisting him out of the cab, and as soon as he set his foot on the ground I heard a report of firearms from behind me, and something struck me on the left ear—I can't tell what it was—it was some blast or heat or something which rendered me deaf the whole day afterwards on that side—it was a burning sensation—I immediately faced round to see where it proceeded from, and I saw the prisoner there with a pistol in his right hand, dropping it down after firing—I afterwards measured the distance from where I saw him standing, and found it was from 11 to 12 feet—the cab had turned into the Rolls Yard right up to the foot of the steps of the Court—as soon as the prisoner had fired he proceeded three or four steps towards the foot of the steps, and taking something from the note-book that he had in his hand either a piece of white paper or a card, he said "My name is Dodwell, Sir George"—I immediately turned round and called out "Police!"—we have a policeman on duty in the yard—Constable Whiting came and took the prisoner into custody—the Master of the Bolls did not take the paper or card, he passed on through the front hall into his private room—I waited outside to see the prisoner secured before I went into his lordship's private room—his lordship took his seat in Court in the course of 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—there is a dwarf wall at the place where this occurred, in the line of firing, about 14 feet high, about 19 yards from where the Master of the Rolls stepped out of his cab; I measured it—I have not had any ex<lb></lb>perience in firearms since I was a boy—the report of the pistol was very loud—I searched everywhere, and so did others, to see if we could find a bullet, but I could not find anything.</p>

               <p>both of us—I did not say before the Magistrate that you were behind me, they did not ask me the question—you could without any difficulty have gone close up to Sir George, there was no one to interfere with you; you could have come close up and touched me—you were pointing at Sir George Jessell's head, my head not being a foot from his—you were about four or five feet behind the body of the cab—I can't say how you hit my right ear, but I felt the effects of it pretty strongly—I did not see any paper flying after the report of the pistol—I have seen you in the Master of the Rolls's Court perhaps five or six times—I can't give you the dates—I think you were there in November, 1876—I don't think I said No<lb></lb>vember, 1877, before the Magistrate—I think I have seen you in the Court since 1876, I will undertake to swear it—I don't know on what occasion it was; some Petition of Right I know you were addressing his lordship about—I know you addressed him in some way—I don't remember saying before the Magistrate that you appeared excited—you told your name and offered the card or paper as well, but Sir George was nearly up the steps then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Master of the Rolls</hi>). On the morning of February 22nd I came to my Court shortly before 10 o'clock—as the cab turned into the Rolls Yard I saw the prisoner standing in Chancery Lane just in the entrance of the Rolls Yard—I recognised him, I had seen him many times, and I am certain he recognised me, he looked me full in the face—as the cab drew up to the door of the Court I turned to get out, the usher came down and opened the leaves of the cab, as he usually does, and I got out of the cab and was fairly out of it, my feet on the ground, when I saw the prisoner at my right hand side—I saw him take his right hand from under the left side of his coat, and he pre<lb></lb>sented a pistol at me; it appeared to me to be directed towards my head, he fired at the same moment and I saw the flash as well as heard the sound—I felt a blow on the right side of the head, as if some one had struck me with his fist—I instinctively looked at the pistol to see if it was a revolver, and in that case I should have jumped back into the cab; I saw it was not, and I waited a moment or two till the policeman was at the side of the prisoner, and then I walked on into my private room—the feeling of the blow lasted a very considerable time, some hours—nothing actually struck me, I was not wounded in any way—in earlier life I was familiar with the use of pistols, I have fired a great many—as a matter of opinion I have no doubt that this pistol contained something besides powder, but whether it was a bullet, or a slug, or a wad, one cannot say—I have presided on two occasions, in my own Court and in the Court of Appeal, when the prisoner had suits there—I do not as a rule recollect very much of what occurs before me, but it is very seldom that a man pleads his own case in my Court, for a very good reason, therefore, I do recollect more about the prisoner's case than I usually do, and since the event has occurred I have also refreshed my recollection by sending for the papers in both the cases—the first time I saw the prisoner was when he made an appli<lb></lb>cation to me in chambers on a summons in 1876—I knew nothing of him but what came before me in my judicial capacity, but it appeared from the papers that he had been a schoolmaster at an endowed school at a place called Collection in Devonshire, that the governing body of that school had dismissed him for alleged misconduct, and he refused to give up possession of the school-house or master's residence, and the governing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110069"></xptr>
               <p>body brought an action against him to recover possession of the house, and the action was brought in my Court—it seems that the prisoner had retained a solicitor, who entered an appearance for him, and that he had then for some reason or other quarrelled with the solicitor, but being ignorant of the practice of the Court he had not taken the solicitor's name of the record; the result was that notice having been given to the solicitor on the part of the plaintiff, and no defence having been put in, the plaintiff signed judgment by reason of default—the prisoner then made an appli<lb></lb>cation to me, sitting in chambers, to set aside the judgment by default—he represented his case to me, and as I am always inclined to be very indulgent where mistakes of that kind have occurred, I put it to the plaintiff's counsel whether it would not be right to allow the judgment to be set aside, and I set it aside accordingly—The next occasion on which I saw the prisoner was in November, 1876, on the hearing of a demurrer—what had happened was this: he put in his statement of defence where I had set aside the judgment, and the plaintiff's counsel demurred, alleging that it was insufficient in law, and that demurrer came on to be heard before me in November, 1876—of course I had only to decide the question of law, no facts were in dispute—the prisoner again pleaded his own cause and at very considerable length—I was unable to make him understand that I had nothing whatever to do with the merits of the case; like most persons who plead their own cause, he had not quite understood the legal points, but he made a very long harangue to me with reference to his grievances, and the way in which he alleged he had been ill-treated, as to which I told him more than once I had nothing whatever to do; I had only to try the sufficiency of the defence as a matter of law—he then discussed some technical questions of very considerable nicety as to the construction of some ancient deeds or documents under which this school was founded of which he had been master—eventually I decided that the demurrer was well founded, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs—I then saw no more of the prisoner till the following year, when I presided in the Appeal Court one day with two other judges, and to my surprise I again saw the prisoner, who again came to plead his own case—on this occasion it was a Petition of Right—again I knew nothing of the fact beyond what appeared on the papers, but it was a question of law that had to be decided—the prisoner, it appeared from the papers, had been appointed chaplain to an industrial school at Brighton; the guardians of the poor, the governing body, had dismissed him from the office, and the prisoner presented a Petition of Right to the Queen to reinstate him—that petition came on to be heard before Vice-Chancellor Malins upon a demurrer which was put in on the part of the Crown, on the ground that there was no remedy by Petition of Right for anything of that sort; it was a mere question of law whether the Petition of Bight was the proper form—the Vice-Chancellor allowed the demurrer on the ground that it was not the proper mode of proceeding to be reinstated in such an office, and I happened to be the presiding Judge in the Appeal Court on the day that the appeal by the prisoner from that decision came on to be heard—I paid particular attention to the prisoner's demeanour on that day in consequence of an observation made to me by Lord Justice Thesiger, who sat on my right—I heard the prisoner, I hope, with very great patience, and I believe my brother Judges did the same—he made a very long speech that had not the slightest bearing upon the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110070"></xptr>
               <p>legal point to be decided—he recounted to us his divers grievances, and the efforts he had made to obtain redress and the way in which the world in general had conspired against him, and showed how these charges were ill-founded, and so forth—he accused divers persons of various acts of mis<lb></lb>conduct towards him—I did not attempt to explain to him on that occasion that all that was beside the question, for I felt it was useless—when he had finished, I said, in very few words, that it was quite plain that the Petition of Right was not the proper remedy for any such grievance as he complained of, and the Court agreed with the Vice-Chancellor and con<lb></lb>firmed his decision—I hoped that would have been the last occasion I should have seen the prisoner, but it was not so—next week I was again presiding in the Court of Appeal when he came before the Court with an <hi rend="italic">exparte</hi> motion—I explained to him that he could not make an <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> motion against anybody in that way without giving notice; there-upon he said he would give notice—I was not at the Appeal Court the next week, therefore I cannot say what occurred, but the following week I was there again, and the prisoner again appeared, and he said he had a new ground to move upon, that he wished to set aside the judgment of the Vice-Chancellor on the ground of corruption in the Vice-Chancellor, that he had discovered that the Vice-Chancellor was a corrupt judge and that he was entitled to set aside the judgment on that ground—of course it was useless to attempt to persuade mm that that was nonsense, and when he persisted in going on, I said to him that if he went on with such language I should be compelled, most reluctantly, to use my power by directing that he should be removed from the Court, and not further in<lb></lb>terrupt the public business—he said he would not put me to that, and he bowed and went away, and that was the last time I saw him previous to my seeing him at the entrance of the Rolls Court, and beyond that I know nothing of him—his demeanour at the Appeal Court was decidedly irrational—his address was incoherent and irrelevant and seemed to me to show distinct signs of delusion—he seemed to think that every<lb></lb>body was, more or less, in a conspiracy against him, and those who have experience in those matters know that is a very common sign of the mind giving way; he repeated that several times—he appeared to me under a distinct delusion as to Vice-Chancellor Malins being a corrupt judge; he had no evidence of corruption, nothing but his own assertion, but he seemed to be under that belief, and that belief appeared to be also a de<lb></lb>lusion—when he was asked on one occasion why he said so, the only answer he could give was that on another occasion in the Appeal Court, when Lord Justice James presided, he had been allowed to call Vice-Chancellor Malins a corrupt Judge without reproof from the Bench, and that that showed he was corrupt Judge—that was what he told us, and I thought that was evidence of delusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I saw you just at the entrance of the Rolls Yard in Chancery Lane when I drove in; I am quite sure of that—I do not know the noise that a pistol makes when it has a stone in it—I never fired one with a stone—I should not say that the greater the noise the less likely is the pistol to be loaded; there is a difference in the kind of noise, it is difficult to explain; the loudness would depend to a certain extent on the quantity of powder—I think I recollect you stopping me in the deli<lb></lb>very of my judgment in the Collation case—I gave my opinion, not that the charge against you was proved, but that if proved it was sufficient to warrant the governing body in dismissing you, and that was the point</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110071"></xptr>
               <p>which I think you did not quite understand—I should be very much sur<lb></lb>prised to hear that an ex-Lord Chancellor took your view of the question—I do not think I said when you were in custody that I had every reason to believe you insane, but that there was reason to believe so—I said that your Petition of Right was of a very absurd character—I don't know who advised Her Majesty to sign it, but I presume the Attorney-General; it would be his duty to authorise it. (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner here read a portion of his petition, which set forth certain complaints as to his dismissal</hi>.) I have decided, in conjunction with my colleagues, that that petition is not within the cog<lb></lb>nisance of the Court of Chancery, and I now say that it certainly is not—you have certainly made, I should say more than twice, a protest against what you call an unrighteous judgment—you were not punished, because Judges are very reluctant to commit men for contempt when it is merely by improper language; that is the only reason; I could have done so had I thought fit—it is quite possible that on one of the motions you said "Your Lordships are cruelly forcing me to break the law in order to state my case"—I have no recollection of that expression, you said so many things—very possibly you may have said that the charge of perjury was ruinous to a clergyman, I don't remember it—I used the expression "I am sorry it should have occurred," because I was naturally sorry; first, because I had run, as I thought, the risk of being killed, and next, because I thought that an unprovoked attack upon a Judge for deciding a point of law was a very bad example—I certainly did not feel that I had acted unjustly in the Collation case; I thought the demurrer which was put in by a very experienced counsel was a good demurrer, and I so decided.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

I was on duty at the Rolls Court on Friday morning, 22nd February, about a quarter to 10—my attention was attracted by hearing a report of firearms—I was in the police room in Rolls Yard, not outside in the yard—I ran out immediately and saw the Master of the Rolls going into the hall—the prisoner said "I have done it"—I said "What have you done?"—he said "I have shot the Master of the Rolls, which is what I intended to do"—he also said that the Master of the Rolls had—did him out of two rights—he said that in two breaths—he repeated as far as "had"—I had hold of him at the time and pulled him round, which caused him to stop in his sentence, and then he said "did me out of two rights"—I saw the pistol in his right hand—I took it from him, the barrel was quite warm, the hammer was half-cocked—I searched the prisoner and found on him some money and a canister containing some No. 2 gunpowder, 18 percussion caps, a note<lb></lb>book, and this letter, which he wished me to post. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read, addressed</hi> "Mr. Taylor, Tobacconist, No. 1, Moor Street, Soho, Feb. 21, 1878. Strictly private. My dear Sir,—I beg leave to ask you the very great favour of going over to see my wife on the top floor front, and break to her the fact that I am in custody for assaulting one of Her Majesty's Judges. After five and a third year's of incessant struggling I have come to the most unwelcome conclusion that I can gain a hearing, not a grand thing for any man in any country, only by breaking the law. All the press, with one honourable exception, have deliberately refused to admit my state<lb></lb>ment, and even to say sideways that I have been unlawfully treated—as all my statements are on affidavit, I firmly trust that God, who demands truth in his rational creatures, will bring me out of my very great trouble. All my necessary papers are in my little portmanteau. Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY J. DoDWELL</hi>.") I know the prisoner by sight, I had seen him on three or four occasions—I searched to see if I could find any trace of a bullet on the wall—I was not able to find one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I said before the Magistrate "I found no bullets on him"—Mr. Flowers said to me "Did not he say 'had done him out of two rights'?" and I said "No, your worship, had 'did'"—I say so now—I don't remember your saying that the Lord Chancellor had refused you your right of petitioning against forged returns—I have not the slightest recollection of your saying so—Bow Street is about half a mile from the Rolls Court—you said to me on the way there "Constable, do you remember me?"—I said "Yes, I do; on two or three occasions I have seen you in Rolls Yard and had conversation with you"—you also said something to the other constable in an under tone, which I did not hear.</p>

               <p>the Master of the Rolls into Court in order that he might thoroughly state his case and bring it before the public, and that his case would then show in a different light—he also said that the case of the detectives would be trivial when compared to his—I have been a volunteer—I have fired many hundred rounds with a rifle, both ball cartridge and blank cartridge—I heard the report of this pistol—if it container no bullet it must have had some wad in it, or paper, or something rammed home very tight—in my judgment it seemed to be the report of a pistol that was loaded with a bullet—I assisted to search to see if I could find any bullet—I made a careful examination of the stone and brickwork of the Rolls House and failed to find any trace or indentation of any bullet mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I heard you say nothing about shooting—I was with you and the policeman the whole time—I did not leave you while you were in the office in Rolls Yard—I must correct myself, I did go into the Rolls House to give notice to Mr. Hayes that you were about to proceed to Bow Street, and for him to follow—I did not see the pistol fired—I do not know why it has no ramrod—I am not a gunsmith—I can't say that I ever loaded a pistol, and am not aware how it is loaded—I say my impression was that it was loaded with a bullet, by the sound—it was a very loud report, it made a great vibration, there seemed to be a sharpness about it—I should judge from my experience of the rifle that it had something in it that had been rammed home very tightly—not having fired a pistol, I can't say whether a bullet fired from it does not make so loud a sound—I don't say that it was loaded with a bullet, I thought so—I did not say at Bow Street that I thought it was not loaded with a bullet—I don't think I was asked the question—I will not be sure whether I was or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law stationer—I heard the report of this pistol, and about an hour afterwards I looked for the trace of the bullet, but could not find any—in my judgment, by the sound, there was nothing in the pistol beyond paper; there must have been paper in it to cause the loud report—I did not find any paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I heard the report distinctly—it would make a sharper sound without a bullet, if it was properly loaded—the pro<lb></lb>per way of loading a pistol depends upon what kind of pistol it is—if loaded from the muzzle you would ram it down; it is not usual to have a ramrod always, some have and some have not—I have rammed them home with a piece of stick—I don't think this pistol unscrews—the Magistrate asked me if there was a stone in the pistol, and I said I should think not—a stone makes a buzzing noise if it was not round, not if it was like a marble, it would make a sound like a blank cartridge—this pistol made a noise like a blank cartridge—I was in my back office when it was fired, about 30 yards off—you were about a yard behind the cabdriver at the time, at least by the side of the cab; of course you were behind the driver—I saw the pistol fired—I was in my back office on the second floor.</p>

I have fired a stone out of a pistol, but many years ago—the sound I heard would not be produced by firing loose powder; there was something besides the powder, but that something, I should think, would be paper or a wad, because the powder would have made but little noise had there been nothing behind it.</p>

I am a general dealer, and keep a shop at 22, King Street, Covent Garden—I sold this pistol to the prisoner on 18th or 19th February, in the evening—the barrel is intended to unscrew, but these common ones very seldom do in practice—there is a thread on it—if put into a vice you could unscrew it—I was in distress at the time, my son had died two or three days before, but I did attend to the prisoner—when he came in he said "I want a common pistol"—I took three out of a drawer, a single barrel, a double barrel, and a revolver, and placed them before him, and told him the prices—he said "I will take this, the lowest price, the commonest"—that was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe he asked was it strong enough or safe enough for powder—I pointed to the proof mark and said "There is the proof"—there is a Government proof mark on it—he said "How do you load it, does it unscrew?"—I said "It is only usual to load these cheap ones at the muzzle with a stick"—he seemed to be satisfied with that, and asked if I sold powder—I said "Yes, but only in canisters, not loose"—he asked if I kept caps—I said "No," but I gave him a few, and with that he left—I did not sell him any powder, and not a word was said about bullets or a bullet mould by him or by me.</p>

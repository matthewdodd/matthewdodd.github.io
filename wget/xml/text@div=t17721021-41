            . I deal in lace; on Monday the 5th of October the two prisoners came to my shop, near Covent-garden; they bought a piece of gold lace for a waistcoat for 14 s. they asked me to change a draught for 50 l. on Brown and Collinson, in Lombard-street; I said I would rather change a small draught; they then produced a bank note of 10 l. which I changed; when I came to enter it, I found it was part of two different notes, which did not correspond; I then set myself to recollect the conversation that had passed, in order to find out who the people were; I recollected the prisoner had said be bought some cloth in the Borough where he had taken this 50 l. draught, and he said his taylor lived in a street near Oxford-road; with great difficulty I found out the taylor, and by his directions I found out Dunn: he lodged in Dangfield-street, Oxford-road; he was taken up the next morning. He said before the Justice, that he received this 10 l. note with a 70 l. draught and 10 l. in cash in change for a 100 l. bank note; he had found in a pocket book of a man at the Rose at Maidstone.</p>

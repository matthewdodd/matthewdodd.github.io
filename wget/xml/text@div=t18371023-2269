                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Baynton, of Grove-terrace, St. John's-wood. The prisoner came after lodgings on the 13th of September—I showed him the drawing-rooms—he asked for the second floor bed-room, and I showed it him—there was a watch there—it laid on the chest of drawers—I then called Mrs. Baynton, to tell the price of the lodgings, and I left him there—in about ten minutes after he was gone I saw the watch was gone—I am sure it was there when he came, and no one but him could have taken it—it has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Baynton. I remember the prisoner coming about the lodgings—he was shown into the drawing<lb></lb>room by the servant—I was going up stairs—he said, "Is that the lowest for the rent?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I will call again;" ad I thought he said he should like to see the drawing-room again—I said I would let him see it, and he went up again—I did not see the watch then—he must have had it in his possession then—if was my son's, Humphrey Edward William Bayntons—he had left it there that morning—I left him alone in the room where the watch was, and I had seen him looking towards the drawers where it was.</p>

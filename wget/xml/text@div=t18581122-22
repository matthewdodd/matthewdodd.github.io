                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Wall, and live on Fish-street-hill. On Saturday night, 23d October, I went to the Britannia public-house to fetch some beer—it is two doors from the corner of King's head-court on Fish-street-hill—it was just before 12 o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner Gardner, Richardson the cabman, and some other persons standing at the bar; (I had seen Gardner before)—they were drinking—I was standing near them, listening to their conversation—I heard Gardner ask Richardson to fight him—Richardson said "No; I have been drinking comfortably the whole evening; I don't wish to fight now"—they came out of the public-house, and I saw Gardner go up the hill—they were then about closing the house—I went in-doors with my beer and came out again—I then saw the policeman come up, and he asked Richardson to take his cab away which stood at the door, which Richardson refused—Gardner then came back again, and the policeman pushed him up in the court wishing him to go; he said, "Go away about your business, I don't wish to have any bother with you," and he pushed him up King's-head-court—Gardner came back again, and the policeman pushed him again, but not to</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, Fish-street-hill, nearly opposite the Britannia. On that Saturday night, about 12 o'clock, I was just going in at my door, and I saw Gardner and Richardson fighting—they were abreast of King's-head-court—the policeman came up at the same time—I did not see Payne—when the policeman came up, Richardson said, "Take him off"—the policeman said, "Take who off?"—he turned on his light and he saw Gardner on the top of Richardson—Richardson said to the policeman, "Why don't you punch him?" referring to Gardner—the policeman said, "That is not my business, that is yours"—with that he pulled Gardner up, and they stood there; and the policeman said to Gardner and to Richardson, "My good men, I want you to go away, I don't want this piece of work in the street"—with that Gardner went away, and the policeman persuaded Richardson to take his cab away, which he refused to do. After some few minutes he sent his cab away by a man, and he stood there himself—the policeman persuaded him to go away; he refused, and made use of very bad language—he said to the policeman," Go to b—y; I know as much about my business as you do;" and he said, "If he (meaning Gardner) comes back, I will smash him"—Gardner came back at the very time, and they were going to fight again, and the policeman prevented them—he shoved Gardner into King's-head-court, and Richardson into the road, one with one hand, and the other with the other—he did not make use of any unnecessary violence—Gardner then came back again; Richardson stopped in the middle of the road—the policeman shoved Gardner again into King's-head-court, and told him to go home quietly as he did not want any piece of work at that time of night—Gardner then struck him and knocked his hat off—they fell down—they both got up and struggled together—they both fell several times—there was pulling hair and scuffling, I should say for ten minutes or more—that was in the middle of King's-head-court, one end of which runs into Fish-street-hill, and the other into Pudding-lane—Richardson was there all the time, he did nothing as I know of; he was standing near the entrance of the court towards Fish-street-hill—I did not hear him say anything to persons who wished to come in—I was in the court—the policeman had his staff out—he did not have it at the beginning nor for ten minutes afterwards—he drew it in his own defence at last; he did not take it out till he had been assaulted for some time—I spoke to Richardson; I told him to go away as it was all through him that the row was—he said nothing to me—I had enough to do to take care of myself, or I should have been killed perhaps as well as the policeman—I took Gardner away from the policeman—he had his staff out then, and he was in a confused state, being down so many times—Gardner got out of my hands, and he went back and attacked the policeman again for two or three minutes—I never saw Richardson after that—I saw Payne after the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was over in Pudding-lane—I spoke to him, and he began to abuse me—I told him to go away, he knew nothing about it—he called me a b—y thief and a smuggler—I told him he knew nothing about it—he said he did, but he did not tell me what he knew about it—he was talking about Gardner lying on the steps and being ill-used by the policeman.</p>

On Saturday night, 23d October, I was on duty in Thames-street, about a quarter past 12 o'clock—I was called by some women—I went to Pudding-lane—I saw Haasell under the prisoner Gardner—I assisted in taking Gardner to the station—while on the way, Hassell pointed out Payne as one who had assaulted him.</p>

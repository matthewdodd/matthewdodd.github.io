               <p>Prisoner. When I was at the watchhouse the prosecutor told me to beg his pardon; I said I would not, I was not guilty of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hill. Were you at the watchhouse - did you hear any thing of this - A. I did not, it was proposed by some person, but not by the prosecutor, the prosecutor did not consent to it.</p>

On the 2d of this month I was in company with some friends at a public-house in Gray's Inn-lane coming down Holborn with my daughter; this gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, he said, good friend you have robbed me; I said, you scoundrel, I never robbed you nor any body else; with the aggravation and passion I struck him; going through Fox-court I saw a soldier of the name of Day, I said, Day go and tell my wife, I am going to the watchhouse; he said, will you ask my pardon; I said, no, I will not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am porter at the Green Man and Still. Two boxes came by the Cheltenham waggon last Saturday week, about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning; I took them out of the waggon, and put them on the pavement - I went into the office, and laid the bill on the desk; I came out, and missed two boxes - I know the prisoner - he is a hackney-coachman; I do not know whether he was on the stand that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say you know him as a hackney-coachman? A. Yes, for two or three years; it is usual for coachmen to sit on their boxes while the waterman puts the passengers' luggage in.</p>
               <p>JAMES CONDIE. I am a Police-constable. On the Saturday morning in question. I heard a coach running, a little after five o'clock, in Hanover-square; it attracted my notice, as it was going as rapidly as the road would allow- I went to a private watchman in Hanover-street, who was just beginning to cry five o'clock; we walked up the street, up Regent-street, and into Hanover-square again- we stopped talking; I heard the coach again, and saw the prisoner and another man on the box - I thought the other man seemed rather fresh, and I had some suspicion; I followed the coach, and saw a young man run across the square towards it - it went up Hanover-street, up Regent-street, and down Argyle-street, and there I saw the young man join in company with another; they went on to Poland-street, and then I lost sight of the coach in the fog - I ran up Poland-street, and got sight of the coach, and saw the other man get off the box; the two young men came up to the side of the coach, and another man with a white jacket or waistcoat, opened the coach door, and went in - a man with a dark jacket came out of the coach, and shut the door; the man who had got off the box wished the coachman good night - I said Halloo! and ran up to take the number of the coach; I cannot say whether the coachman heard me, but he went on - I laid hold of the handle of the coach door, and it went on to the end of Poland-street; I kept calling all the way Stop! Stop! Stop! as loud as I could - I then let go handle, made a spring, got hold of the trace, and one of the horses slipped; I put my foot on the box - the coachman then stopped; I got down to take the men on the pavement, but they were gone - I then went to take the man in the coach, but he was gone; I made an alarm, and two of my partners came up - the coachman said two men came and called him, and said he need not get off the box; these two boxes were in the coach. <rs id="t18291203-39-verdict209" type="verdictDescription">

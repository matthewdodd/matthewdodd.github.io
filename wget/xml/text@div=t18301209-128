            . I am an officer. On the evening of Friday, the 26th of November, I was in Bishopsgate-street; I saw the prisoner and another man following a cart, which was going down Camomile-street - I followed them, and in <placeName id="t18301209-128-crimeloc731">St. Mary-axe</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed by a man to carry them for 1s. - the officer came in about ten minutes, and asked what it was; I said I did not know, but I showed him the man - he would not hear any thing, but took me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

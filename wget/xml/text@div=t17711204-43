            . The morning after the trunk had been cut from behind the Dover coach, I went with the last witness to Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, where I found the prisoner a-bed in his son's house. I told him he must get up, for I wanted to search him; and I found these stockings in his pocket. I asked him where he got them; he said, he bought them on board a ship: after that he said he brought them from Holland. We had heard several things against him and his son.</p>

               <p>I brought the stockings home with me from abroad. I have had them above six months.</p>

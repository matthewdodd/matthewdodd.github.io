                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman of 43, Westmoreland Place—on 14th November, about 10.20, I was in Eagle Street, and just as I got opposite an oil shop I slipped over something and fell into the shop—I had hardly recovered myself when the prisoner gave me a push with one hand and drew out nay watch with the other—a friend who was behind me seized him by the back of the neck and said "John, your watch"—I said "Yes, I know, I felt him draw it"—I seized the prisoner by the throat and forced him into the shop away from his confederates—he pretended to be in a fit, but I said that I should not loose him till a constable came—I then gave him in charge—the mob was very violent on the way to the station, and if it had not been for my friends I should have lost him—after he was searched he said "Now you can't find it and you don't know where it is"—my friends were Mr. Mackie and Mr. Scohen.</p>

I am in the carpet trade, and live at 39, Mare Street, Hackney—I was with Derry in Eagle Street, and saw him slip and fall into the doorway of an oil shop; and, in falling, his watch fell from his waistcoat pocket—his coat was open—a crowd assembled round the door, and I saw the prisoner close up to him, and take the watch, as it hung by</p>

I am a book finisher, of 55, Buckland Street, New North Road—on 14th November, I was in uniform, with Derry, in Eagle Street—I saw him slip, and as he recovered himself, the prisoner pushed him in the chest, and passed something over my shoulder—I seized his arm, and he wrenched it away, and the man who had the watch kicked me on the legs—I got hold of the prisoner, and when we got outside, I being in uniform, the policeman called upon me in the Queen's name to assist him—I did so, and my forage cap was knocked off—I assisted the police all the way to the station.</p>

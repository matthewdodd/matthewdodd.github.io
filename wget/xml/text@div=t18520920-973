                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live in Oak-cottages, Old Kent-road. On Sunday evening, 22nd Aug., I went into the taproom of the Shards Arms, to get a light—it was from half past 10 to 11 o'clock—while I was lighting my pipe, a man named Sheely came in with a stone, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it at me—it did not strike me, for I <hi rend="italic">ducked</hi> my head—then me and Sheely got scuffling together—not a word had passed between me and Sheely previous to this—after the scuffle I went outside, and Sheely came out—as soon as I got outside, the prisoner took a stone out of his jacket, threw it at me, and struck me on the head with it—he was about three yards away from me—there were five or six other persons with him—they were about three yards on the other side of the door—I was in front of the door—the stone struck me on the forehead, and I remember no more that took place till the next morning—there was a gaslight over the door, and I could see—I had known the prisoner for twelve months by sight—I hud not had any words with him that evening in the least, or at any previous time—I had not said a word to him before this was thrown.</p>

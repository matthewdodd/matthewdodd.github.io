                  </hi>. Hive in High-Holborn, and am a picture deals On the 3rd of January I saw this picture in the window, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I did not miss it till next morning at eight o'clock—this is the picture—it is "Time flying away with Beauty"—it was framed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hedger, a pawnbroker, of Drury-lane. This picture was brought on the 3rd of january by the prisoner—he wanted a sovereign for it, and we lent it him—he gave his name on the ticket—I cannot say what it was—I am sure he is the person who left it—on the 25th of March, when he came again to the shop for an affidavit, which we give when a duplicate is lost, I recollected him, and sent for an officer, who took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-meter, and live in White Horse-lane, Stepney. On the 11th of April I went into the Black Lion, Mile-end-road, about half-past ten o'clock—I was not exactly sober—there were several quarrels in the room—I said nothing to the prisoner, but I saw he had been very ill-used-he took up the poker, and struck me by accident instead of somebody else on the top of my head—it was only a very flight wound—I received no in-convenience from it—it did not bleed mucfi—I am satisfied he never intended to do me any harm—I told the Magistrate so, and wanted him to discharge him—he had been struck by other people, and was defending himself when he took up the poker—he had no malice towards me, for I never saw him before.</p>

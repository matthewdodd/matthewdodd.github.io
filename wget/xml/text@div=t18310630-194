             - I sat at a table in a room on a line with the bar; the prisoner was in that room, and nobody else but one man - I had a miniature picture, framed, with me; it was an original subject, designed by myself - it was Cleopatra; I painted it myself - I would not sell the picture under ten guineas, and the frame under two guineas; I am an <rs id="t18310630-194-viclabel1029" type="occupation">artist and miniaturepainter</rs>

               <p>Q.Were you in the room all that time? A. No; about half-past seven or eight o'clock I got up from the table to take a newspaper from a person who was there; the picture was on the table then - a few words passed between the person and myself, and when I turned round Mr. Platts directed my attention to the table, and said the picture was gone; the prisoner was the only person who left the room at that time - my back had been turned to the table to receive the newspaper; it was rather too large for my pocket, and I put it on the table - nobody could have taken it unless I had gone away from the table a few minutes; I went a yard and a half or two yards from the table, to take the newspaper - I was not away more than three or four minutes at the furthest, and in about ten minutes the prisoner returned; I merely said to him,"Do you know where my picture is?" he commenced looking under the tables and benches, and said, "I know nothing of the picture;" he began wiping his forehead, and said he had been to Hampstead-road - the person I had the paper from said, "Then you have been but a short time going and coming back;" I should imagine it is a mile and a half, or two miles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.When you first went in the morning a third person was there? A. Yes, he was in and out - he was there when I discovered my loss: a person named Bousfield was in the room when I missed my picture - I live in Greek-street; I went there in the morning, feeling very thirsty, and was there till eight or nine o'clock at night - I was away once; I had nothing but intermediate beer, and only paid 9d. - I was perfectly sober; the picture was not in paper - I do not mean to say there is any sterling value in it, but I would not sell it under ten guineas - I should charge a gentleman twelve guineas for it; it cost me that, in time, to get it up.</p>

            . I keep the lower part of this house - it belongs to my uncle; I do not pay any rent - my uncle gave me an opportunity to try it, as the last occupier could not make it do; the whole house belongs to my uncle, and he lets out the other part, but does not live there himself. On the 4th of June, just before eight o'clock in the evening, I went to look after my glasses and pots - I immediately missed the picture, which I had seen laying before Jones in the early part of the day; I told him of it: I saw the prisoner go away before I missed it - Jones was about a yard and a half from where it had laid, when I told him of his loss; I sleep in the house.</p>
               <p>ROBERT GILES. I am a pawnbroker, living in Greek-street, Soho. On Saturday, the 4th of June, between nine and ten o'clock, this picture was pawned with me for 14s., in the name of Richard Good - I believe it was by the prisoner, but cannot be sure of him - it was Saturday, and there were a great many people in the shop; I asked if it was his own property - he said it was, that he merely wanted 14s., as it would be easier for him to get out, and if he wanted to leave it he should ask 30s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not at all unusual to pawn property in a wrong name? A. No; we had a great many customers, and I did not take particular notice of the man - I do not say I am certain of him; I believe him to be the man - I think I could get 5l. for this picture.</p>
               <p>J. H. JONES re-examined. On missing my picture I did not require that the person in the house should be searched - only the prisoner had gone out; I thought it was done out of a lark - I gave him in charge on the following morning.</p>
               <p>Q. If he took it he returned and remained there, I understand, for an hour? A. I do not know that I was in his company so long as that - he at that time was dressed in a blue butcher's frock; I think I left him in the house - I do not know where Bousfield lives; I had never seen him before, to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in King-street, at two o'clock in the morning, and was called to Platts's house - I found the prisoner there; Platts said he was asleep on the stairs and prevented his lodgers from going up - I examined and found a latch-key on him, which Platts claimed, and two half-crowns - I left him there, went to Jones at six o'clock in the morning, and told him; between eight and nine I apprehended him, and on Tuesday morning Platts brought me this duplicate.</p>

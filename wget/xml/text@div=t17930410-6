               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; in consequence of an information I apprehended the prisoner Turnbull, on the 27th of February, I apprehended him at a place called the World's End; I believe it was the house where Turnbull was quartered at, he belonged to the Middlesex militia, and was quartered there at that time; I searched him, and I found on him a powder flask, which I have here; there was another man present with him; I searched him, and I brought him along with me to Tunbridge Wells; he told me that he had a trembling on him for two or three hours before, and that he had a dream the night before that his mother was dead, and he expected what had happened; he knew what I came for as soon as he saw me; I asked him if he had any box, or any thing else? he said he had not; he was giving some things out of his pocket to a comrade, the comrade said, that is my powder horn, I then took the powder horn from him, and brought him to London. (The powder horn produced.) As I was coming along in the coach with this Turnbull, I did not tie his hands; while I was in the coach I was taken very bad and sick, I had occasion to put out my head, I wanted to cast up, while my head was out of the coach, I felt something at my pocket, and afterwards when I felt, I found I had lost the horn; we were then out of the coach, I told him he had used me very ill, he had picked my pocket; he said, he dare say I had let it fall at the bottom of the coach; accordingly I went back to the coach, and the coachman found it at the bottom of the coach. (Deposed to.) On the 26th I had notice of a box being left at Mr. Cook's the furrier's, that was the property of Turnbull. I went to Mr. Cook's and I saw Mr. Cook's servant girl, and the instant she saw me, she was ready to faint away, she said, she knew very well what I came about; of Mr. Cook, who is now in court, I requested to see that box, and therein I found a great quantity of things which I now produce. Mr. Brooks's man has seen them, but Mr. Brooks has not. (The articles produced and deposed to.) I apprehended Somerville on the 22d of February, at the Bull's Head in Crown-street, St. Giles's; Miller and I were together, he denied his name at first, he was playing at knock up halfpenny in the tap room; I looked very hard at him, and said pray, is not your name Somerville, he said, no, I pulled off his hat, and I saw his hair was dressed up in a soldier's form, I said to him your name is Somerville.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he in the militia? - No, but he wanted to feign their dress. I said I am certain your name is Somerville, and whether it is or no I will take you, I apprehended him. Treadway had searched Somerville's lodgings before.</p>

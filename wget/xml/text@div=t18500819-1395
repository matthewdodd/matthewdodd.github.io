                  </hi>. I am a wine-porter, of 3, Charlotte-court, Whitechapel. On 23rd July the prisoner gave me this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), at a public-house in Dark-house-lane, Billingsgate, and told me to bring him the samples there—I took the order to the proper officer at the docks—he marked it, and I took it to the vaults and got twelve sample-bottles—as I came away, Dix stopped me, and I went with him to the house in Darkhouse-lane—I went up-stairs to the second-floor, put the wine at the prisoner's feet, and said, "There is wine"—Dix was close behind me—he came into the room, and asked him if he knew anything of the wine—he said no, he knew nothing of the order or of the wine—he was taken to the constable's room in the docks—he then said, "It is a pity to hurt that poor fellow," meaning me, "I did give him the order; he is innocent"</p>

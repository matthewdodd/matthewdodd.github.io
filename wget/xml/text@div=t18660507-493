                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Jones, of 324, New-cross-road—on Thursday, 12th April, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon I saw my little child (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) playing before my door—I sent her out with the other children to play, and from something they told me I went and looked for her—she could not walk any distance—she is weakly—I saw nothing of her till the following Tuesday, when I saw her at the station with the police—I advertised her by handbills—there were four articles on the child—they were worth more than 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my husband is a picture-frame maker.</p>

On Monday night, 16th April, about 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner going down Shooter's-hill with a child—I noticed something about the child, and asked the prisoner if the child belonged to her—she said it did; I asked her where she came from—she said from a place called Devizes, and that was where the child was born—I let her pass, and went to the station and examined the information-book, and from the description, I followed her and found her in a house; I told her I should take her into custody for stealing the child—she still had the child—she said she did not steal it, she found it in the New-cross-road—I took her in custody—she had a penny and a thimble on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 32, Fitzroy Market. The prisoner lodged in the same room with me, and slept in the same bed for about a fortnight—she had an infant named Julia, I understand; it was about three months old—it was in perfectly good health all the week before Sunday, the 13th—after the prisoner had fed it that morning it turned sick—after that she began to give it more of the same food—I said to her, "You are only punishing the child; you see it will not lie on its stomach; why don't you give it the breast?"—she made some sullen, muttering reply, I could not exactly say what—I have seen her rather cross with the child, and once or twice she has said, "I wish you were dead; I wish you were in heaven;" and she has often said, "I know it won't live long"—on Mon<lb></lb>day morning, about 10 o'clock, as I was washing up the breakfast things, she came to me, and said, "Is there something can be had from the doctor's to make a child sleep?"—I said I did not know, I never had any<lb></lb>thing to make my baby sleep—nothing more passed then, she left the house about an hour afterwards—I had occasion to go out on an errand, I returned about 1 o'clock, or a quarter to 1, and she came in about half an hour after—the baby seemed very well then; a little girl of the prisoner's, about seven years old, was carrying it about—I have heard that the prisoner has three other children, but not in this country; I know nothing of that myself—she was a stranger to me before this-an old lady was sitting in the corner, with the baby on her knee, when the prisoner came in with a pair of socks; she <hi rend="italic">throwed</hi> them down, and said, "What a fool I was to boy them!"—she "afterwards took the child on her knee, and began feeding it out of a tea cup with a tea spoon—after she had given it the stuff, whatever it was, the child went to block it up, and she put her hand on its mouth, and put it back, and made it swallow it—I said, "What are you giving the baby?"—she said, "Nothing but a little cold milk "—I did not see what was in the cup then, I did afterwards—she then called me over, and said, "Come here, and look at the child; I am sure it won't live "—it was then on her knee—I said, "I do not see why you should say that, I do not see any deathly signs about the child"—she said, "Come, and look at its eyes"—I went, and looked at the baby's face; its little eyes looked rather glassy—I said, "The baby is asleep, put it to bed, and let it have a sleep," and she got up, and made a bed on the large arm chair, and put it down, and covered it up—she then came over to the old lady in the corner, Mrs.</p>

I have seen it suck many a time—she did not give it the breast when I told her—I do not know that there is some stuff sold by doctors to sleep children, I have seen a little aniseed used some times in the food to comfort the bowels—I never heard of Godfrey's cordial—I do not know whether she can read or write; I never saw her write, or heard her read—I never heard of anything being given to children to make them sleep; I have brought up three fine children of my own, and I never gave them anything of the kind—she had taken the child to the hospital about three weeks before; it had a purging, and they gave it a little draught which stopped it, and it was in perfect good health afterwards—on the Sunday night the child was a little fractious—I did not hear it suck—she changed it from side to side several times, and she shook it, and said, "I hope you will be stiff before morning"—she seemed in a passion, rather spiteful.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer at University College Hospital, Gower Street On 14th Sept., the baby was brought to me, into the hospital—it was insensible, and apparently from a narcotic poison—this bottle was brought in at the time—there were only a few drops in it, I should think about ten minims; it smelt strongly of opium—I asked the prisoner what she had been giving the child—she said some aniseed—she said she had given it about two hours previously—I gave the child an emetic, which was repeated, it acted very slightly; it was wrapped in flannel, and motion used—I did not apply the stomach pump, owing to the tender age of the child; it would have been difficult and dangerous, I think it would hare suffocated it; moreover it appeared So be almost dead when it was admitted—the second emetic I gave it operated slightly; I got a little warm water down with difficulty—it died fifty-four hours afterwards; it appeared to be dead three hours after its admission, but it revived; I sat up all night with it—it was a flabby, ill nourished child—the day alter its death I made <hi rend="italic">a post mortem</hi> examination; I examined the brain, and all the vital parts—the appearances of the body were insufficient to account for death; death did not appear to be due to natural disease—taking into consideration the symptoms during life, and the absence of any sufficient cause of death, I Was convinced that the child died from narcotic poison—poison in a fluid state would be absorbed more rapidly than if it were solid—two drops have caused death in a child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the child when it was first brought into the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately—several persons brought it in; the prisoner, I think, followed it—I found it in the out-patients' room—the prisoner fol<lb></lb>lowed me into the ward—she remained from about 10 minutes past 8 o'clock until she went away with the policeman, about 6 o'clock—the child was not dead then—she was taken away on suspicion—she could not attend to the child between that time and the time of its death; there was collapse of the lungs after death, which is a very common appearance in young children—it is generally an indication of debility, of a failure of power and tone—that had nothing whatever to do with the effects of narcotic poison; it is seen in children dying under many different circumstances, it is not the least indi<lb></lb>cation of death by poison—it is not an indication of death from something else—I have not known children die from collapse of the kings; I did not say so, I said you frequently find collapse of the lungs in children dying under different circumstances; indeed I should anticipate collapse in this case, or any other where a child dies from failure of power, without any poison at all—I lay no stress upon the collapse of the lungs in this case—I have not known many children die from it; children who die from exhaustion exhi<lb></lb>bit that symptom—it is an indication of debility, which debility ends in exhaustion, causing death—it has nothing to do with the cause of death, it is a sequence—if I had not been told anything about a narcotic poison, I should have suspected that the child did not die fairly, if there had been simply collapse of the lungs; there must have been something to cause that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260056"></xptr>
               <p>collapse, something first of all to produce the debility upon which collapse of the lungs supervenes—exhaustion from any cause will produce it—what I mean to say is, that collapse of the lungs is an indication of death from debility—I should state that there were some other indications of disease in the child—there was some solidification of the lower lobe of the right lung but I think that had nothing to do with the death; it was subsequent to the other symptom, not antecedent; there was limited pneumonia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the cause of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That might be due, and I think was due, to gravitation, the child being kept in the position it was—it is also a common sequel of opium poison to have more or les solidi<lb></lb>fication, of the lung, because the respiration is interfered with, and the blood stagnates; it is what medical men call hepatization, which is a common sequel to a narcotic poison—if the child had died at an earlier period, I should say it arose from coma or insensibility, but, the symptoms being so protracted, I should say it was rather due to exhaustion, the effect of the coma having more or less passed off, vegetable poison having a tendency to become eliminated—assuming a larger dose of laudanum than would be consistent with health to be given, I think that would account for debility causing collapse of the lungs, the child living so long—if narcotism imme<lb></lb>diately proves fatal, it would be by coma; if remotely, it would probably be by exhaustion—collapse of the lungs may supervene upon any state of exhaustion whatever.</p>

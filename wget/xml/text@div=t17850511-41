               <p>Did you know from the prisoner whether that was her lodging? - Yes, she gave me a direction where she lived, I found all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110063"></xptr> the things mentioned in the indictment, and I have had them in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say more than that she lived there? - No, there was no more asked her, because we wanted the name of the house where she lived.</p>
               <p>Did she only mention the name of the house where she lived? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she mention which was her room? - No.</p>

               <p>Had she any other part of the house besides? - No more.</p>
               <p>What was her character? - So far as I saw, a pretty behaved woman: she was ill used by her husband, and I asked her if she would go to place, and I believed her to be an honest woman.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see her in her lodging, after she went? - She came down and staid four nights with her husband, and I persuaded her to go back to her place again; her mistress gave her leave to stay one night, and she staid four; I saw her the Sunday before she was taken up for the fact at my house, she was in her lodgings, I saw her come out, but it is a place I never go in, I only saw her come out of the house, not out of any particular room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could speak in my own defence, if I was where I could get justice, but I leave it entirely to the mercy of your Lordship; I lived with this gentlewoman as a just and honest servant, I worked hard with her, and two nights before I went to service, I slept with this gentlewoman here, it was a house of common lodgers, I being a stranger knew nothing of it, he asked me where I lived before I went there, I said, I lodged at Green-bank, Wapping; he had no directions from me to go to search for any goods, I never had a farthing for my wages, I had not a gown till one was lent me to come here before your Majesty.</p>

On the morning of the 21st of February, the prisoner came and bought a shawl, and as she was going out, I asked how many shawls she had got - she said two; I asked her to produce them - she produced the one she had bought of me; I asked her if she had not got a red one - she then took a gown from under her arm, and in it was a red shawl, which she said she bought of Mr. Ward, where she bought the gown, which Mr. Ward would prove; she had bought a light shawl of me.</p>
               <p>MARY TAYLOR. I was in the prosecutor's shop. I saw the shawl under the prisoner's arm, and told Sizer.</p>
               <p>JOHN NICHOLSON (Police-constable K 38). The prisoner was given into my custody; I received the shawl from Sizer.</p>
               <p>JAMES SIZER re-examined. It was folded up in the gown; I did not perceive the gown till afterwards, but I had turned my back twice towards the prisoner - it is worth 1s. 6d., and I think the one she bought was 5s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that Taylor had been fumbling about the gown, which was on the counter, and must have put the shawl into it.</p>

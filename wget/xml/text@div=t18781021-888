T., and this gravy spoon marked M., also four teaspoons, two tablepoons, and a ladle; 12 articles altogether—I have not seen the gold watches or the remainder of the goods—I knew nothing of the sale of my property—I never received any papers from the bank except receipts, not even a letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Finsbury Place—I was a clerk in the Lombard Deposit Bank from 1876—I left in January this year, and went back again in May—I remember Mr. Pace getting the advance on his goods in December, 1876, I happened to see them in the lump in Mr. Payor's room at the bank—lie was the manager and had charge of the securities upon which money was advanced—Mr. Tyler, the secretary, drew this cheque and I cashed it—there is an iron safe of which Mr. Pryor had the key at that time—on folio 223 of the ledger I find an account opened by the ledger clerk with Mr. Pace, who is charged with an advance on 1st September, 1876; there are various entries to his credit, and it is settled by the payment of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 7th May—in Mr. Pryor's absence the secretary opened letters addressed to the manager—I never saw the bulk of the goods or the parcel again till 24th May, when Mr. Pace identified them—during 1876 and 1877, sales by auction took place of goods deposited for advances, and I know by the auctioneer paying in, that account sales were rendered and the accounts were squared up with the balance, but there never was a case of spoons and forks before, it was usually bills of sale or wines—I signed most of these receipts and the money went to the bank—Mr. Pace afterwards called at the Bank, and the secretary sent me with him to show him West Lodge, and if he identified anything it was to be brought away—I was present at the station when these goods were produced, which were taken from the house; Mr. Pryor said that he bought them at an auction, and I saw him pull a catalogue out of his pocket, but I do not know what was in it—I cannot say whether this is it—I do not think any one else produced one—he did not read from it, he conversed with the superin<lb></lb>tendent—a jeweller from the neighbourhood was called in, who said in his presence that they were silver, and he said that he should never have known it—I said that they were silver before the jeweller was called in—a book was kept for the register of mortgages of securities, but it fell into disuse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I still persist in saying that I saw a catalogue come out of Mr. Pryor's pocket—when the catalogue was referred to at the office</p>

               <p>the prisoner pointed out the goods in the hook and said, "That is my lot"—I do not know whether there was a lettering in manuscript of the auctioneer, showing the prices the various goods fetched—I said that they were silver—Mr. Pryor may have said that if there was a wrong description, it was not his, but the auctioneer's; I know there was a long conversation—he afterwards said that he should not have known they were silver unless he had been told by the jeweller—there are twenty different forms—the deposit note is in the usual form for that kind of money lending, but it is the only transaction I had of the kind, and I think it would probably appear in the register of mortgages—the prisoner took a lot. of papers out of his pocket, and I understood there was a catalogue—I swear to the best of my knowledge that he took out a catalogue from his pocket, but there were a lot of people interposed between him and me, a lot of papers were taken from his pocket, and I understood the catalogue came from his pocket, but I cannot swear it exactly—Mr. Pryor had charge of the safe, and there were other valuables in it extending to hundreds, I do Dot know about thousands—we also had warehouses where other property was stored, but not to the extent of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Pryor had the control of everything, and this is the only charge I know of: his misappropriating a spoon—I did not know about the sale before his arrest—I knew that Cooke and several other auctioneers had been in the habit of selling things occasionally for the Bank—they are the same persons who sold these goods—the accounts were made up and entered in the books, but not till after the auctioneers sent in their cross claims—the Bank had a right, on the failure of any one payment, to realise the goods—I know a man named Banks, I met him in July at the European Tavern, opposite the Mansion House—I did not say to Banks that I knew Pryor had bought the spoons which he had been charged with stealing, but I may have told him what Mr. Pryor's explanation was; I do not remember saying so—I db not remember a friend being with me, or his remarking to me in Banks's hearing that the mode Mr. Pryor was being treated was a shame, or my saying "Yes, but I can't help it," there were so many people about having drink; nor do I remember saying, "What a shame"—I left in January; and I have heard since from Mr. Gaskill that there has been a committee of investigation—I do not know of any resolution by the directors with reference to realising any goods for any installments which were in arrear—I was not there in February and' March.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I left in January, 1878, and returned in May—I do not know of a Mr. Lomas having deposited goods for an advance of money from the Bank; I know there was an auction, but I was not there at the time—I saw Mr. Lomas <hi rend="italic">dodging</hi> in and out of the office—I did not go with him to Mr. Pryor's residence—I did not hear Mr. Pryor say anything at the station about Lomas.</p>

               <p>Bank for a loan, and were plated goods, and had been sold at an auction, and he had purchased them—Mr. Jones said several times "They are silver goods," and to satisfy myself I sent for a silversmith, who came and said that they were silver—I asked Mr. Pryor how he accounted for their being silver when he represented them to be plated only—he referred me to 8 catalogue, which resembled this which was in the office, and said that be purchased them at that sale, and pointed to lots 170, 171, and 187—170 is "12 plated table-spoons and forks," 171 is "12 ditto," and 187 is "12 superior plated tea-spoons"—lot 172 was not referred to—lam clear as to 171, but not as to the others—after he pointed to those lots the silversmith came in and said "They are silver"—the prisoner said that he bought them at the sale, and if they had been described wrongly in the catalogue that was the auctioneer's fault and not his—the name of Lomas was mentioned, but I cannot recollect by whom—after the catalogue had been referred to I directed the sergeant to enter the charge on the charge sheet—Mr. Pryor took a bundle of papers from his pocket while Jones was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The catalogue was not one of them—Mr. Bowler was there, he made the charge and said "They are silver goods," and then I asked Mr. Pryor to point out to me where silver goods such as those produced were described in the catalogue—he then went through the catalogue, pointed out several entries, and said "These are the goods"—I did not see a description of them in the catalogue—I did not see a watch, there was nothing but the spoons—the lots I pointed out referred to spoons only—Barlow did not charge him with stealing a watch on that occasion, he said that the prisoner was wearing a gold watch which was part of the property, the prisoner said that it was not so, and I found that he had no watch, and only a bunch of keys attached to his chain—Barlow charged him with embezzling 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1873, but I said that I knew that the prisoner was carrying on business on his own account, and refused to take the charge—the secretary said that he knew that at that date the business was Mr. Pryor's, and that he could not be charged with embezzling from the Lombard Bank, which came into existence subsequently—Mr. Bowler then rushed round in a very excited manner and said "I will charge him with stealing 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and before I could investigate that charge he made the charge of these silver spoons, which were then for the first time produced by Mr. Jones, and I investigated that charge—I did not take a spoon from a cupboard and show it to Mr. Pryor, nor did Hunt, the station sergeant, that I know of—he is not here—I made no pencil marks in the catalogue, and I only looked at the place Mr. Pryor referred to—the gold watch, brooch, earrings, soup-ladle, sugar-tongs, and forks, various, were not mentioned by Far. Bowler except when he said "The watch which the prisoner is wearing." <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. If I did not mention to the Magistrate that Bowler said that the spoons were silver it was a mistake—Bowler made the charge against the prisoner before Jones said that the spoons were silver, and after that Jones said "They are silver"—I was under the impression that I told the Magistrate that Jones made that observation—I told the Magistrate that it was Bowler who said that they were silver, and upon that I asked Pryor to point out in the catalogue where the silver goods were—I did not to<lb></lb>day intentionally omit what Bowler said—he first charged him with stealing 12 silver spoons, and Jones several times made several similar assertions aft the charge was made—there had been a criminal charge made against him</p>

                  </hi>. I have been secretary to the Lombard Deposit Bank from its commencement, about 1874, and continued so up to the liquidation last May—Messrs. Plunkett and Leader became the solicitors before the prisoner's trail in June—they acted in that, but he was taken out of their hands and put into Mr. Lewis's jointly with Mr. Lee, and when Mr. Lee resigned Plunkett and Leader became solicitors to the bank—that was about the end of June, and they have been the solicitors from that time and are conducting this prosecution—I am acquainted with the mode in which property was sold by the bank for non-payment of instalments—I was not aware that Mr. Pace's property had been so sold—in the event of the sale of property realising a larger amount than the bank claim, the surplus was paid over to the borrower, and a marked catalogue was sent to him—no account was rendered to the Bank to my knowledge by any auctioneer of the sale of Mr. Pace's goods—from January Captain De Van and Mr. Gaskin have been acting as directors of the Bank, but I do not think they were present at the meeting so early as January—I was sent for to the Seething Lane station when Pryor was given in custody on 29th June for embezzling 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went there with Mr. Jones—Mr. Bowler then said that he would give Mr. Pryor in charge for stealing 12 silver spoons—the inspector asked Pryor for an explanation—he said that he had bought them; the catalogue was produced, and the inspector asked Mr. Bowler to point out where they were, and when they looked at the catalogue they were found to be plated—they were handed round to all of us and we said they were silver—I said "I think two of those are Lomas's spoons."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired captain—I purchased shares in the Lombard Deposit Bank, and attended the directors' meetings from September 1877, to the middle of May, 1878—they met about once a week—Mr. Pryor attended the meetings—I never knew that Mr. Paee's goods had been sent for sale.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There was a committee of investigation at the Bank early in the year; the whole of the directors were upon it, and I was one—there was a resolution that irregularities should be put down, and that the goods should be realised when money was not paid—that was in February—Mr. Pryor was manager in January and February, and Mr. Tyler succeeded him.</p>

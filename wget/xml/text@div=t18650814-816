I live at the same house as the last witness, and am a timber porter—on Monday night, 3d July, I was walking along the Kew-road, from my work, and saw the prisoners standing at the gateway of Mr. Black's field opposite my house—one was in the gutter and the other close to the gate—I heard Taylor say, "I wonder what o'clock it is?"—I then went to my gate and stopped there, the men stood for a few minutes, and the taller man opened the gate and went into the field and drove four beasts out, and the shorter man turned them towards the Kent-road—the man who drove them out put the gate to and then went up behind the hedge right through the field and I never saw any more of him, the other one went along the road with the beasts—in passing the lamp I observed the colour of the beasts—it was a very clear moonlight night—ten yards was the shortest distance I was from the men—I was ten yards from Taylor when he was in the gutter, and when I heard him speak—they were ten minutes under my observation to the best of my knowledge—on the following Thursday I went to the Caledonian-road police-station and from there to the Metropolitan Cattle Market—at half-past three in the afternoon I went round the market and saw Taylor sitting on some fencing—the moment I walked to him he got off and began to stroll round the market—I followed him and he went into a bank—I went in to light my pipe think<lb></lb>ing it was a public-house, and met Taylor at the doorway and asked him for a lucifer—he said, "I will feel in my pocket," and I recognised his voice instantly—I went and told the police and he was given into custody about three minutes after—I afterwards saw Gray driving some sheep in the market, and he was also taken—these are the two men I saw at the gate of Mr. Black's field, Taylor especially, and Gray to the best of my belief—I did not hear him speak.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder at the Mill bank Convict Prison, and live in the same house as Gray, 1, Goding-street, Vauxhall—I remember the Thursday he was taken—on the Monday preceding that I saw him from twenty to twenty-five minutes past eleven in the evening, coming into the passage of my house—he afterwards went and fetched my beer and his own at the Vauxhall Tavern—he came back about five minutes to twelve—he did not leave the house after that time till six in the morning—my wife was confined on the Sunday night—on the Monday night she was very ill, and I sat up with her the whole night, and in my kitchen I can see every-one who goes out or comes in—if Gray had left the house after twelve that night, or before six in the morning, I must have seen him—there is no other way out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you a warder now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am on sick leave now—I did not sit up on the Sunday night—the nurse was there—she was a hospital nurse, and she only came when she was sent for—I did not sit up on the Tuesday night, only on the Monday—I went to bed at eleven on Tuesday—I did not see Gray that night—I was before the Magistrate but I was not examined.</p>

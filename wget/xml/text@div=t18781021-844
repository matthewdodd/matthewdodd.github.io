                  </hi>. I live at 36, Westbourne Park Villas—about six weeks before I went to Paris there were intimate relations between myself and the prisoner—when we left for Paris I took with me this jewel<lb></lb>case, containing two large diamond stars, a pair of diamond earrings, a pearl and diamond locket, a pair of diamond screw earrings, a pearl and diamond bracelet, three diamond rings, a gipsy ring, a plain ring, and a gold collar-stud—the box also contained a pair of gold solitaires, a pair of gold sleeve<lb></lb>links, a pencil<lb></lb>case, and a turquoise and pearl bracelet with an inscription on the back—we left London for Paris on Friday, 14th June, and left on 24th—I was not present when the railway tickets were bought; whilst in Paris I saw them on the chimney<lb></lb>piece; they were return tickets—we put up at the Hotel de Rivoli—on the fourth day the prisoner asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he expected a letter from Rothschild's and he had not got it—I let him hove a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he would give it me back next day; it was never returned—on Monday, 24th June, it was arranged that we should return to London—in the early part of that day the prisoner wished me to dress, as a gentleman was coming to lunch with us; and I put on the jewellery—the gentleman did not come, and he asked me to take off the jewellery and put it in the jewel-case; he said it would not be comfortable for me to wear these screw earrings or the diamond rings in travelling—I took off the jewels and put them in the jewel-case—my property was all safe at that time, about half-past 1 in the day—I locked the jewel-case and packed it in my large traveling<lb></lb>box; that had no lock; it was only fastened with straps across—the prisoner told me to put my jewel-case between my dresses at the bottom of the trunk, and I did so—after doing so we went out to lunch—we went in a cab to some money-changing place, where the prisoner went in; I waited outside in</p>

Emmieaa, when you read this and the enclosed, what will you think of me? I have been so wretched and miserable for the last week, hunting about to try and get money, and always disappointed. You wrote me Tuesday, to<lb></lb>day week, to send you any tickets I had. I said I had none. Such was and is the case, but the enclosed will explain itself. You will have to send Arthur and Co. 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when he will send you the things registered. You will have to send the enclosed letter also. You hall not be out of the money for long, for by hook or crook, if I have to get rid of all future interests I may have, I will get it for yon. I have not been to Long's since Friday 12 o'clock, and by the time you get this I shall be many miles from London till I can repay you what yon have to send. Think as well of me as you can. Some day you may forgive me. I dare not say anything more, I am too wretched. Capel." Enclosed in that was a letter in his handwriting to Messrs. Arthur and Co.—up to that time I did not know that he had obtained 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Arthur and Co.; he never told me a word about it; I did not know where my jewellery was till I got that letter; that reached me after the advertisement offering 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—when in Paris I had in my purse a sovereign and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; it contained the same money when we came to England on Tuesday morning, the 25th—it was in a sealskin bag on the dining<lb></lb>room table; I placed it there about 8 o'clock, after we had arrived—I saw the prisoner there; I left him there alone from half-past 8 till 9—I then went to my purse, and missed the sovereign—I did not say anything to him about it—I afterwards said in his hearing that I had lost it—I did not charge him with it—Taylor was the only other person there.,</p>

I have been living at Westbourne Park Villas two years, under the protection of a gentleman—the same gentleman has pro<lb></lb>vided the establishment during the whole of that time—I was separated from my husband—I first met the prisoner in 1875, at Cremorne, and for a</p>

               <p>short time afterwards I was on intimate terms with him—I denied with him at the Criterion, at St. James's Hall, and the Pall Mall Restaurant—I did not go to the theatre with him, or to Cremorne, on any other occasion—our acquaintance then dropped for two years; it was about six weeks before we went to Paris that I met with him again, I was frequently in his company during that six weeks; he slept at my house on several occasions, during that time he gave me about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I dined with him frequently at the Cafe Royale and else where—the trip to Paris was arranged about a fortnight before we went—we were not just to run over and see the Exhibition, I was to stay as long as I could, he was to remain with me the whole time—I always knew him by his own name; I only knew by reading it in the papers, that he had been in pecuniary difficulty at one time—it was at Scarborough last year—I did not know that he had been bankrupt—I did not talk to him at all about his financial position-—he did not intimate to me that he was expecting money, or that he had future interests from which he hoped to get money—we reached Paris on the morning of the 15th June and went direct to the hotel, we went to the races on Sunday in a carriage, we sometimes breakfasted and dined at the hotel, and sometimes at restau<lb></lb>rants—we did not have a carriage on any other occasion—we sometimes drove about in the evening, we did not go to the play, we used to stay at home, I told him I would not stay after the Monday; it was at my suggestion that the visit terminated then—we lunched about 2—my box was packed about 11—he left me at the' luncheon place for about half an hour and returned to me—we came by mail boat from Calais to Dover—I think the luggage was registered through, I left—it to the prisoner to register—we drove to my house and sat up till about 9, he then went to bed, I went to bed, I was up when my servant came and informed me about my jewel case—the prisoner returned that night and slept in the house—some of the missing jewellery was presented to me by the gentleman with whom I lived, I saw that gentleman on the Wednesday evening, and he observed the absence of my rings—he did not accompany me when I applied for the warrant, he was not instructing Mr. Lewis in this matter; I don't know that he was at the police-court, I went with my maid to the police-station, the gentleman was there taking a strong interest in the prosecution.</p>

I read in the paper last year that the prisoner was arrested or brought away from Scarborough for forging a cheque or something, I don't exactly remember what it as—he said nothing when leaving Paris about any difficulty of paying the hotel bill—the jewellery could be carried in a handkerchief or a pocket—I did not know that he had the jewellery upon him when he left me at the luncheon place for half an hour.</p>

               <p>Southampton Hotel at Surbiton, and there found the prisoner under the name of Charles Fraser—I said "Sir Capel Fitzgerald, I believe"—he said "Oh yes, I know, don't show me up"—I said "There is no occasion for that, there is a cab outside," and he came with me—he asked how I knew about it—I said there was an advertisement in the paper, which I showed him he then said "I did not steal the things; we had overrun our means, and I pledged them by Susan Stevens's consent at Arthur's, 10, Rue Castiglione, to pay our fare back to England."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that as to the articles charged in the first court the offence, if any, was committed and perfected in France; that the taking and converting was there, and that this Court as to those articles had there<lb></lb>fore no jurisdiction. See Reg. v. Nadal, Central Criminal Court Sessions Paper, vol</hi>. 84, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 295; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Carr, vol</hi>. 87, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 46; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Prowes, Moody's Crown Cases</hi>, 349, <hi rend="italic">and Reg. v. Madge</hi>, 9 <hi rend="italic">Carrington and Payne. He further contended that the doctrine of continuing larceny did not apply hen. The taking, which must be felonious to satisfy an indictment forlarceny, was com<lb></lb>pleted in France, and for aught there was to the contrary, it must be a perfectly lawful act here</hi>.<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the cases cited when Reg. v. Carr was before Denman, Justice, were authorities to show that if the larceny was com<lb></lb>pleted out of the jurisdiction, a receiver in the jurisdiction could not be tried for that offence or for being accessory after the fact to the larceny, because the original offence was not trialable here. The decisiim of Gurney, Recorder, in Reg. v. Nadal was to the same effect. There the prisoner took Mr. Brown's goods in Paris end sent them, to his wife in a false name in London, and afterwards came to London and took possession of them. The late Recorder pointed out that if Nadal had travelled with the goods to London then would have been jurisdiction here, because the carrying away would have been in England, although the taking was in France. The doctrine of con<lb></lb>tinuing larceny applied wherever the goods were carried by the thief himself from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction</hi>.</p>

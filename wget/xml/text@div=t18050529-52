               <p>Q. When you returned home, in what situation did you find your house? - A. I found my door open and my drawers had been broke open, and all my money taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the lock of your door had been picked that goes into the alley? - A. Not the outer door that goes into the alley; that door was open, and so was my parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left that door locked when you went out next the alley? - A. No, I left that door open, on account of my lodgers going up and down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out did you leave any of your lodgers in the house? - A. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd; they were in the house the whole of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there when you returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the outer door open - What was the next observation that you made? - A. The passage door was open and my parlour door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your parlour door open? - A. I double locked it, the lock had been picked, the door had not been damaged at all.</p>
               <p>Q. On going into the room did you miss any thing? - A. I lost all the money I had in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put that money? - A. I had locked it up in a drawer belonging to a chest of drawers in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there many drawers belonging to it? - A. It has three large drawers, and two little ones.</p>
               <p>Q. In which of these drawers was your money? - A. In one of the upper little drawers; they went into the shop, and took a basket of copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what sort of money it was that you missed from this drawer? - A. I missed the guineas, the half-guineas, seven-shilling pieces, a dollar, shillings, and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the gold and silver amount to that was taken? - A. I had counted ten guineas in guineas, and twenty half-guineas, and I counted eight pounds in silver; I cannot say justly how many in shillings; I counted it on Saturday night; I had so many seven-shilling pieces, I cannot say how many, and five pounds of copper in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was it contained in the shop? - A. It was put into a half-sieve basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the parlour open into the shop? - A. Yes; on coming home I missed all that money which I counted on the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any Bank-notes? - A. Two Bank-notes of one pound each; they were in the drawer with the silver in a decanter stand; the gold part of it was in a green silk purse.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the prisoners - look at either of them? - A. I know neither of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that you saw either of them before? - A. No, but my daughter came home, and found one of the young men in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your daughter come home? - A. No; she came home before me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Garland. Q. Did you not say on the last examination that you took part of the sieve out of the fire that was burnt? - A. I went up in the one pair of stairs with Mr. Ray, and there I saw on the fire the appearance of a basket that had been burnt there, and it struck me that that was the basket that my copper and my money was in; I only thought so, I could not swear to ashes you know; that I mentioned at the Office, but not here.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on Sunday, the 28th of April, any thing at or near Mrs. Curtis's door? - A. I was at home on the Sunday evening, and Mrs. Curtis's little girl came and called to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time? - A. I cannot justly say, it might be about eight o'clock; Mrs. Curtis's little girl asked me whether her mother was come home; I told the little girl I did not know that she was out; she said her mother had been out to dine, and she had come home and found all the doors open; I told the little girl to get a light.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark, was it? - A. It was near dark, and Mrs. Williams came into the garden to get some stockings and things she had been hanging out there in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose garden? - A. Mrs. Curtis's garden; and the little girl asked Mrs. Williams to go with her to the door to see whether they could see any body in the house, or about it; I was informed that they looked in at the door, but saw no person; I went up to my own room again; in or about five minutes afterwards, Mrs. Curtis's little girl cried out very loudly; I ran down, and seized a person in the passage close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that person? - A. The prisoner, Garland, in the light coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it exactly that you seized him in the passage, how near to Mrs. Curtis's door? - A. About two yards in the short passage that leads into the long passage which goes up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him two yards, you say, from the door? - A. Not more than two yards from the door; he said, I do not look like a thief, come to the light.</p>
               <p>Q. You had done something, or said something, before that? - A. I had seized him by the collar; then he said, I do not look like a thief, come to the light; he said that I should know him again; he pulled off his hat, and stood in this manner (witness holding his head up,) quite upright, facing me so; I did not see him have any bundle, or any thing of that sort; he referred me to Mr. Faulkner for his character; he said he was well known in the neighbourhood of Chiswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man with him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had no bundle with him? - A. No bundle at all to appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body search him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to search him? - A. I cannot tell you; but the reason why I suffered him to go away was, by seeing he was a genteel young fellow, and his saying he was no thief, and the like of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you let him go away? - A. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept him about ten minutes, and then let him go? - A. Yes, in the presence of several people in the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came afterwards to be apprehended? - A. No.</p>

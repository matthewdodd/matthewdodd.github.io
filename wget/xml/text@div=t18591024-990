I keep a greengrocer's shop at Charlotte-terrace, New-cut, Lambeth—on Saturday night, September 24tb, about 12 o'clock, as near as possible, the prisoner came into my shop for 1lb. of potatoes at 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—she offered me in payment a bad florin—I knew at the time that it was bad, but I did not pretend so to her—I said "Have you got another?" she said in a very quick off-hand manner, "If you don't like it you have no cause to take it; I have more money;" and she gave me another bad florin, as quick as possible—I tried both the florins; they were both bad—I said, "Have you got any more of these?" she said, "No; why, do you think they are bad?" I said, "You are perfectly aware that they are bad"—she said, "If you judge me for that, you are quite wrong; if they are bad they are as I received them from my husband, to-night"—I said, "I will give you into custody directly"—I sent immediately for a con<lb></lb>stable—before the constable came she turned out her pocket, and said that she had no more money—when the constable came she laid down a little purse, which contained 3 sixpences, 1 shilling, and 2 penny pieces—I gave the 2 florins to the constable—I never lost sight of her; she had the potatoes in her basket before she gave me the money.</p>

I said, "Yes;" she then said, "They are both bad;" and I turned out my pocket, and said, "Then all my money must be bad." I showed her all I had,</p>

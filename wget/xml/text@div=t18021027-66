             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Hoppe: On Thursday the 21st of October, three men came in, Welch said, he wanted a pair of shoes, I took two pair out of the press, and tried on pair on, which sitted him, but he wanted a more fashionable pair; I went to get him another pair, and Welch came after me, and pointed to a pair of shoes, saying, they would do; when I turned round, I missed the first pair, which I had left in his possession; the third man went out; I looked to see if they had the shoes, and saw them behind M'Leod's back, and saw him push them up to hinder them from falling; I asked Welch where the shoes were, which had sitted him so well, he said, he and given them to somebody, pointing to the apprentice; my master said, M'Leod had them behind his back; he denied it till they were pointed to, and then he produced them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. Welch came to buy shoes, did he not? - A. I understood so, but I suspected him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Welch gave them to M'Leod to hold, you cannot say? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from Welch? - A. Standing still, close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know how far the apprentice was concerned? - A. He knew nothing of it till I mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had Welch agreed to buy a pair of shoes? - A. No.(

             confirmed the two former witnesses.)(The shoes produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Welch's defence. I went along with M'Leod to buy the shoes, I sitted them on, and they were rather right; I said to M'Leod, hold them, while I sit on another pair, which he did.</p>
               <p>M'Leod's defence. I went with Welch, and the first pair was tight, as he has said, and he gave them me to hold; I was speaking to a man at the door, and kept them in my hand under my coat behind, unthinkingly, while I was talking; they asked for the pair of shoes; I said, what is the matter, and immediately gave them to the master; I have been in his Majesthy's service nine years, and would not disgrace the cloth of a soldier by stealing a pair of shoes.</p>

On Friday, the 6th of July, about eleven o'clock, as I was driving along Milton-street in my cart, a man came up to me and gave me a letter, in consequence of which I sent him to my premises—about one I received another letter from him, and directed my foreman to let him have a horse—I said, "Are you the carman to Mr. Bartholomew?"—he said, "Yes, I am"—I said, "He gives you an excellent character; go into my stable with my foreman, and take such a horse as will suit you"—a brown mare was delivered to him, worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my foreman said, "You bring the horse back this evening, and I will let you have another in the morning"—he took it away about a quarter past one—it was not returned—between seven and eight next morning it was brought by Mrs. Cox's man, who came with it in a cart for two quarters of oats—my foreman claimed it—I afterwards made inquiries of the two Mr. Bartholomews, and the man's story turned out to be false.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, living at Greenwich. On 10th July I was at Mrs. Cox's when West came up-stairs—he said, "Well, mistress, how are you getting on?"—she said, "I hardly know how I am getting on; I have been wanting to see you"—he said, "Did not you know where to find me?"—she said, "No"—I asked how long he had had the horse before he brought it to Mrs. Cox—he said, "Not more than an hour"—I said, "Do you know the party you bought it of?"—he said, "Yes, I have seen him," or something to that effect—he seemed to speak as if he had a knowledge of him—he did not say how often he had seen him—he said he bought the horse in St. John-street—I do not know that he mentioned the house, for Mr. Greig came in, and I was in a hurry, and did not stop—he said the ostler was present when the horse was bought, and saw the transaction—he did not name the ostler-did not hear anybody ask his name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Robinson, who keeps a livery and bait and commission stable in St. John-street. On Friday, 6th July, about a quarter to two o'clock, the prisoners were at our yard—Blake came to look at a cart—11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid for it—it was my master's cart—I was allowed to sell—while he was looking at it, I saw a man leading a horse—I do not know who spoke first, but the man said he had come from a green<lb></lb>grocer's in distress, and wanted a little ready money—West and he began talking about the horse—our place is about a mile from Smithfield—there were four or five other persons in the yard—West went away outside the gate with the man, and then came back again and said he had given 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the mare—it was on the market-day—Blake asked me to lend him a cart to try it in—I said, no, my employer allowed me to lend nothing—West took the horse away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they both come together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I had never seen West before—I had seen Blake twice previously—he had been on Friday to look at the cart—West had a white frock on—the man who came from the greengrocer's had a round jacket, and breeches, and gaiters—I should know him again in the same dress—West said he had bought the mare—they both went out of the yard, and the mare stopped in the yard with Blake's little boy, who was holding it—I should think he was fourteen or fifteen years old—I do not know whether he is here—none of the people who were in the yard are here—I never saw the man before who came with the mare—I do not know his name, or where he lives—I saw no note brought, and saw nothing written on the day I am speaking of—our yard is not a place for selling horses—I did not know the mare was for sale when they brought it in—I do not know where Blake lived—the man who brought the mare did not give any name—both Blake and West came into the yard again with the mare to Smithfield—there was a little white mare in the yard at the same time, I think West brought it in; I am not certain about it, it was either West or the little boy—Blake bought it—I do not know what was given for it—the other men were Mr. Robinson's men, who work in the yard—they are all in his service still, they all saw and heard this—their names are John Bellamy, Edwards, George Harness, and Philip Gordon—I believe the white mare also went down to the market—I saw no money pass, or any receipt.</p>

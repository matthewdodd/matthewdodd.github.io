On 19th February, from information I received, I went to the last witness and received this watch—I also went, with another constable, to the house where the prisoner lived—I was in plain clothes—I found the prisoner in bed—I asked him if his name was Wood—he said, "Yes"—I told him I belonged to the police, and had come to speak to him respecting a watch that he had sold to Smith, of 5, Thomas-street, Backchurch-lane, that he had better be careful what he said, as I might have to give it in evidence against him—he said, "Yes, I sold Mr. Smith a watch"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "I bought the ticket of a man at mid-day last Sunday week, in Petticoat-lane, and I took it out of pledge in the Bethnal-green-road"—he afterwards said that he bought the watch of a man in Petticoat-lane, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; that</p>

               <p>he saw a man offering it for sale; that he looked at it, and saw it was worth the money; and happening to have the money with him, he bought it for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "It's no use for you to tell any more lies about it; last Sunday week was before the watch was lost"—I told him he must dress himself and go with me to the station—on the road to the station, he said it was on Thursday at mid-day that he bought it—I said, "How is that, if you are working so regularly at the docks you cannot get out to buy things?"—he then said that it was in the evening that he bought it, when he went out to buy two flannel petticoats for his child.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the 13th, I was on my way to work at ten minutes to 6, when I met Thomas Davis, the husband of Ann Davis, who pledged these things. He said, "My wife has got a watch, if you know anybody that wants to buy a watch, she wants you to sell this watch." Mr. Good<lb></lb>child had been speaking to me about this Mr. Smith that wanted a watch, and I said to Goodchild that day, "I think I have a watch that will suit that person you were telling me about." I went home early that afternoon, went to Mr. Smith's house, and asked him if he was in want of a watch. He said, "Yes, I am." I said, "Well, I am going home, and I will bring it round in an hour to you" When I went up stairs this Ann Davis was in my place talking to my wife. She said, "Mr. Wood, I have been waiting for you, for I have got a watch I want you to sell, if you can." I said, "I have been asked for a watch, and, if you like, I will take it round before I have my tea. I took it to Mr. Smith, and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, which I brought back and gave to Ann Davis, and she went away. That is the whole truth. As regards the tickets, Mr. Smith came to my place, I think, on the 16th, on a Monday; Goodchild was in the room. Smith said he had been given to understand that this watch was stolen. I said, "No; I can't believe." At this time I had the tickets of the property, which turns out to belong to this other burglary. If I had known them to belong to that other burglary, should I not have burnt them instead of keeping them from the Monday till the Thursday, when the policeman came. If I had known myself to be guilty, I had plenty of time to abscond.</p>

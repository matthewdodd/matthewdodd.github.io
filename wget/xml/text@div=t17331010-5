            . Between 9 and 10 in the Morning, I was sent for to Mrs. Frazier's, in Barnet, to search the Prisoner. I found she had had a Child, and she own'd it and that she had drop'd it in a Pond, by the <placeName id="t17331010-5-crimeloc21">Green-Man at Barnet</placeName>

She said, she was an Irish-woman, and was going to her own Country, and being taken ill by the Pond-side, she could go no farther; but leaning against the Rails, the Child came from her, and fell into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100004"></xptr> Pond, and that she was so weak with an Ague and Fever that she could not call for Help. I saw the Child, it was a Female, very fair and clear, and without any Marks of Violence, and, I believe, with proper Help it might have been born alive.</p>

            , Surgeon. About 8 in the Morning I saw the Child at Mrs. Frazier's, it had no Marks of Violence. The Prisoner said, that when she first came to the Pond she was taken with Labour-Pains, and was taken with such a Fit that she lost her Senses, and if she had not held by the Rail, she must have fallen into the Pond herself; at which Time, she said, the Child dropt from her. It fell down a Slope two Foot deep, and might be killed by the Fall. She told me, her Husband died in Kent 6 Weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Coming by the Pond, very sick and weak, I was taken with a Fit, and took hold of the Post, and the Child dropt from me. I was going to my Friends in Ireland, and did not expect to be brought to Bed till a Fortnight after Michaelmas. My Husband died in Harvest-time at Kings-Down in Kent, where he was buried.</p>

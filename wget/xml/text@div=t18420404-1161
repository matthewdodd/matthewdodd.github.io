                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live at No. 73, Alderagate-street—I saw the prisoner at my shop on Friday, the 4th of February, he said he should want some linens to show a customer—I had known him five or six years—he said he was going to show them to Mr. Cheslett, living at an eating-house opposite the Post-office—he looked at the linens, said they would do, and he would call again the beginning of the week, and on Tuesday afternoon, between two and three o'clock, he came and saw them again—they were packed up—I sent my son with him, with in<lb></lb>structions not to leave the linen, nor to leave the prisoner without the money or the goods—he and my son went away with the goods to show Mr. Cheslett.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son, and assist him in his business—the prisoner came on the Friday previous to the 8th of February—I was present—he wanted eleven yards of flannel, and said he should want a piece or two of linen in a day or two, to show the same party, Mr. Cheslett, and of course the transaction would be carried on in the same way as the flannel was—he came again on Tuesday morning, and saw me first—he asked if anybody could go with him with the linens—I said the porter was gone to dinner, but if he would look in about two boors after somebody should go with him—he called again—the linens were packed up and laid on the counter—my father said, "You had better put your coat on and go with him"—I did so—he said, "Will you any the linens or shall I?"—I said, "Oh, you may carry them," and he took them off the counter—I went with him to Mr. Cheslett's, St. Mar<lb></lb>tin's-le-grand, opposite the Post-office—I waited outside—he came out with the linen again—he said nothing, but went into a pork-butcher's next door—I waited outside—he came out again, but said nothing till we got under the portico of the Post-office—he had the linen with him, and said they had suited themselves with linen, but would very likely want some flannel, and if I would go with him to Maiden-lane, he should very likely sell a piece there—he went into the Angel and Crown public-house—I waited about five minutes—he came out and said the gentleman was up stairs shaving, but if I would wait ten minutes he had no doubt he should sell him a piece, as he was a good customer—he went in again—I waited outside half-an-hour or more, and finding he did not come out, I went in to inquire, and ascertained there had been such a person showing some linen to the gentleman, and he had gone out at the back-door—I found there was another way out of the house—I saw nothing more of him till he was in custody—I have never seen the linen since—it was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Watling-street on the 10th of March, about half-past one o'clock, Mr. Woolmer's porter brought the prisoner to me and gave him in charge—I took him to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I have had goods of the prosecutor before, and paid for them; in this instance I had an order for a piece of Irish; I took two pieces with me in case one might suit better than the other; I went to the place to effect the sale; they had been supplied, and did not require any at present; I went to the Angel and Crown public-house, thinking I might sell goods there; I waited there half-an-hour; the gentleman was engaged; I went out at the Wood-street entrance, which is not a back-entrance; I went to look for a better market for the goods; it is usual to obtain goods on approbation; it was my intention to return and pay the money, but I did not; I have lived in the City seven years, and bone an unexceptionable character.</p>

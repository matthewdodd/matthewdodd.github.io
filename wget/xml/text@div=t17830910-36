               <p>Court. Did you observe the other prisoner Barker? - I cannot say positively to him, but there was another man came to the horse's head.</p>
               <p>How long might they continue with you? - A very short time, about a minute or a half a minute; when they went away I stood up in the chaise to look after them, they all three went directly together, and went up the road, I would have followed them, but the gentleman in the chaise would not, they trembled very much, I took particular notice of Glanville for his size, his face I could not see particularly, he had something over it, but I took particular notice of the size of the man, and when we took him I knew him as soon as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>Then you did not swear to him from his face? - No.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had a brown coat on and a striped waistcoat.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again? - On the Tuesday night, we went after them the next night to take them, and on the Tuesday following we took them at the same spot.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Glanville dressed the same on the Tuesday night as on the Thursday? - Yes, he was searched.</p>
               <p>What had he over his face? - It was something black.</p>
               <p>If you had happened to have met him any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100052"></xptr> where else but upon that spot, do you think you should have known him? - I should have known him, my Lord, I think if I had seen him among fifty people.</p>
               <p>By what? - From the thickness of his hulk, and his having a prodigious round head, I thought he had? - And you positively undertake to swear to him now? - Yes, my Lord, I do.</p>
               <p>Was there any moon that night? - No, it was just the beginning of dusk, it was plain enough to see a person a hundred yards from me.</p>
               <p>Was any body going by at the time? - Not just then, there was a little cart came by, I called to them, but they did not mind me, then there was a chaise coming, and I wanted them to go first and me to follow them.</p>
               <p>What sort of hair had he? - He had his own hair hanging down, shortish hair and flapped hat.</p>

               <p>Had he any arms? - They all three had knives.</p>

               <p>Did they pull out their knives at the time they stopped you? - Yes, I saw all their knives very plain.</p>

               <p>I was driving the chaise, I must confirm the evidence, that Mr. Branson has already given, only with this difference, that I perceived them start from the pathway, and the man at the head of the horses stood on my side, his knife seemed to be very bright, he shewed it by way intimidation I thought, it was not so dark but what one might easily discern them, and know them again, one on each side came and mounted the foot board of the chaise, and unbuttoned the leather, and on mounting the foot board the man presented a knife to my belly, and he held it about an inch and a half, and demanded my money, the man at the horse then called out for the watches, and the prisoner Barker asked me if I had a watch, and I told him yes, and I lifted up my waistcoat pocket and was going to pull it out, he took hold of the seal, and had three pulls before he could get it out, my waistband being tight; I had not then given him my money, he was in a very great tremor, - and desired the business to be very quickly done; I told Barker I had no pocket book, but one that had some fishing tackle in, this book I gave into his hand, and he felt at it, but he saw the piece of wood, which the lines are wrapped round, and he believed me, and he gave me the pocket book again; just about the time that Barker had got my watch, Glanville not getting Mr. Branson's watch, Barker said what is that you have dropped there, and repeated it three times, the prosecutor said nothing, but Barker absolutely had the audacity to, put his hand into the middle of the chaise, and felt for it; the man at the horse's head, called out to know if the boy had any money; they all three had something black tied round their faces, but this did not cover their faces, it was only tied nigh about an inch wide all this time, I was very collected and took particular notice of all that passed with the three, but more particularly the man at the head of the horses, and Barker, the man that robbed me; after they had got their booty, Barker very civily buttoned up the chaise, and twice wished me a good night, I said, it was exceedingly ridiculous to think of going after three men armed with knives, and having nothing to defend ourselves; we hailed a cart which did not hear us, we hailed a chaise but the lady was frightened: At the turnpike I applied to several people to get a pistol for the purpose of pursuing them, I got one, and used my plumb that I used to my fishing tackle for a bullet, we went, but could not find them: We went the same road on Friday night, with some of Sir Sampson's men, and on the Tuesday evening we went out, Atkins, Mr. Branson and me, they went down the road, and I, and the other two people were to go on foot, we searched a house near the bridge, and as we returned we met Atkins and the men in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you positively swear to the face of Barker? - We were so near all the time during the transaction I am mentioning, that I really have not the least scruple or doubt of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100053"></xptr>Notwithstanding he had something over his face? - He had, but when I came in, I immediately singled out Barker, and disclaimed any notice of Glanville, I took very particular notice of Barker by his moving his hand with the knife in that manner.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose they might stay with the chaise? - Rather more then a minute, they were very fearful and trembled very much, and wished to get away.</p>
               <p>Was Barker dressed as he is now? - Yes.</p>

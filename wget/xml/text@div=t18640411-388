                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hudson, who keeps a public-house in Little Newport-street—on 12th March, about half-past 12 in the day, the prisoners came in; Wilson called for a pint of porter—they drank it and went away together—Wilson, I think, paid for if with twopence—they came back again in half or three quarters of an hour for another pint of porter—Wilson, I think, paid for it with a shilling, which I put into the till and gave him tenpence change—there was no other shilling there—they re<lb></lb>turned in half or three-quarters of an hour, and Wilson said to Montgomery, "You had better have some brandy, as the beer made you feel strange—Montgomery gave me a shilling, which I put in the till, where there was no other shilling—shortly after they left a woman came in and I took the two shillings out of the till—I found they were bad—the woman told me some<lb></lb>thing,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110015"></xptr>
               <p>and I put them on the back of the counter, and they were in my sight till I gave them to the police—the prisoner came back at a quarter-part 5, and Wilson called for a quartern of gin—he gave me a shilling—I put it in my month, and it was bent—I said, "This is the third bad shilling you have given me to-day"—Wilson said, "I will soon fetch a policeman," and they both went out—I gave Montgomery in charge a quarter of an hour after<lb></lb>wards with the three shillings which I marked.</p>

On Saturday, 12th March, in consequence of information I received, I took Montgomery at the White Bear public-house, corner of Bear-street and Castle-street, Leicester-square, at half-past 6 in the evening—he was a little the worse for drink—I told him that he was charged with being concerned, with another, in passing bad money at the Crown and Grapes, Little Newport-street, New-port-market—he said, "You have made a mistake, I was not there"—I took him back there, and the last witness identified him—I received three shil<lb></lb>lings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched Montgomery, and found sevenpence in copper—on Monday, 28th March, I took Wilson at the White Hart, Finsbury-market—I said to him, "Is your name Gleeson?"—he said, "No, my name is not Gleeson, you have the advantage of me"—I said, "l am a police-constable, and I take you into custody for passing, with another man, some counterfeit shillings at the Crown and Grapes, Little Newport-street"—he is well known by the name of Gleeson round about there, and Wilson also.</p>

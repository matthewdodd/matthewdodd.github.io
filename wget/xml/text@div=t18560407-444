Signed, J. Bugbee"—J. Bugbee is nephew to Mr. Bugbee—I paid the prisoner 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—in half an hour afterwards I saw Joseph Bugbee—he brought me this book from which the cheques are torn.</p>

I keep this book—I know the prisoner, Wiggins—I take my direc<lb></lb>tions as to what I am to pay the men from Mr. Perkins, the foreman—I enter this sum on the counterpart from what Mr. Perkins told me—I made out this ticket—I wrote on it, "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Feb. 23," the "6" in "1856," and the name "Wiggins"—this "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the corner is my writing—the figures are mine—the "1" has been added to the "4" since I wrote it—there is only one person employed in that office besides me—I afterwards took this book to the Green Coat Boy, and showed it to Mr. Mills.</p>

            , who had leave to lie in the house, called upon me, and told me some of the captain's relations were coming to town, and asked if I knew the woman, as he was afraid things were not right at home. The prisoner came the next morning to me, and desired to have half a guinea; I did not let her have it, but told her I would come up the next day; I went the next day, and took two men with me; I told her, that as the family were coming to town, I brought them to put up the furniture; I called up Woolaster, who told me things were just as he suspected; I then took the prisoner into the parlour, and she owned she had pawned the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) part of them at Mr. Hall's, St. Martin's-lane, and the remaining part at Mr. Freer's in Walker-court.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises to induce her to confess? - None upon earth. I had no power to make her any; she said she was in debt, and in great distress, and pawned them to pay her debts. I saw the things in the hands of the pawnbrokers; I do not know them to be Mr. Kingsmill's.</p>

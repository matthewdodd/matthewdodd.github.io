On the 26th of December I left my house at eight o'clock in the evening; my property was then safe - a young woman lived in the house at that time - I returned between eleven and twelve, the young woman was at home; I missed my things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the prisoner been often at your house? A. No, the first time was on Christmas-eve - I do not know that he was there after that - he never slept with me - I never knew him to sleep in the house - I did not know that he was in the robbery till I found some of my things; Mr. Duncot used to come backwards and forwards, from knowing Mr. Gill; Duncot was there for a week once, but I did not know him at the time these things were taken; he slept in the same room that I did - I have seen the prisoner since the robbery; he lived at a public-house near where I lived - it is hard for me to tell how often I have been in that public-house with him - Duncot has absconded; I did not know that Gill was in the robbery till Duncot told me so; he never was in my place till Christmas-eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he never, to your knowledge, slept in your house? A. I never saw him about; he might come to Duncot one night, but I knew nothing about it; he never slept with Duncot to my knowledge; I slept in my own bed - I do not know that Gill and Duncot slept in the same bed.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did Gill pass the night in the same room with you and Duncot? A. No; I do not recollect Gill being there on any night.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your oath, did not Gill sleep one night in the same bed with you and Duncot? A I never slept with Gill; I do not recollect his sleeping in the same bed with me and Duncot - I have three beds, one on the other; I have slept on them for nine years - Duncot and I lived together, as man and wife, while he was there; I do not recollect whether I was in the same bed with Gill and Duncot - it is a good bit ago; to my knowledge I never was.</p>

            . On the 26th of December, the prisoner, Duncot, and three other young men brought a tea-board, a poker, a shovel, and a pair of tongs to my house between eight and nine o'clock in the evening - I could identify the other three, but I do not know their names - Duncot told me that he and his wife were in great distress, and asked if I would buy two or three things of him; he asked 3s. for them, which I gave him; the prisoner did not speak at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Duncot in gone off? A. Yes, Sir; I did not know that he was living with the prosecutrix; I know Gill by his working nearly opposite where I did; he bore an honest character - I suppose they came to me to buy them, because I was lately married.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner employed by you? - A. He was employed to bring up three crast; he was not the man tath stowed them, nor the man that watched them; I lent him a hand up with one of them part of the way, up to Porter's-quay.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you continued in his employ all that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has also been employed between eight and nine years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the prisoner who was at all entrusted with the property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not Custom-house officers on board, to whom the care of the property is committed? - A. Yes, during the time they are on board.</p>

               <p>Q. Then to them was committed the custody of the articles on board the lighter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you come up to the shore, is it not committed from the officers belonging to the ship, to officers belonging to the shore? - A. Yes; as soon as we were showed in shore, there was a watchman sat, but he seemed to be in liquor, and there were two watchmen of Mr. Briant's put into the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the custody of the lighter was given to them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the duty of the prisoner, after the charge was given to these men? - A. To go home, if he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not his duty to have gone on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But is it not the usual custom? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whetever you took from the Uretta, was taken on the Surry side of the river. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, was there an opportunity, all the time the prisoner was on board, to have cut, untied, and tied up again those bales, without your observing him, or the Customhouse officers? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came on shore, were you not moored alongside other lighters, not belonging to Briant? - A. Yes, many empty lighters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this was a lighter that belonged to Briant, or one that was hired for that day for the purpose of carrying these goods? - A. It belonged to Mr. Briant.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you on your passage from the ship Uretta to the shore? - A. I look upon it to be about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from the ship to the Custom-house? - A. Best part of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on board from the first? - A. No, I came on shore about half way between the ship and where the lighter went to land; the tide ran very hard, that made me go to assist him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was on board besides? - A. A Custom-house officer, and a watchman from the ship; I do not know the name of either.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140083"></xptr>Q. How many lighters had the prisoner under his care that day? - A. No other that that lighter.</p>
               <p>Q.You told us he had three lighters under his care? - A. He brought three different lighters from that ship, during the time she was there, which might be seven or eight days.</p>
               <p>Q. But how many were there on the 5th of January? - A. I don't think there was more than that one came from there that day, that was the first lighter, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you landed? - A. It might be near three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your lighter? - A. I was in the lighter with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not assist in loading her? - A. No; nor the prisoner either.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that, if you were not there? - A. He was not there at the time, I am well convinced.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you? - A. I cannot rightly say, I was at all parts of the River looking after business.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came on shore, who went on shore first? - A. I went on shore first, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave on board then? - A. There was nobody left on board the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to look after the watchman, to take charge of the lighter? - A. The captain's men, I believe, returned to the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the officer? - A. He went to the ship, I expect, I cannot tell, they must leave their note before they leav the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. They must leave it with whom? - A. With the King's officer on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do so? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come away with you? - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon that occasion, was Fenton's examination taken down in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any promise of favour made, if he gave an account of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What was taken down was read over to him? - A. I believe it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. I will not be positive that it was read over to him; he looked over the book himself, as I had taken it down before he signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do more than sign it, without reading it? - A.He desired to look at what he signed before he signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who handed the book over to him? - A. He stood close to the table where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time it was written, to the time he signed it, had he time to read it over? - A.He had; he was desired by the Magistrate to read it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was he not frequently cautioned, by the Magistrate, not to sign it till he had read it over? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sign it? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Magistrate sign it in your presence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the original examination? - A. It is.(Reads)."I took the skins to Redmaine, now present; I went to him first, and asked him to buy them; he said he could not say what he could give for them, till he saw them; Redmaine paid six guineas in part; he said they might be worth 30l. or 40l.; I had also 10l. of him, four guineas, and other smaller sums; I found the skins in a lighter, I saw something white under the edge of the lighter; it was not the lighter employed to bring the goods, but an empty one; I told Redmaine I found them in the lighter."</p>

               <p>Q. Was this man charged with stealing other skins that were present at the office, or only the skins that were taken from the ship Uretta? - A. I understood it was the skins taken from that ship.</p>
               <p>Q.The other skins were skins taken from a gentleman in the Borough, and with which some other person was charged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not you understand the Uretta to be lying on the Surry side of the water? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sworn to give evidence against any body else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140084"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Rowe.) Q. You attended as a witness against the prisoner before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What skins might he be charged with stealing, before the Magistrate? - A. Beaver and otter skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charged with stealing skins from the Uretta? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at those skins? - A. These are new beaver skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they have been in the market that year? - A. I do not think they could, for they are exactly in the folds in which they came to us from abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bales of beaver that you received deficient? - A. Yes; we discovered, I believe, sixty or seventy skins, but there might be more, because I believe all our packages are not unpacked yet, but as far as I have examined the packages, there are sixty-seven beaver skins missing; they are worth about ten shillings a skin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How do you know there were so many missing? - A. By comparing the invoice with the quantity that I entered.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the invoice? - A.(Produces it.) It is a consignment to the merchants here.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the hand-writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it may or may not be a consignment from abroad for any thing you know? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that invoices are very frequently incorrect? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect when the prisoner was examined at the Police-office, that although he received frequent admonitious not to make a confession, yet the moment the confession was written, he signed it, without it being ever read to him? - A. No; I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was examined, were there any one of those skins there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore he could make no confession of these skins? - A.Certainly they were not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is that the invoice by which the goods are entered? - A. Yes; and the invoice by which we have paid the duties.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner charged with stealing any other skins than what were said to come from the ship Uretta? - A. No others.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there are such skins as these about the town? - A. Not in that state; there are certainly such skins about the town, but there were none came this year but that ship; the whole of last year's came into our possession also.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it is too much the case that goods of this sort are smuggled? - A. I have heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. They never go out of your possession in that state? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Saville.) Q. Are you servant to Mr. Waldock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These were brought by Redmaine's porter? - A. Yes; and Redmaine came the next day to agree for some other skins for one Mr. Fell; some of these beaver and otter skins were lying there, and he said they were remarkable fine skins.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found them in an empty lighter.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. - I am a watchman employed by a lighterman at Porter's-quay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time of the Uretta being discharged? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his being employed to bring the lighters to Porter's-quay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember having any skins given you in charge to take care of on board the lighters? - A. Yes; Bradshaw was with me, one watched the head, and the other the stern.</p>

               <p>Q. If there had been any skins untied or broke, or taken away, should you have observed the vacancy it would have occasioned? - A. No; I do not see how we could see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a tarpaulin over the property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment that they were delivered over to you, they remained perfectly safe, of course? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never came on board the lighter after the things were delivered to you to watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If any harm had taken place on board the lighter after that time, either you or Bradshaw must have known it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing of that sort did take place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>

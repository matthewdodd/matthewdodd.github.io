On the morning of 18th April the prisoner came into our house, and said he wanted a person named Thompson—we told him we had no such person there, and told him to go about his business—he went out, and I followed him—he walked up and down Cheapside once or twice—he then went into the house of Messrs. Boyd and Co., in Friday Street—he came out, and I followed him to the house of Devas and Co.; he stopped there about half an hour—when he came out, I gave him in charge of the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Nag's Head, Leather-lane. On the 10th of April, the prisoner and some others came to the bar, and had something—there was a dispute about the payment—I desired the prisoner to go, and I endeavoured to put him out—we had a scuffle, and while we were scuffling, I noticed that he <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> my pin out of my scarf—he denied it, and I gave him in charge—when we got a short distance from the house I saw him throw something, but I cannot tell what—it fell on the spot—after we had been to the station I searched on the spot, by the light of the policeman's lantern, but did not find anything—I went out the next morning—the police<lb></lb>man found the stem of the pin on the spot where I saw the prisoner throw something—I found the stone of the pin—that stone and the stem of the pin produced by the policeman make up the pin I lost—this is it.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is it worth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave half a sovereign for it when I bought it—I turned the prisoner out of the house, because it was just up on twelve o'clock—there had been a dispute about the payment for some gin, and I was going to turn him into the street for it—I said he had stolen my pin, and he and the other man with him were <hi rend="italic">mouchers</hi>, (that means persons coming for gin without paying for it)—I am head bar<lb></lb>man at the house—my name is on the lamp outside—the house belongs to Mr. Reed—I formerly lived at the Hog in Armour—there were no <hi rend="italic">niggers</hi> played there—we never had any gambling—we had no young persons come there, and their parents come for them—I never had a waiter there—I was waiter myself—there was nobody but me there—I never had a thief there, who Archer the policeman turned away, and reprimanded me for employing him—there was not a youth there who attended on the young persons who came to the house—the house was not frequented by a great number of youths</p>

               <p>and girls—Archer never turned any one out—when I left that house I do not know who it was parted with to—I was under Mr. Charles Yates—he of course was there—he sometimes lived in the house—it was not my house—I managed it—I did not take away a valuable clock, and put another in the place of it—a solicitor did not write to me to pay for the clock—I did not appraise in a number of pots belonging to other landlords, and the new pub<lb></lb>lican have to have pay for them—my name is on the lamp at the Nag's Head merely as a matter of attraction—it is not to attract the boys and girls who used to come to the Hog in Armour—I never saw any boys and girls come to dance at the Hog in Armour with their faces blackened—I never played a <hi rend="italic">nigger</hi> myself—I never had my face blacked—the prisoner was bailed—I do not know that he is partner with his father—I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock that night—I was up again a little after four—I am accustomed to take very early walks—I take a sleep in the afternoon—the policeman and I searched by the light of his lamp, and did not find any pin—there were about a thousand persons in Leather-lane as we were going to the station—I saw the prisoner throw something away—I will swear the pin did not fall from me—I missed it in the public-house—it had been in my scarf as pins generally are—there is no one else here who saw the prisoner throw any thing away—the policeman had got him in custody, and I we behind him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 248.) I took the prisoner—he denied having the pin—between four and five o'clock the next morning I found the gold part of the pin in the gutter, partly buried in mud—I saw the proseeutor find the stone of the pin within a foot of the spot where I found the stem of it—that was in the direct road from the prosecutor's house to where the pri<lb></lb>soner was taken to.</p>

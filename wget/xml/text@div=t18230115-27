            . I am near fifteen years old; I live in Bell-alley, Coleman street, and am a shoemaker. On the 6th of December, a little after five o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner close to the prosecutor's house, I saw him go and jump against the door, trying to break it open. I told him not to do it, he made no answer; I knew him before by having lived in the neighbourhood; the watch was not on. I told my father of it the same night, and Mr. Page next morning. I did not lay hold of him, because I knew he would strike me. I left him, but saw him go to the window and take a shutter down.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not call Stop thief - A. I did not know what to do. There was another boy with me, but there was two more boys with him. After taking the shutter down, he went to the window and tried to get the lead away to get in, and I told the boy who was with me to come away, or we should get into trouble. I did not call Stop thief! for it is a very dull place, as hardly anybody passes of a night. I told my father directly he came from work. I knew where the constable lived, but do not think he was at home, for there was no light in his room. I did not see the prisoner get into the house. I work with my father.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Crown-court, Moor-lane. I was with the last witness in Angel-alley; the prisoner called Findlater away. I did not hear what he said to him. I saw the prisoner run to the door to break it down, I persuaded him not to do it, but he would - there were two or three of them - Redwood was one. I saw the prisoner take the shutter down, then I and Findlater ran away - we did not raise an alarm. I told my father and mother of it that night, about ten o'clock; we had been taking a walk. I went to Page the constable, but he was not at home. I did not know where any other constable lived.</p>

            . I live in Moor-lane. I am out of employ. On the 6th of December, I saw Buckley run to the shutter, and take it down. I was standing at my door looking at him; he cut away the glass - there was nobody near to call to. I did not lay hold of him, because he could beat me and two or three together. I saw him get through the glass - he broke the box open, and threw the things out of the window. I could not see what they were - I was not near enough, but I believe they were clothes, I did not help him to take them away. I ran up stairs and told my master, whom I live with, and he went for an officer - he is not here; he got Page next morning. I did not tell him till next morning, for he was out till ten or eleven o'clock that night; and I was in bed when he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. When he threw the things out of the window, why not pick them up and take them home? - A. I should have got into trouble. I saw nobody pick them up. I saw him come out. He had two or three companions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You first moved the shutter, broke the window, and put the glass down the gully-hole, and I gave the clothes out of the window to you. I put them in the soot bag, and you got up the chimney and blew the candle out when your master came home. - Witness I was in bed when my master came home. I never had the shutter in my hand.</p>

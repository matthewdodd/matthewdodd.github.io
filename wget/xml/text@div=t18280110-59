I offered a reward, and my chain and seals were found the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You do not mean to say this man took them? A. No; he is the man I pursued; I saw nobody else in the market - there were people under the Piazza - I did not lose sight of him: I did not see him do any thing. I was about a yard and a half from him.</p>

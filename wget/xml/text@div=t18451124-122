                  </hi>. I am groom and carman to Joseph Brown, a statuary and marble-mason, in University-street, Tottenham-court-road. On the 3rd of Nov., about seven o'clock in the evening, I missed this marble statue of a cow from the entrance, close against the gallery door—I cannot exactly say when I had seen it safe—I had not seen it that day, and am not sure of hav<lb></lb>ing seen it the day before—it is Mr. Brown's property—it is heavy—one person could not carry it—it stood in a passage open to the public—it was found at Mr. Whistler's, in the Strand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Whistler, a pawnbroker in the Strand. On the 1st of Nov. I saw the prisoners there—I knew Davis before by the name of Harrison—they had this cow with them—Davis said he wished to pledge it, and he pledged it in the name of Harrison—I am sure he is the man—I did not know Cleary before—about a week after, Davis came again, and wished more on the cow—I gave him a sovereign—I did not see him again till he was in custody—the cow still remained in my master's pos<lb></lb>session.</p>

On the 14th of October, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, my servant brought me a note, directed to Mr. Hall, Howard-street, and said the person was waiting for an answer; suspecting something, I came down stairs and found nobody there; I missed my great coat, and silver a tankard, which was worth 5l., and my coat, 2l. I had seen them safe at half-past eleven o'clock, the night before; I have not seen them since. I gave information at the Police offices.</p>

            . I am Mr. Hall's servant. At half-past seven o'clock in the morning, the bell rang - I opened the door and found the prisoner there; I never saw him before. I saw him at Bow-street on the Monday following, and knew him immediately, and pointed him out from another man. When I opened the door, he asked me if Mr. Hall was at home, I said he was; he told me to give him a letter, as the gentleman was going out of town; I took the letter up, leaving the prisoner on the mat in the passage, and the door shut. When I came down, I found it still shut and the prisoner gone; I missed the tankard, which I had seen at eleven o'clock the night before.</p>

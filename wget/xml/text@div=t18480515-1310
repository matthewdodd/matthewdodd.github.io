                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 290.) On 21st March, about one o'clock in the morning, I was in the Holloway-road, near the Cock Tavern—there was a crowd of between twenty and thirty persons, singing hallooing, and swearing—I went up to them, and said, "I hope you good gentleman will go home peaceably and quietly"—they said, "You b—r, what do you mean?"—the prisoner was amongst them—after saying that, they knocked me down—I got up—they knocked me down again with their fists four times—I was cut over the eye, and kicked severely in the body—I have felt it ever since—I believe I got this wound over the eye with a fist—I was not struck with anything beside the fist then—I was afterwards struck with a staff across the forehead; I cannot say who by—it did not cut the skin—the men went away—I followed them down the lane leading to Holloway-road—they turned back, and said, "You b—r, turn back, or we will murder you"—they then turned, and came back to Holloway-road—I followed them—two of my brother officers came up—we went before the men, stopped them, and took two of them into custody—they then began knocking us about and throwing stones—the prisoner was still with them—I saw him throw several stones—I do not know that any stone thrown by him struck me—a stone struck me and cut my forehead—the men were fighting with the other officers, and trying to rescue a prisoner that they had—I saw the officer knocked down—several of the men were beating, kicking, and jumping on them—I went up to assist them, and then received this stone on my head, and a blow with a truncheon from one of the crowd, which knocked me down insensible—I was under the doctor's hands for a fortnight in consequence.</p>

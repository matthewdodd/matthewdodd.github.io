               <p>The prisoner then made the following defence, most of which was written: - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, -Being deprived by law of the benefit of the eloquence and arguments of Counsel on my behalf, I am compelled (and I am very unfit,) to address a few words for your consideration. I am aware you will consider the awful situation in which I am placed, and under such consideration I feel confident of your favourable indulgence - that you will excuse my timidity in addressing you, rather than leaving the case against me as it now stands, to your Lordship's unbiassed judgment. Through a mercantile life of twenty years, during a part, at least, of which, I have been perhaps useful in my generation, though it has been sadly checquered by misfortune, I have never until now been criminally charged before a Magistrate, nor until now did I ever open my lips in a public audience, however small. Upon the evidence produced against me, I shall make no comments, leaving that to one who is able and competent to the purpose, and who will give me the benefit of any decrepancy, should any appear there - in: I am charged with having paid, or uttered, a forged cheque, knowing it to be forged, and should you consider the evidence sufficient, and the instrument a forgery, I am afraid I shall have little left to do but to entreat, under circumstances, your favourable recommendation, and, viewing the amount and circumstances of the case, I hope such recommendation may not be denied me; but, Gentlemen, there is a point, of which, I trust, you will fully satisfy yourselves before you return a verdict of guilty, viz. That I knew and considered the instrument to be a forgery at the time I paid it away - for I conceive, that unless you are satisfied that I considered it a forgery at that time, I could not have paid it with a guilty knowledge; and, Gentlemen, I most positively aver, that taking the case as proved against me, as far as regards the payment of the order, that I cannot even now bring my mind to the conviction that I have committed a forgery. Upon whom have I forged? On no person living. Whose name have I used for the purpose of ob taining money? No one's; that I may have spoken falsehoods, and made false representations, may be true, but that I have committed a forgery, in the common acceptation of the words, is not the case; it possibly may, by law and precedent, be considered otherwise, but what is true in fact, law and precedent ought not to make wrong - there are precedents for burning women for the supposed crime of witchcraft, and men as wizards, and precedents for the putting to death one sect of the professors of the all-merciful religion of Christ by another sect, because they were at variance in some doctrinal point, or in their modes of worship, but will any of you say such precedents ought to be followed? No, not one; Gentlemen, the severity of the law of forgery seems to have aimed at the protection of great mercantile bodies, or individuals, upon whose firms or names (as third parties not present, to protect themselves,) credit or property was obtained - a person pays a forged Bank of England note, the credit of property given in exchange is not given upon the credit of the person paying it, it is given upon the faith of the security given them by the note on a Company well known - so is the case as to small Companies, or individuals; the tradesman knows the character and responsibility of another tradesman, and though he may not know, or be sufficiently acquainted with his handwriting, so as to detect an imitation, yet, from his knowledge of the individual, he takes the order, or bill of exchange, upon such knowledge, and the credit is given on the supposed security of a known individual; how different is the case before you - I shall take the case as in some measure proved by the witnesses; they say I called upon them, and inquired for so and so, and presenting an order, purporting to be one for money, drawn by a person they had never heard even a whisper of before, in fact, it is sworn no such person does exist. Upon whose credit then do they take it? Upon the credit of a non-entity; certainly not, for they could attach no credit, or conceive they had any security, by holding the order of an individual, who, if in existence, might not be worth a straw - No, Gentlemen, the credit they gave, or property they parted with, must have been so given or parted with upon the representations of the party offering it, and not upon any supposed security of holding an order of a person, of whom they knew nothing, therefore the crime is in the appearance of the instrument offered. Such being the view of the case, and, I conceive, is the common-sense view, will place me out of the reach of the forgery, and especially if you believe that a party may pay away such an instrument without knowing that law constituted it a forgery - Such, Gentlemen, will, I trust, be your view of the case, but should you think otherwise, let me humbly entreat you to weigh the case as it affects the interest and peace of the community, and, taken in every point of view, you must agree that it is a comparatively slight offence; and here I dare not trust my feelings, but, Gentlemen, is the offence to be compared in magnitude of moral guilt, with the panderer who seduces from the parental roof perhaps your only child, and after having satisfied his propensities, leaves the poor innocent to seek her bread by wretched prostitution? compare it to the profligate seducer, though only punishable in his pocket, who enters your house as your friend and confidant, and under that specious cover seduces from your arms and affections the wife of your bosom, who had been the joy of your younger, and who you had looked forward to he the solace of your declining years, and leaving the children upon whom you doat worse than motherless. As against the mercantile interests of the country, the name of an individual, or firm, utterly unknown, or not in existence, could never be circulated by a person unknown to others, to an extent to affect the well-being of the smallest trading interests - next view it as it affects the peace of the country, and here, from the feelings I have before to day witnessed, and the expressions I have heard, I am certain the humane Judge, before whom I appear, will agree with me that it is comparatively slight; compare it with the ruthless highwayman, who, on the pain of your life, robs you of all your person carries, or, perhaps to secure his own escape, leaves his bleeding victim a wretched spectacle of his barbarity; compare it, I say, with the case of the burglar, who, in the dark and silent watches of the night, breaks open your fancied castle of security, and, perhaps binding the trembling inmates hand and foot, confines them to a dark dungeon, there(but for the interposing hand of Providence,) to starve or contract disease, which increases, as life is protracted, or, if resistance is offered, with deadly weapons maims for life, or sends<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150064"></xptr>his hapless victims to the judgment seat of his Creator; compare the charge against me with those, my case is a fly-bite in guilt - if, when proved to its fullest extent, what is it? a person, who almost with his own concurrence, for there certainly does appear a great want of discretion, if not blameable negligence, in a person taking from an entire stranger, at first view, an order for money, (it is very different to a Bank note,) of the quality of which order he knows nothing - I say, taking it in its fullest extent, the peace of society is not broken in upon, the peace of mind of the person taking it is uninjured, his bodily health, powers, and existence are not endangered, and he loses, What does he lose? (far too much, certainly,) but only what any citizen could replace in a week, or what many tradesmen could replace by his profits in a day, if not in a few hours; I have stated I had no guilty knowledge of the offence being a forgery, and nine out of ten persons in the common walks of life would take the same view. I have compared it with other crimes, some of which are only punishable by remuneration from the purse, or confinement in a debtor's gaol, and some with life, all of which, I think, you will agree with me are greater crimes; if I have been prolix, or intruded upon your valuable time, let the situation in which I am placed plead my apology - consider my feelings - consider the anxiety for my near and dear relations - consider that your verdict (but for the interposition of Sovereign mercy,) will place me in the hands of the public executioner. I implore you to weigh well my case - to consider mercy as one of the attributes of Heaven, and to allow the consideration of the feelings of humanity to turn the balance in my favour; and, with the fullest conviction of the humanity of my Judge, I place my future life at your disposal.</p>

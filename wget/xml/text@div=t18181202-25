On the 19th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, I was writing at the desk in the counting-house, the shopman was serving. I thought the prisoner came in a curious kind of way, he appeared very careless, and, as I thought intoxicated. He said,</p>
               <p>"Will you let me have two pounds of cheese, and one pound of bacon." I came into the shop, by that time my man had cut him two pounds of cheese, he threw down a 1 l. note; I took it up, and immediately knew it to be forged, and asked his name, he said</p>
               <p>"Walker." I asked his master's name, he said it was Matthews, who lived at 35, Sutton-street. I told him I thought it was not a good note, and I could not give him change, and asked if he knew where he got it; he said of his master; I said I would go with him to his master. I wrote his name and his master's name and address upon the note - (looks at one.) - This is it. He said he would go with me. We went out immediately. I kept the note in my hand. We went to 35, Sutton-street. He wished me to walk first; I would not, but said I would walk behind. As we went along I communicated my suspicions to a watchman who stood in the street. I still kept the prisoner in sight; he was walking on before. When we got to 35, Sutton-street, he knocked at the door, a little girl opened it, he went in first, I followed; he went up to Mr. Matthews and spoke to him. I could not hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Matthews say anything to him - A. Nothing that I could hear. He saw me behind the prisoner, turned round, and asked my business. I asked if he knew that young man; he said he did. I asked if the man's name was Walker? He said No, it was

I produced the note, and said I believed it was forged, and I would not give change for it, but if Matthews sent him for the goods, I would send them home, I told him that the prisoner said he took the note of his master. The prisoner heard all that passed. Matthews said, you had better go to his present master. I told the prisoner it was great impudence to bring me into a strange house, where he did not live. I turned round, saying</p>
               <p>"It is of no use stopping here," when Matthews's daughter called out</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! he has got a knife, and is going to stab you." I turned round, and seized him by the the right hand, his left was then under his apron; we were looking for the knife, and he struck me a violent blow on my head. The girl said she saw the knife glitter in his hand. I got behind him, threw him on the stairs, and said I would not leave him till I got the knife. The constables came in at that time. I told them what had happened. They were going to search him. He fought desperately, but was secured at last. Bell found the knife in his breeches. It was a clasp knife, open.</p>

Hutchinson produced a bank note, which I returned to him, and said that he was not my servant, but he was articled to Mr. Knight, of Gee-street, and he should go there, and not come to me.

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 19th of November I was on duty in St. John-street, about a quarter past eight o'clock. Mr. Hutchinson came by with the prisoner. Hutchinson held his hand out, and said to me,</p>
               <p>"I have got a smasher," which means a passer of bad money. I and Warner followed him to No. 35, Sutton-street. He and the prisoner went in. We staid rather behind, and listened at the parlour window, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020017"></xptr>street door. I heard a faint scream, and something about stabbing, but could not tell what it was. We knocked at the door, were let in, and found Hutchinson standing in the passage, very much agitated, with the prisoner. We began to search the prisoner; they held his hands. I found the knife in the left thigh of his breeches, inside; it was open. We were going to secure his hands. He started back, and struck me a violent blow in the face. I collared him. He began kicking, striking, and beating me, and made a great resistance, and said, no b - y watchman should ever take him. We secured and took him to the watch-house. Immediately as we got out, we were assailed by a mob, who came out of a public-house opposite, and began to kick and strike us, to rescue him. He was resisting at the time himself. After a resistance of an hour and a half, we at last got him to the watch-house. Warner was present all the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not cut me with a cutlass, which made me strike you - A. No. I broke a stick about him in the street, as he resisted very much.</p>
               <p>- WARNER. I have heard Bell give his evidence. It is very correct. He did not use any violence to him until the attempt was made to rescue him. The prisoner hit him first. This was in the street.</p>

            . My husband keeps a chandler's shop, in Clerkenwell. On the 16th of November the prisoner bought a quartern loaf and some cheese, at our shop, and paid a 1 l. note. I asked him who he took it of? He said he had just took it of his employer. I gave him a pen and ink, and desired him to put the name on it, which he did in my presence. He wrote William - , but I could not see the other name. I gave him change, and gave the note to my husband - (looks at one.) - This is it.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and live in St. John-street. The prisoner came to my shop about the 6th of November, and had some medicine, which came to a shilling. He tendered me a 1 l. note. I asked who he took it of? He said of Mr. Woolmer, Sutton-street. I suspected it, and refused to give him change, and said unless Woolmer said he had given him the note, I should detain it, and sent my servant with the prisoner to Woolmer's, who I knew. He returned without the prisoner. He never came for the note - (looks at one.) - This is it. I marked it before I parted with it.</p>

             re-examined. (Looking at the notes.) I know Tabor's hand-writing well. I have been acquainted with it several years. I have often seen him write, and can take upon myself to say, on my belief, it is not his hand-writing; it is something like it; but it is not his. That uttered to Todd has Clough's name to it. I have known his writing several years. I have often seen him write and sign notes, and can judge well of it. I have not the least doubt of its not being his writing. That uttered to Hill and Mrs. Todd are signed A. Consett. I have frequently seen him write, and have often seen notes signed by him. It is not his hand-writing. Here is another, signed Pearson; he has been a long time a signing clerk in the Bank. I know his writing well. It is not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any clerk in the Bank authorized to sign notes on such paper as this - A. I know the Bank paper; they never use such paper as this. It has the water-mark put in afterwards. The Bank notes have the water-mark in the regular manufacture of the paper. The clerks have no authority to sign anything but genuine paper.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have there not been instances where the inspectors<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020018"></xptr>of the Bank have differed in opinion respecting good or bad notes - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

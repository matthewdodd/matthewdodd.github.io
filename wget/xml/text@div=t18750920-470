On 25th August, a little after 5 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty on the road leading to Acton from Willesden—the London and North Western Railway runs under a bridge, which crosses the road there—I saw the prisoner and three other young men there—I was about 15 yards from them—there was a passenger train going by—I saw the prisoner stoop down and pick up a stone from the side of the footway and throw it at the train that was passing, whether it hit or not I can't say—I immediately took the prisoner into custody—he said "I threw the stone over, but I did not intend to do any harm"—he was taken to the station, and I went off to the station-master—the other young men were waiting outside the station; I only took the one I saw throw the stone—the stone was about the size of an egg—I only saw him throw one.</p>

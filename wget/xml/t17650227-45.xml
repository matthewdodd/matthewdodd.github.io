            . I am servant to Mr. Liquorish; the prisoner came into our house yesterday was a fortnight, for a halfpennyworth of gin, and asked to go backwards into the yard; my mistress ordered me to show her the way: I did: after that she wanted to go out at the back door; I said she could not, for that was fastened up; then she came and went out at the fore-door. I perceived a bundle under her arm; I asked my mistress if she saw a bundle when the prisoner came in; my mistress said, No, she did not: I I went out and took hold of the prisoner, about two doors from our house, and asked what she had got under her cloak; she said she had got nothing: I desired her to let me see; she said I should not: I took and turned her cloak aside, and saw the kettle: I took her back with it; (produced in court.) this is my master's property; it was taken from off a little bench in the backyard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>

               <p>She says it was a fortnight ago, and it was three weeks ago yesterday, when I was taken up. I found the kettle at the door.</p>

             was standing with several of them at the corner of an alley further on with another woman, and she took hold of my arm, she was on the right side of the Strand as I was going up, and she asked me to have a glass of wine, or something of that sort; I refused giving her the wine, and she still kept hold of my arm till we got to the corner of a passage when I stopped with her; we had not stopped above a minute or two, but I put my hand into my pocket and missed my watch; I was not sensible when she took it; I asked her if she had got it; she said, she had not got it and laughed, and just as I missed it I turned round, and the other women that were with her was gone; at the time I first met her there were two other women with her; but she stayed with me till the watchman came up voluntarily; when he came up I gave her in charge to the watchman; she was taken to the watch-house and searched and nothing found on her; the other two women was not near me, they were within a yard or two, I don't think they were near enough to touch me; she had got hold of my right arm and I never let her quit my hold till I charged her with the watch. I was sent for to the public office in Lemon-street; these other two women were in custody and the watch was found on them; I saw the watch at the office; I advertised the watch next morning with a reward; but I found it was taken immediately. I went on the 12th, they were taken on the 11th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Kirkpatrick I believe these ladies were apprehended in the neighbourhood of East Smithfield; that is a considerable distance from the Strand? - It may be, I don't know where it is, I am a stranger in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Very likely then your curiosity might lead you to converse with more ladies then one; - I believe there was another spoke to me somewhere in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem a good humoured pleasant man, and no doubt inclined to indulge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150135"></xptr>the ladies as far as in your power; did you stop any length of time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Kirkpatrick where had you been spending your evening? - In Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Drank a little of course? - Yes, a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in Maiden-lane? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Kirkpatrick how lately before you came into the Strand did you know you had your watch? - I had had my watch when I was in Covent garden.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at the coffee house that evening? - I had been at the Carpenter's-arms in the middle of the Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. This is one of the early houses; I observed that the expression you used when this was fresh in your memory was, that you verily believed that you had the watch when you went out of that coffee house? - If you will give me leave to explain it, I think it necessary. Some gentlemen had gone to that house and had had a little supper and drank some liquor there; one of them there pulled out my watch; he said, I think you are rather poorly, we will try how your pulse beats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe then I need not feel how your pulse beats any further.</p>

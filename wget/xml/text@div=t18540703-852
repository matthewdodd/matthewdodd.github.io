                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich, and am collector of rents on the estate upon which Lyme Cottage is situated—it was untenanted on 9th June—I was there on Thursday June 6th, and saw the copper and the lead quite safe; they were fixed to the premises—on Friday June 9th, about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going there, and when I was within a few yards of the cottage, I saw the two prisoners coming through a gap in the hedge with the copper (the house stands about fifty yards from the road); the gap in the hedge is about two yards from the garden wall, which is about four feet high at the back, and ten feet at the front—a person after getting through the gap, could not get to the house without getting over the back garden wall—I knew the copper when I saw it, but I said nothing to the prisoners, but opened the garden gate, run down to the bath house, and found the window open, and the front door forced open—it is a' brick building in the garden—I had the keys with me—I then went after the prisoners, and found them on the turnpike road carrying the copper—I asked them where they got it; Cope said they found it in the <hi rend="italic">hollow</hi>, where they had gone to gather elder blossoms—they both said that—I told them it had been stolen from premises which I had charge of—they said that I knew them both, and I could not suppose that they would steal the copper—they are both tenants on the estate—one rents a piece of ground, and the other a cottage and garden—they said that rather than get into trouble, they would take the copper back to where they found it; and in order to gain time for a policeman to come, I told them to take it back to where they found it, which they did—they took it through the gap in the hedge. I found the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 76). I received information, went to where: Mr. Smith was standing, and took the prisoners, at Cope's house, which is close to the spot—I told them the charge—Cope said it was very hard that a person could not do as they liked with what they found; and Blackwell said, "I think so too"—I found this lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at Millard's stop—I allowed him to bring it to the police court the next day—I found a hammer; chisel, and saw, in the waste piece of ground—Millard identified them—they were close to where the copper had been carried—I examined the premises, and found traces of where the copper had been taken over the wall, at the back of the bath house.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a marine store shop, at No, 124, Lower-street, Woolwich-road. About half past 1 o'clock, on 9th June, Cope brought these pieces of lead into my shop, and I bought them of him—Blackwell was not present—this saw is not mine, but the hammer and chisel are—I had not change to pay for the lead, and went to a public house opposite—Cope accompanied me, and so did Blackwell, whom we found at my door—I got change, and paid Cope 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in Blackwells presence—Cope called for a pint of porter, and I drank some of it, and so did Blackwell—I then had a conversation with Cope, but I do not think Blackweil heard it—I gave 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the lead, and there was an odd pound, which I did not pay for—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the corresponding piece of lead, which was left on the wall.</p>

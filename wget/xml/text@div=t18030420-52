             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen's-square. On Thursday the 24th March last, at nine o'clock, I met the prisoner with this coat under Mr. Johnson's house, going from Mr. Johnson's towards his own in Duck-lane; I suspected him, and asked him how he came by the coat; he said he bought it the day before of a Jew, and had given eight shillings for it; I felt the pockets, and asked him if there was any thing in them; he said no; I then took the gloves out, and put him into Tothill-fields bridewell; next day I heard that Mr. Johnson had lost the coat; I went to him, and he came and swore to the coat.(The coat produced and identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home, and bought the coat of a Jew, and gave eight shillings for it; going along the officer stopped me, and took me into custody, though I told him I had bought it.</p>

I am the wife of George Rooke, who keeps the India Arms public-house, at Rotherhithe—about 20 minutes past 5 on the evening of 22d February, the prisoner came for a glass of ale—I served him, and he gave me a bad shilling—I told him it was bad, and he said he did not know it—I went to the door, called my husband, gave the shilling to him, and he marked it across the head—I did not lose sight of it—he gave the prisoner in charge with the shilling—the prisoner offered to pay me with a good sixpence, but I did not take it—this is the shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the King and Queen public-house—on 27th February, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came for some refreshment—he put a shilling on the counter—I saw it was bad, and said, "This is very soft, have you not got a better one? have you got any more in your pocket?"—he said, "Oh, is it a bad one?" and reached forward to take it off the counter, but I took it up, bit it, and doubled it with my teeth—my house is about a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Rooke's—about three-quarters of an hour afterwards, a constable brought him to my door—I walked round the counter to the door and said in his hearing that he was the same man who had come into my house about 5 o'clock—I let the man go after he gave me the shilling, and two of my cus<lb></lb>tomers who heard the conversation, gave information to the police, and they came for a description of him—the bad shilling the prisoner gave me was lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had half-a-crown on the previous night, and got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in change, and went the next day to Mr. Rooke's house. I did not know it was bad. When the landlord of the King and Queen came before the Magistrate, the clerk told me to put my cap on. I did so, and he said, "He is a different sort of man." The Magistrate then said, "If you could swear to him when he was brought to the door, you can now;" and he said, "Well, I think he is the man;" and I was committed on that evidence. I could easily have got out of Mrs. Rooke's bar if I had liked; any guilty man would have got away, but I had my conscience clear. I was not in the King and Queen public-house at all.</p>

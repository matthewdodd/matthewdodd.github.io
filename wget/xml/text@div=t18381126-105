                  </hi>. I live at the Cannon public-house, Brentford. On Tuesday evening, the 27th of November, the prisoner Miles came to the bar and asked for change for a half-crown, which I refused-immediately after she went out, Hart came for a glass of half-and-half, and gave me a half-crown—I gave him four sixpences and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went out, and another female came in and asked for half-a-pint of beer—she put down a bad shil<lb></lb>ling—I said it was bad—she took it up and went out—I then looked in the till, where I had no more silver but the half-crown which I took of Hart, and found it was bad—I had apologized to him for giving him four sixpences, as I had no other silver there at all—I sent to the police-office and described the two prisoners, and the officer very soon afterwards took them.</p>

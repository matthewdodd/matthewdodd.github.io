               <p>Q. Are you in the General Post office? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Was he the only sorter for this bag? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it his business to attend to the bag from Watford to London? - It was not. His business was to open bags and deliver them out; it was his duty, with eight or nine more gentlemen, to sort letters that were to go into the country; I don't mean to say it exactly belonged to the prisoner at the bar to sort these letters that came from Watford, but a letter which arrived from the country post on the morning of the 11th, and which was to go into the country on the evening of the same day, went through his hands in common, with eight others.</p>

What is the first thing that is done with them? - They are taken out of the bag and taken to be stamped, and then given to the sorters; then those that are to be delivered in London are separated from those that are not to be delivered in London.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the business of the prisoner, on the morning of the 12th? - To open the bags and sort the country letters for their destination in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think were employed in doing the same thing? - About nine or ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him employed in that way that morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular in his conduct? - I observed him take a letter and put it in his pocket, and from there he went out of the back door with it; and I immediately went and told Mr. Raymond of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he take the letter out of the bag? - No; from where he was sorting. Mr. Raymond went out, in about five minutes after I went out myself; I went up stairs and found Mr. Raymond at the privy door; Mr. Raymond said, it will not be necessary for both of us to stop here; he went further on, and I stopped there, and I see the prisoner come out, he went down the first landing from the privy; there are holes from the privy; I see him read a piece of paper; at that time Mr. Raymond had come up from the further end of the gallery to me, Mr. Raymond pushed past, and went down and followed him into the yard; when the prisoner got about the middle of the yard, I see the prisoner tear the paper and throw it way; I picked up them papers, me and Mr. Raymond did, and took them to Mr. Stowe and Mr. Slater.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation on the paper you picked up? - The first piece I picked up had eighty pounds on it in figures.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - In the morning, about eight o'clock, soon after the mail arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. The stair case is a dark place, up three pair of stairs? - Yes, it is. I went out a second time and found some more in the yard, which corresponded.</p>
               <p>Q. And you see Mr. Raymond pick up papers? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Mr. Raymond deliver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160128"></xptr>the papers you picked up, to Mr. Howe and Mr. Slater? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick up these papers which you delivered to Mr. How and Mr. Slater in the place where you had seen the prisoner throw away pieces of paper? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick up all that you found? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any stamp on any part of what you picked up? - Not on any one I picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you see them put together? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards search the stair case? - Yes, we did; we took a candle out of the kitchen, Mr. Raymond and me, and in three or four of the bottom stairs we found two or three bits.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these two or three bits assist in making up what was previously found between you and Mr. Raymond? - It did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I understand you to say, this young man was employed to open bags? - Yes; and when there were no bags to open, to sort country letters.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, this morning what was he employed in; did he receive bags or what? - He received them and opened them.</p>
               <p>Q. And then delivered over these bags to other persons to sort them? - No; there is a messenger that takes them from him to the sorters.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you then to say, that he received bags and opened them, and then they were delivered to a messenger who delivered them to other sorters to sort them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the persons that were that morning the sorters of the letters? - I cannot mention all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that morning he was a sorter of letters? - Yes, after he had opened bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the young man that morning after this happened, was employed in sorting of letters? - Not after this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. This young man you observed him tearing a piece of paper in the yard? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dispute with him before that? - We had a little dispute with him about a fortnight before, but there was not above six words passed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been on good terms since that? - O yes, we did not speak together for about a day, but not longer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge any body else with this offence? - Mr. Gage I did.</p>
               <p>Court. What with taking this very letter? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. On your oath, did not you charge Mr. Gage, and was not Mr. Gage searched, and was it not in consequence of nothing being found on Mr. Gage that the charge was made against the prisoner at the bar? - It was a long while after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge Mr. Gage with having taken a letter out of the very case, and was it not after Mr. Gage was searched, and no letter found, that you made your charge against the prisoner at the bar? - It was a fortnight after that I saw Mr. Gage take a letter.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you do it on that same morning on which you charged the prisoner Morgan? - No, it was a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Did not you charge Mr. Gage with having taken this letter or bill? - I never charged Mr. Gage with this letter or bill. I charged Mr. Gage with having taken a letter out of the box of the eighth division; it was above a fortnight after this.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was this letter or no, you did charge him with taking a letter? - I said, to the best of my knowledge, I see him take a letter.</p>


               <p>Q. Did not you apologize before the superiors of that Office, and beg Mr. Gage's pardon, for having so charged him? - I wrote two apologies and sent them to Mr. Gage, and told him that he might make it as public as he thought proper. To the best of my recollection, I see Mr. Gage take a letter, and put it into his pocket, about half an hour after. I went and told the president what I had seen. The reason that I did not go before, I thought that perhaps he might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160129"></xptr>suspect me, and hide it; and the president called him into their room, and examined Mr. Gage, and found no letter on him. Mr. Gage required an apology to be made, and I wrote to him an apology, and sent it to him, saying in it, that he might make it as public as he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state, that except that one day, you had no coolness or quarrel with the prisoner? - I do; which was, that I said I would kick him when he went out of the office; and he went and told Mr. Blagrave of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The first bit of paper you picked up had eighty pounds on it; had it any thing else? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver that to your superiors? - I did, along with the rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This transaction, with respect to Mr. Gage, was a fortnight after this man was in custody? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all connected with this subject? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to this man, had you communicated your suspicions to Mr. Raymond before you went out to watch him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you never made any apology to the prisoner, though you did to Mr. Gage? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at the time you stated Mr. Gage to have taken a letter, did you believe it or was it a false charge? - I did believe it; I was almost certain, but there was none found on him.</p>
               <p>-RAYMOND sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Coulston communicate something to you with respect to the prisoner at the bar? - He did. I went out of the office supposing he was gone to the privy. I found the door shut. When I was standing there, Mr. Coulston came up. I then left my situation; and let Mr. Coulston stand there for some little while. When I returned back, I asked him who came out of the privy? he told me, that he saw the prisoner go down stairs, and on the second pair of stairs, take a paper out of his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come in sight of the prisoner at the bottom of the stairs? - Yes, going from the privy into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see him do? - I see him tear some paper and throw it down. He walked along the yard towards the office door, tearing paper, and throwing it away which I immediately picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you pick up that second paper in such a manner as to be sure it was what he had thrown away? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that constitute a part of what you afterwards delivered to Mr. Stowe and Mrs. Slater? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick up in this manner that which you are sure came out of his hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Coulston pick up paper? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick up other paper on your other search? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver it to Messrs. Slater and Stowe? - Mr. Coulston did, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver all that you picked up under these circumstances? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver any thing but what was picked up? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it pasted on paper? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing strike you before it was pasted on paper? - A one shilling stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the fragments that were picked up by you and Coulston? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt that they were all thrown away by the prisoner after he came from the privy? - I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Them papers were thrown away in different parts of the yard? - The yard had just been swept; there was no other paper in the yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160130"></xptr>Q. They had been thrown in different parts of the yard? - They had.</p>
               <p>Q. A quantity of paper did there appear to be? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces do you think there may be in all, two or three hundred pieces? - No; about a dozen, more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to describe as if he was throwing away for some distance from the privy to the office door? - The last he threw away I picked up as soon as they came out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pick up the first? - I did part of the first.</p>

               <p>Thomas Hill, Esq; I know nothing of the prisoners. I lost a gelding out of a meadow on the 27th of September last; on the Sunday after, I had a messenger from London which described the horse to me, by which I knew him to be the horse I had lost. I sent my servant to Mr. Green's at Bethnal-Green, who knew him to be my horse, and he was delivered by Mr. Green, and is now in my custody.</p>

             rode up to my door at Bethnal-Green, I knew him before, he had lived servant on the Green, within a hundred yards of me, about two years ago; he knowing I dealt in horses, he brought this horse to me to buy: said he, I am going to the fair; What fair, said I? - To Smithfield, to sell him; said I, I'll buy him of you, and give you as much as any body. How long have you had him? said he, Six months. I said, What will you have for him ? he said, What is he worth. I said, I must not be buyer and seller too. He asked ten pounds for him. I said that was too much. Then he said, Six pounds ten shillings. I bid him four Guineas. He said, I must give four pounds ten shillings. He got off and put him in my stable, and came in and drank a dish of tea. I agreed to give him the money. I mistrusted he was not honestly come by. I gave him half a crown earnest; and said, If he appears to be your own property, I'll give you the rest of the money. Have you any body to vouch for you? he said, There is a man at the Weavers-Arms that will vouch him. I went with him there, there was the other prisoner, his brother, but he then went by another name; that man said it is

I said to a young man, Do you go there, and see if that is true: when he found I was for knowing more particularly, he said, Either give me the horse or the money. Then I said, He should not go. I charged an officer with him, and then asked him to tell the truth; then he said, Indeed Mr. Green, I did steal him out of Aylsbury Fields. Then I sent a letter to the Church-warden at Aylsbury, and by that means Mr Hill heard of him. Then I sent a young man on the Saturday, and Mr Hill sent his servant up, who knew the horse to be his master's property.</p>

            . On the 12th of April I had Occasion to go out, and left this Money lock'd up safe, in a Drawer in my Chamber. I returned in about 5 or 6 Hours, and heard the Prisoner, who was my Servant, unlock my Chamber Door: I immediately ran up Stairs, and found the Door fast, with the Key in the Inside. We have an empty House backwards, and imagining he might make his Escape that Way, I took my other Apprentice with me to search; but as soon as I had got down Stairs I heard my Chamber Door open, and somebody run up Stairs into the Garret. I ran up into the Garret likewise, and took the Prisoner from under the Bed. When I had taken him, I went into my Chamber, and found my Drawer broke open, but the Money was not taken away.</p>
               <p>- Painter. I am a Constable, and was sent for to take Charge of the Prisoner. I asked him how he came to use his Master so, and he said he did design to take the money; that some People were waiting for it, and it was to be spent at the White-Conduit-House, in White-Conduit Fields. He owned he broke open the Drawer with this Knife, which we found on the Bed, according to his Directions, and said he put the Money into his Pocket, but hearing his Master come up, he laid it in the Place from whence he took it.</p>
               <p>- Long. I was present when the Prisoner was examined; and heard him own this to be the Knife with which he broke the Drawers; he said, he did take the Money and put it into his Pocket, but hearing his Master come up Stairs, he put it into the Drawer again.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner having nothing to offer in his Defence, the Jury found him <rs id="t17410701-7-verdict33" type="verdictDescription">

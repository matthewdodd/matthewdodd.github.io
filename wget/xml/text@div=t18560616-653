                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at Stratford. I let lodgings to the prisoner on 13th May—she was with me for three weeks, until she was taken into custody—about three hours before she went away, I saw there were some feathers taken out of the bed—I saw that it looked much thinner and flatter than when she first came to me, and because the thread with which it was sewn was new in one part, while that with which the rest was sewn was soiled—the blanket was marked in the corner.</p>

               <p>Clapham. On Sunday evening, 9th Jan., at half-past eight o'clock, I was going home, I met the prisoners—they asked me to give them some gin—I gave them a shilling—they went and had some—I went into the stable, came out, and one of them gave me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one of them kissed me, and the other stroked me dewn the thigh—I went away about twenty yards—I then missed a sovereign, a half-sovereign, three shillings and sixpence, which had been loose is my pocket, and safe two minutes before—I went back, and asked the prisoners for it; they would not give it me, and I sent a boy for a policeman—they went on the Common—I went after them—a young man struck me on the side and knocked me on the knees and eldows—I had not seen the prisoners before—I am sure they are the persons.</p>

On 9th Jan., about ten minutes past nine o'clock, a boy gave me information—I went and found the prisoners—I asked Roberts what she had got under her shawl—she said only four penny pieces—I said, "Let me sec"—I found a half-sovereign in her hand—I said, "How do you account for this?"—she' said nothing—I search her, and found a sovereign—Newman came to the station—Dawson was brought up—Newman said she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him, and Roberts stroked him down the thigh—Roberts had her head cut—I asked the prisoners if Newman was the party who struck the blow—they said "No"—they after<lb></lb>wards said he was—he told me the sovereign and helf-sovereign had Queen's heads on them, which they have.</p>

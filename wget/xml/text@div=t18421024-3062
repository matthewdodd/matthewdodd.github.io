                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the Navy, and reside in Melton<lb></lb>terrace, Southwark-bridge-road—I attended the deceased several times during his life—I did so about six years ago, and have attended the family many years—on Saturday, the 17th of September, about ten o'clock, I was called in—he was then dead—he had been dead, I think, about au hour—a spot on the floor was pointed out to me—there were <hi rend="italic">faces</hi> and a good deal of mucus on it, by the side of the bed—he was on the bed when I first saw him—(I had attended the prisoner in her confinement, between two and three months ago, I am not quite sure)—I opened the body of the deceased on the Monday—the cavity of the thorax was quite healthy, and all the viscera—the stomach was opened, and a portion of white powder was seen at the bottom of it, about two inches in length, and an inch in breadth, and a good deal of fluid—the intestines were all empty—the kidneys were larger than they should be—all the rest of the viscera were healthy—we took home the contents of the stomach, and examined it by analysis—I examined it by different tests—it turned out to be arsenic—I should suppose, there must have been about twenty grains of white oxide, commonly called arseni<lb></lb>ous acid—it is generally called white arsenic—if you purchase it in the shops it is called arsenic—I should say the deceased must have suffered very much indeed, they described him to be in a fit when they called me—I should think, from the appearances, the poison must have been taken into the stomach about six or seven hours—I consider twelve hours to be the extent of time within which it must have been administered—I think he would have died in less than that; but I have given the extent—I found some castor-oil in the stomach—I attribute the death of the deceased to the arsenic—I had said to the prisoner that I thought it would be proper to have him opened, they had better send for the beadle; and she express<lb></lb>ed a wish to have him opened—she said that he had eaten apple-pudding on the Wednesday previous to the Saturday, and that he went into the yard and immediately cast it up again—she gave me what she said was some of the crust of the pudding—it was analysed, but there was no arsenic in</p>

               <p>that—if there had been arsenic in the pudding taken on Wednesday I should have supposed it had been all cast up again—the people in the house told me he had been ill from the Wednesday till the Saturday—Mrs. Bowler said nothing to me about that—all that I believe she said to me was, that she wished to have him opened—I do not recollect anything more—I was in my shop on the Thursday morning before, at nine o'clock—I did not see her there then—I did not sell her any tincture of rhubarb that morning—I did not give her any advice—I had not seen her from the time I left her when she was confined.</p>

                  </hi>. At the time I was examined I lived in Union-street, Borough; I knew the deceased by living in the same house for seventeen weeks. On the Sunday before the Saturday on which he died, the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my room, and our conversation began about the newspaper—I told her a lady and gentleman and their servant had been poisoned with arsenic, by their daughter—she asked me whether I knew how they sold it, I whether in liquid or powder—nothing was said about the name it was called by—I saw the deceased on the morning he died—I cannot tell what time, it was before dinner—he was sick when 1 first went into the room—he brought something up, but what I do not know—the prisoner was there at that time—she said he brought up every thing she gave him—I asked her why she did not have a doctor—she said, "We owe money"—I said, "Why, there are parish doctors and dispensary doctors; why not have a doctor?"—the deceased said, "Why not me have a doctor?"—she said, "You don't want to be physicked and tortured about"—he had his hand on his chest—I did not hear him complain of anything at that time—on the Monday after the Saturday on which he died I was conversing with Mrs. Parfitt, whom Mrs. Bowler calls her mother—Mrs. Bowler was present—I told her that he had said, "Why not have a docto?"—she said, "He did not say so; and if you say that, you will hang me, for you will be called on the Jury"—on the Sunday morning the day after his death, I was clean<lb></lb>ing the room, after laying him out, and brought a half-pint mug off the drawers' in the room, and took it into the kitchen—there was some tea in it—I emptied it in the yard, on the stones by the water-closet—I saw a sort of sediment in the bottom of the mug, of a dirty white, like magnesia—I then took the mug up stain to my husband, to show him—he told me to take it down and place it in the kitchen, and I did so—I did not wash it out—I never saw it afterwards—a man named Dunster lodged in the house—Mrs. Bowler told me at one time, just before Mr. Bowler's death, that if he (Dunster) got married to the young woman be was paying bis addresses to, she would destroy their happiness—on one occasion, previous to Mr. Bowler's death, she told me that Dunster would stop five years for her—I never saw her and Dunster go out together.</p>

               <p>or "stedfaatly," nothing of the sort—she said she had never been in the shop before—I cannot speak positively as to every part of her dress—when she was brought by the officer she had, I should say, a straw bonnet on, and a dark shawl—she was not in mourning—she was dressed in a dark dress and a straw bonnet—I remember having my attention called to her before the Coroner—I did not then say I could not speak to her accurately because she was in mourning—I said, "She is in mourning now"—I did not say I could not swear to her because her dress was different, nothing of the kind—I am quite positive I did not say, at any time, that I would not undertake to swear to her because her dress was different—this signature to the depositions is my handwriting—it was read over to me before I signed it—these last two lines are quite right—it is exactly what I said, but it is punctuated differently—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">I would not undertake to swear to her, her dress is different, she is now in mourning"</hi>)—that was in answer to a separate question—I told you just now that I said nothing about a doubt of her person in reference to her change of dress—I still adhere to that answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a publican, who keeps the Nun's-head at Peckham—my mother's name is Parfitt—I have known the prisoner since a few years after she was born—my mother was acquainted with the prisoner's parents, and she took the prisoner at her father's death—she was then not quite seven months old—she apprenticed her to Mrs. Coxton, a milliner, and kept her until her marriage—she received a very good plain education, according to my mother's circumstances—she knew the deceased some years previous to her marriage, which took place six years ago in November—she and her husband came to live in my house in Union-street—they came there at my mother's request, to wait on her, consequence of her being very much crippled—my mother afterwards came to me for the benefit of her health, and the prisoner and her husband continued to reside there to take care of her house, in return for which they lived rent-free—it was occupied by various lodgers—Mr. Dunster was one of them—a niece of mine, named Charlotte Trott, is engaged to</p>

               <p>Dunster, and has been so some months—I have known Dunster personally for ten or twelve years, but I have known there was such a person this twenty years—he is a first-cousin of my husband's—I knew the prisoner's husband—I never could form an idea of his disposition—he was very gloomy in my presence—I never exchanged half-a-dozen words with him at one time, and I have been with him for hours—he was so reserved in his manner, he never held any conversation with any of us—he was quite of a reserved gloomy habit, and, I should say, desponding—I never saw him merry or cheerful—I have known the prisoner and deceased for many years—they were not brought up together, only for a few years—they came together being inmates of one house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty-eight years old, and am a traveller to a commercial house—I have lived in the house where Mr. and Mrs. Bowler lived, about eighteen months—I knew them very well for at least nine years before that—I have not been particularly intimate with them—I know the Trotts, and the other parts of the family—Mr. John Trolt has a niece named Charlotte—I have been paying attentions to her for six months and more, with the approbation of her own friends and mine-our intimacy continues down to the present time—the prisoner had not inti<lb></lb>mated to me at any time any displeasure on her part, to my attentions to Miss Trott—I remember the deceased attempting to destroy himself in Peckham-fields, twelve months ago last May—we had been to the Nun's Head, Peckham, and were coming home together—I was a little before him—his wife was there—we were coming over the bridge together, and he said he would throw himself into the b—canal—his wife entreated him not to do so, and to come away—he said he would not come away, he would not leave, he would drown himself—I assisted her in endeavouring to prevent it—I asked him why he did so—he said he was tired of his life—I thought at first it was a joke, but not afterwards—he seemed very determined—I succeeded with his wife in getting him away home—he was of a very sullen temper—he talked very little—on two or three occa<lb></lb>sions I had seen him in a room, in company with other person—I never observed any thing particular—he was generally very quit—I think he has remained in the room—I never particulary observed—he did not join in the conversation like other persons—I never thought that</p>

               <p>he was depressed—he was very reserved—it appeared to me to be his general disposition—on one occasion, about seven months ago, he told me that he had been home to his dinner, and had nothing but bread and cheese, and had been home to his supper and had the same—he then talked of his bringing home money to provide different food, and he had not got that which he expected—he two or three times complained of great po<lb></lb>verty—it was the duty of the prisoner to attend to me, among the other lodgers in the house—I have never said that she was to wait for me, or any thing intimating any intention on my part to marry her, or be ac<lb></lb>quainted with her improperly—there is not the slightest truth in it—I was about to leave the lodgings—I gave notice last May, at least I spoke to Mrs. Parfitt about leaving, because I did not like to live in the house, in consequence of Mrs. Bowler being negligent—I stated as the reason, that I thought she did not pay attention enough to the lodgers—I also told Mrs. Trott of my intention to leave, and complained of the prisoner at the reason, but she asked me to wait until after her confinement.</p>

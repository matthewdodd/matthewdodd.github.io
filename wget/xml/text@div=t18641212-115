I am the wife of Thomas Condon, of 8, William-street, East-lane, Walworth—on 8th November, about half-past 8 in the morning, I was in Devonshire-street, St. George's—I saw the prisoner in a public-house drinking with two men—I called for two pots of beer and three-pennyworth of brandy—I gave a sovereign, and received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I paid four shillings to the cabman, and put the fifteen shillings into a nankeen pocket, which I put down my bosom—the pocket also contained three lockets and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—the three men saw me do that, and the prisoner said, "I know where your sister lives; I will take you to her"—I said, "I do not care what I give to see her, because I have not seen her since my mother went to Australia"—I had spoken about my sister before that—when I went out, the three men followed me nearly to the bottom of the street, and the prisoner held me by the throat, and nearly strangled me—I hardly know whether he was in front of me or behind me—I halloed out, "Murder!" "Father!"—the other one tore my bosom open—here is my gown all torn, and I am all sore now—they tore my breast and chest, and took out the pocket and the money, and ran away—I spoke to a police<lb></lb>man, and went with him down Devonshire-street—I saw the prisoner at the station at 2 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Finch, a coal-porter, of 7, Devonshire-street, St. George's—on 18th November, at not quite 8. 30 in the morning, I saw the prosecutrix and a man with his arm round her waist, and two other men—they were all three very drunk—the prosecutrix did not appear to me to be sober—the prisoner was about twenty yards behind—I saw a short man thrust his hand into the prosecutrix's bosom—she screamed out "Murder!" and "Father!"—the prisoner then went up to her, but the other man was robbing her then—that was at Mr. Atkinson's door—the prisoner went up, and laid hold of her by the shoulders and neck—I cannot say whether he had hold of her when the other man took the money, but I think he was very close to her, as he had his hand on her shoulder—what I said was, that he was twenty yards behind when I first saw them—he held her while she was being robbed.</p>

We had been there ten minutes when this woman came in, and the two shoemakers came out. I know one of them by night, and he handed the pot to me; she called for a pot of beer. One of them said, "Now, mistress, you drink along with us." She did so. She gave me seven chops, and I gave four of them away to the shoemakers. I lighted my pipe, and was about forty yards behind them. One of them had his arms round her shoulders, and they were rolling from one side of the pavement to the other. She holloaed out and I went up, but whether I put my hand on her shoulder or not I cannot say. I did not know she had a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the world. She never appeared against me, and I was remanded twice. Is it likely that in a street where all the people knew me I should attempt to rob a woman?</p>

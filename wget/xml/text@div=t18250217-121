On Saturday, a month before Christmas I went to town, at three o'clock in the forenoon, and in my hurry am not sure whether I latched my room door or not. We have lodgers. I returned about one o'clock, but did not go up stairs till four, and then missed this property. I have seen the prisoners about the neighbourhood, but did not see them there, nor till after Christmas, when they were apprehended, and my property was produced at Bow-street. I have not found the money - it was kept between the bed and sacking, tied in a stocking.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On Saturday, the 27th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners in Beck's-rents, Rosemary-lane, sitting on a quantity of grass mats - they appeared bulky about the body. I went up to them, and asked Tyler where he got them from - he said they belonged to a boy - I searched Tyler, and found in his hat a gown, and in his pocket a handkerchief - he said they were his own. Carter, who was with me, found a shawl, and a pair of new blue trowsers on Clements. Tyler said he picked his things up on Ruthem-hill, which is on the Maidstone road, about nineteen miles from town - he said they had been down there looking for work, as brick-makers, and had made the mats on the road - that they lived at Uxbridge. I took them before the Magistrate - they were remanded, but I could not find the owner - they were committed for a month as vagrants, and were afterwards apprehended on this charge, I have had the property ever since.</p>

            . I am a carman: I was coming from Battle-bridge, last night was fortnight I believe; it was the 29th of December, at just upon the stroke of seven in the evening; there was Mr. Wood and another friend with me; as we were coming along the road we saw the prisoner in the Spaw-fields, just by the road side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it moon light?</p>
               <p>Crouch. The moon was not up; he stood up sometimes, and sometimes stooped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light?</p>
               <p>Crouch. No. I was at the distance of twenty yards from him; it was light enough to discern him very well; we stood to see what he was doing; I said I supposed he was easing nature; Mr. Boyd said no, he believed he was after something else; I said we will step over the nails and see what he is about; we went over the rails; he ran off immediately; we pursued him; we caught him I believe in about a dozen yards from where we first saw him; then we went to see what he was about, and we saw a bag lying with a sheep in it, and the head lying by, and he had a knife in his hand all bloody, which he dropt down by our feet; we found the sheath of that knife in his pocket; we secured him and took him to Bridewell. Then we went up to Islington among the drovers, to enquire who had lost any sheep; I described the mark; two or three of them directly said it is Mr. Treasurer's, at Clare-market: it was a wether sheep.</p>

            . I am a small worker in gold and silver. I was with Mr. Crouch about seven in the evening; we saw a man about thirty yards from us in the field; sometimes he stooped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120019"></xptr> down, then he rose up and looked round him; we stood about ten minutes watching him; then we got over the pales; upon which he run; we overtook him and secured him; then we went to the place we saw him standing at, where we found a sheep tied up in a bag, and the head close by it. When I ran up to him he dropt this knife (producing it); it was all over bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it fit to kill a sheep with?</p>
               <p>Wood. Yes; we searched him and found the sheath in his pocket. The two shoulders were c ut off skin and all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Crouch. Is that the same skin?</p>
               <p>Crouch. Yes; it was quite hot when we took him.</p>
               <p>Wood. It was bleeding. We took him to New Prison. Upon enquiry we were told it was Mr. Treasurer's mark; when we shewed them the skin, they said it was his sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>There are two women live in the same house that I do, who saw me go out from home but a quarter before seven, and I was in New Prison before seven; I could not therefore have time to have killed this sheep and cut some of it up. I was going to the Bull in the Pound for a pint of beer; I saw this lying in the road; I stooped down and untied it; I saw it was cut and mangled about; I did not meddle with it. When I had got about twenty yards from the place, one of these men laid hold of me, and they hand cuffed me. Some of the sheep was carried away; I know nothing about the knife; I did not run. My witnesses are not here.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. Did you find the shoulder any where?</p>
               <p>Wood. No; the keeper of New Prison went and searched round the field but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Crouch. There was wool upon the prisoner's shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury to Wood. Did you see the prisoner drop that knife?</p>
               <p>Wood. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They found the sheath in my pocket, and then they searched after the knife; here is the young man that took me; he will prove they were thirty yards from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you chuse to call that young man?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no objection to that, though he is one of their own party.</p>

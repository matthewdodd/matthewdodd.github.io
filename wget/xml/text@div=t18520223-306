                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Dover Castle. On the night of 16th Feb., when the prisoner in the last case was given into custody, this prisoner came in before the woman came in—he appeared rather intoxicated, and threw down a penny over the counter into the room—he asked for half a pint of beer—he drank the beer, and remained there while the woman uttered the two half crowns—the woman dropped some money, and the prisoner said, "You are like me dropping money"—she made some observation that it was no business of his—I sent for an officer to give the woman into custody—the prisoner went out of the house—I went out with the officer to press the charge against the woman, and I saw the prisoner at some little distance from the house, standing by a stable, apparently hiding—I suppose that was a quarter of an hour after I had sent for the officer.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 124.) I was called to the Dover Castle—when I came out I found the prisoner three or four yards from the door, standing still—he walked away—I said, "Stop, I want you"—he said, "I know nothing about the woman"—I had not said anything to him about the woman before that—he said so a great many times—I told him I must take him into custody and search him—he said he would not be searched—I took hold of him, he resisted, and I got the assistance of a civilian, and got him into the public-house—I searched him, and found a bad half sovereign wrapped in paper in his waistcoat pocket, two half crowns and seven shillings bad, and some good silver.</p>

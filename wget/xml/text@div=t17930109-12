             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am with my brother, the trunk maker, the corner of St Paul's Church Yard; I lost my watch, on the 7th of January, coming up Ludgate-hill, about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night; the prisoner met me at the corner of the <placeName id="t17930109-12-crimeloc61">Old Bailey</placeName>

(Produced and deposed to.) I am sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man in my life time till he gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the watchman, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man running from Ludgate-hill, up the Old Bailey; I was in my watch box, the corner of the Old Bailey and Ludgate-hill; I followed directly, I met him up by Surgeon's-hall, he ran across the way, and there I laid hold of him, I am sure the man I laid hold of, was the man that was running, for I never lost sight of him; when I laid hold of the man, Mr. Bryant came up, and I gave my charge to the patrole, I found part of the watch in the kennel without the case, I carried it to the young man, and I went back again and found the case in the kennel; and he was carried down to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming along, I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw a man run by me; the prosecutor was much intoxicated with liquor, he says I believe this is the man; I turned about to see what was the matter, seeing them running and calling stop thief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bryant was in liquor very much, so that no one could take his word for any thing.</p>
               <p>Constable. Mr. Bryant was rather in liquor, but not so much as the prisoner represents; he certainly knew what he did.</p>

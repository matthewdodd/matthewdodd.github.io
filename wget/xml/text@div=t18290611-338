On the 2d of May I was in the Haymarket - the prisoner came there in a gig, and said he wanted a load of hay and a load of straw; it came to 6l. 4s. - I said I could not let it go without the money, as I wanted to pay my men; he said,"I have a cheque in my pocket for 190l., and I am going to get it cashed at a banker's, and any time after I return you may send to my place; I will pay for them;" I sent between four and five o'clock, to Mill-hill-mews - my brother took the straw, and lowood the hay; I said,"The agreement is for ready money, mind, and bring the money back, but they returned without it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known Tickness? A. Five or six years; I have taken perhaps 20l. of him; I have a bill of his returned for 18l. - he became a bankrupt on the 31st of May: I entered this hay and straw in a common day-book - I did not give credit to Tickness; I believed the prisoner ordered it on Tickness' account - I thought, as he was his servant, he had got his master's money to pay; I was not to allow him any commission - he asked for something to drink- I said I would give him a pint of beer or a glass of gin; he did not say he was going to Sir John Beresford's to receive money on his master's account - a man did call on me on the Tuesday, but I had taken a warrant out on the Monday, and on Wednesday Mr. Tickness' sister came, and said she came to settle it: half a dozen people came to me to try to settle it - there was a man called on the Tuesday; I said it was in the Magistrate's hands; some man did say if I would go up about four o'clock, but I did not hear him say I might take the receipt: he said the money would be ready - the Magistrate did not say I ought to take the money; he said it was a gross fraud: I have not offered to forego this prosecution if the bill was paid, and the money for the hay and straw; a man did call and say he came as a friend to ask me to settle it.</p>

               <p>JAMES TROUT. I am the prosecutor's brother. I took the straw; I saw the prisoner and gave him the bill - he said, "You have 6l. 4s. to take back, I will go and fetch the money in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes and settle with you;" I had not unloaded the hay, but we did afterwards - he came on horseback in about twenty minutes, and said he had seen our master and settled - we came away without the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you he was going to Sir

            's to get the money? A. He did not; I never called there afterwards - he did not say when he had settled.</p>
               <p>JOHN ISWOOD. I drove the cart with the hay - the prisoner said he had settled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said I wanted a load of hay and straw for Mr. Tickness; I said, "What time will you send it?" he said, "Between this and two o'clock;" when I got home there were six trusses of hay in the cart - I was called to speak to a gentleman, and went to a public-house to have something to drink - the man and boy came to the house and had a drop of beer, I saw neither of them afterwards; Mr. Trout afterwards came to the house and rang the bell, and said, "Have you got my money?" I said"No: I am going to Sir John Beresford's to get a cheque for 5l., and I will give it you, or you can have it on Monday."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TICKNESS. I am a stable-keeper, and live at Mill-hill-mews. I have known the prosecutor some years, and had dealings with him to the amount of 300l.; I have paid him myself 70l. - he never bought any thing of me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110152"></xptr>the prisoner has been in my service four years, and is so to this day - he is paid by the assignees of my estate; I sent him for this hay and straw on the 2d of June, and said his mistress would give him the money - he was to collect some money in the course of the day, and to go into the City for a cheque, but it was not paid; this hay and straw were delivered on my premises, and upon my solemn oath the prisoner derived no advantage from them - he receives his weekly guinea from my assignees.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When did you become a bankrupt? A. On the 30th of May; Mr. White, who lives in Kent, was the drawer of that cheque - I sent it back to him and got the property back.</p>

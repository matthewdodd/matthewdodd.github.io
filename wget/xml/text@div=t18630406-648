                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Rose and Crown public-house, Long-lane, Bermondsey—on Friday evening, 27th March, the two prisoners came there together—Johnson asked for half a pint of ale, and gave sixpence—I gave her five pence change—they drank the ale between them, and left immediately—I put the sixpence on the side of the counter in the mean<lb></lb>time, to serve another person—a minute or two alter the prisoners left I saw it was bad, bent it, and put it in my pocket by itself, and the next day gave it to the policeman—on the next day, Saturday, the prisoners came to my house again, and Smith asked for a pennyworth of gin, and gave me a sixpence—I detected it, and said, "This is similar to the one the old lady gave me yesterday"—she wanted me to return it—I would not, but sent for a constable and gave them both into custody—Smith gave a good shilling to my daughter, who came into the bar—I gave both the sixpences to the constable—I am quite positive the prisoners are the women who came on both occasions—they did not deny that they had been in the day before.</p>

I am a tobacconist, at 47, Skinner-street, City—some time early in January, Smith came to my shop, and asked for a quarter of an ounce of Prince's mixture, which was five farthings—she gave me a counterfeit half-crown—I told her directly it was bad, and she said she was not aware of it—I asked her who she took it from—she said from her father—I gave her into custody, she was taken before one of the Aldermen at Guildhall, remanded, and discharged, I think, on 21st January—I gave the half-crown to Brett—I did not see anything of the other prisoner.</p>

I was looking out at my school window on Monday morning; at the upper end of Love-lane I saw the two prisoners and another boy together; Mills was winding up a watch, which I thought to be gold; I went out after them, and found them in Fenchurch-street; I desired Mills to let me see the watch he had; he said he had not got it, but the other boys had, and the rest of the goods; I ran after them with Mills in my hand, and overtook the other prisoner; I alarmed, but nobody came to my assistance; I asked that boy for the watch, he gave me a bag with two watches, and several gold rings, a stay-hook, buckles and buttons; I took the boys into an apothecary's shop, there we examined the effects they had, and took a list of them; I then went to my Lord-Mayor for an officer to bring them before his Lordship, and they were carried there and committed (the things produced and deposed to.)</p>

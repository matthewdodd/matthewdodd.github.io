               <p>Q. You do not mean that she was his wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she married to him? - A. I never heard to the contrary; we went with the property to a Jew's, and he would not give money enough, and we brought them back to Seaton's house, his wife was at home then; we agreed that the property was to be pawned, and she took out the things separately to pawn, I said there while she went with them; she came back with the money and the duplicates, and shewed them to me; she pawned two pair of shoes, and a black silk cloak, and the remainder of the property I pawned myself, and the money was equally divided.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were taken up, you know? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. But you did not think you might chance to be hanged for it? - A. I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you being to think it a mighty clever thing to hang somebody else to save yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, you did not charge anybody with this robbery for the purpose of saving yourself? - A. Not at all, by hanging anybody.</p>
               <p>Q. By swearing then? - A. I never thought concerning hanging anybody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think, by swearing against some person or other, you might be able to save yourself? - A. Yes, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, for the first time, you charged the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been tried here before? - A. No.</p>

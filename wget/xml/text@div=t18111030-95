            . Q. Your husband I believe was in the service of the College of Surgeons. - A. Yes assistant, superintendant of the museum. On Thursday the 31st of October, I was at one of the windows of the house in <placeName id="t18111030-95-crimeloc536">Lincoln's Inn Fields</placeName>

I kept the prisoner in my eye, then in about five minutes after the prisoner walked past the window with something in his apron, which he endeavoured to conceal. I was some distance, I saw before he got out of the yard that what he was carrying appeared to be a great weight. I suspected one of the pieces of lead was gone, there were eight pieces of lead in the hall. I had seen them about ten minutes before in the hall, they had been sent in the night before. I sent my child for my husband, and watched the way the prisoner went, the other man went off first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband go in pursuit of him. - A. Yes. I saw him in about seven or eight minutes, he was brought back.</p>

            . Q. You are the husband of the last witness. - A. Yes. I pursued the prisoner and overtook him, he had the lead in a leather apron carrying it on his shoulder, I collared him, he resisted three or four minutes, the lead dropped in the scuffle, and then he begged of me to let him go, that I did not do. I left the lead in Mr. Wilds shop, opposite of whose house I took him, I took the prisoner to the watch-house. I am certain there were eight pieces of lead in the hall. I went to look in the hall before I pursued him, and one was gone. I have the lead in my care. This is the apron it was tied up in, and this is the lead.</p>
               <p>MR. WELLS. The lead was desposited in my shop and the same lead I delivered back again.</p>

            . I am a plumber, employed by the Royal College of Surgeons. On the night before this was done I sent in eight pieces of lead, it was their property. I have examined this piece of lead, it corresponds with one of the pieces to make up the eight, it is about half an hundred weight, it is worth fifteen shillings.</p>

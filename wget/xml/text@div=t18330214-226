On the 11th of February I was called into the shop, about one o'clock; my young man, said the prisoner, who was in the shop, had stolen a seal - I said,"We must search him;" I sent for an officer - he pulled his handkerchief out of his coat pocket, and with it he threw the send on the floor; it has my mark on it - it cost me 2l.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Banfield. - The prisoner came into the shop alone, and asked to look at a few neat gold seals; I showed him some in a tray; I saw a seal in his hand, and missed one from the tray - seeing him keep it in his hand I watched him very closely, and saw him put it into his pocket; he had not asked the price of it - I sent for my master, who came down; I said I suspected he had stolen a seal - he said, "If you think I have robbed you, you may search me," and at the same time drew she handkerchief out of his pocket, and the seal came out with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Can you take on yourself to say there might not be some mistake? A. Yes - I am quite sure I saw him put it into his pocket - I never said any thing about his having flape to his pocket.</p>

Then Jessup got upon the Coach-Box, and Yates put me into the Coach, and came in after me, and pull'd up the Windows. Jessup drove on, and I was sadly frighted, but knew not how to help my self, for Yates turn'd up my Peticoats, and lean'd his Breast so hard against my Mouth that I could not cry out; then he took hold of my Legs, and put them about his Middle, and by main Force lay with me, and had the carnal Knowledge of my Body, without my Consent. And so when he had done he went out, but I was in such a Condition, that what with the Fright, and what with having my Mouth stopt, and what with striving and strugling, I was quite spent, and out of my Senses, and ready to die away; and before I could recover my self, I found the other Prisoner, Jessup, was got into the Coach with me; how he came in, I don't know, but he ravish'd me as the other had done before, but at last, when all was over, I got Breath enough to cry out Murder, and then he turn'd me out of the Coach into the middle of the Road. They had used me so barbarously, that I was forc'd to call at a House by the Way, and could not get home till near 11 a Clock. My Husband saw that I was very much out of Order, he asked me where I had been, and what Company I had kept till that time of Night. I not telling him at first, he began to rave and curse like a Madman, and swore that he'd never lie with me again, if I did not satisfy him, and so at last I told him all, and besides I was afraid that they had given me the Clap.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner Yates thus made his Defence. The Prosecutors Wife was my old Acquaintance, I have Lain with her many and many a good Time. - About 7 in the Evening, as I and Jessup were talking, we saw her in the Fair standing with another Man. How do ye Molly, says I, and how d'ye do Jerry says she. Now I was then out of Business, the Coach belonged to Jessup, and he had made several Turns from St. Giles's Pound, and so he asked me to go and drink, which I agreed to, and Molly left the other Man and went along with us. When we came from the Alehouse she would not go into the Coach, except I went in with her which I did. And she was well enough pleas'd with what past, for if any thing had troubled her she might have made Noise enough, and there were People enow in the Road agoing from the Fair - I have lain with her a whole Week together, at the King's-Arms in St. Martin's lane, for I was got upon the Loose then, and it cost me 7 half Crowns in Expences. - We have bedded together twenty and twenty Times in a Hayloft.</p>

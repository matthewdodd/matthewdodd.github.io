               <p>Was there any particular hustling of you? - I was hustled as the rest of the people were in getting past the gate-way.</p>

            's Council. This was the day when the balloon was going off with Count Zambeconi? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The gate-way you talk of was the gateway where the people were endeavouring to get in to see the balloon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Many hundreds and thousands were there? - A great many.</p>
               <p>They wanted to pass through? - I did not see any person wanted to pass through; I was passing the gate-way.</p>
               <p>They pushed you in the crowd, is that what you mean by hustling? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you to be sure was hustled, and you hustled the next to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many hundred might be there about? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Was you laid hold of by any body? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Was you touched by any body? - It was a different hustle to passing in a crowd.</p>
               <p>Was you any more shoved than other people? - I believe there were six or seven that were shoved and lost their watches in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Did not you shove some body else? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>This day fortnight, I and my shop-mate went to see the balloon go off; I got into a crowd, and they shoved to hard I was glad to get out again, and I got upon a wall that was in Pancrass street, Tottenham-Court-Road; I turned my head, and I saw the prisoner at the bar and and several more; a tall man in a red coat who is at the door now, I saw him several times attempt to rob people of their watches; they served several so; I had no such thoughts, they looked like gentlemen, but several said their watches were gone; this red headed man which is at the door came plump up against the prosecutor; and I understood the prosecutor had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe in what manner they came up against him? - The same as I may come up against another willfully.</p>
               <p>Were they standing in the crowd? - Nobody could hardly stand there, but they certainly were in the crowd; the prosecutor came in and went in amongst them; and I saw this prisoner at the bar and the other that is outside the door come up from towards the fields, the lower part of Pancrass street; there was not any body near them for a foot or two; people might have stood very well if they had only been easy; I could discern so plain, that I saw the prisoner shove against the prosecutor, and other people where there was no occasion for it; I saw his hands round his waist; I did not see him take any thing; I jumped off the wall, and said to the prosecutor, are not you the man that is robbed? and he said yes; I said, come along with me and I will shew you the man that has robbed you, and then a man gave me a punch on the side of the lug; the other man was on the outside of the door when I came up I shewed him the red haired man first, and he was rescued away; then I shewed him this man, and he said, what me! and I said, aye you, directly.</p>
               <p>What time did you shew him the man that had taken the watch? - I shewed him first the red haired man, and then this man.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know at that time which of these men had taken the watch? - I did not, nor I cannot say now.</p>
               <p>You did not tell Mr. Tubb which had taken the watch? - I said, I thought the red haired man had it.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon him? - I was not present when he was searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow another of the Prisoner's Council. Now, Master Goodman, pray who may you be? - I am a sawyer.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a balloon hunter? - I saw the other, Mr. Lunardi's.</p>
               <p>It is not the temper of an English mob to stand very quiet, they like to hustle, they wave to and fro, do not they, that is the way, is not it? - It is too much the way.</p>
               <p>You was afraid? - I was not much afraid.</p>
               <p>You did not feel yourself much at your ease? - No.</p>
               <p>You was afraid they would take your watch perhaps? - No, I could not, I had no watch.</p>
               <p>Then it was for the fun of the thing that they hustled you? - It was foolish fun too.</p>
               <p>Why this wall was seven or eight feet high? - I was lifted up, they laid hold of my legs.</p>
               <p>That is a sort of a horse, you are more used to, I take it for granted, than a fourlegged one? - No, I took notice of them I suppose for about half an hour.</p>
               <p>I thought so? - You did not think any thing about it before.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was there looking about the same as other people; I was thirty or forty yards from where this gate way is; there were a great crowd of people there, it was an open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060016"></xptr> place where a number of people went; the rails were all pulled down by the mob; the witness came and laid hold of a man with a red head of hair; I stood still, and he came then, and said, that is one in boots, and laid fast hold of me; says the prosecutor, Sir, I believe you have my watch? Sir, says I, I have not; says the other witness he is one of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

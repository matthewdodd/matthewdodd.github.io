                  </hi>. I am a dyer, carrying on business with Mr. Paxman, of 4, Schofield-place west, Brompton—the prisoner was in our employment—he had to drive a cart, deliver goods, solicit orders, collect monies, and pay them over to me in the evening—on Thursday night, 17th March, about half-past 7, I was in the warehouse—I heard the prisoner having an altercation with one of the men, he was threatening—I could not exactly hear what he said—I did not stop, but passed immediately into the shop and waited for him—when he came in, I said, "Come, you are keeping me waiting, deliver in your account"—he made no reply, but scowled at me—he paid in his account, and then said, "I wish to speak to you, Mr. Hen wood"—I observed that he was somewhat excited, and said, "I will not speak to you to-night"—he repeated the question—I still said I would not see him that night, and I said, "if you have anything to say on business, see Mr. Paxman"—he again repeated the question—I said, "My good fellow," or," my dear fellow, I will not see you to-night"—he said, "I will only detain you a few minutes—I am no more a fellow than you are, Mr. Henwood, I was brought up at a boarding-school"—he had often made that remark before, but I had never noticed it—I made a motion with my hand that I would not hear him—my saying "Good fellow" appeared to offend and irritate him—I was at a loss to know what could have irritated him, and I said to the shopwoman who was present, "Did I say anything offensive?"—she reminded me that I had said the words "Good fellow"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185904040043"></xptr>
               <p>I then said to him, "I did not use the word 'fellow,' offensively; but I hope your conduct may not some day make you a felon"—I took no farther notice of him—I was walking towards the desk, when he came towards me and tired a pistol, saying simultaneously, "I will let you know"—I saw him hold the pistol at me—I fell down with fright; and crawled under the desk—he tried to follow me—there was a bench there—I was standing at the side of it—I examined that bench the next morning, and found a lot of shot holes in the leg of it, I should think twenty or thirty—I was standing two feet or two feet and a half from that angle—the shot travelled in the direction where I was standing, but at an acute angle—there was a poplin dress under the bench—I can't say how near that was to me—I saw that dress next morning, I did not find any shot in it, but the constable did—I was afterwards shown some shot—I did not compare it with the shot in the bench.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employment—I saw the prisoner on that evening about ten minutes before he spoke to Mr. Henwood—he was talking to me, and he held a pistol up in my face, and said, "You see this, if any one insulted me I would as soon shoot them as I would a sparrow"—he said he had been insulted—he did not say by whom—I heard what took place between Mr. Henwood and the prisoner—I heard the remark made, "My good fellow"—I noticed that it excited the prisoner, and he said to Mr. Hen wood, "I am no more a fellow than you are, I am quite, as respectable as you are"—Mr. Henwood asked me if I had heard him say anything offensive—I said, "No"—he said, he did not use the term "Good fellow" offensively—the prisoner requested to see Mr. Henwood alone—Mr. Henwood refused—he asked him several times and he refused, and told him if he had anything to communicate upon business he was to see Mr. Paxman—they then both went round to the back counter—Mr. Hen<lb></lb>wood gradually withdrew from the prisoner, the prisoner moved towards him and said something, but I don't exactly recollect what, and at the same time he let the pistol off—I did not see the direction in which the pistol was pointed—there is a bench in the warehouse—Mr. Henwood was near that bench, about a foot from it—there was a dress under the bench—Mr. Henwood fell down and crawled away—he ran through the press room into the warehouse—the prisoner followed him—a policeman was called, and he was given into custody.</p>

               <p>it would spoil them, and he stopped—I don't know where his hands were at the time—I did not take notice—that was the first time I was ever so near a pistol when it was fired—I told Mr. Henwood to get up and run—the dress lay quite at the corner of the bench—there were some shot holes found in it in the morning—it lay quite close to the ground—I said, soon after this occurred, that it appeared as though he was taking the pistol out of his pocket, and it went off, it appeared as though he was taking it from his right side—that is my impression now.</p>

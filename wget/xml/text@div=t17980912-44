I own I was in liquor; I believe I was there to the best of my knowledge about two hours and a half; I fell asleep; when I waked, I said, you have robbed me; I had lost three one pound notes, the watchman found them all three, I could swear to the number of one of them, but not to the other two, and the Magistrate gave me them back as I was a poor man; my pocket was turned inside out; she began to give very ill language, and abused me; I told her I would make an affidavit that I had them after I was in the room; when I gave her the one shilling and sixpence, I felt them in my pocket; I called the watchman, and he called another watchman, and they both came in; among the notes, there was a direction from a gentleman in Mark-lane, for me to call upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been? - A. At Hounslow.</p>

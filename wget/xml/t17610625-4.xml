               <p>Abbot. It was a Month ago last Saturday, about five in the afternoon, the saddle then hung up in Mr. Gomme's stable, which is in our yard. Soon after that a woman came and said, a woman had gone out of the yard with a saddle under her apron. I went after her, and found it in her apron, and made her bring it back again. Then I sent for Mr. Gomme, and he came and owned it. It was the prisoner at the bar.</p>

            . I happened to be in the yard looking at some horses; I saw the prisoner in the yard; after that we went into the house, and in about ten minutes the maid came in, and said, a woman was gone out of the yard with a saddle. I went and told Mr. Gomme: he said, I am lame, so I ran after and stopped her: the ostler came: she said, If we would not make a noise, she would bring it back again. So she did. Mr. Gomme owned the saddle. [ The saddle produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

               <p>I met a gentleman, he desired me to go and fetch this saddle, and carry it to the Green-Dragon, in Fleet-street, and told me he would give me sixpence for going. I never saw him before. I leave it all to their conscience, for I did not take it, it was given to me to carry; the gentleman gave it to me under the gateway, and they said, they would know who I belonged to, and stopped me.</p>

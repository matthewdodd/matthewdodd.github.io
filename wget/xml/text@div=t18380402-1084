                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Charles John Stewart, bookseller, in King William-street, Strand. On Monday evening, the 19th of March, about seven o'clock, I was in the back part of the shop, and heard a noise, as if the shop door was being opened—I went towards it, and saw the prisoner leaving the shop—he observed me, and ran away—followed and came up with him, as he stumbled—he turned, and struck me—he was stopped at the farther corner of Chandos-steet, without my having lost sight of him—six volumes of Shakespeare were given me—I did not see them found—I missed six volumes of Shakapeare, which I had seen safe not fire minutes before the prisoner quitted the door of the shop.</p>

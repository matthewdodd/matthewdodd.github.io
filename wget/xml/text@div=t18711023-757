I live at 5, Wellclose Square, and am a cigar maker—I was in Shorter Street on 16th September—I saw Matthias and Kidd there, with a sailor—they were on each side of the man, who was three parts intoxicated—he wanted to get away, and they would not allow him—Matthias had her hand at her side, but I don't know whether she stole anything, but she passed her hand very quickly to her mouth—she had her hand at the prosecutor's breast before that—someone threw the man's cap away—he called out "You have robbed me; give me my money back"—he caught hold of Matthias' dress, and said "You have got my money. Police! Police!"—Matthias said "I have not robbed you; you have got all your money in your pocket"—she put her hand to her mouth, and then put it in his pocket, pulled out some loose silver, and placed a sovereign amongst it, and said "There! there is your money"—she struck the prosecutor, and said "There! you b—wretch! that is because you don't want to pay me"—they struggled, and fell to the ground—the man got his hand in the twist of her hair, and held her by it—Kidd came up, and got the man's hand away—Matthias passed something to Kidd, which she took from her mouth—Matthias ran round Wellclose Square—the prosecutor ran after her and caught her by the gateway—a policeman came up at that moment—I pointed to Matthias, and said "Officer, take that one"—I saw Kidd pass the money to Cox—she came from Ship Alley—I ran after Cox, who was running round the square—she was stopped by an officer—as we were going back, we saw Kidd going up North East Passage—he gave Cox to another constable, and went and took Kidd.</p>

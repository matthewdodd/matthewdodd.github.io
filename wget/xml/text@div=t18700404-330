               <p>on Sunday evening, 6th March, I was going into the Mother Shipton public-house, with George Prince, about 10.30—I know the prisoners by seeing them standing about there—as I opened the public-house door O'Keefe struck me in the mouth, and knocked me backwards—I got up, and was knocked down again by Lee—Lee and Howe then fell on me, and knocked me about while I was on the ground—they <hi rend="italic">lugged</hi> my coat off, and I lost my hat as well—I got up at last, and ran up the road—O'Keefe ran after me—I stopped and gave him in charge—the others came to the station.</p>

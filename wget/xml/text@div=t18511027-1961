                  </hi>. I live in Back-road, St. George's-in-the-East. On 3rd Oct., in consequence of something that was said to me, I watched the prisoner—I saw her leave Mrs. Boyce's house at half-past 6 o'clock that sight, with a child in her arms—I followed her to Florence-road, Deptford—it was between 9 and 10 at night—she went out of the main road, and turned into Florence-road, and into a lane—she went about forty yards, and put the child down, and ran away immediately—I went to the place, and found the child on some bricks, close by the dungheap—it was an unfre<lb></lb>quented place, and there was no light there—I saw a policeman—I took the child up—it was lying on its back, wrapped in this article, which I believe is part of a cloak—the policeman took the child—I went with him to the station—next morning I accompanied him, when he apprehended the prisoner in her mother's house, I think about a mile from where the child was found <hi rend="italic">—</hi> I pointed her out to the constable—he asked her if she knew anything about dropping a child last night in the Deptford-road—she said, "Yes," she had done it because she was unable to keep it, and she was sorry for what was done—she thought the child would not remain there long before it was picked up.</p>

I am the wife of George Roseden, a seaman—I live in New Catharine-street, Commercial-road—the prisoner was confined with a boy. at my house, in March last—she remained with me seven weeks after her confinement—at that time I had a person named Boyce lodging in my house—when the prisoner left, Mrs. Boyce had the child to nurse for a fort-night,</p>

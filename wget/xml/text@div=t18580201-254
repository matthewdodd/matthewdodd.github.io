                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on 8th Jan., between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening; his hair and the upper part of his dress was covered with blood—he had a wound at the back part of the scalp, about two inches in extent, and there was another slight wound, but it was of no consequence, it required no application—the other was a lacerated wound, as if caused by a blunt instru<lb></lb>ment—itwould require a certain amount of violence to produce such a blow—thisiron candlestick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would produce such a wound—he must have lost a considerable quantity of blood—he was in the hospital two or three days—I do not anticipate any permanent injury—I have not examined him since he left the hospital.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I speak English very little—Iwork for Mr. Homer, a sugar baker, in Whitechapel—I am not a foreman, but I have got three men under me—the prisoner works under me in the same employ. On 8th Jan. I told the prisoner that he ought to do his work in a proper way, because that would be to the advantage of himself and his master—I said so because the master looks to me for the proper execution of the work—the prisoner said that I intended to put him out of work—I said, no, I did not intend to do any such thing, or I should apply to the boiler or to the master—I then went up to the roof to make an air hole, and when I came down, the prisoner took up the candlestick, and knocked my head, and pulled me by my hair, and the blood gushed out—he struck me more than once; I got so many blows from him that I do not know how many—he made no threat to me before I went up stairs.</p>

Q.</hi> Is the foreman Mr. Nick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a young man, a friend of mine, was discharged a few days before this—I was informed that the prisoner was the cause of the boy's being discharged—I and Cohen did not threaten to give the prisoner a good hiding in consequence—the prisoner did not say that he would leave in consequence of my suspicion of him—I had not been constantly annoying the prisoner, in consequence of my sup<lb></lb>posing that he had caused the discharge of the young man—as soon as they began to work this night, the prisoner did his work wrong—he did not tell Mr. Nick that eleven gallons of liquor would be required—I and Cohen did not call him a d—fool for having said so—I said, if they had it not to-day, it should he had to-morrow—he may have said that he was not going to tell his master a lie; I do not know whether he did; I quite forget—I said he was no man—he had not got the candlestick in his hand at that time, to light the candle; they stood by, on one side—when he got hold of my hair, I got hold of him—I did not stick my nails into his flesh—Philip was one of the men that came up to assist me—I do not know that he put his hands to the prisoner's throat, and nearly'choked him; I could not see—I have never said that I would do the prisoner some serious injury—since this I have been offered 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the injuries I received, and of course I said yes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I was a fellow workman with the prisoner. I remember the prosecutor and prisoner having a dispute on Friday afternoon, 8th Jan.—I do not remember much of it, but I know the pro<lb></lb>secutor told the prisoner that he was no man—the prisoner said that he would be a man to him—the prosecutor was about the place where they put the sugar, and the prisoner took up the candlestick, and gave him several blows—thecandle was lighted at the time he took it up—the candlestick is crooked</p>

               <p>now; it was straight before that—I cannot tell how it became crooked—it was about a foot from him at the time he took it up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were they not quarrelling and fighting a good deal that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not fighting—I did not hear Brandt threaten to give the prisoner a good hiding, not at any time, nor threaten to do him some injury—I seized him by the throat after he had beaten the presecutor—as he took the prosecutor by the hair, I got hold of him—it was not after he had caught him by the hair that the blow was struck with the candlestick—he first took the candlestick and struck him, then he took him by the hair, and pulled him down, and then I took him by the collar—it was not exactly the blow from the candlestick that knocked him down, but he pulled him down by his hair, and the frames of the sugar tumbled down with him.</p>

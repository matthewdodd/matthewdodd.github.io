                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside at 5, Mint-street, Southwark—on the Friday before 17th May, I met the prisoner in Great Earl-street—I asked him if he knew where my son was lodging at present, as he had taken my son, on a previous occasion, to lodge along with him—he said, "No, I do not; but if you will wait here, at Aldridge's, I will go round to Newport-market, and see if he is there"—I gave him threepence to buy some tobacco, and afterwards went with him to a public-house in Newton-street, Holborn—he asked me if I would treat him if he went to look for my son—I said, "I don't mind that, James;" and he said he had a young woman, and he asked me if I would treat her—he went and fetched her, and I treated them—a quartern of gin was called for, and I put down a half-crown—the barman gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, which the prisoner took up, and put in his pocket—when we came out of the public-house, I said to him, "James, you took that change out of that half-crown; give it to me, I want it"—he said, "Your change?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I don't believe you have the rest of the money now"—I had a half-sovereign and two shillings—he saw that when I gave him the threepence, because he asked me to lend him three or four shillings, as he was hard up—I then went across the street, and he said, "Show it me?"—I opened my hand—he snatched the money from my hand, and gave me a violent blow in the face with his fist—he injured the bone of my nose, and it is only getting well now; I could not see a bit afterwards—he ran across to the house where his young woman had come from, next door to the public-house, and ran up stairs—I saw no more of him that day—he left me without a penny, and I was obliged to go into the Workhouse—when he asked me to lend him four or five shillings, I said I could not, as my clothes were in pledge—this is the third time he has served me the same—I have a small income from Lincoln's-inn.</p>

About 8, on the night of 16th May, the last witness pointed out the prisoner to me; he was in Newport-market, driving some cattle—I took him into custody, and told him what he was charged with—he said, "I was with her, but I know nothing about the robbery"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found four shillings, and a duplicate relating to a ring.</p>

I afterwards had some gin with her, and then she said, "Ain't you going to give me something to drink?" and I took her in, and gave her some gin. I put down a two-shilling piece, and she took up the change, and said it was hers. I have a witness to prove that she had a half-sovereign in her mouth, and wanted her to go and drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman—my husband is a sweep, at 31, Charles-street, Drury-lane—I was coming home from work on a Friday afternoon at half-past 2, and I met this woman coming out of a public-house—she said she was going to have a cup of tea next door to the Windmill—as she was coming up, she made a run, and knocked her face against the lamp-post—I went and picked her up, and she asked me to show her where King-street was—I took her as far as Charles-street—she had some money in her mouth, and she put her finger in her mouth, and asked me to have something to drink—I said, "No, I do not require it"—her face was bleeding, and I asked her to allow me to wash it, and she would not let me do so—she was alone—I don't know what day this was—it is about three weeks ago now—I recollect it, because my brother-in-law came home from the Militia on the same day.</p>

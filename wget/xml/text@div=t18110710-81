               <p>JOHN BROWN. On Thursday, the 6th of June, my brother was with me, he said there was a man stealing some lead opposite, I saw the prisoner come out of the house, he had nothing with him; he had a leather shoe and a list shoe on him, this was about six o'clock, about eight o'clock, a little boy said a man had gone out of the house with some lead; I pursued the prisoner and took him in custody; he then had one leather shoe and a list shoe. I am sure he is the same man.</p>

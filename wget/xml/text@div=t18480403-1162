                  </hi> I am a beer-seller at Wandsworth. On 23rd March I was outside my house, and saw the three prisoners, as if in conversation together—I thought they passed something, but I could not be positive—they then separated—Watson came towards my house, Howell came into my house, the others passed by—Howell was in my house before me—when I got in my wife gave me a shilling and said, "Give this man his change"—I did not like it, and said, "This won't do for me, this is not good"—I partly bent it—he took it and said, "To convince you that I did not mean to pass bad money, I will destroy it"—he put it into his mouth and bent it partly double, he then went but—I gave information to the police—I saw them again the same day after they were taken.</p>

               <p>Sadler, went in the direction pointed out to me, and saw the three prisoners in a lane leading to Merton—they were about ten yards apart—I saw Roberts and Watson join afterwards—I got assistance and took them—a small knife was found on Hewett, on Roberts a good half-crown, and on Watson two canvass bags—there were twenty shillings and a half-crown, all counterfeit, in one bag, and amongst them were two bent shillings—in the other bag were sixteen sixpences, seven fourpenny pieces, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good.</p>

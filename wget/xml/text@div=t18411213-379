                  </hi>. I am waiter at the King William the Fourth public-house, in King William-street, Strand, kept by Mrs. Charlotte Ashton. About ten minutes to nine o'clock, at night, on the 1st of Octo<lb></lb>ber, I missed the plate that covered the coal-cellar, and the next morn<lb></lb>ing, about eight, the prisoner came, and said my mistress was fineable if she did not have the plate down, and he asked to be employed to put one down—my mistress asked him what it would come to—he said, "About 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—she employed him to put it down—this one—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—is the same pattern, and the same size as the one we lost, and I be<lb></lb>lieve it to be the same.</p>

             as cook. Thursday evening last I used the silver skewers and cleaned them, and hanged them on a nail in the kitchen; I did not miss this skewer at all till it was sent home from Marlborough-street; I know it is my lady's skewer.</p>

               <p>I have got the skewer, I got it of the boy, he offered it for sale yesterday afternoon at four o'clock; I asked him how he came by it? he said, a servant gave it him for four shillings he owed him; I said it was not at all likely, you must either tell me how he came by it or go before the justice; when he got into the street there was a boy an acquaintance, and he said that boy picked it up; that boy ran away, I secured him and took him to the justice; we found that it was Lady Burgoyne's.</p>

               <p>Harper. I saw him come into the kitchen between eleven and twelve, as much as I can tell, yesterday, with charcoal and salt, and other articles that we had ordered from his master's; he did not stop above two or three minutes the farthest, I was in the kitchen and my lady and the governess, my lady was writing a bill of fare out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skewer in such a part of the kitchen as he could get at it? - Yes, he put the salt very near where the skewer was hanging on the dresser.</p>

            's? - I don't know any further than by her crest, and I had bent it in using it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in Lady Burgoyne's kitchen at past eight o'clock for my master, and I had a sand sack in my basket, and I was in a great hurry, my master told me to make haste home again; I catched up my sand sack in a hurry and put it into my basket, and put it on my shoulder and came home again, and when I had sawed about half a dozen sticks several of these pieces of wood tumbled on this basket, and when I came to take the sack out of this basket these two pieces of a skewer dropped out of them.</p>
               <p>Court to Harper. How long have you lived with lady Burgoyne? - About fourteen months. This boy came almost every day with things since Lady Burgoyne came to town.</p>

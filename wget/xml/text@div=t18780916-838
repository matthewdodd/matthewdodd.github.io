                  </hi>. I am a boot maker of 15, Leicester Street, Leicester Square—on Saturday, May 4th, between 12 and 1 p.m., I was in Lock's Fields alone, and saw the prisoner smoking a short pipe—I asked him the way to Sarah Ann Street—he said "I will show you"—he stopped a moment and then followed me, and pointed out where I was to turn—he said "That is the street," and turned round and took hold of my watchguard, broke the watch off, and ran away—I halloed "Thief," but every one appeared to be at dinner—I next saw him at Lock's Fields about two months after I suppose—he was placed with six or seven men—I could identify him from a thousand at once—I had described him to the police as well as I could, and gave the number of my watch, which I have never seen since.</p>

I took the prisoner from a description I saw in the "Police Information," and took him to Lock's Fields Police-station, and placed him with seven others—Jones came in and was standing looking round, when I said, "Go closer to him, you will see better then"—he began at one end of the row, and when he got to where the prisoner was, he said, "This is the man," without any hesita<lb></lb>tion—when</p>

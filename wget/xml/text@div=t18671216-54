I keep the King Henry the Eighth public-house at Islington—on 19th November the prisoner called at my house—he said that he had come from Mr. Denyer respecting a situation in the country, and he handed me this letter.

Denyer, and recommended the prisoner as a suitable person for a situation, and at the end were the words</hi>, "in the meantime you can send by the bearer two bottles of your best champagne, I am coming down on Friday to settle with you"—I gave the prisoner four pint bottles of champagne instead of two large ones, as I believed the letter to be Mr. Denver's writing.</p>

               <p>I was at my work, and I saw them two men go up to a dunghill and fetch a load from it; I was digging a common fewer in the field the second day of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from you? - The length of one field. I saw the men take something out, but what it was I could not tell; I pursued after the men, and I went and spoke to the constable, and while I went to the constable, he went into the house, and I could not tell rightly where he was; I went to the dunghill and there I saw a piece of lead; from there I went to the commissioners of our town, and they granted a warrant, and we searched, and we found a great quantity in this man's house, where they live.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose lead it is that was found there? - Mr. Buddle has swore to some of the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he swore to that found in the dunghill or that found in the house? - That found in the dunghill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whereabouts was it you was at work? - At Sommer's town, about a quarter of a mile from Camden. This lead was in the dunghill about half way from Somer's town to Camden.</p>

While I was walking in my garden with Mr. Willington, I saw two men with table-cloths under a hedge in my field, near the house of a woman who washes for Mr. Cornwall; it occurred to me that they had been taken from the washerwoman's hedge, which was in the next field; I called out to them, and asked them what they were doing with the linen; and I jumped over the pales into the field, with an intent to take them, but they separated, and one ran one way, and the other the other way, and each dropped a table-cloth; this was between eleven and twelve o'clock at noon. I am certain the prisoner was one of them; he was taken almost immediately. Mr. Cornwall's washerwoman used to hang her linen on the hedge of the field next to mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 249). At half-past 2 o'clock on the afternoon of 25th July, I was in company with Sergeant Rock, went to a coffee-shop in the Waterloo Road—while we were there making inquiries the prisoner came in—he said "Halloo"—no answer—he sung out halloo again to the woman who was upstairs with us—we were making inquiries respecting another person—we went down stairs and saw the prisoner—he had this sack on his shoulder—"Is the governor in "he says—"No, he is not"—"When will he be in"—"I do not know"—he said "I have some corn here; I will leave it and call back in a few minutes"—he came back in about ten minutes—I said "This is not corn"—he made a sort of a laugh—he said "I call it anything"—I said "I never heard bacon called corn before"—this bacon was in the bag—I asked him where he got it from—he said from Greenwich—I said "Where"—he said he bought it at a shop—I said "What shop"—he said "It was left for me at the Eight Bells public-house to bring to Lorrimore Road, Walworth "to Mr. Benedick"—I asked him where he lived—he said at Wardour Street, Oxford Street—I was not satisfied with his answers and took him to the station—he got on a horse and carried the bag.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he first came he called upstairs twice "Is any<lb></lb>body at home?"—he called twice—the mistress of the coffee-house answered at last—he said "Mind this corn"—I never heard the slang term <hi rend="italic">graun</hi> as applied to bacon—he gave four or five different statements about this bacon.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 21). I was with the last witness when the prisoner came into the shop and called out "Anyone at home"—he knocked several times—the landlady said "No, the governor is not in"—he aid "Where is he?"—she said "I do not expect him in for some time"—he said "I have a bit of corn to take care of, I will be back in about 10 minutes"—he threw it on a stool and left—in about 10 minutes he came back—I then went up to the sack and questioned him</p>

               <p>about it, and found not corn but bacon—he said it had been left for him at the Eight Bells to take it to a house in Lorrimore Square to a man named Benedick.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 72, Thames Street, Greenwich—I identify the piece of bacon as the property of my employer by the cut of it—I cut it myself—I last saw it about 4 o'clock last Saturday week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is a peculiar cut—we have a large number of sides of bacon in our warehouse—perhaps a hundred, but we only have forty sides of this kind every week—until Sergeant Rock came I was not aware that we had lost any—this I positively swear is one of three sides we had.</p>

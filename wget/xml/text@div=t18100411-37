               <p>Q. Had you seen him any where near the orchard where the mare was lost from - A. Yes, about eight o'clock I saw him pass me, it was quite moon-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was him - A. Yes, I bid him good night, but the answer he gave me I could not understand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any talk with him about the mare. - A. Yes, on the 12th of February he asked me if I was obliged to blindfold her because she was shy, I said, she is the better for it.</p>

             offered her for sale. I claimed my mare, then John Judge came forward, he said he had sold her at Bromley fair. I got my mare again.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt that this mare that you got from this Edwards was your own mare - A. I am sure it is my own mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, is that the person who was at your orchard - A. He is the man that pass'd me about eight o'clock in the evening; I have known him for a twelve month; he once kept Walton-bridge-house, about a mile and a half from me, I am quite sure of his person.</p>

            What marks had the mare - A. She had a star in her forehead, and blind in the off eye, and broken on the off knee before, two white feet behind and a sand crack in one of the hoofs; I am certain it is my mare.</p>
               <p>JOHN JUDGE. I am a currier. I live at No. 6, Market-street St. George's.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at Bromley fair on Wednesday the 14th of February - A. I was, I got in there about half-past nine, I saw the mare between ten and eleven, I bought the mare, I gave 4 l. 3 s. for her.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the person dress'd from whom you bought it - A. He looked like a farmer's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner's person, what do you think about him - A. There is some resemblance, and more I cannot say; he had a snuff-colour'd coat on, he said he brought the mare from Chersey.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is it from Bromley to Chersey - A. They tell me it is twenty-two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse hot - A. No, there was not a hair sweating about it when I bought it, it seemed as if he had been somewhere to have refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold it again to one Newman I think - A. Yes, he stood by, he wanted to have it, I thought it was rather a broken-back'd one. Mr. Newman gave me 4 l. 10 s. I sold it for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you much talk with the prisoner - A. About five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any talk with him since - A. No more than when we went down to the magistrate, we went in the public-house along with the officer before we went before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recollect the voice as the voice of the person that sold the horse - A. When I bought the mare I had about twenty people round me.</p>
               <p>- NEWMAN. Q. You were by when Judge bought this horse - A. I was. I bought it again and gave him seven shillings for buying it. I saw the man that sold it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe his countenance - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, is that the man - A. I have not a doubt of it, he has had his whiskers shaved off.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110022"></xptr>Q. Did you observe his countenance so as to say he is the same man - A. Yes, I did, I said he was the same man at Hatton-garden office. I observed his voice, and after Judge bought the horse he gave 
               <persName id="t18100411-37-person343">Lloyd</persName>
             a shilling to get some gin and I had part of the gin at the public-house at Bromley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his voice enough so as to recollect him before the magistrate - A. Yes, I am sure it is the same person. Thornton and Lloyd were both by, I have no doubt of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her sold by the prisoner at the bar - A. I cannot say that is the man, he is like him; that man that sold the horse to Judge had long whiskers on, and he was a fresh-coloured man.</p>
               <p>Q. Exclusive of the whiskers does he appear like the man - A. No, I do not think he is.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before the magistrate by the features he resembled the man very much - A. He had a red silk handkerchief on and a red waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the features independent of the clothes, because any man might shift his clothes; do you believe him to be the man - A. I can say no further, I think it is the man by the features.</p>
               <p>Q. to Groves. Do you recollect at the time you saw the prisoner whether he had whiskers on - A. Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. to Newman. Have you any doubt about it - A. I have not in the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went back to Clerkenwell the people said, that man that swore to me, and one Rogers in particular said, that man that swore to me would swear any thing for the price of my blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of them people here - A. No, they were all in custody at the time I was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know no more of the man, I never saw Mr. Judge with my eyes before he came in the country to take me before a Justice. I am as innocent of the crime as you are, I know no more of it. I was at Mr. Hensley's that night the mare was lost.</p>

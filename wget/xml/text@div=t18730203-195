                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and joiner, of East Street, Lamb's Conduit Street—on 24th March, Sunday, the day Mr. Pavia died, I went up to his room; I told him in the prisoner's presence that he was very ill, and asked him if he wished me to go for a physician, and if he considered the doctor understood his disease—he said "No, I will see one on Monday; I shall very likely be better on Monday, and we shall see"—I said "Have you got any relation in London?"—he said "No"—I said "Is there any particular friend you wish to see?"—he said "No"—I said "Should you like to see your clergyman, or the Italian Consul?"—he said "I should like to see the Consul, but I don't wish to trouble you; we shall see him the beginning of the week"—I said "You are so ill, Mr. Pavia, your best plan is to let me go for him now"—he asked me if I knew his address; I said "No;" and he took a pen and ink, and wrote the Consul's address, in the Old Jewry—he said "Very likely you cannot get the Consul himself, but get one of the secretaries"—I went to the secretary, but did not find him, as it was Sunday, and Mr. Pavia died before I got home—on the Monday morning, at 10 o'clock, I went to the Consul—the prisoner went with me, and when she found I spoke my mind plainly at the Consulate, she opened her mind to me after coming home more plainly than I thought it prudent for her to do—we sat down, and had part of our dinner—the prisoner was present, and she turned to my wife, and said "Well, I have as good a right to the bonds as anybody else; he has no relation in the world; the bonds are mine; the Italian Consul will not give you anything; and you need not mind saying you saw Mr. Pavia give me the bonds"—"No," said my wife—she said "You would not if I give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—"No," said my wife, "not if you give me all the bonds you have"—the prisoner turned <hi rend="italic">rusty</hi>, and was never so friendly afterwards—she was present with my wife when Mr. Luciano asked for the cash-box and papers—she took the cash-box out of a cupboard—Mr. Luciano said "Where is the key?" and she took it from her pocket—the prisoner always said the bonds were hers, and that she would stick to them, and she would eat them before anybody else should get them.</p>

It was three days after Mr. Pavia's death that the prisoner asked my wife to say that she saw the bonds given—I had been to make arrangements about the funeral—I could not get the Consul to take it in hand, and they told me to bury him by the parish; but he was a nobleman by birth, and I would not allow it—I saw the cheque for 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. taken from the cash-box—I went to the bank and the bank would not pay it—I may say that I also recognise his watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker—I was fetched to the house in East Street to conduct the funeral of Mr. Pavia—I had a conversation with the prisoner, and fixed the price—when I took the coffin in next day I asked her about the payment—she said that Mr. Pavia died worth a good deal of property, and I need not be under any apprehension about payment—next day we took the outer casing in, and I found she had been removing some of the things—I wanted to know who was to be paymaster; she said that if I went to the Italian Consul they had got some of the property, and they would pay—I was finally paid by the prisoner—when I asked her for an undertaking to pay me, she refused—I said "You have got some Russian bonds; will you deposit one with Mrs. Graham or me as security?"—she said "No"—I said "Or his watch?"—she said "No;" the bonds were hers, and there was no one to prove Mr. Pavia did not give them to her—I asked her how she would manage to draw the dividends on them—she said "I shall take one, and if they pay that I shall be all right for the rest"—I said "Are they transferable?—she said "Yes, they can be sold"—she at last consented, and I drew up a paper consenting to leave the whole of the goods there belonging to Mr. Pavia and herself, and upon that I carried out the funeral; but the body was above ground about ten days—in April she wanted to move the things, and to deposit a gold watch with me so that I should give consent to move them—I said "This is a lady's watch"—she said that it was given to her, and it was in the Exhibition of 1851—I said "I shall retain this as additional security," and that brought her down again on 19th April, when she brought me the money, and after paying me she said "You can swear that Mr. Pavia gave me those bonds?"—I said, "My good woman, are you mad? I never saw the man alive in my life"—I had seen a catalogue of the goods, and she brought it to me again, interlined with other matter—I said "You have interlined this?"—she said "No; it is just the same as Mr. Pavia gave it to mo"—she was the worse for drink, and I don't think she was sober from the time I first saw her till after the funeral—I said "As sure as your name is Jones, you will be charged with stealing the bonds"—she said she did not care, and sooner than give them up she would tear them up and eat them—I had to order her out of my house—her language and ways were disgusting.</p>

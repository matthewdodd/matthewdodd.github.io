               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How came your name to be Ann? - A. That is my christian name.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not known by the name of Black Esther? - A. Yes, but that is not my name.</p>
               <p>Q.Where do you ply from ten o'clock at night, till two in the morning? - A. In the Hay-market, and St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would have these honest gentlemen believe, that a gentleman gave you a two pound note? - A. Yes, that was no object.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go for the gin? - A. To the corner of Prince's-court, Hedge-lane, the man's name is Dolan.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; they are all a combined set together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any watchman that you had been robbed? - A. No; the watchmen were a party concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. I see a gentleman's name upon the back of the bill, that I dare say will explain all this -How came you acquainted with Mr. William Kelly, has he not been acting as your solicitor, in concucting your prosecution? - A. Nobody has conducted my prosecution; I don't know that I ever saw Mr. Kelly till I took out the warrant at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard that there is a reward of forty pounds if this man is convicted? - A. Yes; but I don't come here for that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at Brentford when your friend Kelly stood in the pillory? - A. I am no person of that description.</p>
               <p>Q. So you take two lovers at a time to these places? - A. It was only to have a bit of fun.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you gave any alarm at all? - A. This man keeps a house for all sorts of prostitution; a nasty, unfeeling, disagreeable rascal like that, what chance could I have with him; if I had said any thing, they would have killed me upon the spot; I thought it would be the best way to stop till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the man fetch two watchmen for the purpose of removing you and these two fellows from his house? - A. He had no business to remove us, we paid him for the use of his place, and were very quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not give charge to the watchmen to remove you and the two men? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.This two pound note was not given you by the two men you brought into the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160017"></xptr>Q.How came you to say so before the Magistrate? - A. I said it was given me by a gentleman, in Pall-mall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that one of the two men gare you half-a-guinea, and not content with that, you asked him for more, and then he gave you a two pound note? - A. No, I never said no such thing.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KELLY sworn. - On the 2d of this month, I was at a public-house, in Marlborough-street; I saw the prisoner at the bar there, in the custody of a constable; he told me he had sent home for forty shillings, and fourteen shillings in silver, to satisfy the black, infamous whore, who had charged him with the robbery; I told him, if he had not been conscious he had done wrong, he was to blame to send for the money to satisfy her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know a little of Courts of Justice, I believe, Mr. Kelly - in the first place, I would ask you, if you know this woman? - A. I have seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. She is, I believe, one of the most infamous prostitutes to be found in the night about the Hay-market? - A. I never spoke to her in my life, before I saw her at Marlborough-street; I have heard she is a very infamous woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, have lived by informing? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did live by informing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you stand in the pillory by informing? - A. I did not come here to answer that.</p>
               <p>Court. He is certainly not compellible to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You don't chuse to answer that question? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I am just as well content as if you did -Upon your oath, how many informations have you lodged in your life - I don't ask you within one hundred? - A. Never one hundred.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor caused to be lodged? - A. No, nor yet fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us how you get your livelihood? - A. As well as I can; I assist an attorney, and do a little conveyancing.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be curious enough to know the attorney, who would wish Mr. Kelly's assistance?- A. Is it necessary that I should answer that question?</p>
               <p>Court. I think it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Who is that attorney? - A. Mr. Howard, No. 16, Charles-street, Fitzroy-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he pay you weekly? - A. No; if I serve a notice, he pays me, or if I serve a writ, he pays me.</p>
               <p>Q.How often may he employ you? - A. Perhaps once or twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is the only way you have of getting a living - what other honest way of getting a living? - (The witness gave no answer.)</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Howard, I believe, is a gentleman, who now and then puts an advertisement in the papers, he is a very generous man, and advertises to lend money? - A. You may know it, but I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q.What other way have you of getting a living? - A. I do business for other gentlemen as well as Mr. Howard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are they? - A. Mr. Wilkinson, who lives near there.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you work for him? - A. Three or four times a week.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is the only way you have of getting a living? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds, if this man is convicted? - A. Not to me; on the contrary, if I thought I was entitled to sorry shillings, I would really give it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds?- A. No; I hope the man's life is not at stake.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you really hope so upon your oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he is charged with? - A. Robbing this woman of forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you did not know was a capital offence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been conducting this prosecution for this woman? - A. No; on the contrary, I am exceedingly sorry I have had to attend here.</p>

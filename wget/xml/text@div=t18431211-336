                  </hi>. I live at Pennington, in Nottinghamshire, and am captain of two boats. On the night of the 10th of Dec. I was at Bull's-bridge, Mid<lb></lb>dlesex, and the prisoner was there—I went to bed about ten o'clock—I awoke about three, and the prisoner was gone—I went on about three miles, till I got against the cemetery—I then went to the hold, and missed a truss of hay, a horse-collar, and the rope—I then went to look in my other boat, and the other rope was gone—I got through Paddington-stop, against the Regent's-canal, and the prisoner was beginning to get his boat through the tunnel—I saw him throw some ropes overboard—I found the ropes afterwards, and they were mine.</p>

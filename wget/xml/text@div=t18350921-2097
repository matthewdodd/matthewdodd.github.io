                  </hi>. I keep the White Horse public-house, at New Charl<lb></lb>ton, in Kent. On the 6th of September, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner and another came in—they called for some ale—they put down a sovereign, and paid for it—they then called for half-a-pint of gin—I saw they had had enough; and I told them, as soldiers, to keep sober, and go to their barracks—they went into my parlour, and drew the door to—when I would not draw them the liquor, away they went—I saw them go into the road—I then went into the parlour, and missed the candlestick—I had no suspicion that they had taken it till the next morning, when the watchman brought the candlestick to my house.</p>

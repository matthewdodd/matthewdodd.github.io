            , there is a shop door and a private door, there is a communication from the passage into the shop and a shop door besides. On Tuesday the 24th of June, I believe about a quarter before twelve in the day, I took a piece of cloth and some nankeen and set it on the counter, the cloth might be a yard and three quarters in length, I was going to make use of it; that moment I was sent for to measure a gentleman about three hundred yards off, I did not stop above twenty minutes, when I came back I missed the piece of cloth and the nankeen; I had measured the prisoner the day before for his livery.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you see your own door when you stood there. - A. Yes, all the time; the prisoner returned and went into the shop while I was over there, and before I crossed the road he came out of the door, tucking something under his coat, and he was buttoning it; I knew he had robbed the shop, I ran round the corner of St. James'-street after him, but seeing I could not overtake him, and my having left the shop, I returned back again.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not taken then. - A. No, a very few minutes after that Mr. Trayner came in, I told him the shop had been robbed, he looked about to see what he had lost, he missed the cloth and the nankeen; after that, in the afternoon the prisoner came again, I wished very much to accuse him of the robbery, Mr. Trayner prevented me, he said he wished to speak to the gentleman about it, sir

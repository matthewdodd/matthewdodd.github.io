I went out about nine o'clock that morning, leaving my wife and Elizabeth Smith alone, but nobody else; I returned about a quarter before two o'clock- I went up into the second floor front room, which I use as a sitting-room, as a study; I missed from there two coats; I was going to change my coats: I took no notice of it, except that Smith was in the room at the time, and I asked her where the coats were - she said she did not know: I said nothing more to her then; Mrs. Bartholemew was out; she came in a little after two o'clock, and went up stairs in the second floor back room, which was a bed-room; I still remained in the front room - Smith was still in the front room with me. I heard Mrs. Bartholemew call to Smith; the door between the room being open she called to Smith, and asked her if she had been emptying her drawers; Smith said she had not touched the drawers - I then said I missed two coats: my wife opened several drawers, but I was not in the room at that moment; we called in a neighbour or two, and I immediately went to Marlborough-street for an officer; I have never found my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100006"></xptr>coats again - they were worth about 2l. 10s. together: very shortly after I missed some shirts and black stockings, some of which have been found; I saw them in the custody of Phillips, an officer.</p>

            . I am the wife of Valentine Bartholemew. I remember my husband going out on the morning of the 2d of February; I went out at half-past eleven o'clock, and left Elizabeth Smith in the house - nobody else to my knowledge; I believe she let me out, but am not certain: I returned a little after two o'clock; I went up stairs, passed through the front room, spoke to my husband, and then went into the back room - the two rooms communicate; I opened one of the top drawers, and found it empty - I called to Elizabeth Smith, who was in the front room, and said, "Why, Elizabeth, have you been taking any thing out of this drawer, and emptying it?" she said No, she had not touched it; my husband then said he missed two coats: I opened the other drawers, and found them all empty almost, except one; a great many articles were taken away - a few of them have since been found: five or six shawls were taken away; three of which, two good ones, and an old one have been found; one of those missing was worth about 2l. 10s., and the other about 30s.; I afterwards examined, and missed a silver watch from the front room chimney-piece; it was mine, and had been my father's; my husband was not in the habit of wearing it; I had seen it the day before, but do not recollect seeing it that morning; I had put it there to get mended several days before - it has not been found; it was an old silver French watch, worth about 10s. I suppose, but do not know the value; it had a glass on one side - I do not think it had a double case; some work-boxes were gone - two of them have been found. Susannah Thompson, Sen. had been employed in the house as a laundress, in the early part of the week, I think, but forget on what day. I missed some miniature portraits from the drawing-room where the small work-box was taken from - they have not been found- they were worth about 5l. I suppose; there was a snuff-box with my mother's portrait on it; it was my father's box; the box and all was gone - I suppose the whole together was worth 5l.; I missed more linen from the same room, also a gown and silk shawl. I never saw the younger Thompson at our house.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre, part of which is in Middlesex. On the 2d of February about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner Thompson, Sen. near the door of Mr. Stafford, a pawnbroker, in St. John's-street, in St. Sepulchre's parish; I did not know her before - she had a bundle in each hand; I asked her what she had got there, she said a box; I said"Who does it belong to?" she said it belonged to her daughter; I asked where her daughter lived; she said in Windmill-street, at the West end of the Town: I asked where she was going with it - she said she had just been and taken it out of pledge for her daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Speakng of the box? A. Yes; I told her I did not believe that story as I knew she just had been offering to pledge it; I told her so - she said it was a fact and nothing but thetruth; I told her I should take her to the watch-house, she said very well, and I did so: I untied the bundle at the watch-house - one handkerchief contained the largest work-box and nothing else: I asked her what was in that box' she said it was a work-box: I said I saw it was - I turned it to the light to examine it, and finding the lock had been forced, I said "Oh! this ayn't all right." I untied the other bundle and found another smaller work-box on the top and that had been broken open; I found some shawls, and shirts and other things in that bundle; they are all here - I searched her person and found a pawnbroker's duplicate for another shirt, which the pawnbroker has here and belongs to the prosecutor; I found a small bit of soap in her pocket, which appeared to have been used - I asked if she had been at work with it, she said she had not been at work since the Wednesday; I produce the property which I found on her - I am a shoemaker by trade; I have no idea of the value of the work-box - it is fitted up.</p>

               <p>MRS. BARTHOLEMEW. I know this work-box - it is one of the things lost; it is fitted up; there were more things in it when I lost it; there was a gold seal; I know this small work-box and the other things here are three shawls, and this linen is all ours. All these things were missed from the house - I had seen the shawls safe - I had taken two of them off the evening before; part of the linen was in use; I had seen the large work-box that very morning just before I went out - my drawers were not locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe Smith's box was opened and searched? A. Yes; Clements searched it; I was not present.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street Office. On the 2d of February Mr. Bartholemew came to the office, and I went to his house between two and three o'clock: I saw the prisoner Smith there, and questioned her who had been there, after her master and mistress went out: she said nobody; I said, "Have you been out yourself?" She said not. - I asked her who her acquaintances in London were; she said she had no acquaintances in London - that she came from Salisbury. I said it appeared very singular, for no force had been used, and the robbery must have been done by some person acquainted with the house; I told her so, she still said no one had been there, and she had not been out. I asked if she had lived in any other situation before she lived with Mr. Bartholemew; she said she had lived with Mrs. somebody (whom she named. but which I forget,) in Margaret-street, and that she had been a very short time at that person's house; that before that she lived with Mr. White, a shoemaker, in Oxford-street, and before that at Mr. Porter's, Sidney-street, Mile-end. I went to Sidney-street, and I found no such person; it was a new street, and not finished; I went in company with Mr. Bartholemew to this house in Margaret-street; and found the person she named, but whose name I forget. I left her in the custody of Goddard, and went out to make these enquiries with Mr. Bartholemew; and in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100007"></xptr>consequence of information which I received, I went to No. 44, Windmill-street, and found Susannah Thompson, Jun. there, living by the name of Mrs. Williams; there was a man named William Wood with her; this was near six o'clock in the evening; I asked Susannah where her mother lived - she told me she lived in Noel-street, but that she had sent her to the City to get some money to pay her rent in Windmill-street; I went to Noel-street, leaving Goddard with her - I waited at Noel-street the greatest part of the night, expecting the elder Thompson to come, but she did not; I went back and took Elizabeth Smith to the watch-house - Avis, another officer took Susannah Thomposn, Jun. to the watch-house; I left Mr. Bartholemew at Noel-street while I was absent, and returned there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you told Smith no force was used, were you aware that Mrs. Bartholemew had left her drawers open? A. I was not aware of it then, I have since heard so - I should say I also examined several valuable dressing-cases at the house, which had been unlocked.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street - I went with Clements to Mr. Bartholemew's and heard the conversation he had with Smith - he has related it correctly - I was left with Susannah Thompson, Jun. but had no conversation with her: I should say, that in the absence of Bartholemew and the other witness I was alone with Smith for upwards of an hour; I did not desire her to make any confession, but she said she hoped that if Mr. Bartholemew and Clements had gone to Mrs. Thompson, that Mrs. Thompson would say Mrs. Thompson had not been there that day, for that Mrs. Thompson and her daughter had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. She said they had been there? A. Yes my lord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she tell you at the same time that she was afraid of letting her master and mistress know these people had been there, as they had been forbidden the house? A. No; I sat down in the kitchen while she got her tea and cleaned herself: I asked her if Mrs. Thompson the charwoman had been there, and she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not, in the course of the conversation, say that Mrs. Thompson had been denied the house by her mistress, which was her reason for saying at first she had not been there then? A. I recollect nothing of the sort - it could not have passed and I not recollect it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You at first enquired if Mrs. Thompson had been there? A. Yes, and she denied it; she afterwards said if Mr. Bartholemew and Clements were gone to Mrs. Thompson, that she hoped she would say she had not been there, but that she and her daughter had been there.</p>

            . I keep the Duke of Bedford public-house, Golden-lane; the name of the sign was changed on the licensing day, the 13th of March - it was called the Lionand Lamb in February; the prisoner Susannah Thompson, Jun. frequently came to my house with Wood, her husband; I think they have been there about half a dozen times, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on any occasion, Susannah asking whether her mother had been there? A. I have some slight recollection of it; I think it was Wood or the woman, I cannot till who - it was in the evening, but I cannot tell on what day; I attended at Marlborough-street on the 8th, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the substance of the question to enquire whether her mother had been there? A. Yes; I am sure that was asked; that is all I recollect - I did not know her mother; I never saw her till I saw her at Marlborough-street, which was on the 13th of March, I think; Susannah Thompson, Jun. and Wood were at my house perhaps a week of a fortnight before that time - that was the last time that I saw them.</p>


               <p>MRS. BARTHOLEMEW. I went outabout half-past eleven o'clock that morning - Smith either opened the street door for me, and either shut it herself or I shut it myself - I am certain it was shut, it might be opened from without by a latch-key - my kitchen is down stairs in the basement, the house has two rooms on a floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door was not left open when you left the house? A. I think not; she washed the door - but I think that was after I left. Two of these shawls are India, and worth about 26l. together - I did not buy them, they belong to my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. The two together then are certainly worth more than 10l.? A. O yes - Smith had been ten days in my service; I had her from a person in Margaret-street, where she had lived as a servant about a month, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you forbidden either of the Thompson's your house? A. Not at all - I never saw the young one, and did not forbid the house to the mother; she was recommended to me by Elizabeth Smith; she came to the house one day as a charwoman - I believe it was the day after Smith came; she was afterwards there two days to wash and iron.</p>
               <p>MR. BARTHOLEMEW. When I came home, I knocked at the door, and rang I believe - Smith opened the door and let me in; it would require a latch-key and a large door key also to open the door from without - for both the latch and the bolt of the lock were kept fastened usually; it is a spring lock - it is possible the latch might not have been down, as it was occasionally propped up with a piece of wood, which we had frobidden - the lock was a good one, I had previously had it repaired.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you been out? A. I went out at nine o'clock and returned a little before two.</p>

            . I have come here in custody from Clerkenwell Prison - I was sent there on the Monday after the officer came and found me and Susannah together; I was taken on a charge of robbing Mr. Bartholemew's house - I know all the three prisoners; the younger Thompson lived with me at No. 44, Windmill-street - she lived there before I knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her, or her mother first? A. I knew her first - she came to see her brother in the ship which I came from Bermuda in; I had no connexious in London, and went home with her brother to lodge at her mother's house, at No. 5, Queen-street, which goes out of Windmill-street; I had returned from Bermuda about three months when I was taken up - I and Susannah had lived together from the time I came on shore, which was the 2d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. That would be but two months - did you ever go with Susan, the daughter, to Mr. Bartholemew's? A. Yes, on the Wednesday before the Saturday the robbery was committed, we went there and I lunched in the kitchen with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100008"></xptr>Elizabeth Smith there, that was on the Wednesday before I was taken up; Mrs. Thompson was there ironing at the time - while I was there Smith told me she wished she had known I had been transported before; I had been transported for 14 years, but got the King's pardon after seven years for my good behaviour, and was allowed to return home.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to know you had been transported? A. I suppose Mrs. Thompson must have told her so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any reason for wishing to have known it before? A. She said she could have loaded me and Mrs. Thompson, and all of us with plate, from where she had lived before; she asked me if I could sell some tea spoons for her that she had in pledge, and which she had taken from the place she was in before; she told me the first opportunity she had, she intended to take some property from Mr. Bartholemew, that there was not much plate there, but she would take what there was, mentioning what there was - she said she was tired of her place, for there was so much work to do; she said Mr. and Mrs. Bartholemew had a present made them a little before of some spoons, and I think a tea pot and fish slice; I do not think she said much more - Mr. Bartholemew came in; he knocked at the door, and before she went up to let him in, she put me and Thompson, Jun. in a kind of coal cupboard, under the stairs, and shut us in; I believe she then went up to let him in - either she or Mrs. Thompson did; I do not know whether he came down stairs - I heard him somewhere, and Smith gave him two letters, which I had seen come in while I was there; she then let us out and told us we had better go home - she said nothing more at that time; she had said that when Mr. and Mrs. Bartholemew were out, she would send for me down to Susannah Thompson; she did not say who she would send for me; I lived about a mile or more from Mr. Bartholemew's, this was on Wednesday, and on Friday evening Mrs. Thompson came to me; I cannot say at what time she told me I was to stop at home the next day, for Betsey (meaning Smith) would come or send down for me, for she wished to see me particularly; I cannot say whether Susannah was with me at this time - Mrs. Thompson slept there that night, and went out about nine o'clock in the morning and said she was going to Mr. Bartholemew's, at Foley-place - I staid at home - she went out alone - her daughter went out about an hour after that, it was before the mother returned; Mrs. Thompson returned first and told me Betsey wanted me; that I was to go with her directly; I went with her to Foley-place; I had not seen Susannah in the mean time; I did not go into the house - Mrs. Thompson said I had better go into the public-house and wait till she went, and told Betsey I was come; I went into the public-house, in Foley-place - I do not know the sign; Mrs. Thompson came to me there alone, in about ten or twenty minutes, and told me Smith wanted me; I went with her into Mr. Bartholemew's house - Betsey let us in; I did not see Susannah there at all - I had not seen her since she went out in the morning; when Betsey let us in there were two large bundles standing against the parlour door, they might be about the size of the bundles produced; she said nothing to me then, but gave Mrs. Thompson a jug and told her to go for some beer or porter and to make haste back; I stood in the passage talking to Elizabeth till Mrs. Thompson returned; she told Mrs. Thompson she had better carry out the two bundles, that people might think they were laundry clothes, she being the washerwoman there; she carried out the two bundles; Elizabeth said, I had better take them to a place which Mrs. Thompson knew of, where they could be disposed of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she then say anything about the tea-pot and plate? A. No. She said she had taken all that was worth having, at least all that she thought she could take without their missing it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Thompson came back with the beer, did she go down into the kitchen? A. She did, and came back directly; she took out the two bundles and carried them to our lodging at Windmill-street. I did not help to carry them at all; we opened the bundles at our lodging; Susannah had not come home then; the bundles contained shawls and shirts, a silver watch, some miniature pictures, and dressing boxes. I tied the things up in two bundles, gave Mrs. Thompson one, and asked her to meet me at the Lion and Lamb, Golden-lane; I took the other bundle into a little street next to Golden-lane, to a Mrs. Phillip's house; I sold it there; it is a place where they buy stolen property; a young man who came from Bermuda with me had taken me there; that was the way I became acquainted with the people; I do not know whether that property has been found; the goods I sold there came to 2l; I received 1l. 19s. as she sent for 1s. worth of beer and gin out of it, which I drank some of; I then went to the Lion and Lamb alone; I did not find Mrs. Thompson there. I waited there I dare say an hour or two, and then went back to our lodging; Susannah Thompson, Jun. Was at home then, and was cleaning up the room. I asked her if her mother had been there; she said, No; I asked her to go with me to see for her, and told her where I had appointed to meet her; this was about four or five o'clock I suppose, but I cannot be certain; she went with me to the Lion and Lamb; I saw the landlord and landlady, and asked if anybody had been there asking for me; they said No, and I believe Susannah said, If her mother came and brought anything, to keep her there, until we came back; she said that, or words to that effect. We went back to our lodging, and had not been there above and hour or an hour and a half, when Clements, the officer, came; I was not taken into custody myself until Monday; I went away after the officers were gone, leaving Susannah there, and did not return; they found me in Golden-lane on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. - Did you tell the Magistrate what you were transported for? A. Yes; I told him it was about a hat, I was charged with it at the time of the Reform meetings at the Manchester riots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell them it was for a riot? A. Not merely; I being supposed to be concerned in the riots, carrying the cap of liberty; I was charged with stealing a hat; I was in prison once before that, and only once, and I was acquitted; it was about some notes that were found; a man said they were found, a gentleman said he had lost them; I was never in prison except on those occasions; I had only been to Mr. Bartholemew's house once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what a skeleton key is? A. I do not, on my oath; I never saw one in my life; I was in the house about an hour when we were hid under the stairs; I was never up stairs at all. Smith put us under the stairs, as she said her master would not like to see us in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not greatly shocked at its being proposed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100009"></xptr>to you to rob the house? A. No - I was sorry afterwards that I had been so foolish as to be led into it; I was partly forced into it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not shocked at all? A. I had spent all my money; I gave information, I think, about a week after the robbery. I was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information because you were shocked and sorry, or to save yourself? A. I would have told at first, but I was afraid of myself; I gave information because I was sorry for what I had done, and to save myself - I could not sleep, for I felt I had done wrong, and that was the reason I told - that was my only reason; I would have told before, but I was afraid of other people taking my life, if I had been put among them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you never say you gave information to save your own neck? A. No, nothing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that the prisoner Smith was as innocent as a child unborn; and that you had impeached her and the other prisoners to save your neck? A. I never said that; I always said we were all innocent, because I was afraid to say we were guilty; I never said the reason I gave information was because I knew the officers were in search of me. I know Joseph Jones - he was in Clerkenwell prison - he was there for trial for something; I do not know what; I never said any thing to that effect to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner THOMPSON, SEN. Which way did I go with the bundles, or did I fetch them out of any public-house. I deny fetching them; he says I went to a public-house, and that he had a glass of ale, I a glass of gin, and fetched him out, and I did nothing of the kind; the publican was brought forward, and said he never saw me - did I go to you and say Smith sent me for you to come and take away the bundles? Witness. She said Elizabeth or Smith had sent her for me.</p>
               <p>MR. BARTHOLEMEW re-examined. Q. Do you remember going home on the Wednesday, before the Saturday? A. I cannot recollect it - I certainly was at home on the Wednesday; I believe it was on Saturday that Smith gave me the letters, but I do not recollect. We had no silver tea-pot; we had a plated fish-slice, but not a silver one; we had no plated tea-pot.</p>
               <p>- YOUNG. I am a pawnbroker. I took this shirt in pawn, which the witness Walker has produced; it was pawned by a woman, and who I believe, to the best of my recollection to be the prisoner Thompson, Sen. - I had never seen her before to my recollection.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I am quite innocent of the charge; I never saw that man.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON, SEN.'s Defence. On the Wednesday I was ironing for Mrs. Bartholemew; I finished all but the servant's things, and she asked me to come on Saturday and finish ironing her things, and to bring my daughter and have a bit of lunch, when she had her dinner. I went according to my promise on the Saturday, to iron her caps- I was there about eleven o'clock; she said her master was gone out, but her mistress was up stairs, but she thought it did not make any difference, as her mistress never came down stairs; my daughter came soon after, and gave me a letter to take into the City, where I go to receive money; before I went with the letter I had half a crown from Elizabeth to fetch some beer for lunch; I left the door ajar, and when I came in with the beer Wood came in, and went up stairs. we all three went and lunched down stairs together, and when I went into the City Elizabeth came up and let me out - Wood was there without his coat; he said he wanted some money, and gave me his coat to pawn, which I did for 4s.; I returned back, and knocked at the door; he came down stairs, and let me in; I went through the the shop, thinking nobody was there, and he asked why I knocked; he gave me a bundle tied in a handkerchief, and told me to go to the Lion and Lamb in some lane, I forget the name - I went to Finsbury-square, and inquired for Mr. Lankston; I had been to Mr. Lankston's before, with a letter for some money. I went to Hill-street, where he gave me a letter to go to one Callaghan; I went there, went into a public-house, and ascertained where Callaghan had lived, and found he was gone away; I came back with the letter again: and on Saturday I could not find Mr. Lankston out, and went to the landlord at the corner of Hill-street, thinking he might tell me, but not finding him I returned to my daughters, and as I was going in I met a person who said the officers were after me, and she thought they were at my daughter's - I returned to St. Martin's-lane, and went into a pawnbroker's, opened the bundle, took out a sheet, and pawned it for 4s. - I then went to Hill-street, Berkley-square, again, thinking I might meet him; I asked a woman to direct me to the pawnbroker's; I went and offered the box - the pawnbroker said I did not get the things honestly; I did not know what was in it, but being in confusion I wished to get rid of the things - the officer took me when I came out- Elizabeth Smith had given me some bundles. A witness said he had seen me with two bundles; I said it was Wood did the robbery, and gave me the bundles; Smith knew nothing of it, nor does my daughter. Wood is the man who did the robbery, and he has Mr. Bartholemew's coat on his back now; as for Mrs. Phillips I know nothing about her.</p>

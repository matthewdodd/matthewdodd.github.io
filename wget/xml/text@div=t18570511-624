                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, High Street, St. Marylebone. I went to bed about 11 o'clock at night on 22nd April—I was the last up, I believe; I was the last in the shop—I saw the fanlight over the shop door, and the glass of it was perfectly safe, and the premises were perfectly safe—I came down in the morning, about half past 6 o'clock; I did not go into the shop till a quarter before 7 o'clock—I saw a great deal of glass strewed about the floor inside, and the fanlight broken, and on looking I missed a piece of long cloth, which on the night before had been near the fanlight, on the top of a pile of goods—the hole in the fanlight was large enough to admit a person's band and body—it was a large square that was broken—the long cloth was near to the fan light, so that it might be reached by a hand put in—this piece of cloth produced is mine—it is the piece that was safe on the night of 22nd April, and was gone the next morning.</p>

I was on duty in Oxford Street, at a quarter past 4 o'clock on the morning of 23rd April—I saw all the four prisoners walking towards a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in John Street—I followed them—the two men put the two women inside a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and put in something which looked like this calico—the men walked towards Oxford Street, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went away—I stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and found the two women in it, and this roll of cloth—when I stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, the two men ran away—I told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive to Vine Street station, and I took the women into custody—I asked them where they got the cloth, and neither of them would answer me—this is the cloth; I afterwards showed it to Mr. Ensoll, and he identified it—I afterwards went and found the two men together, in a coffee shop in Brydges Street, Covent Garden, and took them in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Mr. Clark, of the Central Criminal Court. It is my duty to make out orders for the costs of the pro<lb></lb>secution for the County generally, and the City of London—it is also my duty to pay orders for the costs of prosecutions in the City cases—on the 4th of last Jan. the prisoner came to the office—he delivered in his recog<lb></lb>nizance-paper and applied for his expenses in the case of John Anderson—he had been bound over in recognizancds—here are his recognizances—he said, "Is there anything allowed for my traveling expenses"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "At Cheltenham"—I asked him if he had come from Cheltenham to attend the trial—he said he had—I asked him when—he said, "Last night" (that would be Sunday, the 3rd of Jan.)—I asked him when he had left London for Cheltenham—he said, "On the Thursday previous"—I asked him how it was he had left for so distant a place, knowing that he had to attend so soon afterwards at the trial—he said, "The fact is, that having left the police force, I had forgotten all about having to attend this case"—I asked him how he had come up to London—he said by a second class train—I asked him how much he had paid—he said, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him how that was. That the second class fare was only 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—(I had Bradshaw's Railway Guide to refer to)—he said Cheltenham was nine miles from Glou<lb></lb>cester, and Paddington was some distance from here, and he had paid alto<lb></lb>gether 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not recollect the exact words of his replay, but I inferred by his answer that it was made up to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—he gave different rea<lb></lb>sons why the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. should be increased to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I acted upon them—understanding he had paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and finding the mileage at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a mile would amount to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he had not paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a mile I allowed him but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each way, that was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the day and night of his traveling to town, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the day of his attendance here. Making toge<lb></lb>ther 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I made out an order to that effect, and I paid him the amount, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the order I made out—he put his signature to ie in my pre<lb></lb>sence—I paid the money—he would have been entitled to half-a-crown as a London witness, he having left the police force—he had been at the office once before, to my recollection—I cannot say that I had known him attend<lb></lb>ing here as a witness—I remembered his name.</p>

               <p>not in a perfect state now—it requires to be examined by Mr. Clark, and signed by him and sealed up and sent to the Chamberlain, and then it would be paid—I pay in advance for the convenience of the witnesses, instead of giving them an order on the Chamberlain, which would oblige them to go some bank—there is an agreement between the City of London and Mr. Clark that he should pay those orders, and they pay him again—the ordinary course would be that this order would be given to the man, and he would take it to another place and get the money for it—instead of that I make out the order and give it him—I should not have paid him this money with<lb></lb>out first making out the order—I should have required his signature as a voucher—this order is quite perfect for the payment of the money by me to the witness—I should not pay a sum of money without getting the signature of the witness to the form of the order, which is perfected afterwards—this order is full and perfect as between myself and the witness, as between my<lb></lb>self and the Chamberlain it has to go through certain other forms, before we get the money—if I were guilty of carelessness I should lose the amount myself—the conversation which I have stated I had with the prisoner is quite accurate—I wrote it down as soon as I discovered the falsehood—I did not give the prisoner the sum of money he mentioned himself, I gave him something more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the payment of this money, I apprehend, where you use ordinary and proper diligence, you would not consider yourself liable to lose the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Mr. Clark is the agent of the City of London for this purpose—I think I excrcised all the caution I could on that occa<lb></lb>sion—I paid him this sum of money on a calculation made by myself, in con<lb></lb>sequence of his having said he came by the second class train, and in compa<lb></lb>rison with the usual charges—I thought the sum allowed him sufficient for a person in his situation—if he had not mentioned that he came by the second class train, and the price of the fare, I do not know that I should have allowed him that sum—I should have asked him the question.</p>

"How can you go home when you have got a trial at the Old Bailey; do you want to get yourself into prison? You are bound over in your own recognizance, and you must appear"—with that he went away—he made no answer.</p>

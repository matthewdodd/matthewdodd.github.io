               <p>I am a washerwoman. On the 29th of April I was sitting out at my own street door on Monday between eight and nine in the morning; I live opposite Mr. Hughes in the same street; I saw a woman running out of Mr. Hughes's house, and Mrs. Hughes crying out, O dear, Mrs. Fox, that woman has got something out of our house; I ran after her and cried stop thief; I did not lose sight of her till I stopped her; she ran down a coach yard, just as I came up to her she threw down the bundle, it was tied up in a black silk handkerchief; I picked up the bundle and told her to come along with me back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she detained then? - She was; I carried the bundle to the justice, and the constable has it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the bundle again? - Yes, they were all the articles in the indictment, except two, which were taken out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>- SANDERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to Marlborough-street; I am an extraordinary constable; I was sent for; I received the bundle of Mrs. Fox before the magistrate; when we took her to the watch-house I searched her, and I took an apron from before her, and this muslin handkerchief came out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Owens. After the alarm, were the things brought back with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought them back? - Mrs. Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these articles, see if you know them? - They are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel. These things were given to me by a woman that was up in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Owen. Did not you hear that there was another woman? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

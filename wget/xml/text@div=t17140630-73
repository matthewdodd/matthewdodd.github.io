It was depos'd by the Witnesses, that a Gentleman having hir'd a Horse of the Deceas'd, brought it home on the 20th in the Evening; and the Deceas'd coming to ask him how he lik'd it, he said but indifferently, which made the Deceas'd very angry. Some Gentlemen (among whom was the Prisoner) sitting in a Box hard-by, one of 'em said to another, you don't know the right Side of a Horse; at which the Deceas'd took so very great Offence (believing the Words were spoke to him) that he would not be perswaded to go away, without quarrelling with some of the Company; and the Deaceas'd going out of the Box, they were immediately engag'd, so that it was not seen who struck first; but the Deceas'd threw the Prisoner down twice, and then they were parted, washed themselves, and were very good Friends; only the Deceas'd chaleng'd the Prisoner to fight him next Morning for five Shillings. They swore positively, that the deceas'd was not down, but as he fell upon the Prisoner, and that he seem'd to make no manner of Complaint of any Bruise; and that he got upon his Horse, and rode home very well, and was seen afterwards drinking at a Publick House, as well as ever to outward Appearance; but on the Day following he was taken with a Fit in Lincolns-Inn-Fields, and fell down, and never came to himself afterwards. The Surgeon swore, that after he was dead, he open'd his Head, and found some Bruises, which were the Cause of his Death; but could not say but those Bruises might be got by his Fall in Lincolns-Inn-Fields. The Prisoner had a great many Gentlemen to his Reputation and Behaviour, and the Jury <rs id="t17140630-73-verdict379" type="verdictDescription">

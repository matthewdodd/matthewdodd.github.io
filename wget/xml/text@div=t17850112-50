               <p>Have you ever had any dealings with her? - No otherwise than she often bought from me some butter and cheese, and about the 22d of November last, as near as I can guess, I bought some stamps of her, she brought them to my house, I never had any conversation about them before.</p>
               <p>Tell us as particularly as you can remember, what passed? - She brought them, and said she found them on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Do you know what number of them there were? - There were about two hundred.</p>
               <p>What did you do? - She asked me to buy them, I told her they were of no use to me, she pleaded poverty very much, and said she was in great distress, and asked me to give her something for them; I asked her what she asked for them, she told me sixteen shillings or half a guinea, or any thing that I would give her, as she was in great distress; I did not give her any thing for them then, they were left at my house for a day or two, and I called on Mr. Thompson on the Wednesday following, and asked him if he did not sell stamps, he told me yes; I told him that a poor woman had found some on Tower-hill, and had left them with me, and I had them to dispose of, he said he would buy them, if they were not forged and were good; I told him I knew nothing to the contrary, but the woman brought them to me, and I took them to him, and he examined them, and thought them to be good, and he said he would give me one pound ten shillings for them; I left them with him, and he told me to call again in half an hour, as he was busy then, and he would pay me; I called again in about three hours, and he was not at home, I called the next day and he paid me one pound nine shillings for them; he said after examining them one pound nine shillings was as much as he could give for them; I took the money, the woman called and I gave her sixteen shillings for them, I never saw her after till I was taken.</p>
               <p>Was you ever questioned about this afterwards? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a messenger to the Stamp-office; on the 2d of December, the Commissioners of the Stamp-office received information that Thompson sold counterfeit stamps, and they sent me to buy some, with Mr. Major the engraver, and Mr. Robinson; I asked for three two-penny, and two fourpenny stamps, he had only one four-penny, I took that and the three two-penny, these are the stamps; the engraver inspected them and found the two-penny stamps to be counterfeited, I and the officer went to Thompson's, we found him at home, Parrott immediately took him prisoner; afterwards we searched the book which his servant gave me those stamps out of, we found two in the book, we begged if he had any more he would deliver them up to us, and save us the trouble of searching the house; he fetched out of the bureau in a little room adjoining the shop, about a hundred and fifty two-penny stamps, which were found to be counterfeits; afterwards the constable took him to Wood-street Compter; I told him if he could tell who he had them from, it would free him from any harm; he said his apprentice should go and shew us where Glover lived, who was the person he bought them of; we searched and could find nothing more, when Parrott the constable returned from Wood-street Compter, we went immediately after Glover, with his apprentice, we found him at home in Red-lion-street, Clerkenwell; we took him to Mr. Thompson's, and after he came there, he said, he thought he could inform us where the person lived, that he bought them of; I asked him if he knew her name, and he said he did not, she told him at the time of buying them, that she lived in White-horse-alley, Clerkenwell; at the same time Mr. Glover's wife came in, and she said she would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120070"></xptr> with me all night, but she would find the person that her husband bought them of; we went to this White-horse-alley, and enquired for a person that scoured saucepans, that was the way Mrs. Glover said, she thought she might find her, and a woman said, she thought she had been gone from there some days, but a little girl came and said, I will go and shew you where the person lives, it is the person that sells stamps; we went with the child to the place where she lodged, and going up stairs the people informed us, she was gone away from there, I told Mrs. Glover to go into the ground-floor, and enquire of the landlord, whether the person was gone from there, and where she was gone to, and if she saw the prisoner, to say that was the person, and I would take her; On opening the door, the prisoner set facing the door suckling a child, and making some silk laces; I told her she must go with me, Mrs. Glover told me she was the person, the prisoner asked me for what, I told her for selling the stamps that were counterfeits; she said she knew nothing of it, when I brought her out I made her lock the door, and put the key in her pocket; and we brought her to Mr. Thompson's shop, in St. John's-street, to Mr. Glover, and they were both taken to Wood-street Compter; then I went to the Temple to Mr. Robinson's chambers, and told him the whole affair, and that I had reason to suspect by what I saw in the room, there was something in the room that should not be there; I went back with the constable, we went first to the prisoner for the key, but she denied having it; we then went back to the room, and found the door locked, but the key was not in the place where the prisoner said she had put it; we broke the door open and searched about, there was a great chest of tools, but no stamps, but among some straw which was the prisoner's bed, I found several parcels in brown paper, which are what I gave to Parrott; after that I looked under the foot of the bed, and there I found the iron engine; in searching under the dresser and in the closets, I found a number of stamps wrapped up in a petticoat, I gave the whole to the constable; afterwards we moved a grate from a trap door, that was in the room where there was a cellar, a coal hole kind of a place, and on moving some hampers, under those hampers I found that model of the engine; we brought the things to the Mansion-house the next day; I went with Mr. Clarke one of Sir

               <p>Mr. Major. The others are all from the same die.</p>

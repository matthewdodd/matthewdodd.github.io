                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Halford, a jeweller, of Queen-square, Aldersgate—on the night of February 10th my husband and I were at a supper party, at a public-house in Paul's-alley, and after supper the prisoner was there, playing a concertina—he had a bag with it—I was about leaving, with my husband, at about 3 o'clock in the morning—I came down stairs first to bid some friends good night, leaving my husband up stairs—I waited for him close to the bar—the prisoner was there, with his concertina in the bag, and I asked him to play a tune—I had seen my watch safe a few minutes before that, in a pocket on my left side—it had a chain to it, and a locket, a gold key, and a ring—the prisoner said, "I must fetch my other concertina," and went into the tap-room—I then saw my chain hanging loose in front, and mised my watch—I then sent for Mr.</p>

               <p>Halford—this watch-chain and other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—when I bid my friends good morning I looked at my watch to tell them the time, and nobody else came near me afterwards but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and the husband of the last witness—on 11th February, about half-part 3, I was called down to the bar of the public-house, and found my wife there, and the prisoner—there were other persons there, but not near him—I observed my wife's chain hanging loose—she said, in the prisoner's presence, "I have lost my watch"—I laid hold of the chain, and said, "And your seals too"—the prisoner said nothing—I had seen him with some cutting pliers that evening—the landlord said, "Nobody shall leave the house till everybody is searched;" and he lit the gas, and pushed the prisoner into the tap-room—I followed the landlord in—there was no one else there—the prisoner put his concertina on the table, on the top of a newspaper—it was in a bag—I had seen nothing else on the table at that time—I moved the concertina, and saw my wife's watch between two folds of the newspaper—the prisoner was standing close by it—I said to him, "The watch is here; the seal and key is not far off"—I asked the prisoner to take his shoes off—he did so; and while he was taking his stockings off I heard something fall on the floor, which proved to be the his and key—I picked them up—it bounded about a yard from him, as he had his foot on a form to take his boot off—he made no observation—I gave him in change—the key is my own make—I am secretary to a society, who were having a supper; and the prisoner made his way into the rooms unknown to the landlord—money was collected for him when he played—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are nippers and pliers in one—I saw him doing something to his concertina with them that evening—after that I found them on him, and took them from him—you could twist a key like this with pliers, but not without—the chain was not divided, but the rings of the watch was left on the swivel—it must have been taken off by two operations—no one was searched but the prisoner—I knew all the persons there, they all belonged to the society.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Yon do not mean to say that this has been snapped with the pliers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt of it—it has been removed by a twist, but you must have pliers to make the twist—it might be done with the fingers, but with the pliers it would be done in a minute—the ring of the watch is left on the splitring now—I had seen the prisoner once or twice before, playing the concertina—he asked permission to come into the room to play, and to receive contributions from the members—he was allowed to do so, and money was collected for him.</p>

            , and my self, (we all belong to one company) were walking in St. James's park between nine and ten o'clock at night; Cheworth was got along with a Gentleman, and they took a walk into the Middle Park, upon the grass, by the corner of Buckingham-house, Ruggles, Smith, and I followed them, (they were together for the space of two or three minutes, we knew what they were doing) Cheworth said the Gentleman had hold of him by what he had; we asked him what he meant by doing so, and we took from him a gold repeating watch, with a chain and two seals, five pence half-penny in money, and three iron keys; I carried them home to my house, and kept the watch a day or two till it was advertised. Mr. Pepys, at the Crown and Sceptre in Fleetstreet, advertised it, with twenty guineas reward, and no questions asked. My wife and I went and received the twenty guineas for the watch: Cheworth was sent to the Savoy, and ordered to go to Flanders; I found neither Ruggles nor Smith knew any thing of writing or reading, so as I ran the risque of carrying the watch, I saved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050049"></xptr> eight guineas for my self, and divided the rest of the money. Smith, Ruggle, and I had three guineas and an half apiece: Cheworth had one guinea; he was to have had half a guinea more, but I said my wife should have that for her trouble.</p>

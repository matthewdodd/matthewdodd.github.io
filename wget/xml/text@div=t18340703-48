            . On Tuesday morning, the 27th of May, in consequence of what my servant told me, I came down stairs, about a quarter or half-past six o'clock, and missed a pair of silver candlesticks, a silver milk-pot, three silver table-spoons, two tea-spoons, two salt-spoons, a pair of old-fashioned salts, the lid of a mustard-pot, all silver, and a metal watch - my silver milk-pot, I believe, was in the kitchen - all the other articles were in the back parlour - when I went to bed, the evening before, the house was all fast - I examined some of the windows and doors myself - I cannot positively state that I examined them all - on missing the articles, I found the inner shutter of the back kitchen forced open, evidently from the outside - the shutter was forced inwards - it was entirely open - the window was open too - a man could have got in without difficulty - the articles missing might fetch about 15l. in their weight of old silver - I was not of opinion that the window was opened from the outside, at first, but on examining I am satisfied from the marks on the frame, that it must have been forced in with great pressure.</p>

            . I am inspector of the police. I was called by Reardon to his master's shop, and took the prisoner into custody - part of two silver candlesticks were delivered to me by Reardon - I produce them - I asked the prisoner where he got the silver from - he said it was given to him by a young gentleman at Islington - I asked him the name of the gentleman - he said it was Cundee - I asked where he lived - he said he did not know, nor could he tell what part of Islington he had met with the young gentleman - I then asked his own name - he said it was George Cundee - I said it was extraordinary his should be the same name: were they related - he said, "Oh the truth is, my father gave them to me" - I asked him where his father lived - he said he had not seen him before for some years, and did not know where he lived - he then said they were given to him in Orchard-street, Westminster, at the end of Union-court, where he said he lodged - I told him I did not believe his statement, and should take him into custody on suspicion of having stolen them - I searched him at the station-house, and found on him 11s. 5d. - I asked where he got the money - he said he had earned it the day before in the Borough market as an occasional porter - he afterwards admitted that he had been a great part of the day at Westminster - I detained the money except 1s. 2d., which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030027"></xptr>he had for refreshment - since the examination before the magistrate, I have examined the shutters of the prosecutor's house, and am entirely of opinion somebody had broken in from the outside - they had attempted to cut a hole in the shutter near the bolt, and at last forced the shutter in.</p>
               <p>MR. CUNDEE re-examined. I know these parts of the candlesticks perfectly well - they are mine, and have been in my family for forty years - they were not broken when taken from my house - I know them from their general appearance, being constantly in the habit of using them - the two parts which have been produced identify with another piece which was brought to my house by a strange man who found it - he brought it to me next day - I do not know his name - I have brought it here - my house is in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell.</p>

            . I lived with Mr. Cundee at the time of the robbery - I recollect fastening the back window the night before, by a bolt on each side of the shutters - I fastened them securely, I am certain - I made it tight and secure - I came first down next morning, at ten minutes past six o'clock, and the things were all missed from different parts of the house - nothing was missed from the back kitchen - I had seen the salt cellars in the house the night before, at half-past ten o'clock in use at supper - I had seen the silver candlesticks at the same time - a watch was also missing - I saw that the night before hanging over the mantle piece in the back parlour - I found the shutter forced down - it opens into the garden, which is enclosed with a low wall - I should think any person could get over that wall - there is a field on the other side of the wall - I had seen all the articles safe in the house the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent - on the night of the robbery I was at work until eleven o'clock - I returned home, and on the morrow I went and offered the silver for sale.</p>

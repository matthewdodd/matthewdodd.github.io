                  </hi>. I live at 19, Church Street, Tower Hill—on 13th December, about 1.30, I was with three friends, in East Smithfield, going home—I was with my cousin and a friend—a man caught hold of me from behind—I was knocked down on the ground, and I was out of my senses—when I recovered, I got up, and felt a pull at my chain—I can't say who did that—I saw my cousin Auguste take hold of a man—when I got up first, I saw four or five men running away—I lost nothing—a policeman came up—there were some men standing on the pavement then, and my cousin pointed out the two prisoners as the men who had assaulted us—the men were standing about four yards from where we were attacked.</p>

I live at 5, Church Row, Houndsditch—on this morning I was out with my cousin—I was walking about four or five steps in front of him, and heard him call out—I turned round, and saw him lying on his back—Murphy was pulling about his coat, as if trying to get it open—I pushed the man away, and got hold of him—Morris came up, and made a cut across three of my fingers, with something sharp, which he had in his hand; I could not say whether it was a knife—I let go of Murphy, and he ran a few steps, and stopped at the corner of the street—there were about five men there—a policeman came up, and I pointed out the two prisoners to him—they were about ten steps away—I recognized them at once—I am sure that Morris is the one that cut my hand, and Murphy is the one that attacked my cousin—it was rather dark; there was a lamp at the corner—it happened in East Smithfield, down by the docks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Charles Spiers, a silk manufacturer, in Spital-square. The prisoner has been employed by him as a silk-weaver between two and three years—he wove hat-bands and galloon—he absconded somewhere about the 30th of May or 2nd of June, 1845—he did not return—on the 15th of Jan. I delivered him some materials to manufacture—this is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—I delivered him sufficient silk materials to manufacture 28 gross of satin bands, 3lbs. 14oz. in weight, that ought to have manufactured 28 gross—20 gross were manufactured, and that left eight deficient—the 20 gross were returned to Mr. Spiers—on the 22nd of March I intrusted him with sufficient to make 27 gross of galloon—he returned 18 gross out of the 27, leaving a deficiency of 9 gross—they have never been returned—on the 29th of March I intrusted him with silk materials sufficient to make 27 gross of silk galloon—18 gross were returned, 9 gross were deficient then—on the 22nd of April I delivered to him sufficient silk materials to manufacture 27 gross of silk—6 gross of them were returned, leaving a deficiency of 22 gross—I spoke to him about these things many times, and his answers were most vexatious and frivolous—sometimes he would say he had lost a brother, at another time that he had been in the hospital, and another time that he had a tumour on the breast, and many other frivolous things—they ought to have been returned in about five weeks after he had them out—on the 31st of May last, in consequence of information I received, I went to his house—I did not get admission then—on the 2nd of June I called again, but could not find him at home—I applied to the Magistrate at Worship-street for his advice, went down again, procured a ladder, got in, and lound Mr. Spiers's work cut entirely from the whole of the four looms which he had there employed for Mr. Spiers—I found</p>

               <p>the remnants of these few cotton bands for the hats—I gave information to the police—I did not sec the prisoner again till the 19th of Jan.—he was then in custody—the silk I gave him was Mr. Charles Spiers' and the galloon too.</p>

                  </hi>. I make galloons for the prosecutor—I worked for the prisoner—on a Saturday evening in June as we finished the warps he wound them up—I did them up in bundles, and I helped him pack them—I do not know what he did with them—I saw him cut them out of the looms and pack them up and put them into papers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and am apprentice to James Hurley, of Teale-street, Bethnal-green, a weaver. I broke some threads of my warp, and went downstairs to fetch another apprentice to help me, but he would not come up—the prisoner was a journeyman of my master's, and went up with me to look at the threads, but did not mend them—I mended them myself—he did not stop above two or three minutes in the room—my master keeps his watch at his loom in the room I worked in, and missed it—I had seen it safe at nine o'clock at night—the prisoner was in the habit of sleeping in the house, but did not come back that night—nobody but him had been near the watch—it was about half-past ten o'clock that I went down for the apprentice—nobody but the prisoner had been in the room—I have since seen the watch at the pawnbroker's—the prisoner went round to master's loom when he was in the room.</p>

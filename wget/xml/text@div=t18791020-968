                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger at Burut-ash Lane—the prisoner was in my employment as assistant about three months, and had authority to collect my accounts—on Saturday, 6th September, my wife gave him instructions—she is not here—I said, "How is it you have not brought Mr. Smelling's money back?"—he said, "I have not got it; they could not see me"—on 6th September I called on Mr. Snelling, who was a customer of mine, and was indebted in the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but did not see him—I did not say anything to him about my going to Mr. Snelling'g—I have never received the money or any part of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I went to see Mr. Snelling first about a fortnight afterwards—Mrs. Sibery put the questions to you—I asked you no questions—no conversation passed between you and myself regarding the money—Mrs. Sibery was the chief person connected with it.</p>

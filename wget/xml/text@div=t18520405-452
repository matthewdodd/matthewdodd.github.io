               <p>in Newgate-street while the prisoner went into Christ's Hospital; she re<lb></lb>turned, we went into a public-house, she produced a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note, got it changed, and gave it to my husband—within a month or two of my husband's death I requested the prisoner to write to let the gentlemen at Christ's Hos<lb></lb>pital know that he was dead; she promised to do so, and nothing more passed on the subject till just before Christmas last, when she wished me to go to Mr. Onslow, the minister of Newington, and to ask him for a paper—she said it was a paper from Christ's Hospital, and I thought she had written over there—she said if I took it in as a blank, and reported his death, I should get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I understood she had written again—she said yes, but she thought the letter was not gone, and that the paper was at Mr. Onslow's—I did not go to Mr. Onslow's—on 5th Jan., this year, she said she had seen Mr. Stathan, the curate, and he said I was to go to Christ's Hospital and get the paper; and that if I took it in and reported his death, I should get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. given me—I went to Mr. Onslow's, and received a paper, which I took home, and gave to the prisoner, as she said as I was going to work, if I would allow her to carry it to Christ's Hospital, it would prevent my losing a day's work; that if the gentleman gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she would give it me, and asked if I was afraid to trust her—I said I was not—I gave her the paper, and went out to work; when I came home she told me she had taken the paper, that there was no one but a boy, and she could not report the death, and give up the paper until the 10th of the month—on the 7th I re<lb></lb>turned home, and she told me my children had burnt the paper, and I should get myself into trouble; I should get locked up for twelve months and she six months, for having the paper destroyed—she said that repeatedly, on different days—on one occasion she said, "Do you wish me to get the money for you?"—I said, "No, Mary; not for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would not have you do it"—she said, "Then say no more about it, the paper is burnt; and if you do I will throw myself in the river"—she always told me that if I said anything about the paper I should be sure to be locked up; in consequence of which I at last mentioned it to Mr. Reed, who lodged in the house, and requested him to go to Christ's Hospital and inquire about it.</p>

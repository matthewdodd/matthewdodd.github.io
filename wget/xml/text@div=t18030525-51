               <p>HENRY LANGHORN sworn. - I received a chesnut horse with this note on Friday, with authority to sell it by private contract; I received the note from a person I don't know, he looked like a person in the situation of an ostler; I received it between ten and eleven o'clock; I made sale of it at twenty-two guineas, the price limited by his note; soon after I received the note and the horse; I sold it in about a quarter of an hour after, (produces the note.) Previous to the horse being delivered, he was claimed by Cobb, therefore I could not deliver him at all; the horse remains with me still; the prisoner came to me on the Monday to demand his money, and to know what became of his horse; Cobb had taken hold of him before I came; he was in custody when I saw him, Cobb and an officer having laid by in wait; I keep these stables in Barbican; nothing particular passed between me and the prisoner; he begged of me to let him go, as a friend of his wanted him, but I would not let him go; I did not hear Cobb claim the horse to be his in the prisoner's presence. (Produces one of the hand-bills.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COBB, Jun. sworn. - I am a serjeant in the second regiment of Foot Guards; Cobb is my father; I went with him to Langhorn's; I do not know the gelding.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROSE sworn. - I was sent for as an officer to take the prisoner into custody; Mr. Langhorn sent for me; as I went up Mr. Langhorn's yard, the prisoner jumped through the window in the yard, and I caught him in my arms; I took him to the Compter, that is all I know.</p>

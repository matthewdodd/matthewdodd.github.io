On the 26th of August, just before twelve o'clock, I heard a violent sereaming, and ran down stairs - on going down I saw the prisoner leaving the street door - Mrs. Clements came out of her room with her hands extended - she appeared to be wounded - I saw blood on her thumb and fingers - I pursued the prisoner, and caught him - he ran, and when he saw me coming out of the door he rather looked round, and mended his pace - I followed him, secured him, and said,"You rogue, what have you been doing?" - he deliberately said, "I have stabbed the woman, and I hope I have done it effectually - I shall die happy to-morrow for it" - I took him back to the house - when I took him into the house I said to Mrs. Clements, "Is this the man who stabbed you?"- she said, "Yes;" and he said, "If I have done it effectually I shall die happy," and after that he asked her to shake hands with him - I said no, he had shook quite enough with her, and hindered him - he said she was the girl he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160013"></xptr>loved, and the girl he would die for - he said he had contemplated this two months to do it, and he had whetted the knife that morning to do it.</p>

On the 26th of August I was on duty in the neighbourhood, and saw the prisoner pursued down Manchester-street - he was stopped, and I came up and saw Saint holding him by the collar - I inquired what was the matter - I took him to the house where the prosecutrix was - I saw her sitting on a chair, and blood flowing from her left side on the floor - I asked him where the knife was - I saw a number of knives lying on the table - he said the knife was gone - I looked among the knives on the table, and asked him which one he did it with - he said it was his own knife - I found no knife on him - a knife was afterwards delivered to me by a brother constable, Jeremiah Haynes, 130 - he is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I state any thing further to you? A. On the road to the station-house, he said it was not done in a drunken frolic, it was meditated in his breast for two months, and he was sorry he had not done it effectually - and at the station-house I said to the inspector, that I must go back to the house to get a doctor to attend the woman, and the prisoner said he wished that I might bring news that she was no more - these stays were given to me.</p>

            . On the 26th of August I was standing almost opposite the house - I heard a scream, and went towards the house, and the prisoner came out with a knife in his hand - he ran about eighty yards, and then Martha Clements came out and said, "Stop him; that is the man" - I did not see him stopped.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to state that in the morning I had no knowledge of what I did - I know nothing of the transaction - I am a stranger in London, and have no witnesses.(The prisoner here handed the following written defence.)"I beg your clemency, your protection, your gracious assistance. I humbly place myself at your feet, imploring your mercy and the humanity of the Court. I have known Martha Clements from my childhood, and at the age of seventeen I have formed a strong attachment for her. Soon after, I entered the East India Company's service, and served in it the term of seven years. On my return to this country, in May, 1833, I landed at Gravesend; I came direct to London, and made inquiries after Martha Clements, and found she was not married, but had a child, who is now living. I remained in town three days, chiefly with her. I left and went to my friends in Gloucestershire, with a full intention (as I then promised) to return in a month, and that we would then get married, as my affections were very great for her, and I believed she felt the same ardent wish for me. When I returned to Gloucestershire, my health became much impaired from the sudden change of climate, and continued so a long time, which prevented me coming to London for nine months. I returned in February last;

             and I, from that time, associated together: we arranged to get married, had the banns put in and registered at Shoreditch Church; we then mutually agreed and cohabited together until circumstances would admit of our union. I am a shoemaker, and with our industry we lived in comfort: we were several weeks in this mutual, and, as I believed, affectionate way. I have done all in my power to make her happy, and resolved to get married in a few weeks. She caused the marriage to be delayed. I was told that she was carrying on an unlawful intercourse with another man, which caused a dispute between us, and much uneasiness to me; she denied it, but in a short time after she proved it to be too true, for she left me and took with this man. I went after her four different times; each time we met, and she told me that she was cohabiting with this man, (

She did not say that she would agree to my wishes, but told me she would come to me at my lodgings: she did not come to me. I was very much troubled and unsettled in my mind since she left me, and from that time I could not rest but thinking of her. The morning I was taken into custody, I drank several glasses of spirits; I therefore lost all command of myself, all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160014"></xptr>reason and judgment.

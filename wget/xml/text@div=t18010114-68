               <p>Q. Was that the skin of one of the sheep that had been in your master's field the night before? - A. Yes, it was a wether sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether, in the month of October, they had either of them any meat in their possession? - A. Yes; about the middle of October, but I cannot be particular to the time, not thinking any thing would come of it; in a chest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140079"></xptr>in the room where Hale and Burgess slept, there was a fore quarter of mutton, a hind quarter, a leg, part of the loin, and some sat in the box.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Inside sat? - A. Yes, and a shoulder wrapped up in a coverlid under the bed; the day before that they dressed a neck, a breast, and a loin.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I saw Hale and Kemp dressing it; they cut up part of the neck into steaks, and the breast they boiled afterwards for their dinners, which gave me a suspicion there was more meat in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the meat in the chest? - A. Yes, I took it all out; my mistress had a suspicion that there was more meat in the house, because they had such a plenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it so as to say whether it had the appearance of being cut up by a butcher? -</p>

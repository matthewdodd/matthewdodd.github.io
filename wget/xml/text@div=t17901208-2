               <p>I saw this gentleman, the prisoner, get on the box, at the corner of Bride-lane, in Bridge-street; he turned them about, and went across the rank to the other side of the street; I thought him an awkward driver, and took notice of him; I thought he had been a footman; I went along-side of him, to the corner of Earl-street; I said, halloo, my friend, what are you going to do with that coach and horses? he said, he was going to take up in Chatham-square; I stood still; I saw him making over Blackfriars-bridge, mending his pace; I ran after him, and hallooed out, stop that coach! as loud as I could; the patrol stopped him; and I ran up as fast as I could; I came up and said, he had stolen the coach and horses; the patrol said, will you give charge of him? I said, I would; I took the coach and horses, and the patrol took the gentleman to the watch-house; Mr. Kay's man came in about an hour after, and he owned them; Mr. Kay was not there himself.</p>

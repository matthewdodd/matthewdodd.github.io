I said I had no money - she swore she would have the silk handkerchief which was round my neck if I did not, I said I would not, and she took it from me by force, I kept hold of her for some time; a short man then came out from the wall with a stick, and asked if I wanted to strangle her. I said No, he told me to let her go, and shook me violently. I let her go, and she crossed the fields and said she would go and get some gin. I found her that night at a public-house close by, with my handkerchief in her bosom - the man searched my pockets after she was gone and found I had no money.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was passing the public-house. I searched the prisoner and found the handkerchief concealed under her arm-pit, under her clothes, she then said he gave her a bad shilling, I found a bad one in her mouth, and two bad ones in her pocket. Carr gave the same account he has now.</p>

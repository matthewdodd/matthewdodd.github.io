                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Warrington, who keeps we Hope and Anchor, public-house, Hereford-street, Lisson-grove. On Wednesday evening, the 17th of June, about ten o'clock, the deceased came to the home—I did not know him before—he was very tipsy—he appeared like a bricklayer—he asked for liquor, which I refused to serve him—he began abusing me in the most shameful manner—I desired him to go away—the prisoner, who is my husband's brother, tried to persuade him to go away—I sent for policeman—the abusive language went on, and at last his conduct was so had that the prisoner turned him out—I did not tell him to do so—nobody assisted him that I saw—he took him by the shoulders and put him out at the door—I saw no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live in Hereford-street. I was at the Hope and Anchor on this evening, and saw the deceased come in—he used most disgusting language—Mrs. Warrington wished him to leave—he then used worse language than before, and refused to go out—he had a stick in his hand—I did not see him flourish it—the prisoner took him by the shoulder and put his face to the door—one part of the door was open—he opened the other part with one hand, and put him out—he did not push him—he put him out on the first step and directly let go of him—there are two steps from the pavement—the deceased had a stick in his right hand, he turned round, and made an attempt to come up the step, and tumbled down backwards on his head—I was standing almost close to the door at the time, and my wife by the side of me—I did not see the prisoner give him a push—he left go of him—the man made an attempt to step, to come into the house again'—the step was worn, and being drunk, he fell backwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hereford-street. About half-past ten o'clock on the evening in question I was at the window of my room, nearly opposite the house, three doors off—I do not knew what distance it is across the street—there is a gas-light, and a light over the house—I saw the deceased on the threshold of the Hope and Anchor, standing with his back towards the curb, going in at the door—I saw the prisoner push him—he then fell backwards, and came in contact with the curb—it was a push from the shoulder or breast—he laid there insensible.</p>

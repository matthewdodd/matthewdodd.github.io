                  </hi>. I am inspector of nuisances to the Greenwich Board of Works. In Ang. the Board authorised the repairing the paving of portions of the parish, and in consequence of some of the old paving stones having been missed, I went on 16th Aug. to Mrs. Silverton's house, and found in the back yard about fifty feet superficial of old paving stones; they were the property of the Greenwich Board of Works—I recognised them as being the old stones which had been taken up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mason and pavior. I contracted with the Greenwich district to do certain paving—in Aug. I was doing some paving works, taking up old paving stones and replacing them with new ones—the two prisoners were employed by me to do that work—at the commence<lb></lb>ment I spoke to them in reference to the old paving stones—from informa<lb></lb>tion I had received I advised them not to sell or dispose of anything, or give any of the old stones away—I ordered them not to dispose of any of them—neither of them said anything to me at any time in reference to having taken away or disposed of any; neither before nor after the paving stones were discovered at Mrs. Silverton's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. About 12th Aug. some paving was being done in front of my house—I saw the two prisoners among the men who were at work there—there was something the matter with the paving in my back yard, and I asked Adams if there would be any of the old stones to dispose of—he said, "I think it is very likely there will be some, how much do you want?"—I said, "If you will go with me, I will show you"—he went with me to the back of my house and measured the ground with his line—he said, "I think we shall have enough"—I said, "When shall I know if I can have it?"—he said, "In about three days"—this was about 12 o'clock—I went out that afternoon, and came home about half past 4 o'clock, and found the stones had been delivered, and they had injured my staircase very much—I went out immediately—I saw Adams, and said, "I find you have brought the stones in my house"—he said, "I have"—I said, "To the injury of my wall, how came you to injure my wall in this way?"—he said, "I am very sorry for any injury I have done, but the stones were very large; I will call the other man, I did not take them in myself"—he went and fetched Butler, and I talked to him respecting the injury they had done—they both said they could not help it—Butler saw it in particular—I said, "The stones ought not to have been brought in to front way, there was a back way—Adams said that he did not know that—Butler was present at that time—I said, "What is the price?"—Adams said, "Six shillings"—I paid him six shillings, and also sixpence for beer—I said, "The stones are very cheap"—he said, "Yes"—they then left the house.</p>

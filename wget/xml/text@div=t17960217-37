               <p>Examined by Mr. Peatt. I am a surgeon: I was sent for by Robert Thacker, on the 27th of last month, to meet him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Be so kind as to state distinctly what you know of this? - A. By the request of Mr. Justice Addington, I went into a private room to examine the child; that is the child; she is under my hands now.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the result of her examination? - A. I examined her, and found the exterior parts very much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was that inflammation owing to? - A. There was a very great discharge; I should suppose owing to perforation; on the further examination, I found the neck of the virgina very much lacerated, and a very great discharge; as to the complexion of the discharge, I was not positive whether it was venereal or not, at that time; to confirm my opinion, I went over to the

            , where the prisoner was confined, to examine him also; I found a strong ghonorrhoea from the urethra; I have had the child under my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she any symptoms of this venereal now? - A. She is under a mercurial course now, and a strong discharge upon her; she has the gonorrhcea upon her at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined this child; were the appearances you saw, the effect of violence from some person or other? - A. No doubt but some puncture was the occasion of that inflammation; I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hymen destroyed? - A. At the first examination I could not be positive, being dark at night.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite certain from your professional knowledge, and that knowledge applied to the observation of that child, are you quite clear that that child had been penetrated by some person? - A. Not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170066"></xptr>the least doubt of it, because, passing the finger up the passage, I found it extremely inflamed; the second time I examined her at my own house, I passed my finger half an inch or an inch, and found it very much inflamed; the hymen was destroyed in some measure, but whether from the puncture, or the acrimony of the discharge, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you been long a surgeon? - A. About sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had much experience in this way? - A. I mostly practise surgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I will ask you a question for the sake of the public, and enlightening the public mind upon this subject; is it possible for a man, having a venereal taint of this sort, to receive any benefit from connexion with a child? - A. It is an extremely false idea.</p>
               <p>Court. This idea cannot be too well understood, because many poor miserable wretches have that notion? - A. I should suppose quite the reverse, because any thing that irritates the penis must inflame it and encrease the discharge.</p>
               <p>Court. That has been the uniform answer of every surgeon that I ever heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. My Lord, I understand that the father, at the instance of the mother-in-law, was arrested, a day or two before, and he is now retired, from fear of being arrested; he was here this morning.</p>
               <p>Court. If any person offers violence attending here, the Court will instantly take notice of them; the man is perfectly safe here if you can find him, and every man is in a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. The woman that she told it to is kept out of the way also.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the child). Q. How many days after he had used you ill was he taken up? - A. The Wednesday after.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you been this morning? - A. I have been in Court, but was informed, being a little embarrassed in my affairs, that an officer was ready to arrest me as soon as I had given evidence here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. You are perfectly safe in coming here; and you shall be protected in going home.</p>
               <p>Thacker. I am the father of the child; she was eleven year old last New-year's-day; the prisoner has been quartered upon me three or four months, I cannot justly say to the time, as I have not the billet about me; with respect to his behaviour while with me, I had not much reason to find saul, I thought him a quiet kind of man; and I employed him to do little matters for me, and gave him victuals, at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of what passed between him and your daughter on Monday the 25th of January? - A. I was out of town; and when I returned, on Wednesday evening, I was told my child wanted to see me; she told me she was hurt, by the prisoner, upon the bed; that she was ordered by her mother-in-law to go to bed that night with the maid, she used to sleep alone; that she fell asleep after the maid got up, and this man came up stairs, and came to bed to her; that she cried out, and nobody heard her.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this? - A. On Wednesday in the evening; I went that evening to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. She had not been to Bow-street before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had another soldier in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A. Dixon.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to think any other man has used your child in this way? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the maid servant? - A. I cannot find her; I have been endeavouring to find her this two or three days, but could not find her; she has been gone away this month, I believe; she went away immediately after this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn her away, or did she go away? - A. She was turned away by my wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish your Lordship to ask Dixon what the girl was turned away for?</p>
               <p>Witness. For being in liquor, my Lord.</p>
               <p>(Dixon called in again.) Court. Q. Why was that maid servant turned away from Thacker's house? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Robert Thacker.) Your child complains she is harshly treated by her mother-in-law, I hope you will take care of her; it is known in Bow-street, and it is known here; and it will be very necessary for her safety that she should treat the child better in future. - A. I have applied to an Attorney to draw up articles of separation between us, upon this very subject.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Dock-street, St. George's East. I have known the prisoner since his last voyage—he stopped one day with me when he came home from his voyage, six or seven months ago—on the 17th of Sept. I was in the Swedish Flag, Princes-street, St. George's, between five and six o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was there—he was not sober—Mary Ann Liddle was there—he kicked her—I said he ought to be ashamed of himself in kicking her in the place he did, which was the lower part of her person—I spoke to him in English—he can speak very good English—he then took a knife out of his pocket, and attempted to stab me in the breast—I put up my left hand to prevent his cutting my breast, and was very slightly wounded in the hand by the knife—I am quite sure he attempted to strike me in the bosom.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Bluegate-fields, Shadwell. Last Tuesday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in the Swedish Flag—he prisoner tried to kick me—Brown was there, and said he had no business to kick a woman in that manner—he did kick me in * * *—on her saying that, he drew a knife, and attempted to stab her in the right breast, but she warded it off with her hand, and received a cut—he was tipsy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and live in Ratcliff-highway. I was in the Swedish Flag last Tuesday night—these girls were there all the evening—a out nine or ten o'clock the prisoner was intoxicated and quarrelsome, knocking everybody about, and capsizing people's grog—he upset my grog—I spoke to him civilly, and he challenged me to fight—I asked him why he was knocking about in that manner, and why he capsized my liquor—he never answered me—he said his knife was his protection while he had got one—Liddle was looking on at the time, and when she stood against the gaslight he kicked her—she had done nothing to provoke him—she went out on being kicked—the prosecutrix said that was not the way to kick a woman, or some<lb></lb>thing—I was not in the room when the knife was used—I went out to see if the other woman was hurt, and on my return found Mrs. Brown bleeding.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 167.) Last Tuesday evening I was called into the Swedish Flag, and saw Brown there—she had a wound on her hand—in consequence of what they told me I took the prisoner in charge—I told him he was given in charge for trying to stab the woman in the breast, stabbing her in the hand, and kicking another woman in the * * *—he said he did not do any such thing, he never opened his knife—I found this knife in his trowsers with the string twisted round his neck—most sailors carry knives in that way, particularly foreigners—he went with me to the station, and next morning, in going before the Magistrate, he asked what he was taken for—I told him—he said he was drunk, and did not know what he was doing.</p>

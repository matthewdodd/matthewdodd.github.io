My room was above stairs; going into the passage I see the prisoner going out into the area with them, down the steps; I asked him what he had got there? I see the bundle under his arm; he said it was a bundle the porter gave him; I could not immediately recollect of my own knowledge that it was my handkerchief or no.</p>

               <p>Q. What may the value of the handkerchief be? - Three shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know these stockings and handkerchief to be your's? - Yes, I did; I bought them of my master, a young man died, and my master was executor to the young man that died, and I bought the lot, about thirty four pair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Watson, of No. 3, Windsor Place, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. On 13th May, I was awoke, at 3 o'clock in the morning—Mary Ann Charlton was sleeping with me—when I awoke I saw the prisoner outside the window—Charlton said to her, "What do you want?" the prisoner said, "Eliza Crawley"—I said, "No one lives here of that name;" the prisoner said, "Yes, there is, at one of these windows"—I said, "There is no such person living here," and got up to shut the window, which was then half open; I thought it was fast the night before, but it was not; it was close down—I went to bed at half part 10 o'clock—when I got up to shut the window, I found half of my shawl hanging outside the window; that shawl had been on the bedstead the night before—I laid down again, but being uneasy, I got up and got a light; I then missed a dress, a pair of drawers, and a pocket handkerchief, which had all been safe the night before on the foot of the bed—a person could reach those articles from the window, by putting their hand over, without getting into the room.</p>

            , captain Delaney, and Mr. Warwick, to the prisoner's apartment up two pair of stairs, No. 10, King-street, Drury-lane; on searching the room I found a great many duplicates; I then asked the prisoner if there were any more duplicates in the room; he said there was not. I moved a jar on the mantle piece; under that I found a duplicate of a pair of leather breeches, pledged for thirteen shillings at Mr. Payne's. The moment I found that ticket, the prisoner was very much alarmed, he begged the captain would forgive him. I asked him what he had done with the epaulets; he told me that he had sold them to a Jew for eighteen shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the deputy comptrollers of the Post Office. The prisoner has been employed in the Post Office for about two years as a letter carrier at Streatham—in consequence of some complaints that had been made, on 16th March, I made up a test letter, addressed to James Denyer, C. Candy's, Esq., Well Field, Streatham—I placed inside it twelve penny postage stamps, and sealed it with adhesive gum, and gave it to Mr. Cole to post; that was about 12 o'clock in the day—later in the day, I saw that letter in the Post Office, in the Circulation department, where the letters are stamped; it was despatched that even<lb></lb>ing, and would arrive at Streatham, in due course by the evening bag—there is an 8 o'clock delivery at Streatham on Saturdays—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter—it bears the midday stamp.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th March I received a letter from Mr. Sculthorpe—I posted it at the General Post Office, in the ordinary way, by dropping it into the letter box—this is the letter—in the course of that afternoon I went down to Streatham with Smee the officer—I inquired about the letter and found it had not been delivered—I waited as late as 9 o'clock—I then went to the neighbourhood of the prisoner's house and saw him on his return home—I stopped him and asked him if his name was Wright—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he was on duty when the 6 o'clock letters arrived from London—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he sorted the letters for delivery—he said he sorted some of them—I asked if he had seen a letter directed to James Denyer, C. Candy's, Esq., Well Field, Streatham—he said, no he had not—I said he must have seen it, for I could prove that it was sent down, and that I had seen the other letter carrier, who was prepared to make oath that he had not seen the letter (I had seen the other letter carrier)—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060145"></xptr>
               <p>repeated that he had not seen it—I told him I knew better, and the reason of his not delivering it—I asked if he had any objection to let me see the con<lb></lb>tents of his pockets—he said, "None"—I then went with him into his house, accompanied by the constable and Pratt, the charge taker—I saw this pocket book taken from him, and took from it this envelope, folded up as it is now—it is addressed to Mrs. Denyer, No. 10, Devonshire Street, Queen Square, Holborn—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for having that in his possession—he hesitated—I said, "I can account for it, for this is the enve<lb></lb>lope given to you by young Denyer, to whom the letter I am searching for is directed"—I told him it was given him to enclose an order for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he was to obtain—he said, he did not get the money order, for he had for<lb></lb>gotten who had given him the money—I said it did not appear that he had forgotten it, by his not delivering the letter, as directed, to the party—he said he thought that might be the party, from what another letter carrier had told him on the Saturday previous—I again asked him what had become of the letter—his wife, who was present, also asked him what he had done with it, and begged of him to tell me the truth; after hesitating a minute or more, he said, "I will show it you"—I said, "Where is it, then?"—he said, "I will go and show it you"—I sent Smee with him, I remained in the house—they returned in about twenty-five minutes, and Smee gave me the letter in question and four others—the letters themselves have been for<lb></lb>warded to the parties they were intended for, and I only produce the covers—when these letters were produced I asked the prisoner why they were not delivered—he said he had not had time—Smee told me, in his presence, where he had found them—I asked the prisoner if he had not been to No. 10, Streatham Common—he said, yes, he had—I said, "You have been to the Rookery, too, have you not?"—he said, yes, he had—I said, "Then those houses being on either side of Mr. Candy's, you must have passed his door to go to them"—he made no reply—he must have passed Mr. Candy's to go to the Rookery—the whole of these covers have the stamp of 16th March—they are within the prisoner's delivery—he was detained in cus<lb></lb>tody—I afterwards received from Pratt four letters and two newspapers, I produce the covers—they bear the Post Office stamp of 4th, 9th, and 12th March—I afterwards went to a field with Smee, and found seventeen or eighteen letters and three newspapers—I produce the covers, they appear all to bear the Post Office stamp of November—I also found ten others in the same field, bearing the December stamp—the whole of those letters are addressed to persons within the prisoner's delivery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There is another letter carrier in that district, is there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was not employed on the same beat as the prisoner, he took the other part of Streatham—I do not know, of my own knowledge, that the prisoner was employed on that beat in Nov. and Dec.—at the time these letters were found they were all wet, and in a pulpy state, and opened of their own accord—one or two have been found since, in a hedge; some were found in his house—they were all perfect, except one—there was no<lb></lb>thing to show that they had been opened—the letter in question had not been opened—I believe the postage stamps are still in the letter; it has not been opened yet—the other four letters, found in the field, had not been opened—I do not know the extent of the prisoner's beat—he came on duty at 7 o'clock in the morning, and was partially employed till 8 o'clock at night—his duty would not occupy the whole of that time—I believe he was entirely in the service of the Post Office during that time—I know these letters have been through the post, by their bearing the Post Office stamp—the</p>

               <p>place where the five letters were found in the field has been pointed out to me; it is on the prisoner's beat—I do not know that he had to pass there just about 8 o'clock—it is not near the spot where he would terminate his delivery, I should say it would be a quarter of a mile from it—I think he must have purposely gone out of the road—there is a footway across the field; he could go that way home—it is about half a mile from his house, and about the same from Mr. Candy's—he would pass along the main road and there is a stile leading into the field—the place where the letters were found is about fifty yards from the road—the road would be a portion of his beat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the General Post Office. On the evening of 16th March I went with Mr. Cole to Streatham—I was directed to go with the prisoner to see where the letters were—he took me to a place called Duke's Field, about half a mile from his house—there is a footpath across that field—as we were going along the footpath the prisoner stepped out of the path, and said, "I think they are somewhere here, I do not know exactly where"—he commenced searching in the grass in a small water grip; by the side of the path—after searching for about a minute or two, he took out five letters from the water grip; these are the covers of four, and the fifth is the letter in question—I said, "When did you place them here?"—he said, "About 8 o'clock this evening"—I said, "How come you to place them here?"—he said, "Because I was too tired to deliver them"—I said, "You must have had some motive in placing them here, if it had rained they would have been all destroyed; however came you to put them in a place like this?"—he hesitated for some minutes, and then he said, "I placed them there because they should not be found upon me"—I then went back with him to his house—two days afterwards I went back to the field with Cole—I pointed out to him the place where the prisoner had found the five letters—we both commenced searching in the grip, and I saw Cole find the bundle of seventeen letters produced—two days after<lb></lb>wards we found three other lots in the same grip, but 400 or 500 yards further up, close by the footpath—they are the letters that have been pro<lb></lb>duced.</p>

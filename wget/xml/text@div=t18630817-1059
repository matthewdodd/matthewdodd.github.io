                  </hi>. I live at 5, Plumridge-street, Blackheath, and am a carman—on 18th July I was at the top of Griffin-street, Deptford, about ten minutes to 11 at night—I met the female prisoner; she stopped me and asked me what I was going to treat her to—I said, "It is too late, you can't get anything"—she said, "Oh no it isn't, I can get something"—I gave her sixpence to get something to drink—she then snatched ray watch from my pocket—this is the watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her to give it to me, and she said, if I did not go away she would give me a punch in the mouth—she walked off—I went into High-street, and found a constable, came back with him, and found both the prisoners talking together—the constable went up to them, and I afterwards saw my watch on the pavement where they were standing, and picked it up—I had had a little to drink—I knew what I was about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 280). About 11 o'clock on the night of 19th July, the prosecutor came up to me in High-street, Deptford—I went to the corner of Griffin-street with him, and heard that the prisoners had gone into Regent-street, Deptford—we went to the dark part of Regent-street, and saw the prisoners talking together—I watched them about three minutes, and then turned my light on and saw that the female prisoner had something bright in her hand—I went up to her and told her she was charged with taking a watch from the prosecutor—she then passed what she had in her hand over to the male prisoner's left hand—she said he was a liar, she had got nothing—I then drew her about three yards from the man, and saw him drop the watch between his feet—he told me I had better search her there—I told him I should not, I should take her to the station—he came up and tried to rescue her—he followed us, and I spoke to a brother con<lb></lb>stable, who took him in charge—he told the prosecutor that he would give him two shillings to <hi rend="italic">square</hi> it.</p>

Q.</hi> How far is the corner of Griffin-street from where you saw the two prisoners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose about thirty or forty yards—I was about six yards from them when I saw something bright in her hand—the male prisoner caught hold of her arm, and tried to pull her away, and tried to put his legs between mine to knock me down—I did not pick up the watch; I told the prosecutor the prisoner had dropped something, and he picked it up—Regent-street is a thoroughfare.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman, and live at 8, Mellish Square, Mill wall—the prisoner slept in the same room as me—on 11th December I was awakened by loud voices in the room below, and heard the landlord say "I know that man is a thief"—I got up, and a policeman came into my room, and threw his light round, and I missed my things from a dresser at the</p>

Early on the morning of 11th Decem<lb></lb>ber I was on duty in Mellish Street, and saw the prisoner with something loose on his arm—I called after him, and he stopped and looked round—I asked him where he was going; he said that he was shifting his lodgings, as his landlady just round the corner has given him notice to leave—I went with him a little way, and he said he was going to Whitechapel—I went with him to his lodgings—he went in and fastened the door, and went up stairs—I knocked the landlord up, and went up after him—the prisoner wanted to make me believe that he as not the man—I found his clothes at the foot of the bed, and these socks on his feet—I can swear that these are the clothes he had on in the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this house—the prisoner lodged there with the prosecutor for one week—I heard a noise in the morning, and laid awake, and heard a scuffle on the door-step—I got up and saw the policeman with his bull's eye, and the prisoner running up stairs with the clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I paid this woman a week's rent that evening, and, having some words with her, I determined on leaving the lodging at one, and I knew if she knew it she would not let me carry away my things. I had a pair of old blue trousers and some hats, boots, and a piece of old sacking, and I seem to have put on this young man's socks instead of my own, which are exactly like them, and my own were left under the bed, so that there was no necessity for me to take them. The policeman ought to have taken the bundle from me, and then if they had been stolen they could have proved it. He selected various articles from the room, and said, "He had these, and he had these," when it was entirely impossible for him to tell what I had. I have been in the army thirteen or fourteen years, and have held situations of trust, and paid the troops, and never was charged with dishonesty. I had simply my own things.</p>

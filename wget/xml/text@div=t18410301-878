                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Richard Henry Cox, of Hillingdon. Wiggins was his carter—I send hay to London by him—I have allowed one truss of hay on the top of the load, and a sack of hay, for the horses to use in London and on the road—that has been my imperative orders for the last twelve months, instead of two bundles—we have a rick of hay now in use—I have compared the hay shown me by the policeman with the rick, and, in my judgment, it is part of it—the prisoner was not entrusted to part with any.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 138.) On the morning of the 25th of February I was on duty in Uxbridge-road—about a quarter before three o'clock I saw a cart loaded with hay at the door of the Coach and Horses public-house—I saw Wiggins put from the top of the load a bundle of hay, and the lad who was with him put it into the crib, which stood opposite the public-house door, which they feed horses out of—I went by them, and waited a few minutes, and the cart drove away, leaving the hay behind in the crib—Bignell then came out of the front-door, and took the crib away, with the hay in it—it was a china crate—the horses in the cart had had some of the hay to eat, but this was what they had left—they stopped not more than eight or ten minutes, and had not time to eat it—I asked Bignell whose hay that was—he said he did not know, he supposed it belonged to the cart that was just gone—I then went and stopped the cart, and Wiggins was on the top of it—I asked if he had left any hay—he said, "No"—I took him back, and showed it him—I asked if that was it—he said, "Yes," he was very sorry, would I let him go, it was the first time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where is this public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About mid<lb></lb>way between London and Uxbridge—two horses were eating the hay—one was being turned round to it—there might be two eating—the crib was full when the hay was put in, and nearly full when it was left—here is 30lbs. weight of it—Bignell was not there when it was put into the crib, nor when the horses were eating—the crib is put there for the express purpose of having hay put in for the horses—I did not wait to see where Bignell took it to—all I saw was he moved the crib—he pulled it six or seven yards—the cart had been gone two or three minutes.</p>

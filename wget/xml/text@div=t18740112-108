                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 1, Ann Street, Bethnal Green—on New Year's night, about 8 o'clock, I was in Bethnal Green Road, and had a bundle under my arm—as I was passing Essex Street, the prisoner came up and fetched me a violent blow in the mouth—as I was falling he snatched at my watch, and I had another blow from some one at the back of me—I fell to the ground, it was a minute or so before I could recover to get up, I then saw him run with two more—I attempted to run after him, but I was so injured by the fall that I could not run—I went to the police-station and gave information—next night I was fetched to the station and identified the prisoner, he was alone then—I am sure of him; it happened close against the shops, and I saw his face as he came direct up to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a safe maker, and live at 21, Libra Road, Roman Road—on this night I was in Bethnal Green Road, with a barrow—I stopped to rest, and saw three men; the prisoner was one of them—they came walking on, one went down a turning and two stopped, about a minute afterwards Mr. Newton was passing and the prisoner attacked him; he gave him a blow, and as he was falling he snatched his watch from him; the other one was in the mess waiting behind him—they ran away—the prosecutor fell to the ground—I went and helped him up, and went with him to the station—I afterwards saw the prisoner there, and knew him again—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

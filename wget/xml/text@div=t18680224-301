                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Penny, a draper in the Wandsworth Road—on Thursday, 6th February, about a quarter to five in the afternoon, I served the prisoner with a twopenny piece of braid—she gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave her the change, and put the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till—there were no other shillings there—in about ten minutes she came in again for a second piece of black braid—she gave me a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I found it was bad—I did not say anything, but knocked for Mr. Penny, and showed it to him—he asked her where she got it from—she said she had been out all day, and picked it up—I said, "She was in just before, and passed another one, which I think is just as bad"—I gave the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Penny, and she snatched it out of his hand—I went for a policeman—Mr. Penny went to the till afterwards, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—from the time the prisoner came in the first time until she came the second time no other shillings had been put in the till—this is the light braid that I sold her first, and this is the black.</p>

                  </hi>.

I was sent for to go to Mr. Penny's shop, on Thursday, the 6th, and the prisoner was given into my custody for passing two counterfeit shillings—Mr. Parsons gave me one, and said the prisoner had snatched the other from him while he was in the act of cutting it—she said she had not got it—I asked her to turn her pocket out—she did so—there was a little tea and sugar, and nothing else in it—she handed me a puree, which contained a good shilling and a good sixpence and fivepence in coppers—I took her to the station—on the way I beard something fall, I looked down, and found this bad shilling lying close by her feet.</p>

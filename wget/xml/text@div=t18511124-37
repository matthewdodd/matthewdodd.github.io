                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Grapes public-house, St. Mary<lb></lb>Axe.

               <p>it—I said, "This is really too bad; it was only last Thursday night you came and served me in the same way"—I remembered him again imme<lb></lb>diately—on that occasion he gave me a sixpence, which I broke, and returned to him, and he took it away—my wife said, in his presence, that he had offered her a bad shilling two days before—I gave him into custody—I had laid the two pieces of the sixpence on the counter—the prisoner took them up, and when the policeman came he gave them to him, saying, if he had known it was bad he would not have uttered it.</p>

I was called to the Grapes, Bur<lb></lb>rows charged the prisoner with passing a bad sixpence, and said that he had offered him another bad sixpence two or three days before, and also a shilling to his wife—the prisoner said that the shilling was a good one, and he was not aware the sixpence was bad—I searched him, and found on him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and this galvanic battery (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave his address, 24, St. John-street, Whitechapel—a woman came up directly I took him, and said he was her husband, and asked why he was taken into custody—I did not answer her—after the prisoner was in the cell at the station, the woman was brought in, and gave an address, 2, Tenter-street, Spitalfields—I went there, and in a back-room on the ground-floor found this box, containing some pieces of metal, some bits of spoons, and 18lbs. or 20lbs. of clay, of which this is a sample (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

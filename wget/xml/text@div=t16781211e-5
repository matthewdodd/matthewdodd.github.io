               <p>The Witnesses were Neighbours, who deposed that the Prisoner with another Woman, went into Mr. Rutty's Shop, and there snatch'd up the Silk and went away. They followed them, and laying hold on the Prisoner, the other slipt from them and ran for it; but they found the Silk about her; upon which they carried her before the Magistrate, who Comitted her. She being asked what defence she could make, said the other Woman told her she had bought it, and gave it her to carry away; but could not produce the Woman, nor would tell the Name. Whereupon the Judge directed the Jury to find it according to so plain an Evidence; but because the man had his Goods again, left the Value to their Consideration.</p>
               <p>The Jury then without coming from the Bar, agreed of their Verdict, which they gave in thus.</p>

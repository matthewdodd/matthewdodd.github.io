               <p>have been so thirteen years—I have been a butcher all my life—on the morning of 6th March, I was in Warwick-lane, and followed the defendant's waggon into the interior of the market; it was loaded with means and other goods—the name on it was "John Jarvis, Toaster, Northampton-shire"—I noticed the carcase of a sheep, which I had taken from the waggon—I had it taken out, found it unfit for human food, and it was condemned—the defendaut was on the waggon, unloading it to the porters below—I then asked him to let me see the contents of another, hamper; he hesitated, and said that he had no more of that sort of meat—I insisted on seeing it, and took out of it the carcases of two sheep and a calf, which were unfit for human food, and I condemned them accordingly—he said that they were his own, and that he intended to sell them to the knackers, for boiling; they were not intended for the market—I had them further inspected by Dr. Letheby, and they were condemned and destroyed—they ware dressed as butchers dregs good meat for market—it would not be worth while to dress it in that way for the knackers; but sometimes after meat is dressed it is found to be too bad, aad then it is sent to the knackers—he also had four quarters of beef in a hamper; it was inferior meat but I passed it—I saw the defendant again, at 10 o'clock, at Mr. Burroughs' shop, who is a meat-salesman, in Warwick-lane; a man who was with him took a hamper off a truek and brought it into the shop—I inspected the meat in it, found it unfit for human food, and condemned it—I asked him who he brought it from; he said, "From Mr. William Powell, of Toaster"—I took it to the Justice-room it was examined by Dr. Letheby, and condemned by Sir R. Carden—the prisoner said that it was the same four quarters which I had passed in the morning, but they were not; these were the carcase of an animal which had died, they were wet and flabby, the other was drier beef—I have known the defendant as a carrier for some years, bringing meat to the market, and I have had the duty of inspecting it—the four quarters weighed fifty-five stones.</p>

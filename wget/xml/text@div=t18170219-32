On the 7th February I bolted and locked my doors before I went to bed-about eleven o'clock I fastened my private door-my cellar has an iron grating over it, which was quite secure. About four o'clock I was alarmed, and found the coal-cellar padlock wrenched off, and the house broken into. Two boards were broken down; the iron grating had been forced up, high enough for a man to enter; the wood-work was broken.</p>

            . I am a watchman-my box is opposite Miller's house. On the morning of the 7th of February I was going my rounds, and heard Mr. Miller's private door jar; I went to it, and found it about four inches open. I asked who was there, several times-nobody answered. The door was drawn back from within, and a man came out - I secured him-the prisoner came out after him, and gave me a violent blow, and struck me with a piece of wood, called a stretcher, which cut my lip; when he was coming up to strike me, the other man said,"Give him a nice one." - I was knocked down. I saw the prisoner come out at the door he had a white apron on. I am sure he is the man-it was moon-light - I saw his face. I gave the alarm - I could not spring my rattle, as I had hold of the man with both hands. The prisoner ran towards Bunhill-row. Cleaver and Newton came to my assistance. I am sure the prisoner is the man that struck me; I saw him again five minutes afterwards.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going round my beat in Bath-street and Old-street, and looking round Bunhill-row, I saw a scuffle between the watchman and some other men. I ran to them, and saw the prisoner coming from the watchman - I was on the opposite side of the prosecutor's house. I took the prisoner - it was about twenty yards from the house; he was running as hard as he could nobody else was running-Grenville said he was the man that came out at the door, and struck him-the prisoner made no answer; he had nothing in his hand - He had a green coat on and a white apron.</p>

            . I am a patrol. My attention was called to the prosecutor's house about four o'clock in the morning of the 7th of February. Grenville called out, which led me there. I saw a man run from him with a white apron - He was brought back about ten minutes afterwards. Grenville was laying on the ground, senseless; he was unable to stand. I went directly to the prosecutor's door, and found a hat and a dark-lanthorn on the step - I alarmed the prosecutor directly-the door was wide open. On going down into the cellar, I saw a white handkerchief laying under the grating, where it was forced up-the inner cellar had the boards broken down and the padlock forced. Grenville was laying just off the curbstone opposite the prosecutor's door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you not in Banner-street when you heard the watchman call - A. Yes, but not above a dozen yards from the spot. Grenville was laying opposite the door, in Banner-street. One side of the prosecutor's house is in Banner-street and the other in Bunhill-row-the dark lanthorn has had oil in it.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Luke's. I searched the prisoner at the watch-house in the morning, before he went before the magistrate. I found a box, a peg, and a piece of candle in his pocket-the peg is a plumber's tool-the lining of his hat was burnt - I took it out-it appears to me to be fresh burnt-the candle was pressed flat.</p>

The man came and said, he was almost sure that I was the man. I am a plumber by trade; we always use candle. I had been at work on some leads, and burnt the lining of my hat.</p>

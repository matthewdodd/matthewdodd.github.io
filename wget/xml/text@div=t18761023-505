There are forms of discharge kept in the office and the prisoner had access to them—it was not his business to take away any of them—the certificate produced is one I spoke of as being in the rack—there are four forms used, No. 4 being silent as to character, anybody may take one of them—this document is, to the best of my belief, in the hand<lb></lb>witing of the prisoner.</p>

             deposed, Baynes came in a hurry to the half-way house, Mother Red-cap's, and said he had been robbed in the field; he turned his head about, and said, there goes the three men together, and said that is the man (Chick) who robbed me of my breeches and penny; whether they husled him him, or how they took it, he did not know; that being on horseback, he (Fletcher) got off, and took a stick and pursued them, and brought Chick back by the coat, the others came along behind him; at the time he jumped over, the parcel was thrown down in the field.</p>
               <p>Court. This case, in point of law, is confined to the penny; the breeches were taken privately from his person, which is a different offence.</p>
               <p>Fletcher. They could say very little for themselves; they pulled the money out of their pockets; there was a halfpenny Baynes said he could swear to, that they took from him; he did not take it out from the others, Chick had taken out his money himself, and shewn it, the halfpenny was not took from him; the constable was there at the same time; Chick said he might take it again if he would.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was going towards Hampstead to see an acquaintance, I was walking before, and I saw some person, I did not know who it was, he came almost to us, and turned and run back as hard as he could, and coming back with another man, they stopped us.</p>
               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>We were going to Hampstead, and this man met us; as soon as he saw us, he set off as fast as he could, run back again, and fetched a person and charged us.</p>
               <p>Court. I don't think it necessary to put Tike upon his defence at all.</p>
               <p>To Baynes. This place you describe, where these people met you, was in the second field from Mother Red-cap's, you say; is not that in sight both of the road from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050103"></xptr> Hampstead to Tottenham Court and St. Giles's, and the cross road from Pancrass to St. Giles's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was at ten o'clock in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In sight of Mother Red Cap's too? - Yes; it was.</p>
               <p>In this place, at ten o'clock in the morning, in sight of both roads, accosted by men who had no weapons, how came you to give your money to strangers? - At that time it was a very thick fog, I could hardly see for fog; when I saw these men I had a sort of fright upon me, I did not like the looks of them; I was coming the same path they were, I went upon the other, as soon as I did, they came across, and came and catched hold of me, they were coming to me, I was going towards town.</p>
               <p>Was your fright occasioned by any thing Chick said or did to you, or merely from the apprehension of your own mind, from seeing those men together? - I was in fear every minute they should knock me down.</p>
               <p>Was it upon what they said, or your own fears? - Upon what they said.</p>
               <p>What did they say? - I have told you every thing.</p>
               <p>Court. There is not sufficient evidence to charge Tike, no direct evidence he was connected with the other prisoners; certainly, it is a nice distinction, if this can be made a robbery at all; in respect to the silk breeches it is clear, in point of law, if the evidence is true, there was no robbery of that; for the nature of the robbery is, that of obtaining from another, money or goods, by force or fear, either by actual force or violence, or putting them in such fear as induces him to part with his property, from the apprehension of violence, and in order to save himself from violence; that cannot be applied to the breeches, that was taking privately from his person. The evidence, in point of law, must be applied to the penny; the value is totally immaterial, if the fact is clear; the law that makes a highway robbery a capital offence, does not so much consider the property of the party, which differs in nothing from the common larceny, but the fear and personal danger that he is yut into, and therefore whether a man is robbed of a penny or 500 l. it is, in point of law, precisely the same thing; for one is as much a robbery as the other, provided it is attended with those ingredients, in order to constitute a robbery. But in order to constitute a robbery, there must be force and violence, taking the money by force violently, or there must be an actual putting in fear, and it must be by fear occasioned by some act done by the person who is charged with committing the robbery, that the party is iuduced to part with their money, and if it is by fear that the party is induced to part with their money, it is not necessary that any particular words or threats should be used by the party demanding. If a person was to beg an alms of you, alone in a field, at a suspicious place and time, and then say, Sir, give me a penny, presenting a pistol to your breast, there is no doubt it is a robbery, upon account of the weapon causing immediate fear of death: but it is necessary to constitute a robbery, that the fear that induces the person to part with his property, should be a reasonable fear occasioned by the person who demands it, and not merely a preconceived fear, arising from suspicion in the mind of the person robbed; it is necessary it should not be a groundless and frivolous fear, but such a fear, as, in the expression of law, may naturally arise in the mind of a firm and prudent man; it is not because a man comes up to me in a suspicious place, and asks for money, and I give him a penny, if he does no act that would make a prudent man have any degree of fear, that will not constitute a robbery; and any person being in company with robbers when a robbery is committed, makes them accessary to the fact.</p>

                  </hi>I am a widow, and keep a shop in Crown-court, Westminster. On the 31st of December, the prisoner came and wanted a pair of slippers without fur—I showed her what I had, hot I had none without fur—she said, "Perhaps you will have some next week? " I said perhaps I should—she went out and I missed a pair of slippers—my little girl was looking for them, and the prisoner came back and said, "Have you seen a bit of ribbon? "—she looked about—I said, "You are looking for your ribbon, and I am looking for my slippers—did you try on a pair of velvet slippers? "—she said, "No"—she then said perhaps she had dropped her ribbon in the cheesemonger's shop over the way she went there and came out—I said, "Have you found it? "—she said, "No"—she walked on—I followed her to the passage of a butcher's shop—she then stooped, and dropped these slippers—I stepped in and picked them up—I said, "These are what I want—I told her to come back, which she did, and I gave her in charge.</p>

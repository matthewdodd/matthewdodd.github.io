               <p>I was in Fenchurch-street on the 17th of August, I saw the prisoner there, it was six o'clock in the morning, there were two other men with him, one was a blacksmith, that was very much in liquor, the other appeared to be a countryman; they made towards Whitechapel, and Whitechapel Church, I did not follow them; I had suspicion that he was doing the man an injury, in regard of getting his money, by tossing for gin; they seemed to come towards Whitechapel church, and they passed me, and another that was with me; I was as far as the pump of Aldgate, before I lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go afterwards? - To the Royal Oak, in <placeName id="t17940917-47-crimeloc241">Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Q. How near was that to the place where this unfortunate affair happened? - Near about a hundred yards. After I came out of the Royal Oak, I saw this man, the blacksmith, and several people standing about him, and the blacksmith was stripped, had no shirt on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the third man, that was with him in Fenchurch-street? - Yes, I think he was there, but I will not be positive; the blacksmith wanted to fight this prisoner, he charged him with a robbery, and would lick him whether or no; and I went to him, and I persuaded the blacksmith to go home, and the prisoner he came up to me, and asked me what business I had to trouble my head with it? I told him I had business, or any other person; he told me that the man had money about him, and he was such a man as he wanted to be with, and it was no use for such as he, to be with one that had none; after that, a man in the company came and taps me over the shoulder, and calls me on one side, and I went about three or four yards, and in the mean time I was talking to the man, I see the prisoner draw a knife, and he began flashing it about, all manner of ways, stabbing; I made up to him as soon as possible, to attempt to secure him from doing any mischief, I got him by the back part of his neck, as he was on the rising ground, and held him down to the ground, and put my foot on his hand, while another man, James Smith, took the knifeout of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing done with the knife? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing? - He said nothing just then; when I came up to the watch-house, there was nobody to take charge of him, and we took him up to Lambeth-street; and he said going along, if he had known so much, he would have cut my throat wide enough.</p>

I crossed over the road, and the words I heard, were, you blackguard give me the money; the other, who was intoxicated with liquor, was challenging the prisoner with taking the money out of his pocket, he denied it; some few more words happened, and he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and I saw a knife in his hand; I said, good God, it is to be hoped he is not going to do mischief; he immediately opened the knife, and says, the first b-gg-r that molests me, shall have the contents of it; that was what he said, he had the knife in his hand, and began to cut about, I made an attempt to catch at his right arm; he turned about, and made an attempt against me, and missed me, and cut another person on the right arm; we endeavoured to get about him, to get him down; the deceased was assisting to get him down, and I perceived the knife to come with a rush blow, from the deceased's thigh, with a great vengeance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was the consequence of it? - Not till I got him to the ground, then I said to him, good God Mr. Pepper, how you bleed, go to the Hospital, and get your leg dressed; I saw this in two minutes afterwards; I followed the people to the place where the prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased before? - Yes, I knew him four or five years, his name was William Pepper.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing? - Going along afterwards, he said if he had had the knife, he would have cut our throats, and bloody guts out.</p>
               <p>Court. You see him brandishing about this knife, and you say it was purely for mischief; when you saw the wound, or rather the hand coming from that thigh, do you apprehend the would was given by the accident of the man being thrown down, or did he make the blow by design? - He was pulling backwards, it was not particularly for this man; the blow was intended for any body that came in the way.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you see him give the blow? - I see the hand come from him; I think it was given wilfully.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the man that was charging him with the robbery? - I don't know, he was quite drunk; he then immediately put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and pulled a knife out, and opened it, and began to clear the way; the witness, Ducroix, went to catch hold of him, he made a stroke at him, and cut the last witness about the arm, Ducroix stepped on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing while he was doing this? - I did not hear him; he still kept his knife in exercise, trying to run away, and get out into the middle of the road, and I observed the witness, Smith, catch hold of him behind, by the collar, and the deceased man ran in to assist him, and he got hold of him in the front, and the prisoner gave his hand a tug back, and the deceased man turned on one side rather, and the prisoner stabbed his knife into the deceased's thigh, I see him push the knife in.</p>

I was there in the morning when the deceased was brought in, he had a small wound on the left buttock about half an inch wide, which poured out an amazing quantity of blood, it was examined and found to be about five inches deep, in a stanting direction, it was then laid open and found it had divided a very considerable artery; the man was then drest and put to bed, I attended him till Saturday morning when it was going on well, after which time I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person appear in a good habit of body and apparently in a good state of health? - He was; he was brought in on Sunday, and I attended him till the next Saturday morning, Mr. Martin attended him after me; Mr. Richardson was present with me at the time.</p>
               <p>- RICHARDSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pupil attending the London hospital, I was with Mr. Heddington when the deceased was brought in, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170119"></xptr>man came in on Sunday morning, about eight o'clock with a puncture in the hip, which bled very prosusely, about five inches deep; I attended him till Saturday; he was a strong hale man, I did not see him so lately as Mr. Martin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martin. I attended him on the Saturday following that he received the accident, I did not perceive any thing amiss that day, I was called up on Sunday morning, and the man was labouring under a violent hemorrhage, a bleeding, I endeavoured to ascertain from whence the blood issued, but I could not, I made use of an application to stop the hemorrhage, which succeeded for a length of time, but at the end of four or five hours the hemorrhage began as rapidly as ever, from this same wound; I was sent for again, and I went and removed the dressing, and examined it very minutely, but could not ascertain it, I renewed the dressing and it stopped for the present, but it soon after began again; I then sent for Mr. Neale, he was out of town; as soon as he came he found the man in a deplorable state, with a sainting and coldness of the extremities, in a dying state; he died about twelve hours after the bleeding began.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the bleeding of that wound, and the wound was the occasion of his death? - No, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a person in other respects in a good state? - He was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was about six or seven o'clock on Sunday morning, the 17th of August, the day the accident happened, I was going down Fenchurch-street, there was a couple of men standing there, one seemed to be a smith and the other a countryman, he says, which is the way to the Maypole, to East Smithfield? I says, I am going past the Minories, which is the best way, as I was going along towards the Minories, says he, I will treat you with a quartern of gin for your civility, accordingly we went into a house and had a quartern of gin, and he pulled out two or three shillings to pay for it, and he said he had no halfpence; and I said, change a shilling, and he said, you pay if you have any halfpence; accordingly he said he would not go down the Minories, he would go with me; we had not gone much further than we got near to Whitechapel church, now, says he, we will have another quartern, and I will change the shilling and pay you the two-pence halfpenny that you laid out at the other house; says I, do so; so we went into another house, and it being early in the morning, there was nobody up but the maid, and she had no change for a shilling, says he, have you got any more halfpence? Yes, says I, I have, and I paid for that quartern of gin, then we walked down the road, and just by the other side of the New-road, says he, I have got a clean shirt in my bosom, I will pull off my dirty one and put the clean one on, so he pulled off his coat and waistcoat and put them on the ground, and his wristbands were tied with strings, and I took the knife out of my bosom to cut the strings of his wristbands and he took off his dirty shirt, and put his clean one on, pulling up his cloaths, his waistcoat, some halfpence dropped out of his side pocket on the ground, I picked them up, I says, I will have these halfpence now for the amount that I have laid out, I don't chose to go any further, says I, I will keep them, and I put them into my left hand pocket; then he began to cry pickpocket, and a mob gathered about, some where for ducking me, some for hanging me on the lamp post, and some for knocking me on the head, says I, if I have done any thing amiss take me to some other place, for I will not be ducked, they insisted on it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170120"></xptr>and they shoved me backward with the knife in my hand, which it was impossible to help my cutting the young man in the arm, at last somebody came behind me and took hold of me by the collar and pulled me back, and I was flat on my back, and instantly six or seven of them came treading on me to get the knife from me, and the deceased being nearest to me, I suppose he had the wound then, but he never had the wound before I was on the ground. I have no witnesses; there have been report about the streets in halfpenny papers that I stabbed the man on the highway, and I suppose seeing the reports in the papers none of them would come forward.</p>

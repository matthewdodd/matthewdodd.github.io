               <p>Court. She never went out of the shop. - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN PARRY. I keep a tobacconist's shop in Newgate-street; the little girl brought me a shilling that she took from the prisoner, I told her it was a bad one, she offered me another that was as bad as the first, then she offered me a third shilling, and I saw she had five or six others, all of the same cast, I kept this third shilling, and sent for a constable, the constable came, I gave him the third shilling, he searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other shilling found upon her. - A. I believe not, except one, I saw five or six more shillings in her apron, her apron was on the counter, I am sure the two first that she offered, were as bad as the third.</p>
               <p>WOODMAN. I am a constable, I was sent for to search the woman at Mr. Parry's, I found nothing at all but three-pence halfpenny in her apron, she had some split pease in her apron, I stripped all her clothes off, I found no bad shilling about her, if I had had any item of anything being in her mouth, I should have searched her mouth, I received this shilling of Mr. Parry.</p>
               <p>MR. PARRY. The third shilling I received of the woman, I gave to Woodman.</p>
               <p>MR. PARKER. I have been a silversmith; I attend prosecutions of the Mint; it is a bad shilling.</p>

I asked for two ounces of shag tobacco, the little girl asked me whether she should take it in to her uncle, I said yes; I dropped the shilling in the shop, or else Mr Parry must have it when they said I swallowed the shilling; I told them to lock me up, I leave it to God, I did not know it was a bad one.</p>

On 11th March I went, with the other officers, to 3, Holborn Buildings, and searched the house; and in a box, at the side of the bed, in the second floor front room, I found a black lane shawl and a vest—French and another female were in bed—I asked French how she accounted for them—she said, "I bought them some time ago"—while I was searching under the bed, I heard someone lift up the window—I saw French with her head out at the window, and heard steps running down the court—she said, "Step it, you b—, as the house is surrounded by police!"—an officer chased one of the men, and brought him back (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 151)—while I was searching, I saw French pass this purse to the other woman; it contains fifteen tickets, one of which relates to the shawl—I took French, and a man who is not here, and charged them with this robbery—at that time Mrs. Morgan had removed from Clerkenwell; and I not knowing where she had gone to, the female was discharged.</p>

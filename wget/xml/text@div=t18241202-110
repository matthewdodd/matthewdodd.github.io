               <p>JOHN CHARLES CRAMPIN. I entered into partnership with Mr. Bryan Charlesworth, in September last; we had taken the whole of the upper part of the house No. 22, Wood-street, Cheapside. We had placed there silk goods of all kinds, to a very considerable amount; there were 6435 yards of silk amongst them, worth about 500 l., thirty-five pieces of silk handkerchiefs, and other goods - the whole of which were worth from 800 l. to 1000 l.; a part of this stock was stolen from that warehouse on the night of the 26th, or the morning of the 27th of October, to the amount of upwards of 800 l.; we had bills printed offering fifty guineas reward for the discovery of the property, and information was given in the morning at the Mansion-house. On the day after the robbery, my partner introduced the prisoner and Salmon, the Bow-street officer, to me - we had some conversation about the robbery, but very little - the prisoner made no proposal at that time in my hearing. I saw him afterwards on the following Saturday, at his own house, the Dolphin, public-house, on Ludgate-hill; he then said he was in hopes our property would be recovered for us. I cannot exactly state what he said, but I remember his saying if the goods were in the hands of regular thieves, no doubt they would be got for us, for he should be able to get them for us; he did not state any thing about his knowledge of where the goods were; he said he should see the party most likely on the Sunday, that

             was frequently mentioned as of the party; he said Ikey Solomons kept a regular fence house, and old Crowder was a notorious thief. I saw the prisoner again on Sunday, at Salmon's house, in Tavistock-street - nothing particular was stated then, but! was to call again in the evening. I did call, and Lidbetter was gone. I went to his house, and saw him; he said he had got into a hunt, and we should be sure to have the goods back again. I made no observation, but I felt pleased at it. I asked him if he felt confident; he said there was no doubt of it, and he would be 10,000 l. to 10 l. that we had the goods back, but we must take stock, and let him have the account by eleven o'clock the next morning; the list was supplied to him, containing the exact description of the goods, and the amount of them. I do not remember any money being paid him then, but I paid him thirty sovereigns myself. I asked him what they were for - he said, they were for the purpose of recovering the goods: but I do not exactly recollect what the words were. I think this was on the Monday. I said "If you give this 30 sovereigns to the thieves, perhaps they may run off with them, and we may be that out of pocket as well?" he said "Oh! No, we have got them too fast for that, they can't run off," or something to that effect; he said he should see them on Monday. Ikey Solomons was mentioned, but I do not recollect that he mentioned any body else. I think he said he was to meet Solomons at the Cumberland, or Northumberland Coffee-house, in the Strand. I do not remember seeing him on the Tuesday, but I saw him several times afterwards; he told me he had seen Ikey Solomons, and had shewn him our list - that there was a deficiency in the number of yards in their list, and in the number of Bandahas and shawls; that their list was 1000 yards of silk less than ours - he said we could have the goods back for 450 l. I said it was a great deal of money to give; he said "Don't be too much in a hurry, you'll get them back for less." I asked him for what, and he said about 200 l. I have seen him several times since about the goods; he said he thought he had been misled, and had been upon a wrong hunt, but he should not give it up yet. I heard from my partner that he had sent a bill to our warehouse; this is the bill. (looking at it.) I have seen him since on the subject of it. I asked why he charged 10 l. for services; he said he did not intend to charge any thing, had it not been for the conduct of a gentleman I took to his house. I do not remember that he stated the name of the gentleman. I did not make any enquiry of him about the 30 l. at that time, but I afterwards took a friend with me for that purpose. I then asked what he had done with the 30 l.; he said he had got it, and should keep it till such time as his bill was paid; he went out of the room shortly after that, and we sent for him again; my friend, Mr. Shaw, then asked him what he had done with the 30 l; he snapped his fingers in his face, and said "What's that to you." I have seen him since, and he said, that though his expenses were stopped, he should not give it up - he thought there was something very black in it, and he should like to get to the bottom of it. I shortly afterwards went to a Magistrate to state the circumstances, and then he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have not a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020052"></xptr>very accurate recollection of any phrase used by yourself or the prisoner; your mind was a good deal disturbed? - A. Yes; it was very materially so, but I recollect some things particularly. I wrote down some things that Lidbetter said to me, by the advice of my friends. I did so to make my memory more perfect. I do not know that I have here a copy of what I wrote. I took a copy of it; the original was kept at Guildhall. I would as soon swear from my memory as the paper. I believe he was well known to my partner - who introduced him to me, and I have heard that he used to go to his house to spend his evenings. I have heard my partner say so in Lidbetter's presence. Salmon, and the other officer, took their refreshments there, but I did not know that a bill was going on at Lidbetter's house for the refreshment of the parties who were endeavouring to detect the thieves - it was not by my authority, and I never heard that my partner gave orders for it at Lidbetter's house; but I will not swear that he did not. I never made any charge against Lidbetter of a criminal nature, till he presented his bill for charges at his house - it was presented shortly after the 6th of November - it had been delivered several days before I made the charge. I do not remember that I had been grumbling about the charge of 10 l. for services in that bill; but I had asked the advice of my friends about it. I had not before then said to any human being, that Lidbetter had been obtaining money on a false pretence of getting the stolen goods. I do not know that I should have complained, had it not been for the charge in his bill - he never, in all his conversation, said that the 30 l. was given for the expence and trouble they were at in endeavouring to find the thieves. I have heard him say, that Ikey Solomons was a great receiver, and he had no doubt he had some of the goods. I do not remember his saying, that he knew the thieves who had committed the robbery. In speaking of Solomons or Crowder, I did not understand him to say more, than that they were likely persons to lead to a discovery of the thieves - not a word was ever said about the 30 l. being employed under the direction of the officers, Salmon and Perry, to use all their ability to detect the thieves. I did not tell him when I gave him the thirty sovereigns, to what use they were to be applied. I asked him what he was going to do with it - his answer was, it was to give to the thieves, and I understood that Ikey Solomons was one - it was to get the property back. I did not understand that any thieves were then found or known, but that Solomons was to get the goods back. I have heard him say, that he knew who the parties were; but I do not know what he meant by that - he mentioned old Crowder's name, and said, he had no doubt he was in it. I thought it very likely he might be one of the thieves. I had been given to understand that his son was in the robbery. I know that the officers went to his house - a woman of the name of Beckwith was taken up, in consequence of some letters which came by post - one was directed to a Mr. Jones - it was not through Mr. Lidbetter that the woman was apprehended. I gave the letters into the hands of the city officers. I always thought Ikey Solomons was a receiver of the goods from what I have heard the prisoner say. I did not direct the officers to take him up. I did not know that Solomons was in the power of the officers, and could have been apprehended any day within the last fortnight. I do not think Mr. Lidbetter ever had a knowledge of the thieves. I believe he did all he could for us, trying to do all in his power to bring the thieves to justice, and get the goods - he told me the goods were to be had for 450 l.; I do not know whether I would have given that or not. I said, had we not better give that than lose all our property - my mind was in that state - perhaps I should have done it; but not without consulting my partner - he said, he thought they might he got for less - the officers employed, were Salmon and Perry. I was perfectly satisfied with the good behaviour of the officers - they co-operated with Mr. Lidbetter, and he with them - their bill was 24 l. odd, and we gave them a check for 30 l. I do not know how many days Lidbetter was employed in endeavouring to discover the thieves. I should think, eight or ten days. I did not think from his being a friend of Mr. Charlesworth's, that he would charge for his trouble. It was in consequence of what Mr. Charlesworth said to me, that I handed the thirty sovereigns to Lidbetter. Mr. Charlesworth was examined before the Alderman on this prosecution - the City Solicitor was there advising the Magistrate, and Charlesworth was examined as a witness - he is not here - we are not on friendly terms. I do not know that it was Mr. Lidbetter's request, that Mr. Charlesworth's deposition should be preserved - the prisoner said, on one occasion, that they had got into a hunt, and they should soon find the goods. I did not know whether they had found the thieves or not, or whether any person was in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You went to the City Magistrate to ask his opinion, not making any application for a warrant? - A. No; but to take his judgment respecting the bill. I did not take out any warrant - the prisoner was taken in consequence of my going to ask the Magistrate's opinion. I was surprised at his being committed. I was not aware there was such a law in existence - it was not upon my application that he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not Mr. Lidbetter attend on a summons? A. Yes; he was not taken into custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were the goods safe? - A. They were all safe on Tuesday night. I left no one on the premises. I took the keys of the two doors. The street door was open which leads to Mr. Jones's warehouse, as well as our's. Mr. Jones's warehouse door was open, and his porter was standing there. I asked the porter if Mr. Jones was there; and he said, No. I went the next morning a little before nine o'clock, and saw our porter, whose name is William - he came to me, and said, "Good God, Sir, we have lost every thing!" the warehouse was stripped of all the best goods - the porter had been there before me.</p>

            . I am a friend of Mr. Crampin's. I accompanied him, on one interview with the prisoner, when he demanded from him an account of the thirty sovereigns - this was at the Dolphin. Mr. Crampin said there must be a dissolution of partnership between his partner and himself, and he desired to have back the 30 l. I do not recollect the exact answer, but Lidbetter said there was a bill of 10 l. or 11 l. which was not settled. Lidbetter said to Mr. Crampin, "If I have got fools to deal with you have not." After that I said "As Mr. Crampin's mind is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020053"></xptr>uneasy about his partnership, I think you had better return the sovereigns." He said "What's that to you." Lidbetter then took Mr. Crampin aside, and shewed him a list which he read to him. I heard something about Ikey Solomons and old Crowder, and a woman who, if she had been kept in custody, something more would have been found out. He said nothing more about the thirty sovereigns, but that he had got them, and would keep them. I did not see him afterwards, till he went to Guildhall, because Mr. Charlesworth wanted more money for Lidbetter and the officers, than Mr. Crampin was willing to allow. The Magistrate granted a summons for Mr. Lidbetter, and he was committed, greatly to our surprise and against our inclination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Mr. Charlesworth at the house when you got there? A. No; he came afterwards - he was present when the demand was made for thirty sovereigns. I do not know whether he concurred in it or not. I cannot tell whether there has been a dispute about it. Charlesworth took no part in the demand of the sovereigns at Lidbetter's house.</p>

            . I was in the service of Messrs. Crampin and Charlesworth. I went to their warehouse on the morning of the 27th of October, and took an account of the property lost. There had been a great quantity of silk handkerchiefs, shawls, &amp;c. stolen. I was not at Mr. Lidbetter's house more than twice. I merely called to know if Mr. Charlesworth was there.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I have been there nearly twenty years. In the course of that time I have bad great experience in hunting thieves and finding them. Mr. Charlesworth and Mr. Lidbetter came to Bow-street together on this business. I had occasion afterwards to see Mr. Lidbetter, almost every day for eleven days - we used his house on these occasions - there were never any orders given in my presence, but I took refreshments without paying for them. I have seen Mr. Crampin there several times, in company with his partner. I told them every circumstance as it occurred, relative to the discovery of the thieves. Mr. Crampin never expressed any dissatisfaction at what Mr. Lidbetter had done. Lidbetter never said that he had discovered who the persons were that had committed the robbery. The name of Ikey Solomons and old Crowder, were first mentioned, in consequence of the receipt of two anonymous letters. I heard at the house, where Beck with lived, that she had been apprehended. Mr. Lidbetter, in my judgment, was doing all he could to discover the thieves. I never saw a person do more to discover a robbery - he never represented to me, or to any one in my hearing, that he knew who the thieves were - I heard him say he would use every endeavour, and, if possible, he would find them. Mr. Crampin never charged him with having obtained money to help him to the stolen goods, to my knowledge. There was an appointment to meet at Charing-cross, in consequence of these two letters. We then went to White-street, to endeavour to see Beckwith - we found she had been there, but was taken; but if we went to Crowder's it would be for the service of this gentleman - we had an interview with him. We had an appointment to meet the next day, at another house, to find Ikey Solomons - it was never understood that Solomons or Crowder could do more than lead to information of the goods. I have not the slightest idea, from Mr. Lidbetter's conduct, that he was in collusion with the thieves to get money.</p>

            . I have been a Bow-street officer nearly thirty years. I moved hand in hand with Salmon in this transaction. No course could be pursued more adapted to discover the thieves than that pursued by the prisoner. If goods, of considerable value, are stolen, it is a natural and usual course, to discover the goods, by finding the takers, and I have no doubt that that was Mr. Lidbetter's object as well as ours. He said he would do his endeavour to get at the goods, and then at the thieves. At the time he met Ikey Solomons we were to be by in case we were wanted. Lidbetter had no power to have helped this gentleman to his goods by means of 30 l. - he never pretended or said, that for 30 l. he could help him to his goods. There seems to be nothing extraordinary in the bill running up to the sum it did. I think the charges for brandy and rum, and other things, are not extraordinary. I do not think 10 l. was too high a charge for what he did - if I had been a publican I would not have taken the trouble he did, and walk about as he had, for less than 10 l.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had not Salmon a bill likewise? A. Yes; he had a bill for costs, coach-hire, and travelling expenses, which came to 20 l. odd, and they gave us 30 l., they were so well satisfied with us. We never knew that Lidbetter had the 30 l.; but I think the eating and drinking at his house, and the labour he had, well deserved it. Our bill was quite distinct from his. We got our 30 l. for our trouble in endeavouring to obtain the property.</p>

            . I live in St. Paul's church-yard. I know Mr. Lidbetter very well. I have seen Mr. Crampin at his house once. The subject of this robbery was then brought up - I heard Mr. Crampin and Mr. Charlesworth express themselves satisfied with what Mr. Lidbetter had done; he appeared to me to have done all he could to detect the thieves. I heard Mr. Charlesworth speak of the bill, and he said he thought it was too little - Mr. Crampin expressed himself very well satisfied. I do not know what Mr. Lidbetter did in the business, but from what I have heard I thought it was very little. I believe Mr. Lidbetter to be a very honest man.</p>

            . I am a waiter at Mr. Lidbetter's house. I have seen these two gentlemen at my master's house, repeatedly. I have seen this bill; I made it out myself - I know that part of the things were had by the officers and the other gentlemen, and I believe the rest of the things were had by them. When my master was engaged in this business he appeared to act like an honest man.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you ever see a person at your house whom your master called Ikey Solomons, or that he spoke of as Solomons? A. No. I saw one person there, but I do not know his name, nor when it was.</p>

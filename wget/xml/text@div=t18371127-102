                  </hi>. I am clerk to Walter Frederick Wingrove, and live in Cumberland-market, in the parish of St. Pancras. He has a counting-house next door, on the ground floor of a dwelling-house, but having no communication with the house—on the 20th of February, I left the counting-house about half-past six o'clock—I went there again about nine o'clock, and all was safe then—there is a passage from the outer door to an inner door of the counting-house—the outer door was fastened by an outer lock, and the inner one by one of Chubb's patent locks, and could not be opened outside without a key—between the two doors is a small window which was fastened by a button—at nine o'clock both the doors were shut, and the outer one double locked—next morning I found the outer door single locked, the other door quite open, and the button broken off the window—the gas had been turned on, and left partly on, but there was no light—my property is worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was all safe the night before.</p>

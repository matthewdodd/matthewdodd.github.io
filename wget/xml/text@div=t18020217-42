               <p>PETER WARD sworn. - On the 23d of January, between two and three o'clock, I lost a game cock, from <placeName id="t18020217-42-crimeloc222">Sloane-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18020217-42-crimeloc222" type="placeName" value="Sloane-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Is that boy here? - A. No, I have not seen him since; I took the prisoner before Mr. Bond, who was sitting at the Prince of Wales's, and there another bag was found upon him, but nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sowl dead, or alive? - A. Alive.</p>
               <p>SARAH WARD sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; I saw a man, whom I believe to be the prisoner, just before the sowl was missing, but I cannot swear he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Prisoner's defence. I was going to work at Mr. Benwell's, in Sloane-street, all night; I was running pretty fast down Sloane-street, when this man came up, and said I had stole his sowl; it is a very likely story that I should steal his sowl, and come past the door again within an hour after.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020217-42-verdict223" type="verdictDescription">

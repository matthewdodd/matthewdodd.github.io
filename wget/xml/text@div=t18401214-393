                  </hi>. I keep the Three Jolly Gardeners public-house, at Lam<lb></lb>beth.

                  </hi>. I sleep in the same room with the prisoner at Mr. Dix's. He got up at a quarter past four o'clock in the morning of the 9th of December, and left the room—(six o'clock was the time he generally got up)—I missed him, and went out to look for him—I heard the gate of the bar go where the till is kept, and saw him coming from the bar along the passage—he had no business there—he then went into the yard—when he came in again, I said he had been into the bar—he said he had not—I said he had—he said I was a liar—I said I would search his pocket—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out rather better than a shilling's worth of coppers, which he said were his own—he then pulled off his trow<lb></lb>sers, and got into bed—I got his trowsers, and found about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in them—I got up to tell Mr. Dix—the prisoner got out at the back-door, and was taken by the policeman, as he was climbing to get away—there were the marks of his feet on the new palings—he at first said the money was his own, and that he must stand the <hi rend="italic">racket</hi> of it—I found the till near the bar-window, nearly empty.</p>

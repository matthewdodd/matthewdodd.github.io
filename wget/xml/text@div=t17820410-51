             was driving a cart with three horses; that the prisoner was driving Lord Verney's coach, that he drove the horses against him, and threw the man down; and the indictment states that it forced the cart over him, and so gave him a mortal wound; the sustance of the charge is, that Lord Verney's coachman threw the man down under the wheel, and must hove done it on purpose; but from the evidence there is no foundation to suppose that he drove the cart over him, from the situation he was in; - we may pretty well collect the substance of this indictment, badly as it is penned. It is a charge against the prisoner of having either wilfully driven his horses against the man, with a design to throw him down, and so endanger his life, by falling under his own cart; or it is at least, a charge of having driven his own coach so negligently and carlessly, as by that carelessness and negligence to expose the driver of the cart to be thrown down and killed; in one case it will be murder, in the other manslaughter. If a man seeing a carman in a situation standing by the side of his horses, the cart going on and not liable to be thrown down by his own horses, if he will drive his coach upon him maliciously to throw him down, the necessary consequences of which would be to expose him to meet with such an unhappy accident as this, he would be guilty of murder for so doing; but if he did not do it wilfully, and on purpose to do mischief, he could not be guilty of the murder.</p>

             deposed, that he was a hackney coachman, and coming up Saint James's-street, turning into Bennet-street, that he followed a cart loaded with coals, that the man was on the near side of the middle horse of his cart, which was the proper place; that the cart was about the centre of the street when he saw Lord Verney's carriage turn into the street, at the other end of it, which was about twenty yards from the carriage, that it was coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100069"></xptr> down a swinging trot, and not taking the proper side of the way, but the wrong side, that he himself was turning into the street and keeping his proper side, that he saw the coachman coming down upon the carman's horses, that instead of pulling up and keeping on his proper side, he crossed the fore horse of the cart, the effect of which was, that the horse turned himself from the carriage instead of towards it, and by that means exposed the man, who stood next the fore horses, to be struck by the wheel of the cart, or the horses, he supposes, that in fact he was struck by the point of the shoulder of Lord Verney's near horse, that the horse took the carman over the left arm, that he observed he was turned quite round, and thrown on his back under the wheel of his own cart, that the wheel went over him, and he died on the spot.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He said, that as he was coming down the street a gentle pace, and had got to the bottom of the street, the carman turned in, that he necessarily described a circle, and brought in his horses on that side he was obliged to bring his horses, which was the wrong side for him to have come down, that he stopped his carriage, that the man ran forward, probably to lay hold of his horse, to take care the cart was brought up, so as to let his lordship's carriage pass, in doing which, his foot slipped and he tumbled, that his carriage did not touch the man at all, but in running to lay hold of his own horse he tumbled.</p>
               <p>Lord VERNEY sworn.</p>
               <p>Deposed, that he was coming gently down Bennett-street, which was his general practice to go gently, that he never suffered his coachman to drive fast, that whenever the coachman attempted to do it he stopped him, that the carriage stood still when a very heavy laden cart was coming into the street, which he could not pass, till the cart had come forward enough to let his carriage come into the street; that he was looking to see what it was which occasioned the carman stopping, that he saw the carman running, rather staggering, as if he had slipped, that it did not occur to him, either of his horses could have touched the man, that it was a young horse on that side, but that he never moved, that the man staggered in that manner, that the horses were coming up on his lordship's carriage, that the man fell down just opposite to his chariot door, directly under the cart wheel, that the cart passed on, and there was nobody there to prevent it, it was so sudden a thing it could not be stopped, that he sent for an apothecary, but the man was dead, that in his apprehension the coachman was not in the least to blame, that it was a meer accident from the carman's turning in when he had got so near the end of the street, and it was the effect of the carman running to lay hold of his horses, that caused him to slip and fall; that he could not take upon him to swear positively his horse did not touch the man, as he could not see the horse's head, that his chariot has a box to it; the whole line of the horse he could see, but he saw nothing of the horse touching the carman, that the prisoner has been his servant a great number of years, that he was bred up in his family, that he never had any complaint against him, he is a very careful driver, and a very good servant, and very unlikely to be neglectful where danger might happen in consequence.</p>

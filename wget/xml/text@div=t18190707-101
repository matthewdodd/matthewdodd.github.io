On the 30th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I had been with some friends, and left them in Featherstone-street, City-road - I had 12 l. in my pocket. I went with a girl to a street near, and went into a house with her, but do not know what part of the house - the prisoner was in the room when the girl left. The watchman awoke me about two o'clock in the morning, he had the prisoner in custody. I missed my money, and found it at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am watchman of Golden-lane. On the 30th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came near me, called a man named May, and told him his daughter was dying - she desired me to call him, which I did, and he said he was coming down. She then said to me,</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about his daughter, he is my husband; I will tell you what I have done. I have drawn a man of 5 l." I said then I must take you to the watch-house - she offered me a 1 l. note to let her go. I called Miller, and took nine 1 l. and a 2 l. note out of her handkerchief. She then took me to a room in James'-court, where the prosecutor was, and said she got them there.</p>

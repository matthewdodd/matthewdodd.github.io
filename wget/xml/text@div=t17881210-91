               <p>What distance was Mr. Sansum's from you? - It is a neighbouring street, not more than two or three hundred yards, I cannot be very accurate as to distance; I never saw the two hats again.</p>

               <p>Sworn.</p>
               <p>I live No. 129, I live No. 129, Wood-street, Cheapside, with Mr. Kanner, he is a hair dresser; I am upon liking; I have left Mr. Rankin, my master; I lived with him for three quarters of a year; I lived with him at that time; it is a fortnight yesterday evening since I left him; the prisoner came in between seven and eight, and he asked my master if his name was Rankin, he told him it was; he asked him if he knew a Mr. Sansum, of London-street; and he told him, he did; he told him he must bring some hats for him to look at them, for he was to go out of town on Sunday morning; my master told him he would; the man went out of the shop; and my master went out of the shop; and in a little time the prisoner came to me and said, your master is at our house, and has sent me, and says you must give me the cocked hat and the round hat, that are in the window; my master had been gone out about three minutes; I am sure it was the prisoner that came back; I gave him them; and I saw no more of him 'till I saw him in the counter.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - No, not to my knowledge; I do not recollect ever seeing him.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure this is the same man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Quite sure? - Certain of it.</p>

               <p>What made you cry so much, when your master threatened you about not swearing to him? - My master did not threaten me; I said I knew him by his stripped coat, in particular, and in the Compter he was among a good many more; and they put them all in a row, and desired me to find him out, and I knew him by his face as well as the stripped coat; this was the 7th of November.</p>
               <p>Then all that he said to you was, that your master had sent him for a couple of hats? - Yes, he said your master is at our house, and says you must give me the cocked hat, and round hat, that lay in the window; upon which I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver them because you thought your master was at this house, and had sent for them? - I did; I saw him come in to order them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you send the prisoner, or any body for the cocked hat, and the round hat, out of the window? - No, I did not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in Mr. Rankin's shop the evening of the 7th of November; I saw the prisoner come and demand of the servant, Mr. Rankin's boy, a cocked hat and a round one, which he said, were in the window; observing, that his master was at their house, and desired they might be sent; he said your master is at our house, and desires you will send a round hat, and a cocked hat, which are in the window; the boy delivered the hats immediately; I saw him; I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I mean to submit to your Lordship, that upon the facts which have been stated, it is impossible to sustain the present prosecution; I need not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100072"></xptr>cite to your Lordship, cases to establish this, which I take to be the first principle of criminal law; for from the definition of larceny, and other offences, which are perfectly distinct from that of larceny, it is perfectly clear, that this is not a felony; and I shall take the liberty of contending that it is no other crime punishable here; the definition of larceny from Serjeant Hawkins's Pleas of the Crown, is in point; and I submit that there has not been any thing in this case, but that which by the most forced construction can be made a misrepresentation; he mistates a transaction, he lays his caution asleep, and induces him to part with the goods of his master; my Lord, I submit that includes no trespass in point of common sense, or in point of law: my Lord, I contend this would not constitute a cheat; and that if this man was now trying under such an indictment, he could not possibly be convicted; and for that, I think, I have the authority of all the writers on criminal law; Serjeant Hawkins says, of cheats punishable by prosecution, there are two kinds, &amp;c. and he says,</p>
               <p>"A cheat that is accompanied</p>
               <p>"with no manner of artful contrivance,</p>
               <p>"is not punishable by a criminal prosecution." He does not say it is not punishable as a felony, but it is not punishable by a criminal prosecution; and he says,</p>
               <p>"Because it is accompanied with</p>
               <p>"no manner of artful contrivance." What is the present case? A false pretence of having a message and order for that purpose; and I argue from proving that it is not a cheat, a fortiori, that it cannot be a felony. This transaction is accompanied with no manner of artful contrivance; if he had brought one of his master's shop-bills, one of his master's hats, or his master's name on a card, I agree there would have been an artful contrivance; and Serjeant Hawkins proceeds, and says, it wholly depends on a bare naked lye, &amp;c. Now, is there any thing in the present case beyond that? If this message had been addressed to any body of riper years, they would have said, very good, I will carry it; and a person of still more caution, would not have carried them at all. I remember a case which happened very soon after I was at the bar, before Mr. Justice Ashurst, where the representation was of this sort: I have taken the Essex Arms in Essex-street, and I shall want a great number of candles: the allegation was,</p>
               <p>"That whereas he</p>
               <p>"had not taken the Essex Arms, nor any</p>
               <p>"other house;" and the learned judge was of opinion, that it was a bare naked lye; for the prosecutor could have gone to the landlord, and made himself certain. My Lord, if I was defending this man on an indictment for a fraud, I should content myself with reading this line from Serjeant Hawkins, to your Lordship, he says,</p>
               <p>"it is said to be needless to provide</p>
               <p>"severe laws for such mischiefs." - What severe laws? Punishing him for a cheat? then this monstrously absurd doctrine follows; that if this man had been indicted for a cheat, upon which this court could only impose a slight punishment, if he was convicted, but which the law authorities have said is not the subject of any criminal prosecution; yet you are called here today, though sitting here, as I contend, without a power of convicting this man of a fraud; and sitting on a case where the law says, it does not make a severe punishment necessary; you are to punish him with more severity. My Lord, I submit it is not even a cheat, and if it is not a cheat, it cannot be a felony; I submit that there is no ingredient of larceny in this case, no trespass, but that it is a bare naked lye.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you distinguish this case, Mr. Garrow, from the case of a man going to buy a horse, and saying, Sir, I will be obliged to you to let me try this horse's paces; he gets on the horse's back with the consent of the owner, and rides away with him. Then there was the case of a man who bought a coffee-pot, or some piece of silver, and carried it to Gray's-Inn coffee-house, and delivered it to a person at the bar, and says, take care of that till I come again; soon after he was gone<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100073"></xptr>out, she says to the boy, if the gentleman calls for that piece of silver, you must give it to him; she went out, another man came in, and it was delivered; he did not say I am the man, but he came so immediately in the same manner that the other man did, who said he would come, that the boy delivered it; and there it was held to be a felony. Then there was another case, where a servant, a porter, I think, was carrying goods, and he was met by some of his companions, who said it would be a better thing to take them to another place and sell them, and prevailed on him to do so; that was a stronger case; for in all the other cases it had been held, that if the fraud was done at the time, animo furandi, then it was a felony; but if afterwards the man was tempted to do it, then it was not a felony. But there is so little distinction between frauds and felonies, that I think it my duty to save this case for the opinion of the Judges, to see if we can get this doctrine of felony and fraud into something of better order, than I confess it is at present, in my mind, at least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow requested to have a special verdict, to which the court assented.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to prosecutor. I have only one question, Sir. My Lord put it to you very distinctly; do you mean to swear positively that this is the man? - That is the man that came to me into the shop first.</p>
               <p>It is stated to me, that at first you charged him only on suspicion? - I certainly did; I committed him that night on suspicion, because, though I was certain in my own mind, without the smallest doubt, yet if I found on the boy's seeing him, and the other gentleman's seeing him, that they would not identify him, I did not intend to prosecute him; the boy was shewn the man in the Compter, in presence of several people, and he picked him out directly.</p>
               <p>The boy had been informed, I take it for granted, before he went into the Compter, that you had taken the man that you had seen come into the shop that evening? - Yes, that he did know.</p>
               <p>The boy is represented to me as having cried a great deal? - He did cry before the magistrate, but it was at the appearance of the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did the boy at any time express any doubt on the subject, or do you believe his mind has been made up since? - Never, on my oath; the moment that he saw him, he pitched on him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear there was a person in Clerkenwell, that was committed for the same crime? - I never did.</p>
               <p>What day did you charge him upon suspicion? - The 19th.</p>
               <p>You had not seen him for twelve days? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment for stealing two hats, and there will be two questions for you to consider: the first is, whether from the character given of him, and the evidence taken altogether, you believe him to have been guilty at all; whether he is the person that has done it, or if he did it, whether he did it with any bad intent at all: Mr. Rankin tells you, he is quite sure the prisoner came into his shop in the evening of the 7th of November, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here the learned judge summed up the evidence, and then added -</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if you are of opinion, from these circumstances, that the prisoner did go with this false story, with intent to get into his own possession, and convert to his own use, the hats belonging to the present prosecutor, and that he was the person that came back with that other false story, that Mr. Rankin had sent for those hats, and that by that means he obtained the hats in order to convert them to his own use, then you will tell us so, and we must put that on the record, for the Judges to decide, whether that under the circumstances be a felony, or if it be only a fraud: if it be a felony, the court will determine on your stating the particulars, that he is guilty, and they will punish him accordingly; if it is only a fraud, of course the prisoner, being now indicted for a felony, will be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100074"></xptr>acquitted; and it will be for consideration afterwards, whether he shall be indicted for a fraud or not.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we are bound to believe the evidence, and that the prisoner was the person that obtained the hats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton read the special verdict. That the prisoner, with intent unlawfully to obtain, and to convert to his own use the goods mentioned in the indictment, went on the 7th of November to the shop of Mr. Rankin, and there told Mr. Rankin, that Mr. Sansum,</p>

               <p>[Court. I suppose the jury mean to find, that when he went in the first time, he had the same intent? - Jury. No doubt.]</p>
               <p>who lived in London-street, wanted a hat, and desired that he (Rankin) would carry him some to look at:</p>
               <p>[Court to Rankin. You did carry some hats with you? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Did the man go out after you, or before you? - Before me.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Rankin then went with some hats to Mr. Sansum, in London-street; while Mr. Rankin was gone, the prisoner at the bar returned in three minutes to the shop, and said to the man who had been in the shop when the prisoner first went there,</p>
               <p>[Mr. Garrow to Morgan. Little boy, was you in the shop when the prisoner first came and told your master? - Yes, I was.]</p>
               <p>your master is at our house, and he has sent me, and says, you must give me the cocked has and the round hat that are in the window, which he accordingly than and there delivered to the prisoner, who went away with them, and converted them to his own use; and they further find, that Mr. Rankin did not send the prisoner, or any other person for the hats.</p>

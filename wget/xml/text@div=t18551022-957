                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About the Italian boys with the white mice, you were discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because a vile conspiracy was set up against me—I preferred a charge at Marlborough-street against a man for keeping fifty boys—it was not in consequence of that that I was dismissed—I did not lay a charge against him that he had fifty boys, and then when at the Court refuse to swear that there were more than ten—I was dismissed in 1844—I never brought any charge against Abiatti, but against his brother—that was in 1842—they never had Abiatti, he was too artful for that—no one paid me, I did it gratuitously—I mean I did all this for nothing—they set up a con<lb></lb>spiracy against me, and the police took my warrant away—I had had it seven or eight months.</p>

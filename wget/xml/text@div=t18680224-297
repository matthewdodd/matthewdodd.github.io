                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Richmond—the prisoner Chant was my butler for about two months—he was under warning, and was to have left the week after the robbery—I had a rosewood dressing case, which I kept locked in my bedroom—it had a Bramah lock, and could not well have been broken open—I kept the key in my pocket—I saw it last on Tuesday, 4th February—I left in it three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, the numbers of which I have in my pocket, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, the number of which I cannot tell, because it was one of a series—this paper has the numbers of the notes upon it—it was written by me, not from the notes themselves but from a letter from Coutt's—I received three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Coutt's, and I can swear number sixty-seven was in my case—I do not know the numbers by heart, I should have to look to tell you—I made this just after the robbery—I knew what I had, but I had not written it down—I know the series, I received them from Coutts's on the 14th January, in the morning, by post, in a registered letter—I also had five or six sovereigns in the case, and a cross and other articles—I did not personally miss the case till the Wedne</p>

               <p>day evening after the robbery, and nobody had said a word to me about it—I instantly gave information to the police—the prisoner came to me on the Monday, the day before the robbery—he spoke first of all about the next house—he said, "Do you think anybody sleeps in it"—I said, "No, I do not think they do"—he said, "Do not you think anybody might get in from over the wall to your house and rob you"—I said, "I do not—there is a man with a gun sleeps in the next house but one, I should think they would hardly dare"—I said something of that sort on purpose—he was very anxious to go out that day to arrange some matters for himself, and in the afternoon he said to me, "My windows have been blown in, I want to go and see about them"—I said, "You had time to see about that on Saturday or Sunday, why now?"—he said, "I want to go, I wish very much to go, I will give up going home on Wednesday if I may go to-day"—I said that he might go—that was the evening before the robbery—we were at dinner in the breakfast room, on the evening of the robbery, from half-past five to half-past six—after that I had a little study with the German master, and we took coffee there—it is impossible that anybody could have broken in without my hearing them, and I had my dog with me; a most extraordinary watchdog, who would have heard any stranger's footsteps—Chant came to the door to fetch the dog about seven—he whistled for him, and after that I ordered coffee—after he brought the coffee up, he took the dog out, and then, instead of waiting to clear away, which was his duty, he rushed out with the dog, and left the housemaid to clear away the coffee—he seemed in a great hurry to get out—that was a little after seven—he returned about eight or a quarter-past—I recollect hearing him go upstairs, while at dinner—I wanted him to open a bottle of champagne—he was upstairs so long that I asked him why he had been away so long—he said, "I have taken the bottle down in the kitchen to open it"—I said, "No, you have not, the bottle is there"—he had come from upstairs then, not from downstairs—he had no business at all upstairs—he said, in his defence, that a staymaker had come; that is not true, for it was on Monday she came—I had no fire in my dressing-room; I had ordered him to let it out—he knew that I kept money in my dressing-cade, because he had always seen me open it to pay the tradespeople; and he knew where it stood, because he had been into my room occasionally to fix the blinds, and such things—I know Robinson—he brought my dog home, and got 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said, "Who are you?"—he said, "A waiter"—and when my servant came home, I said, "Your friend, George Robinson, brought my dog home; I think he enticed him away"—he said, "Oh! no, he is not a man to entice the dog way, he is too respectable"—I gave him Warning in consequence of that, though I did not tell him so—all the silver ornaments were on the toilet table untouched.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Bricklayers' Arms, at Kew Road—Mackay has lived with us four years—on 4th February I saw Mackay and Robinson at the bar—I think it was between six and seven—Robinson came in and called Mackay out—I saw a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his hands, and Mackay told me afterwards that Robinson called him out to ask me to change it—Mackay had not left the house before during the day—I refused to change the note.</p>

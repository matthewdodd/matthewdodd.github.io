             - we live in Whitecross-street. On the 12th of September the prisoner came to meet me at the House of Correction, in Spafields; I had a bundle, containing these things - she asked if I would go to her place, and lodge with her, and said I need not trouble myself to look for any other home; I asked her if she would have any thing to eat and drink - she said she should be much obliged to me; we went to the <placeName id="t18291029-173-crimeloc976">Apple Tree</placeName>

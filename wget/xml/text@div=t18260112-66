I had 17s. 6d. in silver in my right hand breeches' pocket, just as I entered the door; there was a half-crown, and the rest in shillings and sixpences. I caught the prisoner's hand as he was drawing the money out of my pocket, and handing it to another person - some of it fell on the ground; as soon as I said "I am robbed, and this is the man," some one struck me on the head, and knocked my hat over my eyes. I am certain the money fell from his hand while I had hold of him; I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you let go of his hand till you gave him into custody? A. I let go of his hand, but did not let him go. I sung out for a constable in the theatre, and could not find one - I had got round the corner into Drury-lane, when I gave charge of him; the watch-house keeper sent me out of the watch-house - but I was not drunk; I had dined at home, and had not been into any public-house. I accused the constable of taking money from the prisoner in going to the watch-house; I did not say first that I had lost 7s. and then 9s. - I said 7s. 6d., and then I checked myself and said 17s. 6d. I was perplexed a little - I had a friend with me; I did not hear him say the prisoner was not the man.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live at the corner of Russell-court, Drury-lane - I have been a constable four months; the prisoner was given into my charge; the prosecutor said he had robbed him at the entrance of Drury-lane Theatre. I think he said of 7s. or 10s. - and he insisted upon my taking him to the watch-house or to Bow-street - he was very tipsy, and prevaricated very much in his story - and his friend said he did not think the prisoner was the man; I took him to Bow-street - there were several officers there, some of whom said I should go out and settle it, for if I took him before the Magistrate, he would reprimand me for bringing a drunken man there - I then took him to St. Martin's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a master-baker? A. Yes. The prosecutor had a person with him, who was more sober than he was, and his friend said he did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120034"></xptr>think the prisoner was the man; he said he had lost 7s. and 10s. - I do not think he mentioned 17s. at all. I took him first to a public-house, to settle it; and then we set off to go the watch-house, and met the keeper. The prisoner and I went in there, the prosecutor followed us, but the watch-house-keeper saw that he and his friend were drunk, and he pushed them out again. The prisoner went on very quietly with me, and declared he knew nothing about the robbery. As we were going along Henrietta-street the prosecutor and his friend came up, and said, "It is all over - let go of the prisoner;" I said I would not - I had got the man in custody; he said, "You are doing wrong - it is a bubble altogether," and I considered he alluded to my being connected with the prisoner - we then turned back, and went to St. Paul's watch-house, Covent-garden, and afterwards to Bow-street; the prosecutor stated there that I was going along with the prisoner, and he thought I had got some of the money. I offered to be searched, but Sir

             would not allow it. The prisoner was very sober, and wished to be searched, and 14s. 6d. was found upon him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What distance is your house from the Theatre? A. About fifty yards - I have lived there about nine months. Though the prosecutor was drunk, and prevaricated about the amount of the money, he did not prevaricate about the prisoner being the man. It was the prosecutor who said it was of no use going on. It was the officer at Bow-street who said it was no use taking a drunken a man in, and I had better go and settle it. The prosecutor refused to come into that measure; we did go the same night before Sir Richard Birnie - he was not angry, but took the prosecutor's testimony, and committed the prisoner - it appeared to me very extraordinary, and it does so now. Sir Richard Birnie told him two or three times to hold his tongue, for a drunken fool. Neither I nor any of the officers told the Magistrate that we had proposed he should not be troubled with the case. I thought the prisoner was as innocent as I was, but I thought it my duty to keep him, as a constable. There were so many officers, I could not tell the names of those who gave me this advice.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNBULL re-examined. Q. Had you been at any public-house that day? A. No. I am a single man, and had been at home with my friends. I had not been drinking. I went to the Theatre to keep out of the way of drinking. Sir Richard Birnie accused me of being drunk, but I told him I was not, and he afterwards took my deposition. I cannot remember whether I signed it, but it has my signature to it, and I was not there afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were so sober that you cannot remember whether you signed the deposition or not? A. No; but I was not there afterwards. I had drank nothing but water all day - my friend was close behind me at the entrance of the Theatre - he did not tell me he thought I was wrong about the prisoner. There was a woman in Mr. Bowler's shop, but I did not notice her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Drury-lane, the prosecutor and another man came up, and said,"You have picked my pocket;" I said, "What do you mean?" and his friend said, "Are you an Englishman?" I said, "Yes" - then he said, "You will not mind going before a Magistrate" - I said, "No." We then went into the baker's-shop, and I was given in charge.</p>

            . I am married, and lodge at Mr. Bowler's. On the evening of the 26th of December I met the prisoner and the prosecutor coming into the shop - the prosecutor was drunk in my opinion - any one looking at him must have seen he was drunk; he called the person who was with him his brother; Mr. Bowler said, "What do you want? - do you want to give charge of this man?" the prosecutor said, "I have been robbed of 7s. or 10s.," and his friend leaned over the counter, and said to Mr. Bowler,"For myself, I don't think he is the man, but he pointed him out to me, and I held him;" the prisoner did not make the least appearance of wanting to escape. Mr. Bowler asked him if he had any objection to go before the Magistrate - he said No; he appeared perfectly sober, and so did the prosecutor's brother. Mr. Bowler is single, and I minded his shop for him while he went - I have lived there about nine months.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM TURNBULL. Q. Was there any money in the prisoner's hand after you heard some drop? - A. I cannot say that, but after we got out he asked me to let go of his hand, which I did, and he put it towards his pocket; I do not know whether he put any thing into his pocket.</p>
               <p>JURY to EDWARD BOWLER. Q. Where was the money taken from? A. I think some was taken from each of his pockets.</p>

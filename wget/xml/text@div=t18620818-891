I live at 4, Queen's-square, Hoxton—I am a painter and am the occupier of the house—on the night of 16th July, I and my family went to bed about half-past 11—the house was quite secured at that time—I fastened it myself—the parlour door was locked and the back window secured by a fastening in the ordinary way—there were no shutters—at about 4 o'clock in the morning I was awakened by the police, and came down into the back kitchen—I found the back window still closed, but a square of glass had been cut out of the half that was close—I found two coats, a clock, and some children's wearing apparel in the middle of the room, packed up—that property belonged to me, and was worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my house is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.</p>

On the morning of 16th July, about 4 o'clock, I was on duty in Queen's-square, near the prosecutor's house—I heard a noise at the back of the house—I went to the back and looked over the wall, and saw the prisoner Huggett in the back kitchen, and William Smith outside the kitchen window—Huggett was packing up some things inside the room—Smith was looking through the window at Huggett—Smith looked up first—they both saw me—it was quite light—Smith made a sign to Huggett, and Huggett looked up also; Smith immediately jumped in through the window to Huggett—I immediately jumped over the wall, and went through the window into the house—they shut the door of the room in which they were; I heard the noise of the shutting—I could not open it very well with my hand, and I burst it open with my knee—I got to the front door and found that was fastened too—I opened it, ran out, and gave the alarm to my brother constable—they had got out of the house, and I followed on the track up St. John's-road, and saw Huggett running—I picked up a pair of stockings that Smith had on when I saw him through the win<lb></lb>dow; his boots were off—I did not see the others running—as I was getting near Huggett he turned round and found I was close on him; he said, "Who are you running for?"—I collared him by the throat and said, "You"—I took him to the station, and afterwards went back to the house, when I found two pairs of boots—I brought them back to the station-house—I then saw Matthews and William Smith—Matthews claimed the pair of boots that I found as his—I have seen Huggett before—there is a mark at the side of his face, and I was near enough to see and identify him—I was within three yards of him when I saw him in the room—from the top of the wall to the room is about three yards.</p>

Some went one way, and I and two or three others came and stopped at the corner of Essex-street. They went indoors to go to bed, and left me. I lived in Clerkenwell, and I was very tired and sleepy, so I sat down and went to sleep, and all at once I heard the policeman halloo.</p>

               <p>I perceived the prisoner, Hosier, frequently went out of my premises loaded with iron, I am a ship-builder, she is repairing upon my premises, and I saw the prisoner, Hosier, coming out of the ship Hope, on the 5th of January, loaded; I called one of my foremen to take notice of it; we found a considerable quantity of nails, packed up in a compact manner for stowage, I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120052"></xptr> sent for the officers, I asked the prisoner where he generally sold these nails, and he told me -</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Council for Prisoner Hinde. Do not mention any person's name? - I came here to do my country justice, not out of rancour; our neighbourhood abounds with these people, and I know, that from four yards, we lose at least five thousand a year, from Blackwall yard and three more in our neighbourhood; I recommended the boy all I could to let me know who it was that bought the things of them, and when the officers came, I told them to be aware that I did not give them charge of the prisoner, for the boy before they came had confessed where he sold the goods from time to time; when the officers came, I thought it was better to put a private mark on the property, and permit him to pursue the same channel to sell them as before; they were not my property; he was followed by two people to the shop, that is all I can swear to, to my own knowledge; I attended at the Magistrate's, and we had a search-warrant in consequence of my oath, I presume I may say, and they brought some of the property back to me that was marked, and a considerable quantity of nails. I do not mean to say a single word to aggravate, but we really are so over-run. I one night could have taken two thieves, but I could not get a man to help me. I took the property.</p>
               <p>Court. I am sorry for it, but I am afraid it will not do. You certainly acted very commendably in what you did: it is certainly a very bad thing there should be so many people guilty of this practice of receiving stolen goods, but it can only be put a stop to by legal means; and I am afraid, in point of law, the receiver, who is the only person that is principally wanted to be come at in this case, cannot be come at. As to the <rs id="t17850112-43-deflabel223" type="occupation">boy</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17850112-43-defend495 t17850112-43-deflabel223"></join>, there is evidence enough, but I only mean to dispose of the receiver: now this man must have been a receiver of stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen, and I am afraid, in point of law, the theft in this case is purged, by the goods once coming into the hands of the right owner; the gentleman receives the goods, and he gives them to him back again; by that act of the owner he purged the felony, and the boy was sent for the purpose of selling them to this man; therefore, I am afraid in point of law it will not be sufficient with respect to the receiver: and I think, after what has happened, that they made use of the boy as an implement to bring the other man to justice, and he having acted faithfully, it would be too much to convict him.</p>

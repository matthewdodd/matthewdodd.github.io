                  </hi>. I live at Highbury, and am actuary to an insurance company. The prisoner was in my service up to about the middle of Oct. last—she afterwards went to the service of Miss Northcroft, who sent for me about 20th or 21st Feb.—I went, and the prisoner opened three boxes—my daughter, Mrs. Gill, was present, and Miss Northcroft—several articles were pointed out by Mrs. Gill as belonging to herself and to me, but more particularly those which had our names on—the things are here—this towel has my name on it—this is the top of my son's cane—I believe it is silver.</p>

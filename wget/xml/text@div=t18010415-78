             sworn. - I am a cheesemonger and grocer, in Russel-street; I have had dealings with the prosecutor; in the beginning of January I was indebted to him 31l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him any thing in the course of that month? - A. No, I did not; I paid him 20l. some day in February, but I cannot say what day; and on the 13th of March I paid the prisoner 8l. in penny pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of the 31l. that you owed Mr. Burks you have paid 28l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Burks.) Q. These entries he charges to himself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Can you now state positively that there is a deficiency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the Magistrate you could not? - A. There is a deficiency now of 12s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there is now a deficiency of 8l.? - A. I mean to say there was a deficiency of 8l. from Friday, the 13th of March, till Monday, the 16th; there was no entry at all on the 13th; I made an entry on the 16th of 7l. 8s. which was the money he received; Martin, the carman, then brought 7l. 8s. before I came home on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you now then speak with positiveness of there being a deficiency of 12s.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to say positively that the prisoner has brought no more money to account? - A. No, he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are perfectly sure there is now 12s. deficient? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Murray.) Q. When you paid the 8l. the prisoner and Martin were in company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were put into the cart, of which Martin was the carman? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Burks.) Q. When the prisoner had made an entry of 10l. copper money received from Murray on the 26th of January, did not you find that you had 10l. less than you ought to have? - A. No; that 10l. was entered, "Mr. Murray, copper," only, the figures 10l. were not entered then; it was entered between the 26th of January and 13th of March; the entry Mr. Murray, copper, signified, that next time he went that way he was to call for copper; I do not know when the 10l. was entered; it was after the prisoner had been charged before I observed it; I am sure it was not there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you cast up your books? - A. That was lest to Bligh, he had the management of all the books, he was in-door clerk; he discharged the ledger from that cash-book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. When you charged the prisoner with this, you took him up? - A. I took him up before he was charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after he was taken up, he had no access to that book? - A. No; here is another book,(producing it); here is "Murray, 20l." and then there is a leaf torn out, and upon that leaf, I remember seeing it wrote, "call at Mr. Murray's for ten pounds worth of copper," that was wrote by syset, the collecting clerk; that ten pounds were never received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Who was the little book kept by principally? - A. Kept by the prisoner to discharge it; this is the in-door clerk's book, but when the out-door clerk went out, he always took it in his pocket.</p>

             sworn. - I am carman to the prosecutor; as we were coming with the cart from Thames-street, the prisoner said, there are 10l. in penny-pieces left at Murray's, we may as well call for them; we went to Murray's, and he brought them out in a tub; Mr. Murray said, there are 8l. worth of them; they were taken out of the tub, and put into an empty candle-box; and as we were going along home through Piccadilly, Bligh said, we shall whack this between us, Harry, for Murray has already got a receipt for it; when we got back, I went into the stable, and took my bag that holds the corn for the horses, and took the copper out of the box, and put them into the bag, the bag was full; I took them to Mr. Bligh's, put them into his bed-room, and left them; when I came back, I found that I had left 8s. worth in the cart, they had shook out of the bottom of the box; I put them in the corner of my smock-frock, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150055"></xptr>went to the factory; I told Mr. Bligh I had left them all at his house, except the 8s. worth; he said no more to me about the money till Monday; on Monday afternoon Bligh said, for God's sake bring back these penny-pieces, for your master is gone the City round himself to-day; I took the 8s. worth of penny-pieces, to Mr. Bligh's, and found him and his children counting them out of a chest of drawers; he took 8s. worth from me; I took them upon my back to Mrs. Burks, and Mrs. Burks asked Mr. Bligh to make a memorandum of them, and he said, they are already made a memorandum of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Where did you come from to-day? - A. From Clerkenwell New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been kept in prison to give evidence here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up yourself for this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said, if they would not charge you with it, you would tell of Bligh? - A. I was not charged with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be taken up then, and sent to Clerkenwell? - A. I was taken up upon suspicion of breaking open my master's desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the man that brought the money home, and we have only your word for all this conversation with Bligh? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, upon being taken up for breaking open your master's desk, did you not say, if they would not prosecute you for that, you would accuse Bligh of having advised you to take these halspence? - A. They did not say any such thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you yourself did not make the offer of accusing Bligh, if your master would not prosecute you? - A. I never touched the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you that; were you not under some degree of alarm at being taken up and sent to prison? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear you were under no alarm at being prosecuted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had no idea that your master would prosecute you? - A. I did not know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010415-78-verdict438" type="verdictDescription">

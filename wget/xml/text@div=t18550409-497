                  </hi>. I am a carter, at Romford. In the afternoon of 3rd Feb., I was going from London to Romford, and on the road I took up Bishop—I saw the prisoner with a gun in his hand, and just before him there was another man who had a gun—the other man said, "How do turnips go;" I said, "Half a crown a dozen"—I said to the prisoner, "You can't shoot;" he said, "I can shoot"—I said, "Shoot me," and be held his gun to his shoulder and fired—I did not hold a cap up, I was sit<lb></lb>ting down in the cart—we were both sitting down—I heard a report, and Bishop was wounded—he bled a great deal—he said, "Stop, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, I am shot"—and the blood trickled down his face.</p>

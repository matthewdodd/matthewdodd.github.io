               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told him I had some other things to carry first; he said I was drunk - I went to a public-house, and he told another porter to take it, if I could not - I awoke next morning, and found I had been asleep in Hoxton-square.</p>

               <p>MOSS WOOLF re-examined. I gave the stove into his hands. I did not see it on his shoulder.</p>

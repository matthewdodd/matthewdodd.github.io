She said that would not do, for she must have something in Pledge. I told her I had nothing to give her but my Gown, and I was not willing to part with that; upon that she and two more fell a swearing at me, and she said she would take it off by Violence if I would not give it her. I ask'd her whether she could answer stripping People? She said, - yes, who could hinder her, and then she took my Gown off my Back by Force, and I have never seen it since. I demanded it again once since that Time; and she said she could not give it me without I gave her the Shilling. She has often desired me to take it out before I had my Tryal, or else I could not have it all.</p>
               <p>Pris. I was made a Ward-woman by the Partners, and when I got a Shilling I always gave them 9 d. out of it, and they told me if People had no Money, I must make it, or else I must pay it myself; and as for this Gown, the Prosecutor was starving with Cold and Hunger, and pull'd it off and I lent her 7 d. half penny upon it.</p>

            . I am a Prisoner, and saw the Prosecutor when she was going to pay her Dues. She said she had no Money, but she would pawn her Gown and Apron for them. The Prisoner offer'd to stay 'till her Friends came, but the Prosecutor immediately took off her Gown and colour'd Apron, and insisted on pledging them; what became of them afterwards I can't tell, but we all paid 1 s. for Ward dues, at our first coming in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 230 <hi rend="italic">B</hi>). About a quarter to three on 28th January I was on duty in York Street, Westminster, and as I passed Mr. Miller's house I heard a noise in the passage—I said, "Who is there?" but received no answer—I sprang my rattle and kicked at the door—Mr. Miller admitted me, and I found the shop had been broken into and an entrance effected—I then went into Ship Court, which is about two doors off, and found that a number of tiles had been broken in two houses in York Street, adjoining—I followed that track into Mr. Mil<lb></lb>ler's yard, and continued it over three different houses in the same direction, when, having crossed a yard, I got to the Wellington Barracks—when I got to the farther end of the barracks I found the prisoner and two others crouched down close to the tiles—the other two escaped over the wall, and went into the Wellington Barracks—I jumped down and stood over the prisoner—he was lying along the tiles along the wall—I cannot say whether his eyes were closed—he was not asleep, because as soon as I stood over him he began to move—when I touched him he said, "I have only been asleep"—that would be a way of escape from Mr. Mil<lb></lb>ler's back door, which was open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist—on the night of 28th January I locked and bolted my shop inside—I was knocked up by people breaking ill in the middle of the night—I let the policeman in, and found the back door open, which I had locked two hours previously—an entrance had been effected by the back kitchen, by lifting up the window-sash, which was loose—I held up a light to see who went over the wall, and a brick was thrown at my head, which knocked the candle out of my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his statement before the Magistrate, alleged that a soldier of the Grenadiers took him on to the roof of the bakehouse, telling him to wait there for a parcel to take to a friend near Temple Bar; and, finding he did not comeback, the prisoner went to sleep on the roof, having been drinking; and that, having met with an accident, he had a handkerchief and some lint and lotion over one of his eyes, and a bottle of lotion in his pocket. The Jury considered that there was not enough evidence to call upon the prisoner for his defence.</hi>

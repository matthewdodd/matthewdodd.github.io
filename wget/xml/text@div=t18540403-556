                  </hi>. I am inspector of the G division of police. On Thurs<lb></lb>day, 23rd March, I went with other officers to No. 32, York-street, London-road, about half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon—the front door of the house was open, and we proceeded up stairs to the back room on the first floor; the door was opened by sergeant Richards, and we immediately rushed in, I saw the three prisoners sitting at a table which was close to a clear coke fire—Richards seized Matthews, and I saw Nevill seize the female prisoner, who had this plaster of Paris mould in her hand; and Evans seized Thomas; Nevill handed me the mould, which was so hot I could scarcely hold it, and in it was a sixpence and a great, as they now appear—on the fire I found this pipkin, which was then whole, but has since met with an accident—it had in it white metal in a state of fusion—on the table I found this teacup, containing fifteen sixpences in some sand and water—there was also on the table these two pieces of paper, with plaster of Paris adhering to them—I believe they are used for malting moulds—I found on the table this file, with white metal in its teeth—there was a saucer containing some white sand and water, and on the table was a jar containing some acid—I saved a portion of it—in a cupboard, in the room, I found this galvanic battery plate, with a piece of wire which has been used with solution of silver—I found a small portion of plaster of Paris in the cupboard, and on the table I found three shillings and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, which were finished, and a sixpence which was unfinished, with the fragments to it not filed off—I found in the cupboard an earthenware dish with plaster of Paris adhering to it.</p>

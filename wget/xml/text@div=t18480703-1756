                  </hi>. I live in Knight's-buildings, Bermondsey. In 1842 I was convicted of felony, and sentenced to ten years' transportation—I underwent an imprisonment, and five years were remitted—I have known Stevenson a great many years—I met him about last Feb.—he said trade was getting very bad (he was a leather-cutter); he intended to sell his stock-in-trade, and he would work on my judgment with his money—I was in the horsehair and glue-piece trade—I collected horsehair for the manufacturers; that has nothing to do with leather—I began the business with Stevenson—I went into Kent with him some time in March—the last trip I had with him was in April, to Thaxtead—he said he wished to return to town, as he expected a man to call with some butts—we came to town, and went to his house—we saw his wife—he asked her if any person had been inquiring for him—she said no person had been, with the exception of the man with the butts, and she wished he would have nothing to do with these infernal butts—she further said that she wished, when he went in the country again, he would not leave her without money, and he had sent the man to her for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to pay for the horse and cart—she was then speaking of the same transaction—Stevenson and I then went into the kitchen—he looked at the butts, and said, "My wife says they are rather inferior, but I think they are very good"—I did not count them, but there were two bundles rolled up—I believe there are generally five butts in a bundle—these bundles were about the usual size—Stevenson said he was sure there would be a <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> about these butts some time or another; but he could not see how it could possibly be found out until they took stock, in consequence of the foreman and the car<lb></lb>man being concerned in the affair—he further stated that they came from a large firm in Weston-street—next morning we went to Maidstone—I went with him to carry some bags to the steam-boat, and he said to me, "I wish you would call on Mr. Lay land, as you are going over the water, and tell. him I have got ten 35lbs. butts for him, and I want 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for them"—I went to Mr. Layland's, in Shoreditch—I did not see him; I saw his man in the shop, and a female—I delivered the message to the wife—Ste<lb></lb>venson returned to town after that, and I told him I had called on Mr. Lay<lb></lb>land, and he said he was a buyer, if they were cheap—Stevenson hired a cart on the morning after he returned, to fetch the goods from the railway station which he had bought at Maidstone—I went with him to fetch them away, and about two o'clock that day the butts which I had seen in the kitchen were loaded in the cart by Stevenson and myself, and taken away to Mr. Layland's—the butts were there unloaded and taken into the shop—on our return from Mr. Layland's, Mr. Stevenson said he had done very well out of these butts; that he gave 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sold them at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but he must have an invoice</p>

               <p>made out at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he emptied his pockets into his wife's lap—she counted the money, and there was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—on the same evening I saw "Walker in the shop I was in the parlour—there was a partition between us, and a glass window in the door—Stevenson's wife was in the parlour with me, and Ste<lb></lb>venson came and opened the door, and asked her for some money—she said, "How much?"—he said, "Give me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or rather 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—previous to that, he had asked for a pen and ink, and I saw him writing while Walker was in the shop—his wife went up stairs and fetched the money, and gave it him—Stevenson and Walker then went to the Cottage of Content—I stopped at Stevenson's till the time to go home, and then went to the Cottage of Content—I saw Stevenson and Walker there drinking ale—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is my writing—I wrote it on Saturday, the day after I saw Stevenson and Walker together—I did not post it then, in consequence of not knowing who to send it to—I posted it on the Tuesday after these goods were sold on the Friday—the post-mark is on it now, April 11—I was at Stevenson's that day—I saw Mr. Layland call there in the afternoon—he saw Stevenson in the shop—after he was gone Stevenson said to his wife, "There has been a <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> about these butts; Mr. Mortimer, the foreman, has been over to Mr. Layland"—his wife said, "I thought they did not belong to Mr. Mortimer"—he said, "No more they do; they belong to Mr. Brooksbank"—about the same time, nest afternoon, Mr. Wilks called, and Stevenson went in the shop and spoke to him—I did not hear the conversation, but after Mr. Wilks was gone Stevenson came to the parlour door, and said there certainly was a <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> about these butts—Mr. Wilks returned with Mr. Brooksbank and a police<lb></lb>man, and while they were there I saw Stevenson take a file of bills down, take one bill off, and lay it on the counter—he then came to the parlour, put his hat and coat on, and went away with them—next morning I was at Ste<lb></lb>venson's, and saw Mrs. Walker there—on the Saturday afternoon following I was there again, and Stevenson returned home—he had in the interval been in custody on this charge, and had been bailed—he did not say anything to me on that day, but next Monday he said he had seen Walker, and had given him into custody boldly, considering it would make his case look better—on the same day I saw Stevenson take-down the file of bills—he took two or three bills, brought them into the parlour, tore them up, and put them into the fire—he said to his wife, "These are the bills of the other butts "—I have seen Mrs. Walker, on other occasions, at. Stevenson's—she was there mostly every day during the time that Walker—was in Horseraonger-lane—I saw her there once when Stevenson was there, and she told him she had seen her husband, and he intended to stick to the same tale; that was said while Walker was in custody—I heard Mrs. Walker speak repeatedly, day after day, to Stevenson—she said her husband did not see that there was any utility in bringing the other man into the affair, because in the event of his being in prison they would assist in supporting him.</p>

               <p>why did he give anybody into custody, for fear they should tell some<lb></lb>thing about him—Stevenson said he had found out Walker, and had taken the officer to him—I stood almost like a post on those occasion—I heard, but I did not utter a word—they did not talk to me—I was continually in the place—they did not tell me to turn out—I most likely must have made some answers—I cannot say what remarks I made—I gave no advice—what I was transported about, was a little wearing apparel—I was tried in the other Court, I think before Judge Gurney—I had never been in custody before; I was with another man, who had been in trouble once or twice—the wearing apparel was in the passage of a private house, in Bermondsey—the door was open—the young man that was with me got the clothes—I was inside—I cannot tell what the clothes were—I was in the hair and glue piece trade—the glue pieces come from the same hide that the butts do—a man may be a judge of glue pieces, and not of butts—I did not buy any glue pieces while I was with Mr. Stevenson—I bought horse-hair—I took him about to horse-hair places, and collected it—my name is James Crowe—I signed the letter, "A Well-wisher to Honesty"—I considered I ought to be a well-wisher to honesty, after what I have suffered—I have been honest ever since I was transported, to the best of my knowledge—I have not been in trouble since—I know a man named Matthews, a publican, in Bermondsey—he never made a charge against me, for having a pewter-pot of his, and never suspected me of anything to my knowledge—I never heard him say that he took a pewter-pot out of my hat—I never heard a word of such a charge till now—the reason I wrote the letter was, I considered I stood in very great danger—I gave no evidence myself till I found the case was not strong enough, then I came forward; when Mr. Stevenson said she hoped her husband would have nothing to do with these infernal butts, I did not remonstrate with him about the danger he was in<lb></lb>curring—I did not know Walker—I had never seen him at Mr. Stevenson's before that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Boucher and Mortimer. I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) on Tuesday, 11th April—the post-mark is "Shoreditch"—I went in consequence with Mr. Mortimer to Mr. Laylands—I saw nine of these butts there—I went next morning and saw the same—we went through our stock, and found it was correct, and I gave the letter to Mr. Brooksbank—Layland took me to Lock's-fields, and showed me where Stevenson lived—I did not go into the house then—I went next day with Mr. Brooksbank and a policeman—there was a bill in the window to let the house and shop—I went in and saw Stevenson—I asked him who he bought the butts of—he said, "Of a man named Roberts"—I said, "Can you tell me where Roberts lives?" and I told him Mr. Brooksbank and a policeman were outside—he said he could find Roberts, but he must not have a police<lb></lb>man dressed in uniform—I told him that I could not say anything about, I must go and speak to Mr. Brooksbank—I did so, and Mr. Brooksbank and the policeman came in with me—Mr. Brooksbank asked Stevenson if he had got an invoice of the butts—he said he had, and he asked his wife to bring a file, which she did—he took one off the file, which was, "Stevenson debtor to Roberts, ten butts at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.," which came to 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—it was signed at the bottom, "Received the same day, "I think, "Thomas Roberts," but it was a cross with Roberts's name—Mr. Brooksbank asked Stevenson who wrote the invoice—Stevenson said, "I made out the invoice, because Roberts had got</p>

               <p>the rheumatism in his hand, and could not write, but he put the cross to it"—I went out with Mr. Brooksbank and Stevenson to seek for Roberts—the policeman followed us—Stevenson went into the Wellington public-house, came out, and said Roberts was not there—he said he did not know where Roberts lived, but there was a man in Pitt-street, named Walker, could tell—we went Pitt-street, and Stevenson knocked at Walker's door—a little girl came, and said her father wms not at home—Stevenson then said he could not tell where to go—we went to the Bricklayers' Arms and had some refresh<lb></lb>ment—we got there about half-past six o'clock—Stevenson said, after he had been there some time, that he did not buy the goods of Roberts, he bought them of Walker—I asked him who put the cross at the end of Roberts's name—he said, "Walker did"—I asked him if he did not know better than to let one man sign a cross to another man's name—he said, "Well, Walker told me to do it"—he was then given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother. I went to Stevenson's house immediately after we got the letter from Bouchers'—I asked Stevenson for the invoice—it was handed to me—he said it was the invoice of the butts he bought oi the man Roberts—I saw it was made out precisely as has been stated, and signed "Roberts," in Stevenson's hand<lb></lb>writing, with a mark following—I went in search of Roberts for the first hour—I then left—I was not in the Bricklayers' Arms, I was at the door—six o'clock is the nominal time for our men to go to work, but they are very rarely there before half-past six or seven—they are not at work before six—I do not reside on the premises—none of these 600 batts had been sold—they came 100 in each cart—they were delivered in one parcel, and put into the shed—I have seen the butts found at Mr. Layland's—they corre<lb></lb>spond with the 600 in tanning, and in marks inside and out—I hare seen talker about frequently—he worked in our warehouse occasionally in Oct. last, I think for ten days or a fortnight—he was sufficiently on the premises to be acquainted with them—he was aware at what time we commenced business in the morning.</p>

            . I am an ivory-turner, and live in Houndsditch. On Saturday, the 18th of March, the prisoner came to my house, and asked me if I wanted to buy some ivory. I asked him what sort of stuff it was? he said, there were nine teeth, weighing four hundred weight. At this time I knew of the robbery having taken place. I asked him where I could see it, as I did not like to buy it by samples, without seeing the whole. He said, it had been smuggled, and therefore cut into pieces to be brought on shore. The real reason I said I wished to see the whole was because it was exactly the same number of teeth, and nearly the same as had been stolen. He said he would endeavour to get the person who owned it, to let me see the whole; he said they were down at Blackwall. When he was gone, I communicated the substance of what he had said to Messrs. Sinclair. He came again in the morning, and came after that again at three o'clock in the afternoon. He came again on the Monday, and said he had four teeth weighing two hundred and six or two hundred and eight pounds. I understood them to be of the same parcel that he had first mentioned. He said, he would bring a piece to shew me, and in the afternoon, about three o'clock, he brought this piece; he brought it strangely wrapt up in a sack, so that it did not look like what it was. I told him I should like to have seen the whole. He said, if I would buy this piece, he would bring another, and so on, until he had brought the whole. I told him, I thought it was stolen, and as I had a suspicion of two persons, I should like to know the name of the person from whom he got it? he said, he could not help it. I said, I must detain the piece. He said, you have brought me into a strange dilemma, and then he went away. I gave information to Sinclair. I had known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years. I had heard of the robbery on the Wednesday morning before.</p>

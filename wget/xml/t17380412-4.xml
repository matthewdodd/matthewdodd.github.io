               <p>John Wall. The Prisoner came into the Field where my Horses were at Work, on the 8th of March, and view'd them: I had been sowing some Barley, and was then harrowing the Ground. After he had look'd at the Horses, he went into my Yard; I watched him, and saw him come out again. When we had done Work that Night, I put up the Horses and made the Stable Door fast. The next Evening, March the 9th, about 9 o'Clock, I saw them safe in the Stable again; and went to smoke a Pipe with my Landlord's Man, about 11 I return'd, and found the Stable Door broke open, and the Horse was gone: He was afterwards taken in the Hands of the Prisoner, at Staines, by the Bellman, who informed me of him the next Morning.</p>

            . While I was upon the Watch in the Morning, the Prisoner came driving the Horse before him along the Road; I cry'd Hallo, and he answered me once; I call'd to him a 2d Time, and he made no Answer, but kept beating the Horse on. I saw he had a Hempen Halter in his Mouth, so I got to his Head and stopp'd him; I asked the Prisoner where he had the Horse, he told me, and by his Directions I went down to Ivall, at South Warnborough, where the Prosecutor lives, and he claim'd it. The Prisoner confessed the Fact very plainly. <rs id="t17380412-4-verdict19" type="verdictDescription">

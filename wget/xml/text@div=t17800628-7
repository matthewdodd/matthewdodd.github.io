               <p>Did you see the cutlass? - No, I did not; I only heard those expressions. The deceased opened the door again, and I heard her say, My dear, the men are all gone, there is no man here now. She shut the door again, and I heard her say, I hope the door is well barricadoed now.</p>
               <p>Where was you when you heard this? - Up stairs over their head. Soon after that I heard four or five blows given, which I took to be given with a piece of wood; I thought by the found they were struck flat ways. I heard her cry out Murder once, but that was with a low voice. The servant girl at the Bell came up; I desired her to go down and get the deceased to answer her. The girl went down, and came up again to me and said the deceased was lying all in a gore of blood. I went down, I saw her lying on the bed, upon her right side, all in a gore of blood.</p>

               <p>Was the deceased lying upon the bed or upon the ground? - Upon the bed; the bed was upon the ground.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Bonus, who keeps the Blue Bell in King-street. I was coming past this house; the landlady, Mrs. Waters, stood at the door; she trembled, and seemed very much frightened; I asked her what was the matter? She told me she believed the cobler had killed Ally; that was a nick-name they gave her: they stood at the bottom of the stairs to hear if they could hear any thing; I could hear nothing; I went softly up stairs, and peeped through a crevice in the door; I saw the deceased lying on the bed, upon her right side, all of a gore of blood; I saw the blood running from the back part of her head. Mrs. Bevan came down stairs very much frightened. The prisoner stood at the head of the bed; the bed lay upon the ground between the two windows; he was in his shirt, and had a rusty saw in his hand; he had something else in his hand, but what it was I could not tell; he stepped over her, and looked out at the window above her head; he called out to her several times, Will you give it to me, you whore? What it was I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Did she make you any answer? - No; but she called out several times, Mother Bonus, are you coming? That was meaning my mistress. I came down stairs then, and told the people that I believed she was killed; I went directly home.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner above three years; he used to follow coal-portering.</p>
               <p>Did he work regularly as such? - Yes, he used to follow coal-heaving. I was standing at the corner by the Bell on the Wednesday between eleven and twelve o'clock, I believe it was near twelve; a woman going about the street said to me, Mr. Bull, I wish you would go and see whether Alley is dead or no.</p>
               <p>Who is that woman? - A woman that gets her bread in the street.</p>
               <p>It was not Bonus or Bevan? - No, a strange woman who lives in the neighbourhood. I went there; there were a great many women about the door. The women cried out, that Ally was killed, and that the cobler had killed her; I immediately ran up stairs to break the door open, but the women laid hold of my coat and pulled me back, and desired me to have more regard to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280017"></xptr> my life, for that the prisoner was a bloody-minded man, and might run a knife into me. I went down to another man, and asked him if he would go with me; he would not; I got two more men and broke the door open, and went into the room; the deceased was lying upon her right side, her head was under the window; I lifted up her arm, and saw three cuts athwart her arm; her little finger was off, all but hanging by a bit of skin; I put my hand upon her breast, and she was as cold as a stone; I looked out at the window, and told the neighbours they need not be terrified, for she was dead enough, she was as cold as a stone.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner then? - In the room, with his back up against an old door; I said to him, O you bloody thief! you have done for her now, and now you will be done for. The prisoner said, I have, by Jasus! swearing at the same time. I said, What did you kill her with? I killed her with a saw, said he. I asked him where the saw was; he said it was behind the drawers. I turned her head on one side, and put my fingers into her skull; it was like a lamb's head that is split open.</p>
               <p>Did you take hold of the saw? - No, I I did not, there was such a conquest of people in the room, and my blood was turned in me, I was glad to get down stairs.</p>
               <p>He said nothing after he said he did by Jasus? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He knows very well that I was out of my senses that morning.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know the prisoner out of his senses? - No, never in my life; I have seen him in liquor often.</p>
               <p>You did not look upon him as a madman? - No, he might be mad when he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he drunk or sober when you entered the room? - He was as sober as I am now.</p>

               <p>When the uproar was made about the murther I went in to see after Bull. I was in the room some time; I saw a piece of a crucifix and beads lying on a table that the prisoner had; There, I said, see that. He gave me no answer at all; he never said a word; the people kept going down and coming up; a neighbour desired me to assist him, to prevent his getting away; he was about twenty minutes in my custody. I said to him, What did you kill her with? He said, With a saw. I said, Where is the saw. He said, Behind the drawers. I could not get at it, there were such a quantity of people in the room. I desired the people to look, and a boy took it from behind the drawers; I took it out of his hand; it was carried before the justice and before the coroner; it was bloody; there is blood upon it now, I believe; it is the same saw; a press-gang came and took him to the justice.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing? - He said, he had done for her.</p>
               <p>Liscoe (produces the saw). The coroner's jury gave me this saw in charge.</p>

               <p>Whether you saw the wounds on the body of the deceased, and whether they were the cause of her death? - On viewing the deceased there appeared marks of violence on various parts of her body.</p>
               <p>Court. You need not describe the wounds technically. Do you think the wounds were the cause of her death? - Particularly on the right leg, there were three cuts or slits, which seemed to be done by a jagged instrument, one above another, on the inside of the right leg; on the outside of the left leg there were two cuts of the same kind. Upon examining the back part of her head, there was a wound with a jagged instrument; on the side of the head there were two other wounds; on the front of the head there was not only a wound, but it seemed to have been done with great force; the fore part of the skull was driven entirely into the brain, and broke into a great many pieces. I have no doubt in the least but it was the cause of her death.</p>

               <p>To Peet. Did you know any thing of the prisoner. - Not to have any acquaintance with him. I have seen him in a publick-house, when I have been having a pint of beer; sometimes, when he was drunk, he used to behave like a mad-man.</p>

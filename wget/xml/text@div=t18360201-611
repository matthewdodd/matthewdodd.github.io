                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Biggs. In the middle of October I had some onion-seed of Mr. Biggs—it was in the drying-house—I missed some at the time, but I cannot precisely say what quantity—the drying-house cannot be shut up—on the 2nd of November last I had some onion-seed in the barn—I lost some at that time—I was cleaning it—I fastened the barn door by the hog yard—I attached the chain on the staple, fastened it with the pin, and hit it in with a stick—I seedbeds it with a rope, and took the key away in my pocket—when I came back at one o'clock, and unlocked the front barn door, which is in the yard, I found some persons during my absence had broken the door open by the hog yard—I missed a quantity of onion-seed—It was precisely the same as this—it resembled it exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of His Majesty as a gardener. In October last, the prisoner Wallis asked me whether I could get him a customer for some onion-seed—I said I did know, but I knew some persons where I worked, and I would ask them—I saw Mr. Street the next day and asked him—I saw Wallis the next day—he asked if I had heard of any one—I said Mr. Street wanted to see a sample—I took a sample over—I cannot say whether this is the seed—it was similar—I told Wallis on Saturday night, that if he would take it over to Mr. Street he would have it, and give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb. for it—he said very well, but he could</p>

               <p>not take it over on Sunday morning, as he had got nobody to took after his teams—he asked if I could do such a thing—I did it without fee or reward—I think it was some time in October—I told Wallis I had sold the seed, and gave him the money—no one was there at the time, but I saw Field go into Wallis' afterwards—no the same Sunday, when I went down to get saved I saw Field, and he asked me if I had sold the onion-seed—I told him I had, and paid Wallis the money, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and he said, "Wallis gave you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., did not he?"—"No," says I; then Field offered me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said, "Waills has not given me enough by sixpence; he only gave 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—after that Wal<lb></lb>lis asked me if I could get him a customer for some more—I said I could not—the seed was something similar to this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am travelers to Joseph and James Atkins, tobacconists, No. 62, Shoreditch. The prisoner was errand-boy—on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 12th of March, I gave him two pounds of tobacco, with instructions to proceed to Greenwich, to a place which he said he could not find the day before—he was brought back by the witness Flack's father, with two parcels of tobacco in his bag, which he ought to have delivered three or four days previous—these seven dozen of cigars were produced by Flack—I have every reason to suppose they are my masters'—we have missed such—he had no authority to take them—I gave him in charge, and as we were going to the station I asked the boy Flack, "How many cigars have you had from this boy of ours"—he said, "Not more than half a dozen"—the father said, "Why, he gave you a bundle yesterday," and he made him fetch them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Paul-street, Finsbury. I know the prisoner—he brought me this bundle of cigars one Friday morning, about seven o'clock, as I was opening my father's shop—I do not know how he came to bring them—I did not ask him to do so—I had smoked three cigars which he had given me before—as I was opening the shop, he came up to the door, gave them to me, and said, "Will you mind these for me? I am going to leave on Saturday night," and I took them.</p>

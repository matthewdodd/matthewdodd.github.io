I was not much in liquor when I first met her - we returned to the room and found Smith there, and had another pot of beer, and some meat cooked for supper, after that I laid on the bed, and so did Pillar, for three-quarters of an hour, and while there I felt her feeling about my breast under my waistcoat.

I picked it up - they both denied having seen me. Pillar opened the window and threw something out - the watchman said it was a note. She made no answer; the watchman afterwards brought me a Warminster note, which had been in my bag with 39 s. in silver. I had more silver in my breeches pocket.</p>

               <p>"Do you know this man"; she said she thought she did, and that he had been there that night - she came down to open the door in her shift. I went with him up stairs. She denied the charge. Fowler took a bag off the bed and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is the bag which contained my swag, but there is none in it now;" Smith denied any knowledge of it.

I said I saw her throw something, she said it was only a piece of paper, and that the watchman had got it.

            . What the prisoner at the bar says is very right indeed; the prosecutor came to my place and gave her this note, in my presence, to go and redeem her clothes. She said she could not get change, he said, never mind, as he could get it in the morning from the waggoners. She put it in her bosom. She had no place to sleep, and I let her sleep with me. The watchman found 11 s. 6 d. in my husband's chest, which belonged to two men who were at sea. Fowler was very much in liquor.</p>

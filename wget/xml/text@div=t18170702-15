The prisoner was one of the two who asked me who I had been speaking to - They both asked me. They then seized me; the prisoner seized my right arm, and the other my left. I told them the man had asked me what was o'clock (which he did, as well as asking relief); they then asked me if I had a watch. They both collared me as I answered them, and knocked me down. I called out, "If you are not out of hearing, come back!" being in hopes that the man who first spoke to me was not quite gone. I was on my back; one of them tore my face, and put their hands into my neck handkerchief. I felt them put their hands into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, where my watch was; they tried to take it, I tried to keep it. I said, "do not murder me, and I will give you what I have got," and gave them the watch and seals-it was a gold hunting-watch, three gold seals, and a gold chain-they ran off; I did not see them again. It did not last more than four minutes-it was a very bright moon-light night. I gave information to the watchmen outside the rails of the Park. In the morning I heard a person was taken up - I went to Marylebone watch-house, saw the prisoner there, and was sure he was the man. Before I saw him, the watch-house-keeper asked me to describe him, which I did, and when I saw him I immediately recognized him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LONG. I have been four years in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in possession of this property - A. I have had the chain and seals five years, and the watch three - I bought them myself. I believe the watch cost fourteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given a different account to any other person as to what it coast - A. I have been asked what the property that I lost was worth altogether; I said I could not replace it under 30l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Chaff - A. I do not. I have been threatened with vengeance by the prisoner's father. I did not speak to any person in the Park afterwards - I got to the gate in two minutes, and then told of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you lived with a lady - A. Yes. I am a lady's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of going to Kensington at so late an hour - A. I only arrived in town on the 20th, and wished to see my friend.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave information of the robbery, did you describe the prisoner's dress - A. I described him to have a long, dark, slouchy coat on, and either a glazed or old oil-skin hat; and the other man as having a lightish coat on. I saw them walking towards me, and put my watch and seals into my waistcoat pocket quite concealed.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is on the Edgware-road. On the night of the 23d I had just called eleven o'clock, and heard the cry of murder in the Park; I could see nothing-it was moon-light. I took the prisoner up on another charge, between half-past ten and eleven o'clock, just by Tyburn-turnpike, which is about six hundred yards from where the robbery was committed - He was walking with another man, apparently from the Park; they abused me very much, which made me take them up. They were taken to the watch-house about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The man who was with him was Sibley, who lives in the Edgeware-road; I knew him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SELLERS. I am a constable of Marylebone. The prisoner was taken up on another charge. I saw him the next morning, and the prosecutor charged him with the robbery.</p>

            . I am assistant watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house between eleven and twelve o'clock by Creighton. The next morning the prosecutor came, and asked if we had any person in the watch-house; I told him we had several. He described the prisoner to me, and said he had been robbed by two men, one having a light and the other a dark dress. He said one of them struck him; he thought it was the man in the light dress. I asked him if there was any difference in the size of them. He said the man in the light dress was the tallest-the prisoner was dressed in a dark brown long coat. In consequence of the description he gave me, I let him see the prisoner alone - He said he was one of them. I had no person else in the watch-house answering the description of the other man. I saw Sibley come into the watch-house with the prisoner; he had a light dress on, and was rather taller than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ROCHFORD. I am a watchman at Cumberland-gate. Just as I had called eleven, I heard a cry of murder in the Park. When I had called half-past eleven, I saw three men standing at the corner of Park-lane; two appeared dressed in dark, and one in light clothes-neither of them were dressed like a soldier. One of them said "Away!" and the other two set off down Oxford-street, towards Tyburn-turnpike-Sibley was one of them. I heard the rattle sprung by Creighton.</p>
               <p>JAMES DAVEY. I am constable of the night. The prisoner and Sibley were brought in between eleven and twelve o'clock. The prisoner had a dark coat on, and Sibley a light one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Sibley, and he asked me to walk down to Knightsbridge barracks with him. We got there at six o'clock, and staid drinking till eleven, and coming home we met the watchman; we were singing, he took us to the watch-house. The next morning the prosecutor said he believed I was one of the men. I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>ROGER CHAFF. I am a musician. I had been at Lord Carlisle's, in Grosvenor-place, and returning home, just by Grosvenor-gate, I met the prosecutor; it was half-past eleven o'clock - He gave an account of his being robbed(it must have been about half-past eleven); he was coming from the Park-he said he had been robbed by two men. I asked him particularly how they were dressed; he said they were dressed in white jackets. I asked him what brought him into the Park at that time of night? he said he was a servant, and could not get out before ten o'clock - He said he was going for a little air. When he came out of the gate, he told a different story to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020009"></xptr>watchman; he said he had been robbed of his watch, which cost him thirty guineas, and that he was returning from Kensington; he said he was making towards Cumberland-gate, and coming back, knowing that he could not get out; he was throttled by two men, and if he had not delivered his watch he should have lost his life.</p>
               <p>JOHN SIBLEY. I am a pipe-maker, and live in Bell-street, Marylebone. On the 23d of May, I was in company with the prisoner; we went from Bell-street between four and five o'clock in the afternoon to Knightsbridge barracks; we got there about five o'clock, and remained there till a quarter before eleven, and returned home through Edgeware-road, up Park-lane-no person was with us. We had a parley with the watchman; this was about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and lasted a quarter of an hour - We were both taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know Rochford, the watchman at Cumberland-gate - A. No. I was not standing at the corner of Park-lane, with the prisoner and another man. We never stopped until we were with the watchman. I was dressed in a short white jacket. The prisoner had a dark, long great coat. I do not know what hat he had on-it was a shabby one. I do not know whether it had an oilskin or not; I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILCON. I keep a canteen at Knightsbridge. The prisoner and Sibley were at my house till about a quarter before eleven o'clock; they were both intoxicated. Sibley brought me some pipes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time did they come to you - A. At three or four o'clock in the afternoon; on person was with them. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

             re-examined. The witness, Sibley, told me at Marlborough-street that he was out of the prisoner's company for a quarter of an hour; this was when he was taken up on suspicion. I am not certain that I saw Sibley before this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say the two men had white coats on - A. No. I described one as having a light coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about taking the air - A. I do not know that I said so, but I might if any person had inquisitively asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been stated that you said you had lost your watch, worth about thirty guineas - A. I said the watch, chain, and seals were worth thirty guineas. I did not say I had come from Kensington. I said I intended to go there, but found it too late.</p>
               <p>SIBLEY re-examined. Did you see Willoughby at Marlborough-street - A. I did; I was taken up on suspicion, but he would not swear to me. He said he could not be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say at Marlborough-street that you had been out of the prisoner's company for a quarter of an hour - A. About ten minutes-this was on the way from the barracks.</p>

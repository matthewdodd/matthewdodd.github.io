                  </hi>. I lodge at 11, Middlesex-place, Somers-town; the prisoner lodged there too. This night fortnight he came home between eight o'clock and half-past, the worse for liquor—he sat down to his supper, eating it with a knife and fork—a chair was broken—the landlord said he was not to break any more of his things—the prisoner said he would break every b—thing he came across—he was then sitting about a yard from me—I did not say a word to him, but he was calling me names—he took hold of the knife, and was wheeling it about, in a great passion, stabbing the table—when the landlord went out of the room, he said he would have my b——y eye out, and threw the knife at me—it struck me, and cut me severely—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

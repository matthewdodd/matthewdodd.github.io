On Saturday evening the 8th of March between seven and eight o'clock, I missed a quadrant from my shop window; on the Monday following in the morning, it was brought by a city officer to my shop; my name is on the arch, I knew it was mine:</p>

             sworn. On Monday. the 10th of March about ten o'clock in the forenoon, I met the prisoner at the bar with the quadrant, going down Crutched Friars; it was under his arm wrapped up in a woman's apron as it is now; I took it from him and asked him what he was going to do with it, he said he was going to sell it where he could; he said a boy gave it to him to sell, pointing to a boy who then stood opposite. An officer who was with me went and took that boy; we took them both to the Mansion House; the boy was discharged by the magistrate and the prosecutor's name being on the quadrant, we went to his house. I produce the quadrant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, and a gentleman stopped me and asked me whether I wanted a job, I said what job is it, he said take this thing to the Two Bells, Whitechapel; he said he would give me six-pence; as I was going there two gentlemen stopped me. This gentleman stopped me and asked me to carry it for him to the foot of London Bridge, and when the officers took me he ran away.</p>

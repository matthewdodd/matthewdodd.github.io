On Oth of this month I lived at No. 7, Lansdowne-terrace, West Brompton—between 11 and 12 o'clock on that night I was going from Bayswater to Brompton, down Paddmgton-lane—as I was going along a man attacked me from behind; he pinioned my arms down, and the prisoner seized me in front across my neck and grasped my neck—I am quite sure that the prisoner was the person who did that—he took a thin case, containing a Crystal Palace ticket, from my right hand waistcoat pocket, and three sovereigns from the left hand waistcoat pocket—he and his companion then both left me—there was only a gleam of light visible there at that time—I only just caught sight of him to see who he was, he had a brown shooting coat on and a cap—I did not see him again till that day week—I gave a full description of him at the station house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the collectors and meat inspectors appointed by the Commissioners of Sewers, for Newgate-market—I have performed those duties for twelve years and upwards—on 16th February, my attention was called by Mr. Greatrex to four quarters of cow beef, which were lying at his place—they were in a hamper when I saw them—on exposing the meat, and examining it, I found it to be in a very bad state—the flesh was quite wet, which is always a sure indication that the animal was diseased—what ought to be fat was a serum, not fat at all, watery—the meat was totally unfit for human food—that was obvious to me immediately upon looking at it—there is no doubt that it was diseased and unfit for human</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it have been unwholesome food when it was fresh killed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far is Hitchin from London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About thirty-four miles—I took the meat before one of the Aldermen of the City, and he ordered it to be condemned and destroyed—I went down to Hitchin to make inquiries about this matter—I called upon the defendant, and saw him—he is a fishmonger, I believe, living in Hitchin—I saw him in the street—I told him that I had come respecting some meat that had been sent up to Newgate-market in his name—he said that he had sent four quarters of beef, but he was employed by Mr. Peck; that the meat did not belong to himself—that was the substance of the conversation—in the course of it, he said that it was not bad—I said that I had seized it, and that it was very bad—he said he was very sorry that he had sent it in his name, and he hoped nothing would come of it—he said, "I shall not get anything by it; I have merely sent it for Mr. Peck"—he did not say anything as to who had packed it up, or dressed it, or killed it—it was cow beef—he did not tell me who slaughtered it—I made a written memorandum of the substance of the conversation—it might have been the next day that I made it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing—he did say that he had killed and dressed the cow for Mr. Peck, and sent it up for him—I had forgotten that—I did not weigh the meat in the market in London—it was so very bad that the men objected to weigh it—we did not take it all out of the hamper—it weighed about 3 1/2 cwt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure he said he killed and dressed it, or did he say that a batcher, of the name of Taylor, had killed and dressed it, and that he had merely sent it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not—I am quite sure of that—he never mentioned the name of Taylor—a good deal of boiling water is used sometimes in the process of dressing—I do not know what the defendant knows of meat—I never slaughtered meat, but I have superintended it when it was slaughtered—if it was quite fresh the day it was killed, I am quite sure it would not be in the state in which I saw it a day or two afterwards—diseased meat will decompose more rapidly than good meat—the disease would certainly be seen at the time of killing and dressing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it possible that any person could have killed and dressed that meat without observing that it was in a diseased and unfit state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing I or the learned counsel had gone to look at this meat, would it have been perceptible to our eyes that it was unlit for human food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly it would—the flesh was wet, and very different from the ordinary appearance of good meat—the flesh of a diseased animal would be wet and flabby—I had no means of judging what disease the animal was labouring under—we cannot always form a judgment of that—from my experience I should think, in this particular case, the animal had the lung disease, from the appearance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the appearances which, to an unpractised eye, it would exhibit of not being fit for food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The flesh was wet and flabby, and very different to the flesh of good meat, and the fat had turned to serum—the difference between fat and serum is that one is solid and the other a fluid—it was in a fluid state when it was exhibited for sale—the fat of a diseased animal would be so—if you took up this animal, the fat would flow from it like water.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had merely seen this meat, from the appearance that you found on it, should you have come to the conclusion that it was dressed by a butcher, or by a person unskilful and inexperienced in such matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By a butcher.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the meat inspectors of Newgate-market—I saw the four quarters of cow beef, about which Mr. Fisher has now been giving his evidence—it has been my duty about seven years altogether to inspect meat—I think this was the worst I ever saw—it was very bad, and decidedly unfit for human food—in my judgment, that must have been apparent to the person who slaughtered and dressed it—no one who was any judge at all, could have dressed it without seeing that—it appeared to have been slaughtered and dressed by a person accustomed to do such work—it was cut up properly, as if done by a butcher—it had the appearance of having been dressed by a person accustomed to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are quite sure that it was cut up as a butcher would cut it up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—any man that had common sense would know the difference between that and good meat—I believe a man that was a fish-monger and not a butcher could, by just looking at it, have seen that it was unfit for human food—I do not know whether meat is generally sent in cloths—sometimes I dare say it is, and sometimes not—there was no cloth on these when they came up—they come in quarters or sides, not in whole carcases—these were not in cloths—I saw them in the hamper—they had not been unpacked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You Saw the hamper opened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the meat in the hamper—it had been opened before—the person who dressed the meat ought to have seen that it was in a diseased state, whether he was a butcher or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a man who was a fishmonger and not a butcher had dressed this meat, what were the signs that it would bear which would indicate to him that the meat was unfit for human food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he opened the animal, he would find the whole of the tissues a mass of water, and the meat would present a different colour from the ordinary colour—the lungs, I have no doubt, were double the usual size—I formed an opinion of what disease the animal died; it was pleura pneumonia—it was suffering from lung disease very severely—it would present those indications to the person who dressed it—the lungs would be formed of a hard callous matter, instead of the usual spongy appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to a man who did not dress it, what indications would it present to him, if he was not a butcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The colour of the meat any unpractised eye would see in a minute—a man I mean, not a butcher—it would principally be the colour of it, and the appearance of the fat—it was more the colour of mahogany than good beef—the fat was merely a thin skin of fat, hanging where the fat ought to be—we did not pull it about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman in Tylor's market, Newgate-market—on 16th February I received four quarters of cow beef directed to me—it was in a very wet, damp state—in consequence of the state in which I found it, I called in the inspectors—in my judgment that meat was not fit</p>

               <p>for human food—that would be evident even to an unpractised eye—it was so bad that any ordinary person could see it—this is the label that was on the hamper—it came by the Great Northern Railway—it was the only hamper I received that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there an invoice in the hamper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not—it was addressed to Larner and Greatrex—that is printed on the label—I was in partnership with Mr. Larner—we are large salesmen—it makes a good deal of difference in meat whether it is packed immediately after it is dressed—it generally arrives in very bad order if it is packed hot—I did not examine it sufficiently to see whether it was slaughtered by a butcher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it on being dressed and given to a man merely to pack up, that man being merely a fishmonger, have passed his eye as being common meat to send up to market? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Really I cannot tell that—I cannot tell whether it might not have appeared fit for human food to a man not a butcher merely putting it into the hamper; I mean a man who did not examine it—I have seen meat that was packed pretty good, look much the worse for the journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that apply to diseased meat as well as to Bound meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it would not make that difference—it would make some difference—if diseased meat was packed immediately after the animal was killed, its bad condition would be increased by that—it would not look so well as if it was packed cold, even though it was diseased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having reference to the state in which you saw this meat, in your judgment must it have appeared to have been diseased and unfit for food when it was packed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot tell, for I did not pay that attention to it—I saw it was in a very bad state and called in the inspectors—I cannot say how it looked when it was slaughtered—if it had been slaughtered a few hours previously, it must have presented a bad appearance then—if it was diseased it would have presented so bad an appearance as to indicate that it was unfit for human food—it would have done so to the eye of any ordinary person, as well as to the eye of a butcher—it arrived packed in a hamper and cloths—there were cloths over it—the four quarters were not in separate cloths; they were packed altogether, and the cloths were all round them—there were two cloths in the hamper, I think, one underneath and one over—the top one must have been added after the meat was put into the hamper.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When she was dressed, as you tell us, you saw her, and the meat looked very bright; my friend also asked you whether it was dry or not; and I observed that you did not quite answer that question. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, she was as dry as you could expect when she was being dressed, she was not quite finished, but the beef looked very well—I did not see her after the dressing was finished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you employed Taylor for the purpose of doing this job? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I employed these two, in fact—I asked them to come and kill her and take her away I asked this man, because they were there together at my house—he has done part of that kind of work, perhaps—I do not know what he is accustomed to—he is a fishmonger and one thing or another—I did not employ him because he was in the habit of doing a job of that kind—I never heard that he was—I never knew him do it.</p>

               <p>take it and kill it—I asked both Spencer and Taylor to come and fetch her and dispose of her, and Spencer said he knew what to do with the meat—that was when she was slaughtered, not before—I told both Spencer and Taylor to come and fetch her away and dress her—the conversation as to what could be done with her was not before she was slaughtered—I mean to say that there was no conversation between me and the defendant, as to what was to be done with her, until after she was slaughtered; not a word about it, to my knowledge—the only direction I gave was a direction to slaughter her, without saying anything whatever as to what was to become of her until afterwards—I should say it was a mile from the field, where she was at the time I gave those directions, to the slaughter-house—she was not driven there to be killed; she was killed at my house, and then taken up in a cart—she was slaughtered by Taylor at my house—the carcass was sent to London, I suppose, but I don't know—it was taken from my house by Spencer and Taylor—she was killed at my house and taken up to the slaughter-house whole, as she was to be dressed—it is a slaughter-house that several butchers use—the reason she was not driven to the slaughter-house to be killed was because her rib was broken, and she could not very well get up when she was down—the cow was healthy enough, but from the effect of the accident she was not able to move—I could not say what I expected the animal to fetch when sent to London—I did not think anything about it—I did not know—it is a good many years ago since I was a butcher—thirty years ago—I am fifty-five years of age—I was brought up as a butcher from a little one—I made no stipulation as to what the meat was to be sold for; they were to do the best they could with It—I was at the justice-room, Guildhall, when the defendant was charged with this offence—was not examined there as a witness on his behalf—I was not called in—I became bail for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see this animal while it was alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not; all I saw of it was hanging up there in the slaughter-house—that was two or three hours after it had been slaughtered—it would still be a little warm—the butcher had dressed it—I could see what I have mentioned about the lights; it is prevalent among fat beasts as well—it had been finished when I saw it, and hung up—the dressing had been completed; the inside had been taken out then—the defendant was not there when I saw it, nor Mr. Peck—no one was there—I went there because the yard belonged to my brother, and I had been hiring it, within about 3 months ago—I go down there now and then—I was there promiscuously—I was not called upon to look at the meat—I went in accidentally—I merely took a cursory glance at it, no more.</p>

COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After you had been there, did Mr. Peck come to you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi> I did not see Mr. Peck or Taylor—I saw Taylor it might have been in the evening—I cannot tell when it was-now; it is so long ago—being a botcher, of course, I should look at the meat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the lights had grown to the side? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I saw that, because there was a little kind of froth at the side—the lights had been taken away, but it leaves an impression on the ribs—there were marks of the lights having grown to the side.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

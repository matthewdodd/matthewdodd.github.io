               <p>I am a constable of St. John's; they called me out of bed, and I went with them to take the prisoner.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080178"></xptr>Q. What did you find? - A sheet, two shirts and a pair of plated buckles; I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about the bed? he said it was in a passage in Duck-lane; I asked him to go and shew me where it was, and he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept all the things? - No, the watchman has kept them, they have been in the watchman's possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Greenhill. He says you took them to the watch-house? - I carried the sheets and the shirt to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been done with them? - They are all here.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what has been done with them since? - I took them home to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. And you produce them now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce the shirts now, and let the soldier stand up.

               <p>Q. to Firman. Look at the shirts, Firman; and see whether you can speak whether they are your shirts? - Yes, they are my shirts, there is my own name on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they your buckles? - Yes they are, I did not know whether I left them there, or whether I had them at the barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure they are your buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming home, and I stopped at the corner of the gateway to make water, and I saw these things lay altogether, and I took them up, to give to a person I saw then up the gateway, close by the side of the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses for that? - No. The watchman was off his bear, and I stopped to see him pass, and before I could see him, these men came up and took me, I told them if they would be quiet I would shew them where they were, I immediately told them so, and I took them to shew them where the bed was.</p>

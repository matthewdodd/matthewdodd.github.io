                  </hi>. I am manager of a lodging house kept by John Freak, at 11, Mill Lane, Deptford—on 5th November I went to bed between 12 and 1, leaving the house secure—about 5.30 a.m., when I came down, I found the lower sash of the kitchen window had been taken out from the back yard and placed on a chair, and I missed some bread and a pound and a half of beef from a shelf in the kitchen; it belonged to a lodger—the police afterwards showed them to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 199). About 1 a.m. on 5th November I stopped the prisoner close to the lodging-house; he had two loaves of bread and a piece of meat under his arm—he said he was going to take it home—he dropped them, struck me in the stomach, and ran away—he was taken by another constable—next morning I found a pair of boots in the passage at the lodging-house; I took them to the station, and the prisoner claimed them; he had no boots on when I stopped him—I showed the bread and meat to McLeod, and he identified it</p>

About 2.10 on Tuesday morning, 5th November, I was called to 11, Poplar Row, Deptford, the back gardens of which adjoin those in Mill Lane—I saw the prisoner in the back yard of No. 11, which is about five houses from Freak's lodging-house—he had no boots or cap on—as soon as he saw me he jumped over the fence—I pursued him over about five fences—I found him at another lodging-house on the top of some steps—I took him into custody—he said he lodged there—he tried to kick me off the top of the steps—I took him to the station—he was sober.</p>

The Prisoner pleaded that the Prosecutor pickt him up in Southwark Fair; that they went to the Three-Ton-Tavern in Southwark; that they were driving a Bargain, but could not agree; whereupon he told her she should pay her share of the Reckoning; she reply'd that she had no Money, he told her if she would stand a Search, and it was found that she had no Money, he would pay the Reckoning himself; to which she readily consented; and turning out her Pocket, there was nothing in it but an Ivory Bodkin, some Farthings and two Crusts of Bread, but no Snuff-Box; that as to her Fan she gave it him to New Mount for her, and that he deliver'd it to her again at the Three-Ton-Tavern in Russel-Street Covent-Garden, before two of his Friends; who confirm'd the same in Court; and that he sent for her to that Tavern by the Name of Mrs. Hasely.

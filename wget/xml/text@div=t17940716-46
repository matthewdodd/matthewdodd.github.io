On the 10th of this month, about ten minutes after five, I went into my master's field, and the men could not go to work for want of two barrows that were stole; in about five minutes after a man came down, and told me that the barrows, and the man that took them, were in the watch-house; one of the barrows belonged to Mr. Samuel Scott, and one to my employer, but they were both in my master's use; I see them in the watch-house, and I have seen them since; they are not brought here. I know my master's barrow very well, by one of the thimbles that the wheel goes in, being rivetted down; the middle of the barrow and wheel was pitched.</p>
               <p>Q. How many barrows has your master got? - About eight or nine in use.</p>

            Do you think that you can safely swear that it was your master's barrow? - I have sworn it three times now.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you see this that morning? - Within five minutes of seven o'clock. I never see the prisoner before that morning he was at the watch-house, that morning I saw him, but I did not speak to him, nor he to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see these barrows in the prisoner's possession? - I did not; I see them in the watch-house, at seven o'clock or a little after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Timmings's barrow? - I did; there is a new rivett put in by the side of it, and it is new pitched.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labouring man, sometimes I work in the brickfields; I was standing talking at an acquaintance's door, and this man was coming out of my master's field with two barrows, and I stopped him; the field comes into a street; he came into the street with it, it was between ten and eleven at night, and I sent for a light, and while I was looking at the marks of the barrows, he ran away, and I ran after him, and catched him; I asked him where he had brought them from? he said, he brought them from Islington; I said, that was an odd thing to come that way from Islington.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the road from Islington? - No. I carried him to the watch-house; I never see the man before in my life that I know of; the wheel barrows were taken to the watch-house, I see the same wheel barrows there the next morning and the prisoner, I am not a labour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160074"></xptr>er to Mr. Timmings; I don't know to whom the barrow belongs. The next morning I see Mark and Baker at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Mark or Baker claim Mr. Timmings's wheelbarrow? - Yes, they did in the hearing of the prisoner; there were two there the next morning, and those were the two that I took from the prisoner; he had got them one on the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked the other side of the water at brick making, and they were standing still for water, and I came over this side of the water to see some of my acquaintances, and I had been higher up the road, and had stopped there the evening a drinking; returning home at night I met a man that stopped me and asked me if I would drink, and he asked me whether I had a mind to earn a shilling? if I had there was a couple of barrows that he wanted to be wheeled round to the King's Head, in Kingstand-road, and she told me he should be round there as soon as I was, and if I was not, he would wait for me; and I stopped at my wife's father's, and dallied a little time drinking with him; after that I went into the field and saw two barrows, and took them out to wheel them into the road, and I was stopped. The man who asked me was a mere stranger to me, but he appeared as if he worked in the field. My relations are all gone down into Kent.</p>

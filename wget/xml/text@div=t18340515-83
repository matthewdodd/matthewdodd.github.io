            . I live in Maidstone-street, about one hundred and fifty yards from Bell's house - I have a side view of his house - on Thursday, I was at work in my shop with the window open, and saw three men loitering about the street, appearing suspicions characters - I am positive the prisoner was one of them - he had a brown paper parcel in his hand, tied with white tape - I observed them walking up and down the street - presently one of them popped round the corner, and presently afterwards I saw them all three go up to Mrs. Bell's door - they stood at the door for a few seconds - one of them peeped through the window, and the prisoner looked through the key-hole - I saw one of them take something out of his pocket, and they opened the door- two of them went in, but the prisoner did not - they shut the door after them - the prisoner walked fifteen or twenty yards, then stood by the pond to watch - I ran down stairs and ran out towards Bell's, and just before I got to the door I saw the two men come out of the house with a bag - I could not pursue them - the prisoner was walking from where he stood - I collared him - the two men ran away; one of them had an umbrella - I had not seen him with an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150054"></xptr>umbrella before he went into the house - I afterwards saw the bag which the man brought out of the house - when I collared the prisoner, I told him he belonged to them, and said he went up to the door with them - he said he did not- he had a paper parcel in his hand, and he began to read the direction; while I held him he tore off the direction from the parcel, and eat it; it was as large a piece of paper as my hand - he seemed very uncomfortable, and asked Mrs. Bell for some water, which she gave him, to wash it down- a policeman was got, and I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your hearing is not very good? A. Not very. I could see the man distinctly, and the parcel he had in his hand - I never saw the prisoner before - I never said he was not one of the men who went up to the door - I am positive he is one of them - I told the magistrate that he was one who went up to the door, and peeped through the key-hole, and the others through the window- neither of the other men were so near me as the prisoner- I walked up and took him, because he was nearest to me, and the others were young men, and running quick - I asked him what the parcel was, and what it contained - he said, "What is that to anybody?" - my shop is on the first floor - between my house and Mrs. Bell's there is a garden, with a great many high trees, but none of them were in the way - there is a piece of road between my house and Mrs. Bell's - the trees in the garden are newly planted, and some of them have not got a leaf - they do not interrupt my view of Bell's house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the trees prevent your seeing this? A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KEY. I am the son of John Key. I was working with my father in the room which commands a view of Bell's house - I saw the prisoner leaning over the palings - he had a paper parcel with him - there was a stout gentleman came from Baker's house, and went up the New Road- as soon as the stout gentleman got out of sight, the prisoner went down to Bell's house, and peeped through the key-hole and the window - nobody but him was at the house at that time - he went down to Mr. Bacon's public-house, and fetched two men out - it is fifteen yards from Bell's - they all three then went up to Mr. Bell's door - one of them put a key in the door, opened it, and two of them went in - they shut the door - (the prisoner remained outside, and walked about by the gas works) - I saw them up at the top window of the house - my father ran down stairs, and I ran out with him - he took the prisoner, who had a brown paper parcel with him - I saw him eating a piece of paper, but did not see him tear it off - my mother gave me a black bag, containing the property, and I took it into Bell's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon after the two men went into the house did you go out? A. We saw them up at the window of the house, and ran out in about three minutes - we stopped to see if it was any body belonging to the house first - I saw them moving about.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Dove-row, ten or twelve houses from Bell's, on the same side. Soon after nine o'clock I went out, and in New Boston-street saw three men in company - the prisoner was one of them - the street is opposite Bell's house - I went on my business, and returned in about half an hour - I observed the prisoner looking over the pales into the pond - the other two men turned into Bacon's public-house - I went out shortly after, and the prisoner was leaning over the pails - the other two were in the tap-room, looking over towards Bell's - I came back, and in a few minutes saw the prisoner look through the key-hole of the gas gates - I said, "You cannot get in there, they have been fastened up some months- you had better go round if you want any body" - he said, he wanted the gas man - I told him his conduct was very suspicious - I went home, and about twenty minutes afterwards I heard a cry of "Stop thief" - I went out, looked towards Bell's house, and saw Key take the prisoner - a crowd got round him, and Mrs. Bell came home - I went into the house with her - the street door and parlour door were wide open - I went up stairs with her - the bed was doubled up, and the things all in confusion - the drawers all open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you saw the prisoners four or five times that morning? A. I did; I suspected them - I was going about to my work people - I have lived in Doverow three years - I never saw the prisoner before that morning - I was in this court ten years ago, on a trial about a 5l. note which I took - I have never been here since to my knowledge - in the other court I had two cases while I was a private watchman - I was never tried in my life in any court.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not charged four or five years ago by one Leggatt, with a criminal offence? A. Never; I know John and Thomas Reeves - they were both tried some time ago- I was not a witness on that trial - it was a brother of mine - I was never in my life charged with robbing any lady or gentleman.</p>

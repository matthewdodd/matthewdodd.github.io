While on duty in King's Road, Chelsea, about 1.15 a.m. on Sunday, 13th July, I heard a woman cry, "Oh, John, you have stabbed me"—I crossed the road and saw the prisoner leaving Bridget Woods—I stopped him and she came up and said "I shall charge him for stabbing me"—I took them to the station—she was bleeding from the left side of the neck, and I sent for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I and the sergeant searched for a knife, but found none—the woman was very faint on the way to the station and the inspector gave her some water—she made no statement about a knife. Bridget Woods. I am the prisoner's wife, and reside at 4, Sutherland Road, Fulham—on Sunday morning, July 13, I was in King's Road—I was not with my husband—I went away that evening from him and went home to my father's—the prisoner has been a good husband, but has kept his money lately—I and another woman met him on my way home—he came up to me and said "This is your beat, isn't it?"—I said "Yes, you know I am obliged to run away from you"—he was very drunk—then he struck me in the left side of the neck behind the ear with a small black<lb></lb>handled knife—I saw a constable on the other side and I went to him and told him, and he took him in charge—I went to the police-station and my wound was dressed by the doctor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did once cut my husband's head open with a chair when he came home in drink to beat me—I did not on another occasion cut his head open with a stone—I only struck him once—I did not say before the Magistrates "I cut his head open with a chair and also with a stone"—I said "There was not a man in my company when this happened"—there was only a woman with me—we have had many quarrels, but never fought, but about three months ago I struck him with the chair because he came home drunk and pulled me off the bed—I did not say "We have often fought"—I do not know William Bradshaw—I do not know any men who work near where this happened—the prisoner has been a good husband to me till the last few weeks—I have been absent from my home and slept away from him for two nights, and have left him and gone to my parents—I do not remember if I said at the police-court that he said "Is this your beat?" but he said that—he said "What brought you here!"—it was past 1 o'clock in the morning—the children were in bed at home—Mrs. Nolan was with me and saw him strike the blow, but she has said she was not there—I was not in company with the man Bradshaw that night—I heard Mrs. Nolan say at the police-court that she met me with Bradshaw, but she said very wrong—she came to my house that night—I did not say so at the police-court, she said so—it was Saturday night—I will swear I was not locked in my room with Bradshaw—I heard Mrs. Nolan say at the police-court "I went to Mrs. Woods' room and was refused admittance; that was a quarter past 12 o'clock; Bradshaw was there," but it is untrue—I was with two or three women drinking in public-houses at Sands End, where I am living, on that Saturday night at 10.30—I had not got my potato knife with me—I heard Dr. Godrich give his evidence at the police-court, but was so upset I could not understand what he said—I have not been trying to get rid of my husband for the purpose of living with Bradshaw—I left my husband's home about 10.40 on the Saturday night, and was with him before I went away—that is at Sands End—I live about half an hour's</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>). Bridget Woods and a man named Bradshaw were together between Stamford Bridge and Cremorne on this Saturday night, and he said good night to me—she and the prisoner and the children live in the Grove Road—she was there on this night in her room with Bradshaw—I went there and Bradshaw came to the door and said "Is that you, Mrs. Nolan?"—I said "Yes"—he said "You can't come in to-night, then," and I said "Very well"—I have seen them together three times—I do not know that she was neglecting her home and going about the streets and drinking in public-houses—I have seen her in public-houses when she ought to be at home attending to her children—the prisoner was not near when Bradshaw said good-night to me.</p>

Bradshaw was at the prisoner's house that night upstairs, and when I knocked he came down and opened the street door and said "You can't come in to-night"—my two little boys were upstairs in the same room with them, and I said "I shall have my children out," and he opened the door and let them out—I saw Mrs. Woods and him together—they both came down, and she abused and blackguarded me, and I said "I will have my two children out."</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I examined Mrs. Woods on the 13th—there was an incised wound about 1/8 inch in depth and 1 inch long behind and below the ear—it was very near a dangerous part, and if deeper would have severed the jugular vein and the carotid artery, which would have been almost fatal—the wound was not bleeding and I do not think she had lost much blood—I dressed it and have no doubt it was well in a few days—I have not examined it since—a small knife would have caused it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the police-court that if the wound was self inflicted it was in the very spot—it had not the least character of a stab, but was long and very shallow, and was exactly the sort of an injury I should expect to find if a person had wanted to inflict a wound upon herself without risking life.</p>

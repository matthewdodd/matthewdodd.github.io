                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Thomas Morton.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 150.) I took the prisoner, and received these two pieces of coin from Mr. Morton—I took the prisoner to the station, and searched and found on him a good half-crown and two halfpence, and, rolled up in a piece of paper in his waistcoat-pocket, a bad shilling—on my finding that he said, "Dear, dear, you have found another piece"—I had not remarked anything on finding that shilling in paper—I took several pieces of paper from his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. These shillings are both counterfeit; wrapping such coin as this in soft paper, prevents the silver being rubbed off it—these are made of Britannia metal, and silvered over—rubbing against other coin would rub the silver off, and it would look black.</p>

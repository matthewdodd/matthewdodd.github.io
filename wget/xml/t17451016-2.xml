I went about two hours after with my man , belonging to the yard, to her lodging, and charged her with taking it, and brought her back to my house; and she said she had pawned it to Mr. Edwards, at the Three Blue Balls in Barbican. When I went to enquire after it Mr. Edwards said he had bought the cup of the Prisoner, and refused to let me see it. But in four or five days afterwards he brought it back to me - he did not demand any thing for it then .</p>
               <p>Jackson. I was at Mrs. Beaumont's that night, and she said she had lost a silver mug, and believed the person that stole it was in the house. The Prisoner was there, and very much in liquor. She said if Mrs. Beaumont would let her go to bed she would tell her more in the morning. I persuaded her to tell the truth, and it might be the better on her side; and she confessed she took it out of Mrs. Beaumont's house; and had pawned it at the Three Blue Balls in Barbican, but did not know to whom; and before the Justice she said she had sold it there for three guineas and four shillings.</p>

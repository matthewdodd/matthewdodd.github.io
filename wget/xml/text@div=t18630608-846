                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Wilkie and Soames—the prisoner has been our traveller about twelve months—his duty was to get orders and collect money—he was to pay in money once a week, at least—he went on very regularly for some months, and in April he was away from the business—I think the last time I saw him was about a month before 27th May—he sent us several letters during that time, and sent addresses—the last letter is dated 8th May, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he says at the end, after giving a list of parties to whom we were to send, "Having been engaged on private business, is the reason I have not been to Greenwich"—I did not see him from that time till the 27th, when he came and delivered this lift (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I don't think we received any communication from him—we wrote to him two or three times and received no answer—as soon as he came in on the 27th, he gave me this list, but said nothing—I asked him if he had collected those moneys, and he said "Yes,"—I then asked him if he had got the money, and he said "No,"—I asked him what he had done with it, and he said he had lost it at horse-racing; upon that I gave him into custody</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not ft letter dated 22nd April, about Mr. Roby's account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, dated from Norfolk-street, Mile-end, where the prisoner lived—he says in that letter, that he has paid it—we should have received that on the 23rd—I believe the prisoner travels for Mr. Holdsworth, as well as for us—when he gets an order for soap, he sends it to us—he gets orders for other things, which he sends to other tradesmen—we did not engage him by salary for the whole year—we paid him accord<lb></lb>ing to the quantity of work he did—if he got no orders, he got no commis<lb></lb>sion—we had no power to order him to go to Mr. A. or Mr. B. and get an order—his time was his own—his getting orders or not, was optional with him—these two letters of 15th and 20th May, are in my clerk's writing—they are not written by my direction—I have not seen them they are written by the direction of my brother, who attends to the books, to ask the reason why he had not been to the factory, and in one we tell him that we had had a letter from a customer, asking why we had not sent some soap ordered a fortnight before—his customers were kept separate from the other customers—it was his own connection amongst whom he got orders, if he thought proper, and sent them to us—he was bound to get the money from the per<lb></lb>son to whom we supplied the goods, for us—we never sent another person to collect his accounts—he always collected them himself—that was the agree<lb></lb>ment when he was engaged—I think I was there with my brother when that agreement was made—he was to have a commission upon the soap sold and paid for—that was the arrangement—I don't think he had a large con<lb></lb>nection at that time—very little, I believe—we gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton com<lb></lb>mission, no salary at all—a man can make a very good living upon that commission if he works—he always brought a list down with him, ready made out generally, I believe—any books he had were his own, we did not supply him with any—we kept an account of the goods that went out, and the moneys owing to us; and accounts were rendered to the prisoner weekly, upon small slips, of the money owing to us from customers—he was not re<lb></lb>sponsible for the orders—he did not tell me, that if we waited, we should have the money—he did not give me to understand that there was any pro<lb></lb>bability of his making up the money—he said nothing to me about it, or in my presence.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner in the habit of coming daily to your place. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, once a week, that was the understanding—he communicated with us by letter, and sent the orders which he had obtained, and came once a week, generally on the Monday, to pay in the money he had collected the week before; and then on the Monday, he would receive the slips, with an account of the money he had to collect in the coming week.</p>

As to the first point he referred to the case of Reg. v. May, 8th Cox Crim. Cases, page</hi> 421. <hi rend="italic">As to the second point, he submitted that, although the prisoner did not pay over the money, there was no concealment, and he only held the cash for the prosecutor; and that the mere non-payment of it at once was not sufficient to constitute embezzlement.</hi>

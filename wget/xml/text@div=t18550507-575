                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Goody, of No. 5, Ann-street, Plumstead, a turner. On Monday, 23rd April, about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I went to the shop of Mr. Munday, a butcher, in Woolwich—my little boy, between five and six years old, was with me—I bought some meat outside the shop, and then went in to have it weighed—there was no<lb></lb>body in the shop then but Mr. Munday, but the prisoner followed in after me—I took out my purse, which contained half a sovereign, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, half a crown, one shilling, sixpence, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and a watch key, and laid it on the bench—the prisoner was then close to my left elbow, close to my purse—I had given Mr. Munday the money, and had the purse by the side of my basket—I did not keep my eye on the purse while I was giving Mr. Munday the money—he gave me a penny change, which I put into my pocket, took up my basket, and went out—when I got outside the door I missed my purse; I returned, and said, in the prisoner's presence, "Mr. Munday, you saw that I gave you the money out of my purse?—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have at this moment missed it"—he said, "Look about, and see if you have dropped it"—I turned to the prisoner and said, "Please, Ma'am, have you seen anything of it?"—she said, "No, Ma'am"—I said, "I have lost my purse"—she said, "I will swear Mr. Munday has never been from the scale"—I said, "Have you seen any one pass in or out of the shop?"—she said, "No; and I will swear Mr. Munday has never been from the drawer?"—she then went out. and I followed her, and found her on the kerb, by the side of Mr. Munday's window—she had a basket, which I believe had a lid to it—I said, "I mean no offence; did You see my purse?"—she said, "No, my good woman; I pity you"—I said, "It must rest between you and the butcher"—she said, did I accuse her of it—I said, "No; I do not say you took it, but I must see further into it"—she said, "If you come near me I will <hi rend="italic">smack</hi> your <hi rend="italic">chops</hi>; I will <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> you"—she eventually turned out her pocket, on my asking her, and there was nothing in it—nothing passed about her basket—a policeman came up, and I gave her into custody—as we went to the station my little boy gave me my purse—I did not examine it; I gave it to the policeman immediately—I afterwards saw it, and it contained the money I have stated—I can undertake to say that I did not take up the purse from the bench.</p>

               <p>7 o'clock, I was opposite Mr. Munday's shop, and saw the prisoner taken into custody; she had a basket with a lid to it in her hand, in front of her—as she went along, I saw her open the lid of the basket, and then put her hand down underneath her shawl, and then I saw a purse drop from her—the little boy picked it up, and gave it to his mother, who was a rod off—it could not possibly have dropped from the prosecutrix—I was in the road, about two yards from the prisoner, and have no doubt that it dropped from her.</p>

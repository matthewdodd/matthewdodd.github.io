On the 28th of April, I was standing in his shop a little before eight o'clock in the evening - I saw the door open, which was ajar; the prisoner put his hand in, and took one boot out of the window - I pursued him, and saw the boot fall, but I cannot say from whom; I was agitated -I took the prisoner, and accused him of stealing it; he said it was not him - I called the beadle, and then took the boot up; the prisoner had got ten or twenty yards from the shop - he walked; no one but him could have dropped the boot.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PRESTON. I was standing opposite Mr. Cox's shop on the 28th of April - the gas-light was within a few doors; I saw a little scuffle between the prisoner and the witness - the prisoner threw the boot from him, and the officer took him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DEVEY. I am a constable. I was nearly opposite the shop - I took the prisoner, and have the boot; there was no other running.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down Crutchedfriars - two young men stood by the door, and began to hustle me; one of them threw the boot down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Jubilee-place, Mile-end. About half-past nine o'clock, last Saturday night, I was going along Whitechapel, High-street, towards Aldgate, Mr. Isaacs tapped me on the shoulder and spoke to me—I searched my pocket and missed my hard<lb></lb>kerchief, which was safe about five minutes before—I went down Petticoat-lane, and saw the prisoner showing the handkerchief he had taken from my pocket to two other men—I went to him and said, "That is my handkerchief"—he said, "No, it is one I bought for a shilling"—he tried to strike me—I caught him by the collar and gave him to the officer, and my handkerchief—this is it—I know it by two small holes in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was going along Aldgate that evening—I saw the prisoner with his hand in the prosecutor's pocket—I saw him take some<lb></lb>thing out, but I did not see what—he walked slowly down Petticoat-lane—I ran and spoke to the prosecutor, and he went with me down the lane—he was going after a little boy—I called him back, and said, "This is the man that took it"—the prisoner was showing the handkerchief to two other men.</p>

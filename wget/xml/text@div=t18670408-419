                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 325 <hi rend="italic">B</hi>). On 22nd February I was on duty in Upper Eccleston Street, and at a little after two o'clock I was near the window of Mr. Glynn's house, which is next door to the Marquis of Down<lb></lb>shire's house, in Belgrave Square—the two gardens are divided by a wall—I saw the prisoner jump over the wall of Mr. Glynn's house into the street—he went off, and I caught him, without losing sight of him, fifty or sixty yards from where he jumped over—I asked him what he had done over the wall—he said, "What! me?"—I said, "Yes, you"—he said, "I was not</p>

               <p>over the wall or on the wall"—I said,"You were"—he said, "Take me back and show me the place"—I did so, but he said nothing—I saw this knife, open, sticking out of his coat pocket, with the blade upwards—I got hold of the blade and took it from him—he put his foot behind me and I staggered, but did not fall—he ran away, and I saw him throw away something—he ran, I should think, 250 yards before I stopped him—he is the same man—I did not lose sight of him, and there was nobody else about—he was stopped by another constable—I afterwards went to the spot where he had got over, and found this glazier's knife and this candle in the enclosure—I searched him at the station and found this comb, matches, and piece of rope—I went to Mr. Glynn's and roused the butler—the garden had been recently dug, and there were footmarks in the mould up to the window, at which an attempt had been made—the footmarks led to the Marquis of Downshire's, in whose grounds there were footmarks of more than one per<lb></lb>son, to a spot at the wall where the ivy was pulled down—there were only footmarks of one person in Mr. Glynn's garden—I took off the prisoner's boots, measured them with a bit of stick, and the impressions just corresponded with them, both in the Marquis of Downshire's garden and Mr. Glynn's—the catch of the Marquis of Downshire's ball-room window was forced back, and there was gravel on the window-sill, where they would have to get up to put a knife between the two sashes, and there was a dirty finger-mark over the catch, which was notched or cut as if by a knife—I put the glazier's knife to the catch, and it corresponded—it would open the catch—the area gate it the Marquis of Downshire's was broken—the prisoner said he was a carpencer, and worked for a man named Green—he refused his address—this piece of rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found in the Marquis's garden, by the side of the railway—it is the same in point of age and twist as that found in the prisoner's pocket—the area has no steps, but somebody had been down there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-steward and butler to the Marquis of Downshire, and live in the house—the windows were all apparently secure at eight o'clock, and at ten o'clock the area-gate was properly secured—I afterwards saw some footmarks in the garden corresponding with a shoe which the constable brought—the ball-room is not separate from the rest of the house.</p>

               <p>Robert. I am dealer. I live at New cross, Deptford. I was in market on the 3rd of February, I sold a horse to a gentleman; and I went with him to the Rose-Inn to take the money for him. In coming out I saw the horse in question it asked if it was to be sold, the prisoner, who was on him, replied he was. I asked him if his master was there, he replied he was not; in it he had the retting of him. Then I asked what lie who tell for him, he asked eighteen guineas and I gave him seventeen pounds five shillings, he was an aged horse; I bid him a sixteen guineas, but bint down to seventeen pounds five shillings. We then went into the Rose-inn he gave me his master's name and place of abode. He gave me a memorandum, not a receipt, we never do take receipts in that way. The uniform was Mr. Viven Sloane-street, Chelsea, I did not asked him for receipts. I then took the horse home. I do a great steal of business, and I don't always take and give receipts, for this kind of business. I sold the horse for twenty-six pounds sixteen shillings the day following, I am not sure the prisoner at the bar is the man who sold him me, if he is, he is very much street since I bought the horse of him.</p>

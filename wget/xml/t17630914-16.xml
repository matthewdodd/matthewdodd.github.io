The chairs were handed out of the house by some people at the time of the fire, I cannot say by who, they were found again at the house of Mr. Woolger, in St. George's parish. Mr. Berry sent for the prisoner from New-prison, to hear what he had to say; he said, a woman gave them to him. I know them to be my daughter's property, I have two of the same, they exactly correspond, and the bottoms are numbered, and agree with the others.</p>

            . I was burnt out at the fire; I went to my brother's house, while I was there, the prisoner brought a book-case and desired leave to set it in there; it was my book-case. My brother lives in the Highway, he is a brazier and broker. I three times asked the prisoner, if that book-case was his own? he answered it was, and he also owned the four chairs mentioned in this indictment, which he brought there, he said he had been working hard for them, and was afraid he should loose his all; I did not know but he would bring more, so I gave him liberty to bring his goods, that I might detect him. At last when he came to take them away, I got an officer and took him up; I then did not know whose chairs they were; as soon as he was charged, he went on his knees and begged for mercy; this was at my brother's house, about half a mile from where the fire was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Royal Standard—eight weeks ago, between 6 and 7 p.m., I served the prisoner and another man with some beer; the prisoner gave me a florin—my mistress drew my attention to it, and I found it was bad—there was no other florin in the till—the florin Mrs. Bailey found was the one the prisoner gave me—on 10th April I picked out the prisoner from ten men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bailey, who keeps the Royal Standard, Camden Town—in the beginning of March, about 6 p.m., the prisoner and another man came in, and I saw my barmaid serve them, and not more than a minute afterwards I looked into the till, and took out a florin and found it was bad—there was no other florin there—the prisoner had then gone; the other man had not, but he went immediately after<lb></lb>wards—I had examined the till a few minutes before—I put the florin in the fire, and it melted—on 28th April, in the evening, the prisoner came again for a glass of ale, and gave me a florin—I weighed it in my hand, and could tell that it was bad—I told him I could bite it if he chose—he said "Don't do that, I can take it back to where I had it from"—he paid me with a good florin—I recognised him as the man who had given the bad one before, and called Tuffey, who came down into the bar, and called the prisoner out to her in the passage—I told him he was the young man who gave us one before, and it was a shame for him to come again—he said he was not the man, he was a commercial traveller, and was at Grove's End at the time, and could bring his lawyer to prove it—I gave the florin to the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>).

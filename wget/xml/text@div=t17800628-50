               <p>I live at Walham-Green; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) on the 19th of June. As I was sitting on the steps of a door in a street near Soho; the prisoner came to me; I had a bundle containing these things, with me. The prisoner asked me where I was going? I told her I was going to Bexley to my grandmother. She said she knew my grandmother very well. She took me half over Westminster-bridge; she then said she would go back and dress herself and go with me. She took me into a court in St. Giles's where she said she lived; she was to get some dinner and dress herself; after we had dined she told me she would go with me to Bexley, but she would first take my things to a publick-house and leave them while I went with her to buy some tea and sugar; she accordingly took them.</p>
               <p>You went together to the publick-house? - Yes; but I did not go in with her; she went and drank some gin and left me on the outside; she took me away from this publick-house, saying, she would go and buy some tea and sugar; she took me to another publick-house and left me there; then she went to the first publick-house and took the things away, as will be proved by the person of the house. I saw her no more till the next day.</p>

               <p>Did you know her before? - No, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Are you sure she is the same person? - Yes, I am very sure.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. The prosecutrix came to my house with the prisoner, and gave me charge of her. I took her to Justice Hyde's, in St. Martin's-street, and she was examined there. When she was at Justice Hyde's I searched her and found the pawnbroker's duplicates upon her, one of the duplicates was for this gown; she pledged it in the name of Jones.</p>
               <p>Is the name of the pawnbroker upon the ticket? - They never put their names on them. I found nothing else upon her; I found the things at St. Giles's (producing a bundle of things which were deposed to by the prosecutrix.) She said nothing to me only what she said at Justice Hyde's.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The girl gave me the things to carry to pawn for her.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutrix. What day was it the prisoner took the things from you? - Last Monday week. I went to Mr. Townsend to find out the prisoner if I could, and we met her accidentally, in Soho; she had part of the property upon her at the time.</p>
               <p>Why is not Mr. Townsend here? - He is at home at work; he was not on the back of the indictment, and he did not imagine it was necessary for him to be here.</p>

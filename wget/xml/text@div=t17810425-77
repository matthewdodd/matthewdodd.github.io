A woman came to me upon the 16th of March, and sold me forty hat loopings, what we call breed; I gave her 10 d. a piece: she said, her name was Ford; after I had paid her for the breed, I observed she had some bands in a paper; I asked if they were to sell? she said, they were not hers, they belonged to a lodger; but I might have them at 17 d. a piece; I said, we sold them in our shop for 1 s. I could not give but 10 d. I said, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250091"></xptr> he did not like the price, he might have them again; I asked, where she lived; she said in the middle of Wheeler-street. When she was gone, I went over to Mr. Hartley, to ask what they were worth; he said, 26 s. a dozen; I said, I bought them for 10 d. he said, they must be stole. I went and enquired after her; I could not find her; she came again on the 29th; I sent then for Mr. Hartley; he asked her about these bands; she said one of her lodgers sent her with them to sell. My father advised me to send for a constable; she said, one Blonde, who lived in our neighbourhood, and was a servant to Mr. Harris, knew her; we sent for him; he seemed surprised, and began to abuse us; we said, she had brought things we suspected were stole; he said, she was a very honest woman, he would be bound for her; we told him we were going before a magistrate; he said he would go, and see her righted; he went home to dinner, and came back again; we went to the Mansion House; there was no Alderman there; we went to Guildhall; she said, she lived in Wheeler-street; and he said, he lived in Wheeler-street; they were examined separate; she said, he had been at her house four times; he said, he had not been there at all; he said, he lived at one Green's, a porter, in St. John's street; he was sent to the Compter; we went to St. John's street; we could find no such man as Green; we found, the next morning, that he lodged in Goswell-street, at one Mr. Cosby's, a snuff-shop. I went with a search warrant; I went up into the garret, where he lodged; there were two beds in the room; under the bed we found boxes, with hat linings and trimmings; and there were some hat bands; there was so large a quantity we were obliged to have a cart to take them away.</p>
               <p>Was he present at the lodgings? - No, he would not go with us.</p>

               <p>Have you lost any property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know to what amount? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250092"></xptr>Do you know these hats? - I do; there is my mark on every one I have looked at yet, (looks at the hats brought from the pawnbroker). These are lined; my mark is branded on the inside; I can only speak to the mark on those which have the linings cut out.</p>
               <p>How many have the linings out? - Only three; they appear to be the same hats the three are, one out of each of the parcels pawned at different times.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the hats found in the lodgings, and of those at Mr. Fleming's? - Those about 7 l. 10 s. what I sell for 5 s. a hat; there were 88 in his lodgings; I can't speak to the value of them, because they are of different prices. Here are two pieces of belerdine loopings: here is my roll, with my mark; I have had these two pieces of belerdine ever since I have been in trade; they were left by my father; it was bought, I suppose, twenty years ago; I have not been able to sell it, except a little piece at a time.</p>
               <p>Can you say at what time the hats were in your shop? - No; I cannot.</p>
               <p>There is a large quantity of hats? - Yes; and a large quantity of goats-wool; I know some of that to be my property.</p>
               <p>What is your stock of hats? - Perhaps 1000 dozen in my shop and boxes some time last year, now perhaps I have not 50 dozen. I do not know I ever sold a Manchester hat without a lining; and some of those without linings are Manchester hats. The other articles in the cart I believe are my property, except a box and trunk which they are in: there is about 150 pounds of goats-wool.</p>
               <p>How do you know that to be yours? - There is a particular sort amongst it, which I import myself; I believe no other person imports it; I have it cleaned at Leghorn. There is a box, which the red Vidonia wool is in. The bow-strings I can only swear to, because they are English-made strings, and I bought all the person had at the time.</p>

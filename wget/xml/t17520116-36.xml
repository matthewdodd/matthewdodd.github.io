               <p>Elmley. The ass is in the Court-yard, and the man that bought her is here.

               <p>Q. How old are the prisoners?</p>

            . The two boys brought the ass to me at Hyde-Park Corner, and I bought it of them about nine in the morning, about five or six weeks ago; they said they had had her about two years, and used to carry sand upon her; But that is none of the ass this man has sworn to; he has swore to a great white ass with a long swish tail.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the ass you bought of the boys ?</p>
               <p>Turner. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Elmley. Is that your ass which he said he bought of the two boys at the bar ?</p>
               <p>Elmley. That is my ass, she has a slit on her ear, and a brand mark on her hipp.</p>

               <p>The man knew the ass was stole, and we would have had him took the money again, but he would not; there was a man in the house where he bought it, that said, it was stolen, and knew whose ass it was ; but Turner said, he'd buy it, if it came from the Devil.</p>

            , JUN. My father is a furnishing ironmonger, and lives in Cheapside. The prisoner was in his service. On Wednesday, the 26th of May, I directed him to go to Mr. Martin's, of St. Albans, and set a steam-kitchen to rights; I supplied him with the materials, and gave him 1l. on account; he came to me on the Saturday - I said, "Have you been down to Mr. Martin's, and set every thing right?" he said Yes, and produced an account, in his own hand-writing, charging 12s. more, for time, coach-hire, &amp;c.; I paid him that balance, as he said he had done the work.</p>

            . I am cook to Mr. George Robert Martin, of St. Albans. The work charged in this bill was not done in April at all; as nobody came from Mr. Slark we were obliged to get another person to do it. The prisoner came on the 11th of May, and asked if the work was done - I told him Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. SLARK. After I paid the prisoner this money I desired him to go to Leamington, in Hampshire, and he should have been there on the 11th of May; I gave him 5l. on account of that job.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I set out for the place, but missed the coach; I drank more than I should, and while waiting for the coach I fell asleep, and my tools and materials were stolen. I did not return to Mr. Slark, fearing he would be angry. I made out the account, expecting to recover my tools and do the job.</p>

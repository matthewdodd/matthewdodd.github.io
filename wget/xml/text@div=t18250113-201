            , in the front parlour, I had secured the house before I went to bed in the usual manner; I went into the room first, but she followed me in two or three minutes, it was then about ten minutes after eleven o'clock - we both went to sleep and were alarmed by the barking of our little dog. On the night before I had left a table-spoon in the kitchen which had been used for gruel, and a shawl; the spoon was silver and was my master's, the shawl was mine. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130074"></xptr>the dog harked I spoke to him, and quieted him for three or four minutes; he came again, and harked very violently, he went as far as the street door; it laid on the mat at the bottom of the stairs, and between the stairs and our bed-room there is a partition of glass, through which I perceived suddenly a light, I think it was about one o'clock - all the persons in the house were in bed; I heard some one catch the dog up very violently and he made an uncommon noise between the first alarm and the second. I opened my door and went to the top of the kitchen stairs. I saw a light and heard a person any</p>
               <p>"hush," it sounded in the kitchen - I went a little backward and called out</p>
               <p>"Who is there?" I then screamed out Murder! several times. I then went into the room, shut the door, and held it firm because there was no lock; my fellow-servant opened the window by my direction and called Watch! I staid at the door: Before the watchman came there were two men who appeared to come down the street from the Strand - I was not at the window, but Rebbecca Thomas was, I heard them say</p>
               <p>"I will send the watchman," but they did not. I afterwards looked out and saw a man standing in the area, with his back towards our window, I suppose he had got up from the kitchen window and then on the coal-house door, and then upon the stonework on which the railing rests; he was on the stone-work when I saw him. A gentleman got in at the window to us, and went and opened the street-door for us, they got a light from the gas, and the watchman went down into the kitchen before me, I went down afterwards, and was very anxious about a little boy who slept in the cupboard in the kitchen, but he was safe and asleep. A gentleman took up the carving-knife which was all over blood, and the little dog was lying weltering in his blood, with his head cut off all but a bit of skin. Newman the watchman came into the kitchen with the spoon and my shawl, he brought them both in together; they had been in the kitchen the night before when I went to bed, the carving-knife I am positive I had put into the knife-box, it was then lying on the dresser, I alarmed the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did this happen? A. I think it was about one o'clock, because I looked at the watch after the watchman had come in, and it was then about two. I had fastened the house myself, the persons had come in at the kitchen window, the shutters had been forced, and the window raised. I had fastened the shutters myself and the window was down the night before - there was only one person within the rails. I gave an account of this transaction in this Court before - I did not then know any thing about these prisoners being concerned in the robbery. I believe I heard something about them from Mrs. Abrahams on the Tuesday following the robbery, which was a week before I gave evidence here - Mrs. Abrahams mentioned the name of Lintott, I think, but I do not recollect the name of Durham; she said it was two former servants of Mr. Frasers who had been concerned with her husband in the robbery, she mentioned two names I know, but I do not recollect the name of Durham: I think Durham was the name of the other but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. She said she believed they had been servants of Mr. Fraser's, but had known them but a short time? A. Yes; I am confident I heard some person below say</p>
               <p>"hush," the voice proceeded from the kitchen and not from the area - Mrs. Abrahams said her husband had told her that they had been servants of Mr. Fraser's; and her husband had been led into it by them.</p>
               <p>REBECCA THOMAS. I am fellow-servant with the last witness. On the 28th of November I lived with her at Mr. Fraser's; I went to bed with her about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, the house was then safe and quiet, we were awoke by the dog harking; there is a glass partition in our room, and we saw a light through it, my fellow servant left the room and returned, I got up and opened the window, and saw two young men come by when I was screaming; I think it was the tallest of the two prisoners who spoke to me, that is Durham; I have no recollection of the other person, he did not speak, but I know he was shorter than the one who spoke; the tallest of them held the top of the rails and looked down into the kitchen but gave no assistance - I believe Durham to be the man but I cannot exactly be sure, because my fright was so great; the shortest one only stood by the side of the other but did not offer to give any assistance; the tall one was dressed in black I am pretty sure; I saw Durham before the Magistrates about a week afterwards, or between a week and a fortnight; he was then dressed in black, I had not then any doubt that he was the same person: while he was at the rails he asked what was the matter, I said there was some one in the kitchen, he said he would call the watchman: I begged and prayed of him not to go away and leave us, but they both went away without calling the watchman. I continued to give an alarm, and the watchman came up, Abrahams got up the area to the stonework within the rails, he was taken before he got over - one gentleman came in at the window, and got us a light and we went down stairs, the kitchen was open, it had been shut over night and fastened up, I saw the dog laying dead in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. With respect to the shorter man, (Lintott,) you have no recollection? A. No; the other was in my sight a little longer than you have been speaking to me. There is a gas light on the other side of the way, nearly opposite. The person I spoke to had a hat on, he was standing side-ways, with his face more towards me than the gas, but I was very near to him - the area is narrow, and I was leaning out at the window - they came in a direction from the Strand; if they had been inclined to have gone into the Strand, they need not have come so far as our window. He did not say any thing more to me than what I have mentioned. I said</p>
               <p>"Pray don't go away," several times. I will not swear that Durham is the man - but I have no doubt he is. I am not quite sure that if I had seen him any where else than in custody I should have believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Unless you had seen him there, you would not have thought any thing about him at all? A. No; I had a good view of his face from the gas light - I was so near, I was nearly touching him. I did not see them till he spoke to me - whether they had been from the house, or not I do not know; they came momentarily to me. The area is not more than three feet wide - there is a gas light on our side also, and they both give a good Our house is nearer the Strand than Howard-street.</p>

            . I am a coal-porter, and live in Milford-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130075"></xptr>in the Strand. I was returning home about twelve o'clock at night on the 28th of November; and coming through the court into Arundel-street, which court runs into Howard-street, I saw a man pass me in a dark coat, well dressed; but I cannot swear to the colour of his clothes. He ran round the corner from Norfolk-street - I heard the screams of a woman crying Murder! - they came from Norfolk-street. I saw the prisoner Durham before the Magistrate, and believe him to be the man whom I met - he was then dressed in black - I believe him to be the man; he met me as I was going to Norfolk-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you meet any other persons in that passage? A. No; only one - he was coming round the corner of Norfolk-street. I know where Mr. Fraser's house is - the passage he was in was nearer the river than Mr. Fraser's house; he went up Arundel-street toward the Strand - he was only in my view while we passed; he had run round the corner, but he did not run as he passed me, but then ran on. We were both near a gas light, my face was towards the gas - I can swear to the man any where. I had been at my relation's, and I had stopped there rather late, and could not get in at my lodgings. I had passed all that time without drinking any spirits. My relation lodges at the top of Ship-yard, Temple-bar, his name is Aldridge, he is a painter. I came home at eleven o'clock to the public-house where I lodge, in Milford-lane. I went back to my relation's, and could not get in - I had walked about till between twelve and one o'clock. I did not swear positively to him before the Justice. I was examined there and said his appearance led me to believe he was the man - but I did not say positively that he was. I went to the Office the next morning, but did not see him there then - I saw Abrahams there with the watchman, but did not see Durham for some time after; I saw Mrs. Abrahams that morning, at the Office, and three or four other times - I never saw her any where else, and never had any conversation with her about swearing positively to a person, in order to serve her husband, or with any body else.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You went the next day and saw Mrs. Abrahams - you went again, and again, and saw her there? A. Yes, but I saw her no where else.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Clement Danes - Mr. Fraser's house is in that parish. On the night of the 28th of November my attention was called there; I heard a scream from a female - I went there, and saw Rebecca Thomas at the window. I apprehended a person named Abrahams in the area. I afterwards searched the house, and found the dog slaughtered. I found a dark lantern on the kitchen dresser, and the shawl and silver table spoon in the area. I found the stock of a centre bit in the area - the shawl was claimed by the servant, and the spoon by the prosecutor. I had not heard any one call Watch! but I heard the screams of this young woman. I was at the lower part of Norfolk-street, about seven or eight doors from the house.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Clement Danes. I was attracted by Newman's rattle; I went to No. 37, Norfolk-street, and found in the area three centre bits, a small iron crow, and an iron stock. I found the door of the dark lantern in the kitchen, separated from the lantern. I applied the iron crow to the marks on the kitchen window shutters, and they appeared to be made by that crow. I am certain they were made by some crow.</p>

I saw the two prisoners together there, in company with Abrahams; they were all in company, and drank together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I wish you particularly to recollect the time of night? A. We went there after eleven o'clock at night, and had to meet at twelve, at the top of Drury-lane, to separate: it was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before twelve when I saw these persons - they were there when I went in, and Abrahams showed me a paper of Life in London: he asked me to drink out of his pint of porter. I am not positive that Lintott was there when we went away, but I am sure the others were; it would take about a quarter of an hour to get from there to Norfolk-street.</p>

             - he is a biscuit-baker. On the 28th of November I lodged at Mr. Chappel's, No. 25, Great Earl-street; Abrahams and his wife lodged in the same house at that time. On the 28th of November I dined with them: a person of the name of Shaw dined there too, so did Durham; we dined about a quarter after one o'clock; Durham went away about two: he came back between four and five, and staid to tea, and afterwards Abrahams and Durham went up into Abraham's room; we had dined in Abrahams's room, and drank tea in mine. Mrs. Abrahams asked her husband for a shilling, when they came down, and he gave her 6 d. Durham then asked what she wanted; she said a shilling, and he immediately gave her one: they then went out together - Mrs. Abrahams said,</p>
               <p>"Abrahams, return the shilling to Henry:" they left the house, about half-past 5 o'clock. Abrahams did not return that night. On the following morning Mrs. Abrahams came to me and seemed very much agitated. I was in company with her, and we were going out to see if we could find Mr. Abrahams - as we went out we met Durham at the door - Mrs. Abrahams said,</p>
               <p>"Where is Abrahams;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Hush, go up to your own room;" she said,</p>
               <p>"No, not till I have seen Abrahams:" he took her by the arm, and they went across the road together. Earl-street leads into King-street where the Fox and Goose is - we went down Queen-street, which is the adjoining street; Mrs. Abrahams asked again,</p>
               <p>"Where is Abrahams?" Durham said,</p>
               <p>"He is in St. Clement's watch-house;" she said,</p>
               <p>"What for?" he said,</p>
               <p>"The fact is we broke into a house in Norfolk-street, Strand, and a dog's head was cut of, but Abrahams did not do it - I held the dog, and Linton cut his head off;" we afterwards got to the Fox and Goose, and Mrs. Abrahams fainted away - Mr. Newman's servant fetched a glass of water, and Durham gave her a small glass of brandy - when she got better Durham told her to go to Bow-street, and she would, most likely, meet her husband coming from the watch-house. I went to Bow-street, and Abrahams was there. Mr. Shaw was in the house when we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130076"></xptr>went out to look for Abrahams - he was not at the door when we went out; he was going down the kitchen stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the wife of Mr. Vandevelde? A. Yes; we were married on the 17th of August, 1823, at Mary-le-bone New Church. I never had any other husband; I know a person named John Williams - that is my husband; he is in confinement, under that name, in the House of Correction - he has been there since last April; he was tried here. I cannot be answerable for his conduct - I believe he had been in prison before he was married. I was never in prison; I have been obliged to do as well as I could since he has been there - I have got my living as other unfortunate persons do: I did not get my living so before I was married. I had known Mrs. Abrahams about a month before her husband was taken. Half-past five o'clock on the Sunday afternoon was the last time I saw these persons. I do not know how Abrahams got his living. I did not mention anything to any person about this business till Mr. Moore came to me - he keeps Serle's Coffee-house, in Carey-street; that was after Abrahams had been tried. I had not consulted Mr. Moore on the subject till he came to me, and asked if I knew Mrs. Abrahams - I said I did. I was told at that time, and have been told since, that giving evidence against these young men might be of service to Abrahams; Mrs. Abrahams did not say that I was to say anything more than was true; she did not tell me to be positive in saying that this young man was present at the transaction, as that would do her good, but she desired me to tell Mr. Moore what I knew, as it might be the means of saving Abrahams's life - this was after I had seen Mr. Moore; I then stated to her what I had heard. When Durham crossed the way he said,</p>
               <p>"Hush, go in doors" - she said,</p>
               <p>"No, not till I have seen Abrahams;" she then said,</p>
               <p>"Where is Abrahams?" and he said,</p>
               <p>"In St. Clement's watch-house" - he said,</p>
               <p>"The fact is, we broke into a house in Norfolk-street, and there was a dog's head cut off." I saw Mr. Moore on the Wednesday following the day on which Abrahams was tried - I said nothing about this till after he was tried. Durham staid with us two or three minutes that day; I did not see him again before Abrahams was tried. I never told this story till I saw Mr. Moore. I did not then know that Durham was in custody for something else.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I saw no more of Durham till I saw him in the House of Correction. Mrs. Abrahams lodged in the same house with me. Mr. Moore came to me on the business - Mrs. Abrahams told me to be particular in telling the truth, because it would be an advantage to Abrahams.</p>

            . I came to town with him, in November; we lived at Mr. Chapples, No. 25, Great Earl-street, on the 28th of November; before that day, I had seen my husband drinking with Durham several times, at the Fox and Goose public-house - on the 28th of November, I dined in my own room - Mr. Shaw, my husband, Mrs. Vandevelde, and the prisoner, were of the party; the prisoner drank tea in Mrs. Vandevelde's room, with the same party, and the landlady - my husband left the house, it might be about half-past seven o'clock; but I am not certain - Durham wore a black coat, a black waistcoat, and black trowsers, which appeared particularly full; his clothes appeared rather worn - Durham and my husband went up stairs together; they came down, and I asked my husband for 1 s.; he gave me 6 d.; he said that was sufficient - Durham gave me 1 s.; they then went away together - I went on that evening to the Fox and Goose, and gave my husband there the latch-key of the door, while the watchman was going half-past ten o'clock; my husband was called out to speak to me; he did not return that night, and in the morning I went out with Mrs. Vandevelde, to go to look for him - Mr. Shaw was then in the house - when I got out, I saw Henry Durham, he appeared very pale - I went, and put my hand on his arm, and asked if he could tell me where Abrahams was; he said</p>
               <p>"Hush, go up stairs" - I told him I should not go in doors any more, till I had seen Abrahams; he said</p>
               <p>"Don't make a noise before people, come round here" - I asked him again where my husband was, and he said in St. Clement's watch-house - I said, on what charge; he said,</p>
               <p>"The fact is, we broke into a house, in Norfolk-street, in the Strand, last night, and he poor fellow has got taken, and I fear it will go hard with him - there was a little dog's head cut off" - I said,</p>

               <p>"No; I held it. while Lintott cut its throat" - he pulled up his sleeve, and showed me some of the stains of blood on his shirt - he said Abrahams was not in the house; he did not say on what part of the premises he was taken - Mrs. Vandevelde was in hearing, but she was rather behind, while he pulled up the cuff of his coat - she heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Look here" - but I do not know that she saw the cuff of his coat pulled up - I went to the Fox and Goose - I there fainted; Durham gave me a little brandy, and said</p>
               <p>"Don't fret - I will do every thing I can for Abrahams, and get Counsel" - he said, if I would go down to Bow-street directly, I should see him brought up from the watch-house, I went, and Mrs. Vendevelde with me - I made enquiries at the Office, and learned that a Jew, named Abrahams, was taken into custody - Durham had told me to come back and tell him how Abrahams got on with his examination, but when I came back, he was gone, and I did not see him again, till he was in custody - I do not when that was; it was after Abrahams was tried - I stated this conversation to Mr. Ford, at Bow-street - I was not in the Office, but outside the door - he was fully committed the first time - I did not say</p>
               <p>"Here is a woman, who will say that she heard a person say my husband was not in the house at all" I was present when my husband was tried here, but I was so agitated, that I could not give any information till now; after he had been in custody at Bow-street I gave this information to Mr. Welford, the solicitor - I had stated this several days before his trial - I went before a Justice, about a week after my husband<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130077"></xptr>was tried; but I had given information before he was tried - I was married on the 23d or 24th of February, at Bath, in my mother's room; there was several persons of Mr. Abrahams persuasion there - I am not a Jewess, but I was married according to his religion.</p>

             re-examined. I know Cousins. I pointed out a room to him, on the 10th of December; Durham had slept there two or three nights; there are three beds in the room; there were some drawers in the room; I never opened those drawers, but Cousins did, with a key which I gave him; the key had been sent to me by a stranger, to get a shirt out of Durham's box; the drawers were opened in my presence - I had not seen Durham, after the day on which I went to Chelsea, till he was in custody; there were two keys in these drawers, which the officer called skeleton keys - I had not been in the habit of seeing them; there was no linen there. Cousins found some linen in a box, which was opened by a key I gave him - there was some shirts and stockings; the marks on the shirts, were</p>

I have never said that I heard of it that night; the box which was opened, was Durham's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Durham had slept there for about a week before the 28th of November. A.

             re-examined. I went to Newman's house, and in the room I found a box, which I opened with one key out of a bunch of three which Newman gave me. There was a variety of linen shirts and stockings - they were not taken away that day, but the next. I found two keys in the drawer, which are large skeleton keys. On Friday, the 10th of December, I examined the box, and brought away the two keys, and four duplicates which were in the box, in the name of Preston. I afterwards went on Saturday morning to a house kept by Mr. Winwood, Blackhorse-court, Fleet-street, and there found a pair of stockings, and a shirt marked</p>
               <p>"H. D. No. 9." - the stockings are marked with ink</p>
               <p>"H. D." I went there in consequence of information, but I do not know of my own knowledge that they were Lintott's lodgings. Mrs. Winwood was there then. I was on the look-out for both the prisoners, but could not find them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was Abrahams apprehended? A. On Sunday night. He was taken to Bow-street on Monday, and tried on the Monday following.

I can have little to say, and I hope the good feeling and candour of the Jury will excuse any appearance of feeling on my part, on my addressing such an assembly, and being placed in so awful a situation. I am aware I stand charged with a most serious crime, my life is at the issue of your determination. The evidence brought forward to substantiate the charge, I hope you will give your most mature consideration to. I am implicated according to this evidence with an individual now under sentence of death for the same offence, your judgment will dictate in what way this implication should be received; the wife of this unfortunate young man is the principal evidence adduced against me. I allow having met her on the morning after

I commiserated with her, and seeing her faint, I gave her the liquor in question, but I most solemnly declare that nothing else ever passed between us, and that I was not aware of the robbery till she herself informed me of it, is it likely if I had been concerned in the robbery that I should have informed women? (strangers to me, only having seen them once before;) would any person of common sense act as they stated I did? if I had been guilty, should I have placed my life in the hands of these women? No, God forbid! Then look, Gentlemen, as to the character of the woman she brings forward to corroborate her evidence, she makes no observation as you will recollect to facts Gentlemen, it is not from malicious motives on my part that I bring forward these facts, I do it most unwillingly, but my own life being at stake, I am in duty bound to lay them before you now, I am confident you cannot nor will not place any reliance upon the evidence of such persons, so utterly devoid of credit; upon this evidence my prosecution is rested, and any other observation from me would be but superfluous, as your judgments<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130078"></xptr>will dictate in what way it should be received. Now Gentlemen, I wish to state that I never before was placed in a similar situation, and that I have an affectionate and respectable parent, (for unfortunately I have but one), waiting with breathless anxiety, the result of your decision. Parents, picture to yourselves the distress you would be in if one of your children was placed in a situation like me, no doubt you see the motives for my being placed here your own discernment will show you it is done by the friends of an individual now under sentence of death, with an intent of saving his life. I now await your decision with calmness, being confident a British Jury will never willingly find an innocent man guilty.</p>

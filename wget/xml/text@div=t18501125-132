                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker's assistant, and reside at 37, York-street, Commercial-road. On Saturday night, 2nd Nov., between eight and nine o'clock, I was at a book-stall, in Baker's-row, Whitechapel-road, and felt a person come up to me, and felt a hand in my pocket—I turned, saw the prisoner, and suspected it was him—he was close to me, and the only person near—I caught hold of him, and said, "You have taken my handkerchief"—he said, "What do you mean?" and struggled hard with me, and got away—I followed him, call<lb></lb>ing, "Stop thief!"—he turned up Thomas-street—I still followed him, and he ran up against a policeman, and I gave him in charge—my hand<lb></lb>kerchief, which I had safe about an hour before, was gone—it was after<lb></lb>wards</p>

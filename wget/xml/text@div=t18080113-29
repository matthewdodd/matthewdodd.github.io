            . I live at Knightsbridge, I am a pawnbroker. On Friday the 11th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house and brought the twenty four silver forks, seventeen silver handled knifes, and eighteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130023"></xptr>silver handled forks; she asked me to lend her eight guineas on them, she said they were her own property; she had a genteel appearance at the time, I told her I did not think they were her own; if she had brought them for some other person, I would send one of my servants with her, to see if they were the person property; she replied, that she brought them from Mrs. Bruce in Bromptom, and that my servant could not be admitted to see her, she was very ill; at last she consented to let him go with her; from her behaviour, I did not give credit to her; I sent two of my servants with her; they returned in a few minutes, and said that she had confessed that she had taken them from the same person; she refused to tell me at first, I told her I must take her in custody if she did not tell me who she took them from, but if she told me they might shew her the lenity that her case admitted of; then she said she had taken them from the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat what you last said. - A. I told her that I must take her in custody if she did not acknowledge who she took them from, and if she would go quietly with me probably the person that she took them from would shew her that lenity that the nature of her case admitted of; I took one of my servants with me and her in a hackney coach to Mr. Bruce, and the articles along with me. I staid there till she was taken in custody. I produce the articles.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to you any time last month. - A. The prisoner came to me on the 11th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, she saw a bill in the window, it was to let a gentleman's house, she supposed it was lodgings to let; she came in a hackney coach, it stopped at my door, she asked me if I could let her have a bed, I told her no; she then asked me if I would let her sleep there for one night; I told her no; she asked me to let her sit up in my room all night, which I refused her; she then asked me if I would let her leave her things, while she seeked a lodging; I told her yes, she might leave them while she seeked a lodging; she said she was come out of the country off a long journey; she went out from me, taking first a small parcel from the basket which she had in her hand; a little before seven she returned and said she had got a lodging; she then asked me if I thought she could go to the top of Sloane street by nine o'clock, I told her she might; I did not see her any more that night; the small parcel she took out of the basket with her, but the bundle in the basket she left in my care till eleven o'clock the same evening, then Mr. Jones came down to my house in a hackney coach, and fetched them from my house.</p>

At half past twelve the prisoner at the bar and another man went into the boat, the officer saw them going over the side, he informed me of it; I insisted on them two men not to go; I took them back and had them stripped, and the prisoner at the bar said, I have some tallow, and dropped the tallow from his leather belt; I did not see it drop, but I saw it dropping, it came from under a leather belt, the bag weighed about twenty pounds and two ounces; it belonged to the owners Reman and Holmes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150167"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. What time did this man come on board that day? - He came on board half past eight; there might be six or seven or eight or nine more in the vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went out he came back on your calling him, and on your saying, that some of you have tallow about you, he readily admitted he had tallow? - He did, and afterwards it was laid down on the deck.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you Mr. Jones, after you had made enquiry on the subject, whether you have made use of this expression, that you did not believe the prisoner had stole the tallow, but that the little man had done it, and that you believed he was innocent, and you had more suspicion of the little man than this man? - I said, they were all concerned together.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Jones was not this man at the time pretty far advanced in liquor? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. This man has a wife and four children? - He has.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the "Union," Queen-street, Pimlico. Colvin was my barman for three months up to 1st Oct.—in consequence of missing money at various times from my till, I spoke to Downing, and he came in private clothes—I supplied him with marked half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences—on 1st Oct. the prisoners were taken into custody, and Downing showed me one of the marked shillings.</p>

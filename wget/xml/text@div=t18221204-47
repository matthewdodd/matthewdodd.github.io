On the 30th of October, about ten o'clock, I went out, and left a shirt a pair of trowsers, and a razor, in a bundle in the room - he was not in the room then. I returned about half-past three o'clock, and did not go into my room till I went to bed; I then found my handkerchief opened, and the things taken out. I saw the prisoner next morning at the Three Crowns, public-house - he denied it. My trowsers were produced to me at the Coach and Horses, public-house. I afterwards went to Riley's.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Chelsea. I saw Trayner at a public-house at Chelsea, one Wednesday night, about ten o'clock; I met him in the passage, and he asked if I wanted to buy a pair of shoes - I said No; I examined them, and should know them again. I met him in the street next morning, and asked him if he had sold them; he said he had, but he would get me a better bargain in the course of the day. I took Banner to the Three Crowns, where Trayner was; I said he was the man who offered me the trowsers - he was given in charge. (Trowsers produced) - these are them. I saw No. 12 on the waistband when he offered them - it was about ten o'clock at night.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 31st of October, about eight o'clock in the morning. I was fetched in the Three Crowns, and found Trayner, Draper, and Banner there. Banner said he had been robbed of this property, and gave charge of Trayner. In the way to the watch-house, he said of his own accord that he took the things and sold them, being distressed. About an hour and a half after, I went to Riley and asked if had not in the course of Saturday bought a shirt and a razor, and described Trayner to him; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I did not" - I said I am told you did. As I was coming away, I saw the razor laying on the board in front of his shop, where he puts his goods; he said he bought it yesterday for 2 1/2 d. - I told him not to part with it till I found whether it was Banner's, and said</p>
               <p>"I think you must have the shirt;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have none but one which hangs there," which was a calico one, without a frill. I fetched Banner, who claimed the razor - I then said he must have the shirt - he said I</p>
               <p>"have not." I said he must go to Queen-square, to say where he got the razor; he said,</p>
               <p>"Well shall I get into trouble about the shirt;" I said I could not say - he said,</p>
               <p>"Well I have it," and fetched it; it was not the one which hung up. Banner said it was his, but the frill was gone. He said he bought it of Trayner - he is a dealer in marine stores. He went out willingly with me.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>TRAYNER pleaded distress.</p>
               <p>RILEY's Defence. He came to me, and said he had nothing to eat for a week, and asked me to buy the shirt - I gave him 18 d. for it, and next morning found it was stolen. I told Champion I had not got the shirt, as I had sold it, and while he was gone I got it back.</p>

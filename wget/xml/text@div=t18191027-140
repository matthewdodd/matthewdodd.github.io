On Friday evening, the 8th of October, I locked up the manufactory door myself, and left the lead hanging on a wooden rail; there is one part of the manufactory which I occasionally leave open to chrystalize saltpetre - in that part the lead hung. In the morning when I got up I found a lead light forced completely out of the window, leaving an aperture sufficiently large to admit a good sized boy; he could then unbolt the back door, and get to the wash-house, from where I lost a cane basket, and an old coat. On looking round I perceived a pane of glass broken directly under the fastening of the counting-house window, which was not so when I went to bed - it appeared they had endeavoured to undo the fastening, but the brass work was corroded, and they could not. On further examination, I found they had entered the cellar. I missed the brass cock of the cyder cask. I gave an alarm about the neighbourhood, and on Saturday found the prisoner in custody with the property.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday morning, the 9th of October, between three and four o'clock, I was on a back wharf at the back of the prosecutor's premises, and saw the two prisoners running with a basket; I stopped them, and asked them what they had got? one said they did not know, for they found it on London Bridge, and were going to Haggerstone; the other said, No, we are going to Blackfriars-road. I took them both to the watch-house. One had hold of each handle of the basket; it contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

On the 17th of April, I was attacked by four footpads, at just after twelve at night, as I was going to my house, near the Boot, by the Foundling Hospital. I had been at the theatre; it was very dark; I was alone. I met two at first; one said, Your money! I went back two or three steps, and asked them, What they wanted? When I was four or five steps from them, I thought, as I was so much nearer town, I could make my escape; I ran about fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>You trusted to your legs? - Yes; but the thieves were too nimble for me. Seeing the man was near me, I turned back; I thought I might save a blow. I turned round, and put my cane up; I saved a blow by catching hold of his hand. He struggled a little while, then there came up the other three; they stood at some little distance: the man that turned round upon me, took me by the collar, and I collared him; he took hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300008"></xptr> my hair, and turned me round; my cane dropped; they all came up to me, and I was cut very much upon the head; I lay senseless. I only felt one blow upon the head, the others I never felt: I kept my bed four days. When I came to my senses, I found an hanger under me: they took my hat, three pair of silk stockings, which I had in my pocket, my shoes and silver buckles, a pair of stone knee-buckles, an handkerchief, a Charles the Second's crown, and two sixpences. When I recovered my senses, I found them robbing me: one was tearing the knee-buckle out of my knees; I felt every motion of theirs: one said to another, Have you got the pistol?</p>
               <p>What answer was made? - None. One had one of his knees on my cheek, and the other knee on my ribs: that man staid the last.</p>
               <p>As it was a very dark night, should you be able to know them again? - No: I could not see them at all: they first kept at so great a distance from me, that I could not discern any human faces.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell whether they had their own hair, or wigs? - They had short round hair every one; that is all that I can tell of them.</p>

Calcott was in bed with two girls and another man; that man made his escape going to prison. While I waited in that room, they took Webb in another room. There was not any thing found upon Calcott; the other had eleven bullets in one pocket, in the other he had some loose gunpowder; his name is Stonnell. I found nothing upon the prisoners: after they were taken, we searched the house of

               <p>You have heard of his having been at sea? - I have heard he deserted from the St. Alban's; but how true that is, I can't tell.</p>

He asked me to go along with him; I went with him, and she bought the watch. I should have been at sea before now, only I am not in a condition to go to sea.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager at the King's Head—I saw the prisoner put a coin on the counter, and the last witness brought me a half-sovereign; it was very light and obviously bad—I asked a friend's opinion of it, who held the prisoner while I went for a constable—I gave him in charge; he said at the station "I have another half-sovereign," and threw one down on the desk, saying "Perhaps that might be bad as well."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I found a brooch, and the only way I am in fault is through selling it, which I had no business to do. My mother has lived twenty-one years in her present place, and I always give her address, though I generally sleep where I am at work. I have never been in the hands of the police before. I have been a potman for nine years, and the policeman will state that I bear a good character. Mr. Whitehead, of the Rum Puncheon, White Cross Street, was my last employer.</p>

               <p>Brixton-hill—Fiddy, the deceased, was the driver—the prisoner was drive of another omnibus—they both started form the City at the same time, a quarter past four, on the 14th of Dec.—we reached Acre-lane, Brixton, about five o'clock—I had to let out a passenger, and then to go up the Effra-road, to the George Canning public-house, thence up Water-lane, into the Brixton-road—while we were at Acre-lane, the prisoner came up with his omnibus, and passed us there—after I let the passenger out, I gave the word, "All right!"—then we drove on, and went to pass the other buss, on the right-hand side—it was fifty yards before us, I should think, and going in the same direction, up the Effra-road—we were going at a good pace, quite fast—I did not notice at what pace the prisoner was going—we got close to his omnibus, which was then in the middle of the road—there was room for us to pass him on the off-side—our driver attempted to do so—the prisoner pulled right across us—he drove us on to the lamp-post—the omni<lb></lb>bus was in a position to have gone by without touching the lamp-post, if he had not pulled right across us—I saw the deceased thrown off immediately on knocking against the lamp-post, and lying on the ground—he was under the horses—he scrambled out as well as he could—his head and back ap<lb></lb>peared to be hurt—he was put into another omnibus, and taken home.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk at Dowgate-wharf. On the 14th of Dec. I was on an omnibus going to Brixton—I was on the top of the om<lb></lb>nibus, in front, with the deceased, who was the driver—when we got to the Effra-road I saw another of the omnibus before us—it stopped to let out a passenger at Acre-lane—the driver of the omnibus I was on attempted to get past the other omnibus—both omnibuses were going fast—the one that I was on struck the lamp-post—I should say that happened on account of the other one crossing—if the other one had not crossed there would have been room for us without going against the lamp-post—in driving down from town they had been going very fast—they appeared to be going against each other, racing.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tea-broker, living at Thornton Heath. On the 14th of last month I was on the prisoner's omnibus, sitting beside him, on his left—I remember getting to the Effra-road—I had noticed another omnibus—the two omnibuses had been running together in opposition, first one took the lead, and then the other—when we got to the Effra-road, and to the lamp<lb></lb>post, the prisoner's omnibus was in advance—we left the other omnibus about sixty or seventy yards behind, but it made up that distance in a very shore time—I saw him endeavour to pass us—on that prisoner slewed his om<lb></lb>nibus across the road—he did it gradually, he did not it at once, not di<lb></lb>rectly viciously—when we got opposite the lamp-post, he had alewed a const<lb></lb>derable distance across the road—there was not room for another omnibus to pass—that was in consequence of the prisoner's driving across the road—I saw the man thrown off—the prisoner drove on—he did not stop to see what was the matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi> When your omnibus came abreast of the lamp<lb></lb>post, in what position was the omnibus of the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must have been very near on the path, if not quite—I generally travel by Ball's omnibus—when we were abreast of the lamp-post the other omnibus was very nearly abreast of us, but I could not see the horses' heads without looking back—it was then that the driver of our omnibus was slewing it across</p>

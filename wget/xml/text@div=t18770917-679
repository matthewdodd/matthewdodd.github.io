                  </hi>. I am stage manager at the Princess's Theatre—Mr. Chatterton is the lessee—the prisoner was employed as dresser, and had charge of one of the dressing-rooms; he had to attend upon the actors in that room—Mr. Clarkson contracts for those rooms to supply wigs, towels, and soap—the prisoner was engaged by the housekeeper of the theatre—I believe I had been at the theatre twelve months, and the prisoner for a few weeks—Mr. Terriss brought him, I believe—the dressers have no right to take the soap, or any perquisites, to my. knowledge; nothing of the kind is recognised by the management—on 22nd August, about 11.30, Phelps the porter brought the prisoner to me. and said "This man, Harris, on leaving the theatre, had a bundle under his arm containing this quantity of soap, and I stopped him"—I told him he had better get a constable and give him in charge, as I had strict orders from Mr. Chatterton that any employed leaving the theatre with articles was to be searched.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not remember the date of the affair at Lillie Bridge; it was about two months ago—Mr. Terriss spoke to me about it at night—the man was in liquor and did not mean anything—I took no notice of it and said he was perfectly at liberty to stay in the theatre—the property manager provides the properties for the theatre—the bank notes and the coins would be provided by Mr. Chatterton in the ordinary way—they were used in "After Dark," and handed to Mr. Terriss every night since I have been there, and would probably be left in his clothes—the prisoner was given in custody at once and charged the next day, without communicating with Mr. Clarkson at all—Mr. Terriss was in Mr. Chatterton's employ there is no foundation fur saying that the prisoner was his servant—actors are allowed to bring their own dressers, and they would be put on the staff and paid by Mr. Chatterton.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's, and an doll-maker. On the 22nd of May, about three o'clock in the morning, I was in a coffee-shop taking a cup of coffee—the prisoner was there, and a young fellow insulted her very grossly indeed, and I took it up—we staid there about half an hour—the prisoner went out, and the man also—they got into the street, and were going to fight—I went out in about twenty minutes—I saw the prisoner, and she took me to a little house <hi rend="italic">in</hi> George-yard,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130191"></xptr>
               <p>where they take spirits at night—I treated her with a quartern of gin—she then wanted another—I said, "I shall not give you any more here, but if you will come out I don't mind"—we then got into the passage—she put her arm round my neck—she put her hand in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and robbed me of 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then went out—I went out, saw her running down the court, and accused her of robbing me of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said it was more than she knew, she had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that she got from a gen<lb></lb>tleman, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that she got from a gentleman in Old-street; and if she had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of mine, she would give it up—but she did not give it me, and I charged a policeman with her—I had seen the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. safe within two minutes before I was with her—I was perfectly sober—no one could have taken them but her—I was in no company but hers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> This man wanted to take very indecent liberties with me, and a young person who was with me said, "Don't have anything to do with that man." I never asked him for any gin; I went home to a gen<lb></lb>tleman's residence in Gos well-street, and he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s;.</hi> I then went to have a cap of coffee; a female there came out with me, and the prosecutor asked me to go and have a drop of gin at a place where he said he had been on the Sunday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I searched the prisoner at the station—I found a shilling and a halfpenny in her stocking, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her hand—she said she would have given the old man his 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if it had not been for that b—r of an inspector.</p>

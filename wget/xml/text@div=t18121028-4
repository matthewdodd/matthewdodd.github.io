            . I am shopman to Mr. Christians, in Wigmore-street. On the 3rd of August, in the afternoon, the prisoner came into their shop. He asked to see some fine shirts. I showed him some; he objected to the price. He ordered eighteen shirts, together with eighteen handkerchief, they were to be marked S. H. and to be sent the next evening to No. 38, Park-street, Baker-street. I took them myself the next evening, and presented the bill; he observed, as it was for ready money, I ought to let him have them lower, but if they were good he did not mind; and probably he would be a customer another time, and after cavilling, I agreed to take twenty-three pound, ten shillings; the bill was twenty three pound, seventeen shillings. He took a check out of his pocket book, and drew it to the amount of twenty-three pound, ten shillings, and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave you the check, did he say any thing about the banker - A. Not as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of him before - A. I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take a check of a person you knew nothing of - A. I am so accustomed to take checks; it being a printed one, I had no suspicion.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280008"></xptr> He told me his name was Harper; I supposed him to be a gentleman, by his appearances.

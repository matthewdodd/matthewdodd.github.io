                  </hi>. I live at 41, Osnaburg Street, Regent's Park, which was formerly called Munster Street—on the 29th January, about 1 p.m., the prisoner came into the shop and asked whether I would mind a letter being addressed there—I said that I did not mind, and he asked me to keep it till called for—I said that I would—he could not find his card and wrote "A. Burton" on this paper in pencil (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and gave it to me—I did not receive any letter, nor did I see the prisoner again in the shop—on the next day I was fetched to the San Francisco Bank, by Hatcher, and saw the prisoner there, and said that he was the man—I said later on that I should know him better with his hat on—I afterwards saw him with his bat on and seemed to know him better.</p>

               <p>gentleman from the bank called at my mother's shop one or two days' afterwards and asked me whether the person who wrote the paper was a young man and he looked ill—I said "I cannot tell for I did not take any notice"—he asked me whether the person was dark or fair—I said "I do not know, because I did not look at him"—I was taken to the bank—the prisoner was there and I was asked "Is that the man?"—I hesitated a little because I was not quite certain—I was afterwards told by the police sergeant and persons connected with the bank, that the prisoner was no doubt the culprit—I said that I had no doubt about it—Thornhill and Payne asked me whether I was positive about recognising Lowry—I said that I had only seen him once and could not exactly tell—I also said that 1 was afraid to say that I did not recognise him lest I should be impli<lb></lb>cated and put down as an accomplice—I could not tell what the man was like.'</p>

                  </hi>. I am acting secretary to the London and San Francisco Bank, 22, Old Broad Street—the prisoner was a junior clerk-in their service—it was part of his duty to receive letters and keep the bill and postage stamp account—if any letters were re-addressed it was his duty to re-address them—about 15th November, Dr. Andree called at the bank and gave me certain directions—about 5th December I received from San Francisco a list of drafts, among which was one in favour of Dr. Andree for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 29th January as I was leaving the office I received this letter addressed "To the manager of the Bank," which I believe to be in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "44, Munster Street, Regent's Park, 29th January, 1871. Dear Sir,—The enclosed cheque I received from Dr. Andree about 'three weeks ago, but I have not been able to get the money for it; and as I am an invalid and have no friends in London I send it to you and hope you will kindly pay it as soon as possible, as I am in need of money. I do not know how you can send the money unless it is by P. 0. 0., and hat will cause expense, so please deduct it from the amount, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I hope you will pardon me for troubling you so, but being an invalid I am unable to go any distance. A. Burton. P.S.—Osnaburgh Street post-office is the nearest one to me.") This is the draft: "13th November, 1876. San Francisco. Please pay Adolph Andree or order (duplicate cheque being unpaid) 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and charge the amount to the London and San Francisco Bank, Limited. J. W. Minter, manager. A. Findwich, accountant,"—this is the same kind of paper which is used at the bank, but it has been cut down—it is not used there cut down—on the following morning the letter and cheque were placed before the manager and I gave 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Hatcher—the prisoner was not an invalid at that time—he was under notice to quit at the end of March—I produce a certificate of the incor<lb></lb>poration of the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had been there about three years—it is required that the clerks shall go to San Francisco if required—the prisoner was required to go there and declined—no fault was found with him and he was given three weeks to find something else—he has said to me on one or two occasions that Hatcher was hard upon him—I do not know that complaints followed on the prisoner accidentally meeting Hatcher in</p>

               <p>the Strand late at night—I never heard that before—the letters are made up after the bank is closed, the very last thing, and it is Adam's duty to post them—I never saw the letter to Dr. Andree"—I should say that he is in Egypt—I do not know where to find him—the documents are usually drafts in duplicate—there is no water mark or maker's name on the paper, but it resembles ours in colour and quality—I do not mean to say that you cannot buy thousands of reams of it in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In this letter which I say is the prisoner's writing the capital I's are finished off at an acute angle, but not invariably with a loup—I found my belief on the general similarity of the writing—there is no special point—I do not see any case in the prisoner's letter where the crossing of the is not carried through—it is carried through is "Minister Street," particularly—in the words "I send it to you and hope you will pay it," the t's are crossed through—I find no instance in the prisoner's letters where the "t's" are not crossed through—all the y's are made with a loop, they are not all formed without a loop—in the prisoner's undoubted letter you will see the word "day" in the third line which is not—the y's in the signature and in "yours faithfully" are made without the loop—the figures "7" are very different in the two letters—in the letter I produce there is an equal margin on each side—this letter being placed before me without any other circumstance I should not say that it is the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Comparing it with the letter before me and my suspicions having been aroused I thought it was the prisoner's writing and I think so still—this signature, (<hi rend="italic">to the letter of 29th January</hi>) I should say is the prisoner's—the "B" on the draft agrees with this "A. Burton," and I say that it is the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  </hi>.

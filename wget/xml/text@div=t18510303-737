                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Barton Rose, of 215, High-street, Wapping. The prisoner came into my service on 16th Jan., and remained till the 29th—she left that day, about twenty minutes past nine, without notice—after she was gone, I missed half a dozen silver tea-spoons, a table-spoon, a dessert-spoon, a child's robe, a muff a bonnet, a table-cloth, and a great many more things—I had seen them the night before—this muff, and victorine, and a dress, I had put in the front lodging-room, and locked it, and hung the key up—I afterwards missed the key, and had the lock picked—I afterwards found the key in a lower room, down-stairs—nobody lived in the house but me and my children—my husband was not at borne.</p>

Dr. Adler, I found these other things—the prisoner had been in service</p>

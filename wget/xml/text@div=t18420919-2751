                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Windmill-street, New Cut, Lambeth. I have known the prisoner nearly five years, and have lived with him as his wife, on and off, for two years—I have been an inmate of the Magdalen for two months—I went in there about two months ago, and left on the Monday week before this happened. The prisoner had promised to marry me when I came out—I saw him the same evening I came out—on Tuesday night, the 6th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went to a concert in Gray-street, Blackfriars-road, and met him there—I asked him for some money for some victuals—(he had given me half-a-crown and a watch a week before)—he said he could do no more for me—he was going to ill-use me, we had words, and the policeman came up and parted us—I went away—no blows passed then—I came down directly after him, and saw him at the corner of Queen-street, Blackfriars-road, the next turning to Gray-street—I was standing there, and he came up to me, and called me a b—wh—, and said he would do for me—he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a knife, opened it, and made a thrust at my side—I put up my arm, and prevented him, and received a stab on my left arm—it bled, and after that he gave me a kick in my left side—I fell, and was in<lb></lb>sensible, and was taken away—next morning I came to my senses, and found myself in St. Saviour's workhouse—this is the knife he did it with—I know it because he wore it in his pocket—I had seen him wear it for about a week before—he is a pewterer.</p>

               <p>asked him for money for victuals—he would not give mo any—he made a blow at me—I did not make a blow at him, not before he struck me—I first lived with him, eating and drinking with him in the day, and lodged with him at different lodging houses at night, during the last two years—he never would provide a place for me to go to—I was at his mother's for a fortnight—I am an unfortunate girl—the prisoner's mother got me into the Magdalen, and also into the Pentonville Penitentiary—she has been very kind to me, but the prisoner has not—I have been wounded by him before—I once attempted to destroy myself—I had no house to go to, be served me just the same as he has now, and I took some laudanum—I never attempted to drown myself—I was once insensible from a blow which he gave me, and he said I was trying to strangle myself—that is twelve months ago—a doctor examined me—I have been before a Magistrate once for creating a disturbance—I was in company with a young woman who committed a felony, she left the things with me, and I was taken to Union-hall, but I was innocent—since this transaction the prisoner's mother has been to me, and she gave me half-a-crown to get myself a pair of boots, that I should not appear against him—I did not tell her that I had wounded myself out of jealousy—they said I had done it myself, but I never did—I left the public-house between ten and eleven o'clock on Tuesday night—I saw the prisoner again in about five minutes—I never told the prisoner's mother that if the prisoner would not marry me I would destroy myself, nor that I would transport him and myself too—he did not charge me with stealing the watch on the night in question—he had given it me as a keepsake—he was the first person that took me from home—I did not sleep with him at his mother's—I lived with him there—I slept in the next room to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant surgeon, in High-streef, Borough. On Tuesday night, the 6th of September, I was sent for to St. Saviour's work<lb></lb>house, and found the proseutrix there insensible—I examined her, and found an incised wound in the centre of the left arm, about an inch and a half, or three quarters long, and half an inch deep in the centre—the knife produced would cause such a wound—she did not suffer much pain then—it had left off bleeding—I dressed it—she was suffering from pain in the side—I examined it—she was not sensible enough to tell me of it, but I could see it by her right arm going to her left side unconsciously, and appearing in pain—she was in bed, and placed her hand to the part—after dressing the wound I administered a slight stimulant, and directed her to be kept quiet—I found a slight inflamed mark on her side—I do not think a kick would produce that—it was merely a streak—I could not say what produced it—it would not require violence to produce it—it was so very slight—sufficient time had not elapsed to produce blackness.</p>

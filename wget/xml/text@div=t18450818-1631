                  </hi>, Jun. I am in the employ of Thomas Bonior, of Rose-street, Newgate-market. About nine o'clock in the morning, on the 6th of Aug., 1 was going through the shop, and saw the prisoner in the back part of the shop—I went into the counting-house, watched, and saw him cut a piece off some pork on the block, and put it into his trowsers pocket—he was then called by one oi the clerks—he went out, and I gave information—he had no business at the block at all.</p>

In con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to the Cat tap, and found some pork roasting—the prisoner was not present—I fetched him, showed it him, and asked if he knew anything about it—his reply was "No"—I took the pork home, and compared it with the piece it had been cut from—it matched it exactly.</p>

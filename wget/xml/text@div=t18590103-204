                  </hi>. I keep the Crown public-house, in the New Cut, Lambeth. On Saturday, 4th December, I saw the prisoner in my house after 6 o'clock in the evening—I had a servant named Mary Quin, she has now left me—while the prisoner was there Quin gave me a base half-crown, and she said this person had asked her for half-a-sovereign for silver and in the silver one half-crown was a bad one, and she passed it into my hand—I said to the prisoner, "Where have you got this from?" holding it in my hand—he said "From a public-house"—I said, "It is very curious you</p>

               <p>should come to another public-house, and ask for a half-sovereign, why did not you ask for it there"—he went to the door, and said, "I will call my mate"—I looked out at another door, and saw him running down the turn<lb></lb>ing as fast as he could—I put the half-crown in a piece of paper, and locked it in my desk till a policeman took the prisoner a week afterward—I marked it and gave it to the officer—I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

On Saturday evening, 4th December, the prisoner came in—I am certain he is the person—he asked for two pennyworth of rum, and paid me two penny pieces—after that he asked me if I would oblige him with half-a-sovereign for ten shillingsworth of silver—amongst the silver I found a bad half-crown; I gave it to my master—I was present when the prisoner had some conver<lb></lb>sation with Mr. Boag—he remained two or three minutes—he then went out at the door—I was present on the 15th, when the prisoner had his examination in a private office—I noticed on 4th December that he appeared as if he had just left work—his hands were very dirty—I did not notice his dress—I speak to Sum by his features—I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On Saturday, the 7th of July, in consequence of information, I went to the French Horn public-house, in Barbican, with Lloyd, Ferguson, and Mr. Powell, the assistant solicitor of the Mint - one Vint was there also; we first got into Kelly's company at this public-house - I searched him there, and found he had nothing about him - I then gave him two good shillings, which I marked, in the presence of himself and the officer: Kelly then left us, and went in a direction for Chequer-alley, by our direction - Kirby went with him. I saw Kelly again in half an hour or more, at the same public-house; he gave me two had shillings, which I produce - he showed me one of the good shillings which I had given him - he informed me what he had done and seen; between four and five o'clock that day I sent him on another errand: he returned to us in about half an hour, and produced three bad shillings, and a piece of colouring stuff in a paper - it was in powder, not in a lump - I produce that and the bad shillings. In consequence of what he stated I went, with Lloyd, Kirby, and vint, to No. 2, Chequer-alley, Whitecross-street; we found the street door open, and went up to the first floor front room - the door was on the latch; I opened it and saw Lynch near the door, partly undressed; the other prisoner was near the window; she had her gown sleeves tucked up, and I think she had not all her clothes on - I think this was between five and six in the afternoon; I took Cavenagh into custody, and Kirby took Lynch - we handcuffed them together, and then searched the room - there was a bed in the room, and under the bolster I found this canvass bag, containing a good half-crown, and a good shilling which was marked, and was the one I had given Kelly; in a piece of brown paper, near the bag, were-seven bright counterfeit shillings: while I was searching the bed, I heard a scuffle between the prisoners and Kirby - I turned round, and received from Kirby this bag, containing the colouring powder, which I afterwards tried on a halfpenny - it gave it the appearance of silver; there was a cupboard in the room - I examined it, and found two bad shillings wrapped up in a piece of rag, in an old mug - they had been rubbed down, and recoloured, fit for circuiation - they appeared to have been rubbed down by sand paper, then recoloured, and blacked over. I found nothing on either of the prisoners; they were taken to the office and searched by Mrs. Lee, the jailor's wife, who gave me, in Cavenagh's presence, a shilling and two or three halfpence, which she stated she had taken from her person; the shitling was marked, and was one of those I had given to Kelly - I had then got back both the shillings which I had given him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you stated all that you saw these women do on your going into the room? A. Yes; one was more undressed then the other - I think they had been washing - I did not find them doing anything; I sent Kelly there by direction of Mr. Powell.</p>

Chequer-alley; he went up stairs, but there was nobody at home - he came down again - he and I went to another public-house. and in half an hour, I watched him up stairs at No. 2, agains; he remained there not five minutes, and came down again - this might be half-past twelve o'clock; he gave Limbrick two connterfeit shillings - he was then searched, and only one of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130042"></xptr>good shillings found on him; he went again in the afternoon, but I did not follow him then - between five and six o'clock, I Limbrick, Lloyd, and Vint, went to the house, the door was open; we went to the first floor front room - the door was on the latch; we went in - I first saw Lynch; she came towards the door as we opened it - she was nearly naked, I believe she had her gown on - Cavenagh was standing close to the window, with her sleeves tucked up as if she had been washing - they were both taken into custody and handcuffed; I had hold of each of their hands; Lloyd left us, and went into another room - while Limbrick was searching the room I saw Cavenagh take something off the bed, it was a little parcel, tied up in a piece of bedtick - I took it from her; we had a scuffle, and Limbrick took it from me - I afterwards saw that it contained a grey powder; I found a paper of cream of tartar on the mantleshelf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not any one, who chose, have walked into the room without any apparent resistance? A. I only had to lift the latch up - the street-door was wide open.</p>

            . I have known both the prisoners for three-quarters of a year - they have lived together during that time, at No. 2, Chequer-alley. On the 7th of July I saw Limbrick, and received from him two good marked shillings; I went with them to Chequer-alley - Kirby followed me into the alley; I went to the first floor room, and saw nobody the first time - I came back, and went into a public-house; remained there about five minutes, and saw both the prisoners go along - I immediately went out and saw them both go into the alley - I went up stairs, and found them both in the room; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock - Cavenagh asked me what I wanted, I told her I wanted two bad shillings; she said I should have them - she went to an old quilt that hung before the bed - Lynch was present; and Cavenagh asked her where they were - Lynch said, "They are there;" Cavenagh produced two bad shillings to me, and I gave her one of the good shillings which I had received from Limbrick - I asked her for a small bit of colouring stuff, she said she had none - but I should have plenty in the evening; Lynch said,"What is that?" Cavenagh said "A small bit of colouring stuff, the boy wants." Lynch said she had none, but I should have it in the evening - I asked at what time I should come in the evening; Cavenagh said "Come between four and five o'clock." I then went to the French Horn, public-house, in Barbican - saw Limbrick there, and delivered him the two bad shillings, in the same state as I got them. I told him what I had seen; I went again between four and five o'clock; found them at home - one was standing near the window, andthe other near the bed; there was a cupboard in the room - I asked Cavenagh for three bad shillings, meaning counterfeit shillings; I used the word bad - she said I should have them; she sat down; and drew a paper out of her bosom, containing about a dozen had shillings, in a bright state - Lynch was washing down the cupboard; Cavenagh sat down, and got some sand paper and was rubbing the bad shillings down; Lynch grambled at not being tall enough to wash down the cupboard. Cavenagh said "Come here, and get these ready for the boy, and I will wash it down;" Lynch came, and sat down, and rubbed down the three bad shillings with the sand paper, to make them not look so new, and fit for passing. Lynch put them on the bar of the stove, and after heating them by the fire, threw them into a basin of water, which Cavenagh gave her; she then took them out of the basin, brought a piece of bed-tick from under the bolster, with colouring stuff in it; she rubbed the bad money with the colouring stuff, and then threw them into another basin of water, took them out, and rubbed some cream of tarter on them; she lighted a candle and somaked them over it, and then rubbed a little tallow on them, to make them a little darker than they were; she folded them up in a piece of printed paper, and gave them to me - she gave me a small piece of colouring stuff. I gave Lynch the other marked shilling, which I had from Limbrick; I took the counterfeit shillings and the colouring stuff to the French Horn, gave them to Limbrick, and they went to apprehend the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are these country-women of yours? A. I do not know that they come from the same county - I have known them three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known this process of colouring? A. The very first time was the commencement of that three quarters of a year - I get my living by labouring, any work that I can get.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you happen to get acquainted with Limbrick? A. I had given information to Mr. Powell of the Mint; I never passed any bad coin in my life - this is the first time I ever asked the prisoners to sell me any; I have been promised nothing for doing this, but I hope to be paid for my time and trouble - I hope to be justified by the Court, to be paid for my time and trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Is all your expectation the usual expenses which the Court allow; what do you mean by being justified? A. I hope to be paid for my time and trouble in seeing the King and Government justified, seeing that they are not robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been working for Mr. Powell? A. The three quarters of a year was the first commencement of it - I work for him but very seldom; I never had any jobs for him but this; I got some money from him to purchase of them. My sister introduced me to Mr. Powell; she was in the habit of going out with bad money; Mr. Powell never promised me any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to be better paid if you convict these women? A. No; I do not know any thing at all about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you expect to be better paid provided you can convict them, than if they get acquitted? A. I dare say I will. I do not know whether either of them are married - I never had any quarrel with them; that I swear.</p>
               <p>Q. During any part of the three quarters of a year, have either of them accused you of stealing a duplicate off her mantle shelf, and getting a shawl out of pawn? A. No, never; nor a gown, nor any thing - I never heard either of them say a word about it - I do not know a woman named Taylor nor Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. Then no relation of yours named Kennedy lived in the room with these women? A. No; I swear that - I shall be satisfied with any expenses I get from Mr. Powell - I do not know how much to expect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it depends on the success of your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130043"></xptr>evidence, whether you get any thing? A. Yes, I do; but I expect I shall get something for my time and trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you ever say to a woman named Taylor, that because Lynch charged you about the duplicate of the shawl, and said she would do for you, that you were determined to do for her? A. No; that I swear, nor any thing of the kind - I never heard a word of it; nor ever said a word of it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Do you expect to be paid for your trouble, whether they are convicted or not? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an inspector of coin at the Mint;(looking at the paper of bright shillings) these are all counterfeit, and bright in the same state they first came from the die - there are seven of them; the sharpness which is now on them is removed by friction of glass or sand-paper it removes the silvering from the surface, and takes off the sharpness of the die - it is then necessary to re-silver them, which is done by a mixture of nitrate of silver and salt, being rubbed on in a moist state - here is some of that mixture among the articles produced [here the witness after moistening the powder produced, with pure water, rubbed it on a piece of copper, which he then rubbed with cream of tartar, and it produced the appearance of silver] after it is coloured in this manner, a portion of grease and blacking is generally put on it to give it a dull appearance as if it had been in circulation. I state this from a great number of years experience (looking at the two counterfeit shillings produced by Limbrick as received from Kelly) these are counterfeit, and appear to have undergone the process I have described. rubbing down, re-colouring, greasing, and blacking; they are in the state in which they are usually put into circulation - (looking at the three other counterfeit shillings produced by Limbrick) these are counterfeit, and in the same state - they have been rubbed down, re-coloured, greased, and blackened; the small quantity of powder produced by Kelly is of the same nature with that found in the room.</p>

            . I am one of the moneyers of the Mint - (looking at the two shillings) these are counterfeit; all the shillings produced are counterfeit.</p>

               <p>CAVENAGH's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I can assure you most solemnly, that I know nothing of the crime. I was this day sent for by my daughter-in-law, as she was lame, to assist her in cleaning her room; a woman named Kennedy was there, and the witness Kelly came to see her, and paid a shilling for her rent, as she was about to leave my daughter-in-law's room, having notice to quite. Kelly also sent me for some gin, and gave me a shilling to get it with. I am a hard-working woman, and sell fruit; and having a quantity of copper in my pocket, I paid for the gin with that and kept the shilling - this shilling was found upon me when at the office. I saw Kelly (the witness) go to the mug on the dresser, where the two bad shillings were afterwards found - Mrs. Kennedy also laid in the bed where the other things were found. kelly had a quarrel with my daughter-in-law some time before, about a shawl, the ticket of which he stule off from her mantle-piece, and Mr. Fryett, a pawnbroker of Whitecross-street, described a man of his description as having redeemed the same; when threatened about it, he swore that he would do for my daughter-in-law (that is, he would do her some harm.) I hope my Lord, you will not receive his evidence against us on this account, as I firmly assure you of my innocence, and pray that our unfortunate case may meet your merciful consideration. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I most solemnly and earnestly, assuring you of my innocence, pray that my case may meet your serious consideration. I have always borne an honest character, and beg to state that the witness Kelly has had a sister tried twice before for this very crime, and a sister of his Joan Kelly, was tried here only during the last Sessions, as he well knows. Myself, I am sure, and my daughter also, are far from being able to attend to, or deal in such practices; there were no appearance seen on either of us to make out that we had been doing what the witness Kelly states; this plau has been laid by himself, or the woman whom he came to my daughter's house to see, and for whom he paid the rent with one shilling, and gave the other for gin, which I kept in my pocket, which I should not have done, as I could have thrown it away on going to the office, had I sold coin for the same.</p>
               <p>LYNCH'S Defence. I know nothing about it; the man brought the woman to lodge with us. I accused him of stealing the ticket of my shawl; all his family are passers of bad coin - he came into my room and treated me.</p>

            . I have known the witness Kelly eight or nine months - I have seen him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever say to you, that as the prisoner Lynch said she would do for him, he would do for her? A. Yes; he said as she had accused him of taking her shawl I out of pawn, he would do for her; I met him in Holborn at the time - I asked what he could do with her; he said he knew that himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known Kelly well? A. No; I used to carry fruit for Lynch, who is lame.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Are you married or single? A. Married; my husband formerly lived in Gray's lun-lane; he is a painter - I sell fruit when I can, and at times go out charing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go by any other name but Taylor? A. Brander was my name before I was married - I have been married about six months - I met Kelly in Holborn about three months ago; I had a basket of cherries at the time - I spoke to him first - I said, "Kelly, are you not ashamed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130044"></xptr>to go to that poor lame woman, and take the ticket of her shawl, though you used to go to the woman that lived with her - you should not take her shawl." I said I heard her say she would have him up for it, and do for him, or send him to Newgate: his answer was, he would do for her before. I said, "Lynch is fully intending to settle you in Newgate for it:" he said he would have her there, and do for her before she could do for him; the prisoners were not in custody at that time - I went by the name of Taylor then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever yourself under a charge of passing bad money? A. No; there never was any charge of the kind made against me at Hatton-garden - I was there once for a row; I was never at any office for passing bad money.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What woman used he to go and see at their room? A. Some woman who lived there - I have seen him there on two Saturday mornings.</p>
               <p>vM. KELLY re-examined. I never saw that woman in my life while I have been in London, or any where - I swear I never saw her before - she is only perjuring herself.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to see any woman at their lodgings, or did you see any third woman there? A. No; I never saw any woman there but those who went to purchase bad money. I do not know Kennedy at all - I never met this woman in Holborn, or any where in my life. I do not know a pawnbroker named Fryett - I never heard the name before.</p>
               <p>M. TAVLOR re-examined. That was the man I saw and spoke to in Holborn.</p>
               <p>M. KELLY. I never saw that woman in my life before.</p>

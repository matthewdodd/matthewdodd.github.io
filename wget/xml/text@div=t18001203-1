             sworn. - I am a soldier belonging to the West London militia; I have been in the regiment six years; I saw a basket like this lying in the road, as I was coming along Whitechapel High-street; it stood upon its bottom; I looked at it for the space of two minutes, I suppose; I looked to see where it came from, but I could see nothing; I then saw the prisoner pick it up, and the patrol ran after him, and called out stop thief, and then I found myself very comfortable that I had not meddled with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before? - A. No farther than being children together; I never knew the lad so as to be in any correspondence with him. <rs id="t18001203-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

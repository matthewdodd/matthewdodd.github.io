                  </hi>. I live in South-street, Chelsea. On the 2nd of Jan., between ten and eleven o'clock, I met the prisoner—I went with her to her lodging—I had two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and four half-sovereigns wrapped In the notes, in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I was with her from twenty minutes to half an hour, and when I got home I missed my money from my left-hand pocket—one of the notes I traced to a pawnbroker's in the neighbourhood—this is one of the notes that I lost on that occasion—I did not pay the pri<lb></lb>soner with a note.</p>

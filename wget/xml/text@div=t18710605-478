                  </hi>. I live at 35, Blomfield Road, Shepherd's Bush; the prisoner lived at 17 in the same street, with her husband, Alexander Carson, and four children, with the deceased—they were her step children, I believe—the little girl Adelaide was between four and five years old—I was charwoman there—I first worked for them a little before Christmas, and at the latter part of the time I went there every day—I have seen the prisoner beat Adelaide with a cane, anywhere she could hit her, on her hands, legs, and face—I have seen her give her as much as two dozen strokes—the child used to cry—she was sometimes dressed, and sometimes undressed—I have frequently seen her so treated—I left the place seven or eight weeks before the child died—I have seen the child put in a cold bath, and then stand naked the remainder of the day, and be put in a cupboard to sleep—I have heard the prisoner say that she had such a dislike to the child that she could put it on the table and dissect it; also that she once pot its head down the water-closet, and if it had not been for the eldest boy Willy pulling it away, it would have been killed—that was about a month after I went—she also said that she had made the poker red hot, and was going to make use of it on the child, but she put it down without doing so—that was at the same time—a little before I left, she said that she had insured their lives, and all she wanted was a new dress and a slow walk—I thought she meant a funeral by that—the deceased generally had two slices of bread and chicken, and some soup, that was her daily ration—the cupboard the child was put into was under the stairs—I do not think she said anything to the child before putting her into the cupboard—I have mentioned to other people during the time I was there what I have seen.</p>

I live at the White Hart, Shepherd's Bush, about two minutes' walk from the prisoner—I became acquainted with her, and she used frequently to call in for a glass of ale, as she passed, but I never went to her house—she spoke of all the children frequently, but Adelaide, she said, was such a dirty little beast, she had beaten it, and abut it up—the first time she spoke of it was before Christmas—she said that it was so filthy, she had beaten it, and she had used fair means, and she had used foul—after Christmas she complained of a pain in her chest, and asked if I could recommend her a doctor—I recommended Dr. Ayling, and in a few days she came in again—I asked her how she was—she said she was better, Mr. Ayling had done her a great deal of good, and that she had mentioned the habits of the child to him, and he had recommended cold baths for it, and to make it carry weights, as he thought the dirty habits arose from laziness—I had occasion to go to her house in the beginning of March, and then she spoke of this child, and said how dirty it was, and that she had held its head down the closet, and if Mr. Carson had not taken it out, it would have been suffocated—she did not say how she came to do it, but she disliked it because it was so dirty, I suppose.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 53, Nothing Hill Square—on 16th May, about 10 o'clock at night, I received information, and went to 17, Blomfield Road, where I saw the dead body of a female child—the prisoner and her husband were in the room—the child was in a coffin—I took it out, and examined it externally—it was between four and five years old, and very much emaciated, and there were marks of bruises on the forehead and face:—I went to the police-station, and reported what I had seen—I returned on the 18th with a Coroner's warrant, and had the body stripped—I could then see every rib standing out, the skin being tightly stretched across it—the abdomen was shrunk and shrivelled, and there was little development of muscular tissue; the eyes were sunk in the head, and open, and the pupils dilated—I was accompanied by my son, who is a medical student, and by my assistant—there were three distinct bruises on the forehead, of comparatively recent date, close to the hair, and downwards; one in the centre, and one on either side; also a bruise on the temple, and another on the cheek bone; these presented the appearance of from three to four days standing, those on the temple and cheek were of about a week's standing; there were also three bruises on the right, and one on the left arm; one on the right hip, and one on the left knee—those on the legs and arms were of minor consideration; the three on the forehead were severe bruises, with much blood extravasated between the tissues—the stroke of a cane would produce the bruises on the arms, but not those on the head—I afterward opened the body, and found the intestines much contracted, and perfectly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050065"></xptr>
               <p>empty, with the exception of a little mucous—there was not a particle of fat in any part of the body; the vital parts were perfectly healthy, with the exception of a slight adhesion of the right pleura—I saw nothing up to the neck to account for death—I then dissected the head—I looked most carefully where I had seen the bruises on the forehead, and saw immediately below them a large quantity of extravasated blood penetrating to the bone, and extending to the periosteum—the skull was not fractured—the mem<lb></lb>branes of the brain were much congested, that is, full of blood—the brain itself was healthy—I account for death from congestion of the membranes of the brain, caused by the blows on the forehead, and accelerated by the poor, ill-nourished condition of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The congestion of the brain must have taken place three or four days before death—I do not think the child could have taken solid food after its brain became congested—congestion is a gradual process, it would not take place at once—it might have begun on the Friday—the origin of it might have been a blow given on the Friday—a dote of calomel administered on the Friday would not account for the state of the stomach—the bowels were much contracted, and it would not have produced that; but a dose of medicine might have emptied the bowels—a dose of calomel administered would account for the emptiness of the stomach if no more food was given, but it would not account for the contracted state of the bowels—the injuries on the forehead would not be accounted for by a fall forward, if the child was standing on its feet, but they might be from falling from a chair, or a bed, or from any height; that would account for the three bruises on the forehead—those three were of a more recent data than the others—those on the arms were twelve or fourteen days old—a fortnight would include all the bruises—the largest bruise on the forehead was a very severe one, that with the other two caused the congestion and the death—the bone of the skull was not injured—the child was naturally of a low type as regards physique.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was told that the child had fallen when I was called in, and to the best of my ability it presented the appearance of a full having taken place—the bruise on the forehead was certainly the cause of death—I considered the body bruises unimportant—I attended the prisoner in January this year, for a complaint incidental to her sex, and ordered her total rest.</p>

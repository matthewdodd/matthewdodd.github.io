In consequence of in<lb></lb>structions from Mr. Woods I watched his boiling-house in Bear-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—there is no shop—between eight and nine o'clock on the morning of the 18th of November I saw the prisoner coming out with this can, with his hand covering the top—there was no lid to it—by fol<lb></lb>lowing him I saw a piece of tripe on the top—he was going in the direction of his own house—he keeps the Crooked Billet public-house—I stopped him just as he was about to enter his own door, and asked what he had got there, pointing to the contents of the can—he said, "Why?"—I told him I was an officer, and he must consider himself in custody—I took him to the station—on the way I asked several times who gave it to him—he did not give an answer—at the station he said some of them down at the boiling-house gave it to him—Mr. Woods afterwards came—I heard the prisoner tell him that <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Armstrong, as I understood him, gave it to him—the can contained a neat's foot and honeycomb tripe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Wood's service. I was at the boiling-house in Bear-yard on the 18th of November, where the tripe and cow<lb></lb>heels are prepared for the shop—it is not a place of sale—the prisoner came down to the boiling-house between eight and nine o'clock, as usual, for his pots—I did not give him any tripe or cow's-heel—we had a lot of tripe there, there were fifty-one honey-comb pieces, of about 1lb. each—I did not see him leave.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>MORGAN JENKINS. I am shopman to Mr. Gillman. On the 12th of October, between ten and eleven at night, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for some dimity; I stood at the door, I asked her to walk down the shop; she went down about the middle where the shawls were laying upon the counter. I turned my back and fetched the dimity, and when I turned back I missed six printed cotton shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of them - A. Ten shillings and sixpence. I cut her off half a yard of dimity, it came to seven pence, she paid me in copper for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. There are many persons employed in your shop - A. Yes, there were two or three persons in the shop at the time, and there was a young woman came in with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who left the shop first - A. The one that is gone, and this one was left behind.</p>

I came in just as the prisoner was going out; a signal was given me; I immediately followed her into the street; I laid hold of her arm and brought her back, at that moment I discovered the shawls between her feet and mine in the street; I immediately took her and the shawls into the shop, I then sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had she put the shawl - A. I do not know; I did not see them fall, I saw them between her feet and mine; my foot touched them as I laid hold of her.</p>
               <p>Mr Challenor. Whether the shawl dropped from this young woman or the other you cannot tell - A. The other young woman was gone at the time, the shawls were on the ground. The prisoner went out the first time, and returned to know if she had paid for the dimity; she had, and then when she went out the second time a signal was given me. I went after her and laid hold of her arm, and the shawls were on the ground. These are the shawls, I know they are ours, there is my private mark upon them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, and called no witness to her character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an excavator, and live in Tudor-place, Tot<lb></lb>tenham-court-road. On Saturday, the 2nd of January, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in the City-road alone, going from my house—I was walking on the footway, with my hands in my breeches-pockets, going to look for a lodging—I met the prisoners—I never saw them before—theywere on the same path that I was—I did not speak to, or even look at them—the prisoner John exclaimed, "Here is a b—Englishman," and hit me in the left eye with his bent fist, and knocked me down—when I was down, the prisoner Michael kicked me in the ribs, and about the left side of my body two or three times very hard, it broke two of my ribs—I knew at the time that something was broken, for something ap<lb></lb>peared to go off like a popgun in my inside, and I said, when I got up, that my ribs were broken, I was sure they were broken—I cried out "Police," and "Murder," and John said, "Kick him in the month," three or four times—Michael then stepped forward, and made a kick at my head, but he kicked a scraper, my head laid between two scrapers—I saw him kick at me—the scraper broke the force of the kick, it caught me in the right eye and cut my eyelid quite through—it bled, and bled all day Sunday, and Sunday night, and part of Monday constantly—by this time twenty or thirty people came up, who cried, "Police," and the prisoners ran away—assoon as I got up, I went round the corner after them, and met them again—they both made a rush at me, and I went down again—that was not above two minutes after the other time—John was the first to knock me down the second time—I was only struck once—it was a sort of push to get me down, not a blow—nothing was said then—when down I was kicked by both (I am quite sure of that) in the arm and shoulder, and about my body, and they kicked one another in trying to kick me—I can<lb></lb>not tell how long the second kicking lasted, they kicked me and ran—the whole transaction did not take five minutes—the mob collected, and sung out "Police!" but not one of them attempted to protect me—the pri<lb></lb>soners ran away—I was picked up—I saw Michael after that, running away in the City road, with a short stick in his hand—I saw them both at the station in about half an hour—I had never had any quarrel with them, and never saw them before—I am universally respected among Irishmen, and likewise among Englishmen—no Irishman ever attempted to ill use me before—Mr. Nott, the surgeon, saw me at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger. On Saturday night, the 2nd of January, about half-poet twelve o'clock, I was in the City-road, and heard a cry of "Police" close to where I was—I saw the two prisoners run from Tabernacle-row, round the corner into the City-road—I said nothing to them—I saw the prosecutor getting up off the pavement on the oppo<lb></lb>site side of the street—he called out "Police," and followed them into the City-road—when they found he was following them they made a full stop, and I saw them knock him down—when down I saw the prisoner Michael kick him—John was close to him at the time—I cannot say that he kicked—I heard no words pass—they ran away, and I went and picked the prosecutor up on his legs—he was bleeding from the eye and mouth—he seemed insensible at the moment—I left him, and followed the prisoners, and in three or five minutes I saw John in custody of a policeman—a few minutes afterwards, I saw Michael come out from some place, out of a hiding-place, I fancy—he seized the policeman's staff from him, and knocked the policeman down with if—I did not see Michael taken, but I saw both the prisoners at the station, in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I am confident the prisoners are the men—I never saw them before.</p>

On the 2nd of January, a little past twelve o'clock at night, I heard a cry of "Police," from the corner of Tabernacle-row, City-road—I went towards the cry—a woman pointed out the prisoner John, as the man that had almost killed a man—he was running away—I pursued and took him—I had no sooner done so than Michael laid bold of me by the collar, put his knees behind my knees, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> me up on my back, by which John escaped—I imme<lb></lb>diately got up, pursued, and took John again—he struggled violently and tried to get away, and while I was struggling with him Michael came up, laid hold of John and of me too, and tried to rescue him from me—I laid hold of him by the collar, and held them both some little time—they both struck me very violently about the body, till I found I was nearly exhausted—I then let Michael go, drew my staff out of my pocket, and said if he did not keep away I should have to use it, as he (John) was my prisoner, and he had no business to interfere—he made a rush at me, I struck at him, but did not hit him, I hit one of the witnesses on the finger—I then lost sight of him for some time—he afterwards came behind me, as I had hold of John with my left hand, and wrenched my truncheon nearly out of my hand—I put my shoulder forward and brought him round in front of me—begave another wrench, got it out of my hand, stepped back, and struck me over the nose and mouth—I was knocked down, and my prisoner ran away—I got up again as quick as I possibly could, and pursued John—Iovertook him again, clasped ray arms round his waist, and we had a very severe struggle—he nearly got away—I had hold of his jacket, when Michael came and hit me on the side of my head, and knocked me down—I was insensible, and recollect no more till I came to at the station—I saw the prosecutor standing at the corner of Tabernacle-row, when I went forward to the cries of "Police," but I was not aware of his being the person that was injured.</p>

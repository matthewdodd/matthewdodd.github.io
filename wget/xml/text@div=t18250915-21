On the 22d of July the prisoner came to my house, and said he knew of some harness to be sold at Kentish-town, which might suit me - I said I wanted to go that way; he said if I would use one of my gigs he would bring his horse and harness; we went, but it did not suit me - we came back, and he had tea at my house; he then asked what I let out that tilbury for - I said 15 s. per week; he said would I let him have it the next day to go to Woolwich to see his daughter: I said I would, and I went part of the way, and while I was in a house he went off with it; I saw him on the 26th, and asked him why he did not bring the tilbury back - he said he should keep it for another week; I saw him several times afterwards, but he did not bring it home; I saw him about a fortnight afterwards, and he said he should hire it another week, and pay me altogether. I then saw him again, and said, "Why don't you bring the gig home;" he said he should keep it; I said he could not keep it, for I had sold it. He then said he had let it to a lawyer for a month. - I asked where he lived; he said he did not know the name of the street - I told him I should expect it in a short time, or I should see about it some other way - he had called at my house several times before, and said he kept several men at work in the harness line. I have never got the tilbury back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had seen this man several times? A. Yes, and he had it week after week.</p>

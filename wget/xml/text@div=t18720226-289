                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. Galloway of High Street, Deptford—on 13th January, the prisoner told me to give him the bas<lb></lb>ket—I did so, and he put it under the counter where the cheese is kept, I went outside and he afterwards gave me the basket packed, and said "Take this to my place"—there was no one there to pack it but himself—there was butter, cheese, eggs, and bacon in it—the cheese was in paper, tied round with string—on my way I opened the paper which was round the cheese, and found under the cheese two half-crowns and a florin, I wrapped it up again, delivered it to Mrs. Hayes—when I re<lb></lb>turned I made a communication about it—on 25th January, he said "Take these papers to my wife," they were packed up under the counter—there were nine <hi rend="italic">Kentish Independents</hi> and one <hi rend="italic">Surrey Gazette</hi>—I took them to his wife, and on my way I showed them to Detective Officer Osborne—I had been told to do so—on 10th February the prisoner told me to take his things off the shelf; there were some eggs, butter and cheese; I put them in the basket, and took them to his house; there were also three or four rashers of bacon done up in paper, which he pointed to me and told me to take—on my way I saw Detective Margetson, who examined the basket in my presence, and I saw him find two half-crowns between two rashers of bacon—he then did it up as it was before, and I left it at the prisoner's house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not called at the Police Court, and have not been examined before—it was, I think, after Christmas when I first went with the cheese; it was close upon Christmas—I was not present when the</p>

               <p>goods were packed—there is no charge against him with reference to the cheese—I had not opened a parcel before—it was the under shopman who told me to open it—when I went back I saw George Simpson outside the shop, and told him I had opened it—the prisoner was then behind the counter—neither Simpson or I put any question to him—I had told the prisoner that Mrs. Hayes wanted some paper to wrap up his dinner to send to him, and he said "Take some of the waste paper under the counter"—they were old newspapers, and something like 1 1/2 lb., and I took it—he did not say "Don't take it away"—I took nine old newspapers, and asked him whether that would be enough—he said "Yes"—Simpson did not pack the parcel containing the rashers of bacon, but he always told me to open the parcels, and I always did from that time—I went to the prisoner's house every day, and opened all the parcels—I do not know who wrapped up the rashers of bacon on 10th February—I was putting the goods away—I saw Margetson open the parcel—I knew him before—he came back in half-an-hour—the prisoner was there—I put no question to him—I did not attend at the Police Court—Simpson has been there all the time I have been there—Mr. Galloway was there every day; he is a cheesemonger—I never served.</p>

                  </hi>. I am under-shopman to Mr. Galloway, and have been sometime in his employ—on January 13th the boy Osborne took some things to the prisoner's wife—Mr. Galloway had not then made any communication to me, but I gave the boy instructions in reference to the parcel—I did not pack the things on that occasion, but I was present when the prisoner packed the cheese into a basket—I saw him go to the end of the shop, and take some<lb></lb>thing from between the tubs, and put it between the cheese and the paper—I could not see what it was, but in consequence of what I saw I gave instructions to the boy—when the prisoner put it into the cheese he deliberately put it into the scale, to weigh it and charge it to himself, the money with the cheese, and that attracted my attention; when the boy came home, he made a communication to me, and I told my father the same day—my father does not live there—I remember seeing the boy take the papers—I did not pack the parcel of goods which the prisoner sent to his wife on 10th February, nor was I present when it was packed, I was outside—nobody was present to pack it but the prisoner and the lad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only mentioned it to my father, but he communicated with Mr. Galloway; I did not do so because I did not see him, and when I did see him I did not tell him, because my father had done so—my father comes to Mr. Galloway on Saturdays—I was not called at the Police Court—the 13th was Saturday—after this I told the boy always to open the parcels, but I had not done so before—I did not speak to the boy to-day during lunch; I had instructions not to do so, and kept away from him—I knew that Hayes had newspapers from the shop to wrap parcels in, but I do not know whether he was allowed to do so; it has occurred four or five times.</p>

               <p>between the first and second rashers were two half-crowns wrapped in paper; they were not marked—I put them in again and sent them by the boy—on the same Saturday I received four marked sovereigns and four marked half-sovereigns from Mr. Galloway—I gave two of the sovereigns and two of the half-sovereigns to Detective Berritt, and the other two sovereigns and half-sovereign to my wife, directing her what to do with them—shortly after 12 o'clock that night Mr. Galloway called me into the parlour where the prisoner was, and Simpson and the two lads—Mr. Galloway gave the prisoner in custody for robbing him—a half-sovereign, a crown, a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence were lying on the table, and Berritt asked the prisoner "Have you any more money in your pockets? if so, turn it out"—he took a half-sovereign and a crown out of his pocket, we examined it, and found that the half-crown was marked—it was money which was previously taken—I asked the prisoner if he had got a great-coat to put on; he pointed to a coat hanging behind the door and said "That is mine;" I asked him if he had got anything in the pockets; he said "A pair of gloves and a wrapper"—I asked him if there was anything else—he said "Not that I know of"—I examined the coat and found a pair of gloves in one pocket and a wrapper in another; I put my hand in a second time and found a marked half-sovereign—he said that he knew nothing about it, somebody must have put it there—I took him to the station—I afterwards searched his house, and in a chest of drawers in the bedroom I found a bag containing a half-crown marked.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in High Street, Dept<lb></lb>ford—the prisoner was my manager—he has been in my service since the 20th May, when the establishment opened—the under-shopman was there at the same time, and the boy came afterwards—Mr. Simpson the elder made a communication to me, in consequence of which, on Saturday, 10th February, I marked four sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, and four half-crowns—I placed the four half-crowns in the till in the shop about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and gave the gold to the policeman—about 12 o'clock that night I asked the prisoner what he had sent to his house in the afternoon—he referred to the entry in the book—I said "You sent something more than that"—he said "No, I did not"—I told him to recollect himself, and not be in a hurry, as I was sure he sent something more, but he posi<lb></lb>tively declared he did not—I accused him of taking my money, and told him I insisted on his coming into the back room, and turning his pockets out—he said "Very well;" and we both proceeded to the back parlour, and in the presence of all the other servants he turned some money out of his waiscoat pockets, and I identified one of the half-crowns I had marked that evening—I said "This is my money"—he said "It is my hard earn<lb></lb>ings"—I called him a liar, and asked him if he had any more money about him; he declared most positively that he had not—I sent for the police, who were outside—they came, and I told them what had occurred, and that I believed he had some more money about him—they pressed him, and he put his hand into his coat-tail, and pulled out some gold and silver, and placed it on the table—none of that was marked—I gave him in custody—two coats were hanging on the door—the police asked me about them—the prisoner said "That is my great-coat"—they asked him</p>

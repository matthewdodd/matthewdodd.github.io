             keeps the house; the shop belongs to both of us: The things were taken out of the shop on Monday the 14th of March; we missed from a shelf in the shop about thirteen yards of Irish linen; and, as we had not had occasion for any from the Sunday, I suspected the prisoner; she was servant to Mr. Aldred; I mentioned it to her mistress; she sent her out for a few minutes, and went up stairs and examined her room; she brought down a parcel of linen; by its appearance, I thought it was the linen we had lost; I sent to the Police-office for a constable, against she came back, we searched her room, I was present, and part of the things were found in her room under the bed, and a part of them in her box; the other articles were under the bed; there were several other aticles, but these were what we could swear to, having our private marks; and she was taken to the office.</p>

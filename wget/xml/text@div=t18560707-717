                  </hi>. I am an engine driver in the employ of William Mor<lb></lb>gan and Son, rope manufacturers, Jamaica-level, Rotherhithe. The prisoner was in their service—on Wednesday, 11th June, I was at work on the pre<lb></lb>mises—I cannot say exactly how many of us there were at work—there were two in the frames where they frame the rope—I was at the engine—one was winding, and Coombes was padding—it is my duty to light the gas all over the premises—I did so that night, <hi rend="italic">barring</hi> the tar house gas, I did not light that, it was not required to be used that night—I lighted the gas about 9 o'clock, it might have been a little before—when I lighted the other gas I looked at the jet in the tar house—there is only one burner there—I turned it off correct, so as to be sure that the gas could not escape—I felt it, and tried it—at that time there were no signs of fire—there had been no fire under the tar kettle for twenty-four hours—they call it a ket<lb></lb>tle, but it is a copper set in brick work—I walked into the tar house at half past 8 o'clock to see if everything was right—I remained on the pre<lb></lb>mises until the fire broke out—after lighting the gas I went into my engine room, and attended to my engine—this occurred about 20 minutes to 11 o'clock—the engine house is about ten or twelve yards from the tar house—I came out of the engine house at 20 minutes to 11 o'clock—I observed no sign of fire about the tar house at that time—I went up to the frame which is at the upper end of the ground, and had not been there a minute or two before I heard the signal bell pulled—that is a bell which is pulled when the work gets foul, for it to be stopped—I turned round to pull the line off the clutch, and saw the tar house all in a flame—I directly ran to the engine house to draw my fire from the boiler—as I was running down, Coombes was the first one that met me, by the stoke hole door—he came across from the direction of the tar house door—he was running up the ground to<lb></lb>wards the frame, and I was running towards the stoke hole—he said to me, "The place is all on fire"—I said to him, "You must have done it," using an expression which I do not wish to repeat—I did not hear him make any reply—when I first saw him running, he was about ten or twelve yards from the door of the tar house—if he wanted a light in the tar house he had no authority to light the gas without my assistance, nor had any one else on the premises—they should ask me, it is my business—next morning, Thursday, I went to have a look at the ruins, about ten o'clock, and I saw that the plug was out of the jet in the tar house, and I put a wooden one in in case I should forget it on the following night—as soon as I saw the fire on the Wednesday night, I went and turned off the gas, and lighted it again in a few minutes, after they had got all out at the lower end; we could shut it off from beyond the tar house without affecting the gas there—I have never seen the plug since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old. I live with my father and mother at Matilda-place, Botherhithe—I was employed at Messrs. Morgans rope factory for about two months—on the night the fire happened I was assisting Coombes in his work, padding junks of yarn—I do not know how many junks there were in the tar house that night to be done—I saw Coombes fetch a junk out of the tar house—he brought it outside against the outside wheel—there is a loop hole near where the junks are and a truck upon which it is turned after it comes out—he put the junks through the hole—I was inside and he was outside—I do not know how long it takes to pad a junk—there was no other junk taken out after that one—I saw Coombes come into the tar house about two or three minutes after that junk had been taken out—he said he came to see how many junks then were, he had a bit of rope yarn alight is his hand when he came in—there was no gas alight in the tar house at that time—I came away from the tar house after that, no, I stopped at the door—there is a gas light outside the tar house near the door; that was alight—I saw Coombes light a bit of rope yarn at that light, and then he went into the tar house—I was standing so that I could see him after he had gone into the tar house—I saw that he was going to light the gas inside—he did not light it, he attempted to light it but did not, he came away from it, came over with the yarn and threw the rope yarn on to the junks—there was some band stuff there as well—I did not see anything there besides the junks—when he threw the lighted yarn there, it was on fire—the prisoner then came out and pulled the bell to stop the work—Massey called out "Fire!"—I did not call out—it was after Massey had called out "Fire!" that the prisoner pulled the bell—I went down the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you had any light in your hand that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had a match—I had it in the tar house—I lighted it and threw it outside in the ground, through the hole—I had put it out when I threw it out I had got that match on the Millpond Bridge, not at my master's, I found it, I only found that one—the prisoner was outside when I lighted it and threw it away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You lighted the match in the tar house, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I pulled it against the wall to light it, not near the junk, nor near the gas—no one was there when I lighted it, Massey was outside, just outside the door—he is a little bigger than me—nobody else was near the door besides Massey; me and Coombes and Massey were working together—Massey is not here—when the fire began Massey was just outside the door along with Coombes against the hole—that is not close to the tar house—I do not know how far it is, it is further than across this court—we were all three together when the fire began to blaze—a man named Coppick was there, he was putting the junk on the jigger; he got the junk from the tar house—I was working with Coppick the first time—he is a good deal bigger than rne, he is as big as Coombes—he had got the junk from the tar house before the fire, a good bit before—my master called me in next morning and asked me about the fire—at first I told him I knew nothing about it, and then I told him about</p>

               <p>the lucifer match—I did not say anything about Coombes until I got to the Magistrate—I told my lather and mother when I got home that the place was set fire to—I did not tell them anything about Coombes, nor about the lucifer match—I did not see the plug in the gas pipe, I did not see anybody pull it out—I knew where it was—Coombes lighted the piece of ropeyarn at the gas outside, just facing the door of the tar house—I do not know whether Massey saw him light it, he was against the hole—there was a boy named Feakes there, he was along with Coppick, putting the junk on, and Murley was putting the junk on—Dryden is a man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Glebe-terrace, and am foreman to the prosecutors. On 11th June, the prisoner was at work at their ropery—there was a great deal of work to get through—I told the prisoner at 5 o'clock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070098"></xptr>
               <p>that afternoon that he would have to work late at night, both him and his brother—he would have to pad the remainder of the junks that wore left there were three left then—I told him how many there were—they were in the tar hotwe—his work was padding the yarn, that is coiling it round—the time it takes to pad a junk depends upon what sort it is, some take longer than others, it might take two hours to do some of them—it is ne<lb></lb>cessary to pad them separately—they come out through the hole—I was not on the premises at the time the fire took place—I went about ten minutes past 11 o'clock, when the boy came and knocked us up—about half-pagt 6 o'clock next morning, in consequence of what one of the men said, I looked at the gas in the tar house, and found the plug was out—I had not obserad it the night before; that would cause the gas to escape—the plug was about eight feet from the ground—the gas branch did not appear to be at all injured beyond the loss of the plug.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. I was at work on the frame when the fire broke out—that is just against the engine house—the tar house with the shed is on one side, and the engine house on the other—about three minutes after the fire broke out I went down to the tar house, and saw the prisoner standing still pretty dose to the door—I said to him, "Here is another fire job happened"—he said that he had scarcely left the tar house before he saw it on fire—this was about twenty minutes or a quarter to 11 o'clock—I had passed the tar house door half an hour before—there was no light in the building then—I heard the alarm bell ring before I spoke to the prisoner—the place has been on fire twice before—the place next to this is almost like gunpowder if it caught light.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of William James Morgan, and am in partnership with him and my brother as rope manufacturers. I manage the business—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Rotherhithe—the prisoner was a labourer in our service, but not a first class labourer—he received about one seventh leas than a first class labourer—I have heard him say many times that he ought to receive more money as he was quite as good as the other labourers, but we considered that he was not—in the performance of his duties he had business in the tar house—he had to go in for each junk if the boy was too small to put the end through; after that he had to put it on a truck and take it down to the ground, about thirty yards down below</p>

               <p>the tar house and winding shed, and run it out its full length, 100 yards, or thereabouts, and then pad it up—I cannot say how long that would take, because the yarns might be broken; it might take two hours—it was decidedly his duty to finish one junk before he took another—after the fire I saw him several times, and asked him questions, but he would not answer—I asked him where he was when the fire took place, and said, "You and Coppick had to take the junk out, and one of you six must have done it"—I he had said that he knew nothing about it—I repeated that several times, and then he said, "I have said what I know, and I shall say no more," and stood very sullenly against the desk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far is it from the gas burner inside to the place where the junk was lying, and which was supposed to be set on fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twenty feet—I should not think that a piece of lighted yarn thrown across would be likely to set it on fire.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 18). I took the prisoner, and Coppick, and Daniel White—Coppick was discharged—I took the prisoner at Mr. Morgan's office about half past 1 o'clock on the morning after the fire—previous to that I had found him standing on the steps of the Holly Tree public house, 300 yards distant from the fire—I asked him if his name was Coombes, he said, "Yes;" "Do you work for Mr. Morgan?" "I do;" "Were you there when the fire broke out?" "I was;" "Had you any gas alight at that time?" he said, "I shall answer you no questions;" I said, "Well, Coombes, I understand you are the last man seen in the tar house before the fire broke out;" he said, "Well, that you have got to prove"—I was in uniform—I took him to Mr. Morgan's office; he said, "Coombes, you were one of the six, and it in evident that one of you must know some<lb></lb>thing about this fire; where were you at the time?" he said, "I shall answer you no questions"—Coppick was there, and I think he said that he was padding his yarn; on his making that observation, the prisoner said, "Hold your tongue, you fool; let them talk, I shall say nothing"—upon that the prisoner was given into my custody—I have searched in the tar house for the plug belonging to the gas pipe, but have not been able to find it—the gas branch is 6 feet 8, or 9, inches from the ground to the burner, I measured it yesterday.</p>

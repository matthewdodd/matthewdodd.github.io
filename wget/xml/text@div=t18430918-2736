The prisoners had been in my employ—Scott came occa<lb></lb>sionally to collect rough grease—Garrod had no business there—I had missed palm oil, and had ordered the two prisoners to be taken—I have since seen some palm oil produced from Mr. Price—one of the casks bears my own name, written in chalk—there is 564lbs. weight of oil and two casks—I have no doubt that it is mine.</p>

I made the discovery in the former case—I asked for the explanation, which I received, and allowed the prisoners to go—the next morning I caused them to be apprehended—when I stopped them with the tallow oil neither of them said one word about the palm oil—I saw the tallow oil going about four o'clock, and afterwards, from information, I went to Mr. Price's with the policeman—I saw two casks there containing palm oil—I knew both of them by marks—one had the name of Jones on it, written by myself in chalk—the letters were quite visible—the other I knew by some figures on it—I was not aware these casks had been taken till the next morning, the 23rd, and then I mentioned it to my master—I had seen the oil safe about nine o'clock the previous morning, in three casks—it has been changed, and put into two casks—one of the casks in which I found it at Price's was not one of those that it was in on my master's premises—I saw the truck outside in Dock-street, on the premises, and had not seen Garrod on the premises for some time.</p>

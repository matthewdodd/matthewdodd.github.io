I keep a publick-house, and am a blacksmith, he came to offer to sell them to me, I took him before justice Bury, there he confessed he stole the coals, he made it voluntary, it was taken in writing, and signed by the prisoner, ( it was read) wherein it appeared he stole a boat at the Horse-ferry, Westminster, and went and took the said coals out of two lighters lying on the river.</p>

I went into the country to see my friends, seven or eight weeks ago - I left my trunks and drawers quite secure; I was away a fortnight. When I returned I missed some of my things, much more than are mentioned; my box seemed to have been opened with a common key, because I found it locked. The prisoner left while I was away; I sent for an officer, and he went to her lodgings, and found some of my things - among the rest the things named in this indictment - she did not say how she came possessed of them.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's lodgings. The prosecutrix found some things there, in the apartments of a woman named Griffiths; I asked the prisoner her name, and whether she had a box - she said she had; the first thing I found was a pair of stockings - I also found two caps, which related to other property. I searched further, and found two more pairs of stockings and a skirt.</p>
               <p>MARY KNIGHT re-examined. The prisoner lived as cook at our house - she had been there a fortnight when I left. The property produced is mine. The stockings marked "Husband" were given to me by my mistress.</p>

The constable came on the 6th of August, and gave me information; I suppose this hammer might be mine, but there are many alike - I do not really think it is mine; I do not think these tips are mine - they are odd ones. The prisoner was in my shop on the 6th of August, and asked to look at a hammer and some bristles; I showed him some hammers pretty near like this, but the iron of this hammer is more straighter than mine - he paid me 1d. for the bristles, and then came in and asked if I had lost anything - I had shown him seven or eight hammers.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of August I was facing the prosecutor's window about nine o'clock in the evening, and saw a lad looking in the window - I crossed over, and he ran away: I saw the prisoner in the shop, looking at some hammers - Mr. Dodd turned round, and the prisoner put this hammer into his pocket; Mr. Dodd then came to the window - the prisoner put his hand into a bag, and put some tips into his pocket; he stood talking a minute or two, and was then coming out - I stopped him; and went in and asked Mr. Dodd if he had bought anything - he said only the bristles; I took the hammer out of his pocket, and showed it to Mr. Dodd.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence soliciting mercy, and received a good character.</p>

            . I am the wife of Timothy M'Carty. We keep the house, the prisoner lodged there ten nights, he did not pay his rent. I asked him for it on the Monday night; he said he would pay me to-morrow, and when he came in on Tuesday, he put me off till Wednesday night; and on this Tuesday, one of the lodgers were out, and my child was restless - I went to bed, leaving the door a-jar; I heard the street door creak, about twenty minutes after, and said,</p>
               <p>"Who's there?" he said,</p>
               <p>"It is me Ma'am." I went up stairs, and found the trunk broken open; I ran and fetched Horgan. I found him in custody next day.</p>

On Tuesday night, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, a woman came and said a man was come into her house, in the Almonry - I went and found the prisoner there in bed, he had nothing; the woman gave me a bundle containing two coats, and in consequence of what she said, I asked the prisoner where he got the coats, he said he brought them from his lodgings, in St. Martin's-lane, and that he was a corn-chandler. I took him to the watch-house with the bundle; the prosecutor came and claimed it.</p>

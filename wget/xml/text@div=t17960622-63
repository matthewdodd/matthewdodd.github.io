               <p>Q. How did these people work the press, I understand there should be three? - A. There should be one to feed the press, and two to pull, but two might work the press, only it would be more tedious.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any candle in the cellar, or appearance that any body had been at work? - A. None; there was a flap would lift up and let light enough in without a candle; there were drops of candle on the press, and it was warm as if it had been recently worked.</p>

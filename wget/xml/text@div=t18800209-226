                  </hi>. I am cellarman at 89, Bishopsgate Street—on Saturday, 3rd January, between 6 and 7 p.m., I was walking up Holborn with my hands in my coat pockets, and saw the prisoner and another man, who put his foot out and tripped me up—I fell, and he immediately snatched my watch from my waistcoat pocket, leaving the chain hanging—the prisoner came up and said, "You are hurt, old man," and began to lift me up, and when I was nearly in an upright position he gave me a blow in the stomach, snatched my chain, and ran down Newton Street—I followed him to the bottom, and lost sight of him—I went to Bow Street, got a detective, went home and changed my clothes—we then went to different places, and at last to the Princess Louise, in Holborn, between 7 and 8 o'clock, where I saw the prisoner among 20 or 30 others, and gave him in custody—I am sure he is the man; a lamp shone on his face—I was perfectly sober.</p>

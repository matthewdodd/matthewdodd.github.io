               <p>Do you know any of them at all? - Only one that first came up to me, and looked me in the face for a good while; that was the prisoner Burne.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No, I knew none of them before.</p>
               <p>How long had he hold of you and the coat? - About five minutes, I believe he was standing looking at me; he laid hold of the coat, and kept looking at me.</p>
               <p>Could you see his face? - Yes, I looked in his face, when he looked in mine; there was a lamp at the corner of the back lane.</p>
               <p>Did he threaten you at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he snatch the coat? - He laid hold of the coat, and called the other; I asked them what they wanted with it; they did not tell me; I struggled to keep it under my arm.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner; when did you see the man again afterwards; I saw him at Justice Wilmot's on Wednesday after; this was on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sure it was the same man? - The same man.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not you alarmed and frightened? - I was frightened; but he looked in my face, and I looked in his face, and I thought he was going to rob me of it.</p>
               <p>What did you think he was going to do? I did not know what; I looked in his face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time I was apprehended for the robbery, I was brought before Mr. Justice Wilmot; I was brought into a room by myself, and four officers had this lad to see me, to swear to me; they gave him descriptions who it was, and what sort of a person I was, before the lad had seen me; they brought him into a room where I was sitting in a chair; they asked the lad if he knew me, and was not that the person; he said yes; had I been with any body else, the boy would not have known me from any body else.</p>
               <p>Drewitt. There were two more prisoners in the room at the time I saw him; they asked me, if I knew the man, if I saw him; I said yes.</p>
               <p>Did any of the officers of justice that took you into that room, point to that man and say, is that the man that robbed you? - No, Sir, they never put up their hand; there were three men in the room, and they asked me which was the man that robbed me, and I pointed to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of December I saw Drewitt just at the bottom of Church-lane; it was Saturday night about half after eleven, I heard some person cry out. murder, thieves, two or three times; I took no particular notice, directly after that, there was a violent blow which I heard, and the people in the next shop heard it; with that I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090017"></xptr>four or five go past my door, as hard as they could run; I went directly out and found the boy in the dirt; I went with him to his master, knowing where he lived; the prisoner was one of the men that run by, there were others with him, I knew him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The officers have told him to swear so, and therefore he swears to me; whether I am the person or no, makes no great difference to him.</p>
               <p>Lowe. I know him perfectly well, I have known him these three years.</p>
               <p>Did you see that man pass your door? - I did.</p>
               <p>On your oath, are you sure that Burne was one that ran past your door? - Burne was one, and moreover than that, he went by the name of Captain.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to see him? - I had three or four candles, and I had a lamp that gave three lights, and there was a shop on the right hand side, and another on the left with lights; it struck a very great light into the street, and the street is not very wide, it was a very wet dirty night; I heard the report of the blow as plain as you hear me speak; I went out then directly; before I heard the blow, I thought it was amongst themselves, it is frequently done.</p>

               <p>How far was this blow from your house? - About twelve or fourteen yards where the boy was knocked down.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday last, the eighteenth day of December last, I received information against the prisoner and three others; coming through Petticoat-lane, I in company with other officers, met four men, the prisoner and three others; as soon as they got past us, we turned our heads, and they all set off running; one of the officers and myself took one of them; we took him to the watch-house; I went home, I think it was about ten at night, or between ten and eleven; we received a further information of the prisoner and another that had gone to a lodging in Frying-pan-alley, Petticoat-lane; we went there, and in a two-pair of stairs room, we went and knocked at the door, and they said they would not open the door; we told them we were officers belonging to Justice Wilmot, and should break the door open; accordingly the man that belonged to the room opened the door; we went into the room; there was another man that is discharged undressing himself; we could see nothing of the prisoner; but we looked under the bed, and between the sacking and the floor we found the prisoner and secured him, and took him to the watch-house; he there said, if he had not been afraid of being shot, he would have jumped out of the window; when we were before the magistrate upon examination, there was a dispute about what parish the robbery had been committed in, and the prisoner then said that it was done in Whitechapel parish; and the two men that were in custody that night with him were innocent; they knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why you certainly cannot be on your oath that I made mention of them words? - I am on my oath, and there are more people to prove it; they were all three committed for further examination; when he was brought up for further examination, he begged his companions to take warning by him, as they saw the situation he had brought himself into; I heard him; this was before the magistrate, it was not taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Court to Lowe. I think you told me you had known Burne very near three years? - Very near three years, I know him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Did you inform any Justice of Peace or any body that Burne was one of the men? - I informed Mr. Dawson at the time, as soon as I could speak to him, not on the Saturday night; but as soon as I could after.</p>
               <p>Court to Drewitt. What was you knocked down with? - With a stick.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090018"></xptr>Jury. Where did it strike you? - On the head.</p>
               <p>Did it cut your head? - It did not cut it, it raised a lump on my head.</p>
               <p>Lowe. He had a lump on his head when I came up.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have not a friend in the world; I was in this room when Dawson and another man came up; a woman that I had connection with had a warrant against me, this man and two more brought in the boy into a room where I was sitting; when they brought me before Justice Wilmot, they asked the boy if I was the person that robbed him; and he said yes.</p>
               <p>Williams. With submission to the Court. and the gentlemen in general, if the oath I have sworn is not sufficient, I will be sworn again; I did not let these men have any intercourse with the boy at all, I kept him at my back, I never suffered them to speak to him once; I said tell the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court to Dawson. Was the boy carried into the room to look at the prisoner? - No, my Lord; there were five prisoners in the room, and Burne was in the middle; I came out of the room, and desired Mr. Williams to take the boy in himself, which he did.</p>
               <p>Did you describe the prisoner to the boy at all? - No, my Lord, not at all.</p>
               <p>Did you say when he went in, is that the man that robbed you? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. Did you point out the prisoner at the bar to the boy, when you went into the room, and ask him if that was the man that robbed him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you describe the prisoner at the bar as the man that robbed him? - God forbid I should do any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any body else besides the prisoner in the room? - There was the prisoner and several other people; now, says I to the boy, as soon as we got into the room, if you find any of the people that insulted you, point to him; the boy went in and pointed out the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Shakeshaft. Did you, when the boy went in the room, point out the prisoner as the person that robbed him? - I did not; there were several prisoners in the room, all standing together, and the boy looked at them, and looked all round the room, and said this is the man that robbed me; I did not point him out to the boy in any way whatever, upon my oath: there were three prisoners in the other room that were ironed, and the boy went and looked at them; there were three prisoners in this room; I never spoke to the boy about the man, nor described him, nor touched him in no way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I going to die, I would say with my last breath, that that man Shakeshaft asked the boy if I did not rob him? - I did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Jury to Lowe. When these three or four people were past the butcher's door, did you see any thing under their arms? - No, nothing that I could discern in their hands, any further than sticks, I could not discern every thing, I see them go past to and fro' two or three times in the evening; they run as hard as they could in the horse-road, Burne was one that came past my window.</p>

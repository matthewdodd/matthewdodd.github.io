            . I am a cordwainer, I live at No. 4, John's court; I was at work on the 16th of March, I heard the alarm of fire about twelve o'clock in the day, I went down stairs immediately, I found a great smoke in the passage of No. 3, I found the door fast, I endeavoured to open the door, I could not; then I tried the windows, I found them all fast; so I forced the door open; on my entrance there was smoke all round so that I could not see; my wife brought the first pail of water, and the other women assisted to bring water; we got the flame under. After the flame was extinguished I looked at the fire place, the grate had some coals, paper, and other things in it, that had not been lighted that day; it excited suspicion in me that it could not come by accident; I requested a candle, because in the part where the fire originated it was dark, it was where a bed had stood, but the bed being away the combustibles were all together; when I got a candle, I saw there were some lighted wood, a large book and some paper that had taken fire, and part of a birch broom, and two or three pound of pitch were all lighted by the flame. It had taken to that part of the partition that is over the stair-case, and the partition of the first floor it had burned; that part of the partition where these things lay we knocked out with our feet, it was on flame; had it been burned through it would not have been in my power to have got it out. There was a small cask that had held white lead or white paint, there was an hamper that had a large oil flask, a large oil glass bottle, it was contained in an hamper; there was some gunpowder and shot at the fire place; there was some shot, I believe, I did not inspect much into it, being away from where the fire was. After we had extinguished the fire a driver belonging to a fire engine came in and looked at it, and others came in; I thought it must be done on purpose; and this person in court, came in; I desired them not to touch it. One of the firemen, in court, had the inspection of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What fire office took this man up - A. The Eagle fire office; Mr. Beetham is the solicitor of the Eagle fire office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. At this place where the fire was, was there not a hole so that a man might put his hand or a candle there - A. No, there was no hole there till we kicked it out.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18090412-56-person569">Q. </persName>
            Were there not two fires in this house, before this happened - A. I do not know that there were two fires in this house; there was a child that set her clothes on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not see any such a place in which a man might have put his hand - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that a person without could not remove the boards and so have put his hand in and set a light there - A. I do not conceive that any man or child could.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in this court - A. Six years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this poor man lived there - A. I do not know that ever I saw him above three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some property of that poor man's found in the room - A. There was some little property found in the room; a bird cage, a grate, and a flap of a table.</p>
               <p>Q. Then certainly if the house had been burned down the property must have been gone - how long after the fire had been discovered was it that the poor man came home - A. At dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. His brother was sent to, was not he - A. A woman went to his brother's to enquire after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that as soon as the woman went to his brother's, the man came - A. I cannot say what past from twelve o'clock till night. The man came in the court that night, I took upon myself that night to lay hold of him; he came about eight hours after the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he come and remain, did he ever abscond - A. No, he could not abscond; as soon as he came I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Some property was found in this room after the man came home - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the property - A. There was a bird cage, an old mop, this cask of colour, a jar, the grate and the flap of the table; there was only one parlour below stairs.</p>
               <p>- EDWARDS. I live in John's-court, No. 6, I was up in my room in the morning till near twelve o'clock; I heard the alarm with the women and children; I immediately went down stairs; just round the corner I saw the women and children at the door; I entered the door, Mr. Harrison was endeavouring to break open the parlour door; I came before the parlour door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he break it open - A. With our strength, I had nothing in my hands; after we broke the door I saw on my going in the room, at the right hand, that it was on fire. Then by the assistance of the women and the water I endeavoured to put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there much flame - A. Not much at that time, but it would have been in a few minutes; it was on fire, but not much blaze; I went to that part which I perceived most in danger, which was over the stairs leading to the kitchen, and broke in the pannel; I returned into the room again, and exerted my power in throwing the water to all parts that were in danger.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120043"></xptr>We put it out with water.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in what state did you find the room when it was out - A. I then looked to see how the fire could happen; I perceived there had been no fire in the stove apparently that day; I looked round the room, I perceived a small piece of candle and a flask, which contained some oil; these were placed by the combustibles, which were some pieces of paper, bits of wood, and pitch; on the top of that there were some bits of birch broom; I said to Mr. Harrison and another gentleman, that this candle had been placed there to keep the flames in; and there stood a keg there, which I think was placed there to throw the heat among the combustibles.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the keg - A. It appeared to be white paint, or white-wash; I cannot say what it was, it was one or the other; I did not take particular notice. I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge till I saw him at Marlborough-street office.</p>

             M'KENNELL. I am clerk to a banker; I was called in by the parties that had put out the fire to look at it, and there I saw the remains of a large writing book, which had been partly burnt, and on the top of that there was about two pounds of pitch, or better, I cannot exactly say, with some few ends of short sticks, an oil bladder, and part of a birch broom; there was nothing in the oil bladder at the time I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could this have been put into that room on the outside - A. No, not without forcing part of it in; on the mantle-piece over the fire place was a packet of gunpowder and some shot, and the fire place was laid ready to kindle, but never had been kindled for that day; the stove was drawn out of the situation of the place it had stood in; I do not think there had been any fire in it from the time it had been drawn out.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were there in the room - A. kind of a table, a bird cage, an old chair, and this stove; no other furniture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have told us there was some powder that was on the mantle piece - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you came there - A. I believe a quarter after twelve o'clock; I saw the wainscot burned of the stair-case, I saw some pitch and some tar close to where the wainscot had been on fire; I went to see that the people were safe in the one pair of stairs room; when I found they were all perfectly safe I went away. About four or five foot square of the wainscot was burned each way, the wainscoting that parts the parlour from the kitchen stair-case.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, John's-court. On the 16th of March I saw Mr. Ward go down the court, about a quarter after eleven, with a small bottle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. They call him a painter, I do not know any thing of the man, I know no more than seeing the room on fire, and bringing several pails of water to extinguish the fire; I saw the wainscot burning and the room all of a smoke; I live in the second floor, next door to the house that was burning. On the evening of the same day he came to the end of the court, he asked me whether I had heard any thing of a fire, I told him I had, I supposed that he had, it happened in his apartment; I said he knew something of it; he said he knew nothing about it. I told him there was a person that wanted to speak to him; then he stopped. I saw Mr. Harrison coming down the court, I called to him; Mr. Harrison was not above two yards from him; he came and took him immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You said you supposed that he knew something about it, you meaned to insinuate that he did the thing - you thought so then and do now, do not you - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he knew nothing of it, meaning that he did not do it, when you said to him that he knew something about it - all I wish you to tell me is this, whether you did not mean by that expression that he had done the deed - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. His answer was, that he knew nothing about it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time of the day was it when you saw him - A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The court is a poor wretched place - A. No, not wretched, the houses are inhabited by poor hard working people, and no other person insured but the ground landlord, Mr. Hobbs.</p>
               <p>COURT, to Macdine. You and your wife live at No. 3, you live in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else lives in the house besides you - A. There is a lodger in the house, he is a broker; I cannot tell you the name; I occupy the first floor, the broker lives over me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day this gentleman has mentioned, I was taken in custody, I had been out; I returned to my brother; my brother told me the house had been set on fire; I said to him, go down with me; he said he had been down; I said if he would not go with me I would go myself. When I got to the court eight or ten people caught hold of me, one of them said put him in the parlour and set a light to it; I catched cold there, that is the reason I slept away from the place, because it was damp. As I went up the court I did not see any of the house burned. Respecting the gunpowder, I had it about three weeks or a month in paper on the mantle piece; I took it from my brother; and respecting the house being set on fire, I know nothing of it; and with respect to the combustibles, the greater part was straw, it was all swept up together.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. What are you - A. I am a painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. That unfortunate man I believe is your brother - did he work for you - A. When he applied for work I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard about furniture being removed from this wretched lodging that he had - A. Yes; about the worth of two pounds was all the furniture that he had in the world; and what was left in the lodging was worth about twenty-five or twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation of life has he been in before - A. He was a tallow-chandler.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a man of property lately - he has been under the necessity of living by labour - A. I have given him work.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of the articles left in the apartment - A. There was a fire stove worth a guinea, a carboil worth six or seven shillings, and there was an old chair and white lead barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard about some gunpowder - A. About Christmas he was shooting with me and one of my men, being bad weather we could not work; he took the gun and powder home; the shot and powder were altogether, which I saw on the mantle shelf in paper; it had not been taken away then; I am sure it is the same that he had; there was about two or three ounces.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a housekeeper - A. I have been a housekeeper seven years back; a master painter and glazier; sometimes I have seven men, sometimes ten, and sometimes fifteen.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the time of the fire - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known any other fire there before the prisoner came there - A. Yes; I was once there myself when a fire broke out, and the house was in danger of being burned; then there was another fire there; the first fire was eight years ago; the other I cannot say how long that was.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a carpenter - do you know what situation the wainscot of the stair case was in, and of the room, where this poor man had the furniture - A. I do. There was a window on the stair case without a sash or shutter, only some rough boards across it; between these rough boards there was a vacancy that a man's finger, or a child's hand might go in.</p>
               <p>Q. That communicated to where this fire happened - A. It was right over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any time repaired it - A. Yes; the last repair I did was last Christmas: I mended the floor and ceiling where it was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had an opportunity of seeing, that any body might put a candle or a match in there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. If so the prisoner might have done it.</p>

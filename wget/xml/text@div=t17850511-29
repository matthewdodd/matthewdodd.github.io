             sworn.</p>
               <p>What passed when you bought this parcel of lead, who was present? - Collins and Baptist, and I think Paul was present; I believe Paul brought it, nothing particular passed, but weighing the lead, and paying for it, I paid about twelve or fifteen shillings.</p>

               <p>What weight had you? - I do not recollect, it was all at a penny a pound, it was exceedingly old, and perished throughout.</p>
               <p>What kind of lead was it? - It had the appearance of old decayed sheet lead, it was in small pieces, beat up, I sold it again without rolling it out.</p>
               <p>Did you hear from either Baptist or Paul or from Collins, in the presence of either of them, where this lead came from? - No, Sir, that I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it very odd where this lead came from? - It was very dirty and very old, it was dry to be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. How can you carry this matter any further.</p>

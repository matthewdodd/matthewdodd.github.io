               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What rent did you owe? A. 4l. 3s. - I think the goods might have fetched about 1l. more if they had been well sold; I had seen the prisoner before - he had been there twice for money; he did not say that if I would pay 2s. 6d. a day for the man in possession, the goods should be left there till the time for selling them; or that they would be impounded at his residence to save further expence - he said they would not fetch the money, and he would impound them at his house- they were not new goods; I had had one bed about two years, but had not weighed it - when I spoke of 10lbs. of feathers being taken out, it was a mere guess; the prisoner might have sold all the goods if he had chosen.</p>

            . I had the distress in my rooms - the prisoner was the officer; I should think the whole of my goods were worth 20l. to me, but if sold, perhaps they would not fetch above 7l. or 8l.; they were all sold but the articles here produced, which I found at the prisoner's- they were not concealed; these articles were not down in the inventory.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not give himself up? A. Yes - I called on him the evening before, and he asked if I would take any thing; I did - he had an opportunity of making away with these things; they were at his place for two days - I do not know what the expences would have come to, but the goods he sold amounted to 2l. 5s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would all the goods that were taken have paid the entire rent and expences? A. Yes, they would; I do not know what the expences were - I had not the bill of them; I am 2l. 1s. 6d. in my landlord's debt now - I did see some feathers about the room, and the bed had been cut open; I had not known the prisoner before - I did not know that he had been and dunned my wife.</p>

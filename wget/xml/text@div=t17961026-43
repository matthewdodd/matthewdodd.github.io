               <p>Q. When you found these different things, did you carry them to your own house? - A. Yes; and I have kept them never since, (produces the lawn handkerchief); this is what she gave me out of her pocket, it is marked E.W. I know it to be mine from that mark; this was taken out of the green box.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of some things at an old clothes-shop, where was that? - A. In Oxford-road; I don't know their names; the prisoner went with me to get them; there was a child's frock and a petticoat, a pair of breeches, and three child's clouts; there were other things carried there, but the woman had sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. These were produced by the prisoner's direction? - A. Yes, at the shop in Davies's-street; I don't know their names; I found five neckcloths and one stock with the ends off; the prisoner went with me; there was one of the pieces of the neckcloths found in the bed-room where she had slept at my house, and that was the way I found it was her that had got them.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you said any thing to induce her to confess? - A. No, I did not; she wanted to lay them upon my servant that had left me; when she was found, her sister, Mrs. Smith, found her, she told me she would tell me all about it if I would not make any noise in the street; she said Rachael knew as much about them as she did; then afterwards she said, she did not do any such thing; she acknowledged she had sold fourteen or fifteen neck-cloths at one place.</p>

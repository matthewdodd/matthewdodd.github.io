               <p>Mr. Sylvester of Council for the Prosecution thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen; I did not think it right to mention this indictment, in the beginning of the former trial, because though I wish justice always to take place between the crown and the prisoner, I for one will never endeavour to prejudice the minds of the Jury; for which reason cautiously did I avoid it, nor did I suggest the least hint whatever of this offence, I wished that trial to turn on that simple fact of the shillings; the question now is, Whether the offence mentioned in this indictment, which has now been read to you, is, or is not compleat? because -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg Mrs. Levy may go out of Court while Mr. Sylvester is stating this.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250180"></xptr>Mr. Sylvester. The character that has been given of the witness, Mrs. Levy, I believe she does not deserve; the way to affect witnesses, is to call people to impeach their testimony; you will judge what credit is due to her testimony, and whether it remains unimpeached. The story of this indictment she has pretty nearly told you on her cross-examination; as well as the former; that on the 29th of January the prisoner came to her, and wanted her husband to get some customer to buy counterfeit money; that one particular half guinea was left for some days, and that at last it was bought, and eight shillings and sixpence was paid for this half guinea; the husband going with this half guinea, and tendering it in payment as a good half guinea, because otherwise, in my opinion, it is no offence, the tradesman said, how did you come by this; then it was discovered that it came by this man, the prisoner; he had been traced by the officers of justice backwards and forwards to Levy's house; they watched him and took him into custody, and found a large quantity of counterfeit money upon him; in this case, the money was actually paid for the half guinea, therefore the offence was perfectly compleat, and if so, you must find the prisoner guilty. If on the other hand, the evidence should not be sufficient to reach him, or he has a clear defence to this accusation, I, for one, shall rejoice in his acquittal; and as to the Mint, although they think it their duty to stand forth to prosecute every offender, and to protect the public, they have no wish or inclination on either side of the question.</p>

               <p>The 29th of January was the first time the prisoner came to my house; he asked me if my husband was at home, that was this day five weeks, I cannot rightly tell the day of the month, I told him my husband was not at home, and I asked him his business, than he shewed me half a guinea to buy it.</p>
               <p>Court. He asked you to buy it, did he? - Yes, Sir, I told him it was a bad half guinea, and he said it was; I asked him then what he asked for it; he said, eight shillings and sixpence; I told him, I thought eight shillings and sixpence for a bad half guinea was a great deal of money, and I told him I could not say any thing to it, I would shew it to my husband, and he would call again, for being Saturday, I could not pay him</p>
               <p>Court. What it was your sabbath, was it? Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>So your conscience would not let you pay for it that day? - No, Sir; he called again on the Monday following, and I told him I did not much like to have any thing to do with it; then he over persuaded me, and said there was two shillings that I might get by half a guinea, and I bought it of him, and gave him eight shillings and sixpence for it.</p>
               <p>Court. And you actually bought it? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>And did you pay for it? - Yes, Sir, I paid him eight shillings and sixpence for it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner you dealt with? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you known any thing of him before? - I had seen him several times before.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any dealings with him before? - Once, a good while back.</p>
               <p>And only in that instance? - Only in that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. When did you see him after that? - I saw him on the Thursday following, he called and had nothing with him, and he called on Friday, as I have said; I am sure of the man, I do not come here for gain or interest; I gave the half guinea to my husband in his pocket on the Thursday, as he called on the Friday.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is your husband here? - No, he had no call to be here.</p>
               <p>Now, the first time that he came to you, you say, that he left the half guinea with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not then bargain for it? - I was only to keep it and shew it, I was afraid to look at it almost, for I did not like the thoughts of bad money, and I know the consequence of people being brought into trouble.</p>
               <p>I think you said you had once before dealt in bad money? - Yes, once with him, but never with any body else, I had bought half a guinea worth of silver of him, and if he had not come to me, I should not have gone to him.</p>
               <p>And so this half guinea shocked you, and frightened you so, that you was afraid to look at it? - I never mentioned any thing of shocked.</p>
               <p>Well, frightened? - No.</p>
               <p>Afraid then? - It was very pretty.</p>
               <p>At last you gave it to your husband? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of it after you gave it to your husband, you do not know of your knowledge? - He laid it out.</p>
               <p>Why will not you tell me that you know nothing at all about it? - I do, Sir.</p>
               <p>Your conscience would not let you pay for it on the Saturday? - No.</p>
               <p>Then your conscience is of this sort, it will let you make an iniquitous bargain of a Saturday? - I did not make any bargain of a Saturday, I bargained and paid for it on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the pawnbroker's? - No, I had as much about me.</p>
               <p>Your husband gave you information that he was in trouble about this half guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was taken up for uttering that half guinea, and gave bail? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was he in custody? - A week.</p>
               <p>Did the Solicitor of the Mint consent to his being discharged? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where was he bailed? - Before them that committed him, somebody up in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Sylvester.</p>
               <p>You have been employed for the Mint about fifteen or sixteen years past? - A good many.</p>
               <p>You went to Levy's house? - I did on Friday the 6th, the very day that I was taken ill; I went into the one pair of stairs, there I saw the prisoner at the bar, and Mrs. Levy, sitting at a table by the fire, and upon the table there lay three nine and twenty shillings worth of silver, in three parcels of silver, I counted them, and in each parcel there were twenty-nine shillings; I desired Jealous to search the prisoner in my presence; he did so, and in his pocket he found a canvass bag, and I think there was twelve or thirteen pounds, besides the three parcels that were found on the table; (the three parcels shewn him) I think there were four counterfeit half guineas, and six shillings which are in the hands of Mr. Jealous.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Have you compared the shillings in the parcels and in the bag with those in his pocket?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will your Lordship try any question about the shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250184"></xptr>Mr. Justice Gould. This is only a circumstance to denote that this man dealt in bad money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is evidence about his character.</p>

            . Have you any monier of the Mint, to shew that this was bad money? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Clarke. You took the prisoner and Mrs.

             both into custody? - Yes, I did at first.</p>
               <p>She was a good deal frightened and alarmed at your coming into the room? - I do not suppose she was so much frightened as what you may imagine; the fact is this, after her husband was taken into custody, it was thought necessary to get at the branch and at the root of it, and the woman herself said, she would give up the person whom she had the half guinea of.</p>
               <p>In order to save her husband? - No, Sir, no such thing; he is under process at this time, to appear at Westminster sessions.</p>
               <p>I would ask you, if I may be permitted, whether you do not, upon your oath, believe that that woman expects her husband will be discharged in consequence of the prisoner's conviction?</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Though that affects her credit, it does not affect her competency.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am as well contented that it should go to her credit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Clarke. You have seen all the half guineas? - All but that of Mr. Lestley's, which I never had in my hands.</p>
               <p>Be so good to compare them.</p>
               <p>(Clarke looks at the half guinea and the others.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If the half guinea which is now produced to you by that gentleman, had been produced to you by any body else, could you have distinguished it from a good half guinea? - Not a doubt of it, if it had been out of my possession for seven years.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish that one from the others that are produced to you? - No, I do not say that.</p>
               <p>They are so much alike, that though you could distinguish them from good half guineas, you could not distinguish them from these? - It is too much for me to swear it, I would not swear it.</p>
               <p>I dare say you would not.</p>

               <p>I am a monier of the Mint; this is counterfeit, and the others also.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that they are bad? - By the milling.</p>
               <p>Is there any gold in it? - It is impossible to distinguish that, without an assay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke. Whoever made one made the other; I should not like to give above sixpence; in short, they are worth nothing; I should not suppose there is any gold in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Franklin. You have said it is impossible to ascertain, without an assay, how much gold there is in this half guinea? - Yes; one of the reasons that I think it is bad is, that the milling is very badly executed.</p>
               <p>Might not a good half guinea be so clipped, and afterwards milled by an inexpert hand, as to produce that sort of milling that is now on this half guinea? - It might be so done.</p>
               <p>Court. Does it appear that this half guinea has been clipped? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you tell that by your eye? - Yes, I speak from the whole, but the milling is what I know by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke. You will find that the very outlines of the die is upon the money, therefore when it comes to be milled, or taken off, it must reduce it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, admitting the whole of Mrs. Levy's evidence to be true, for the sake of argument, I humbly submit that there is no evidence, that this half guinea was the half guinea that Levy uttered, because Levy is not produced.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to Mr. Levy's to see him; I knew him some time; he said he would help me to some employ; he was out of town, and I called again the next day, and she bid me stop a bit, and she began telling this money over; I had no time to say any thing to her, she had them in the room when I went in; she said here is somebody coming up; says she, put that bag in your pocket, and she had some shillings that she was looking at, and there was somebody coming up stairs, it was these gentlemen; says she, here is somebody coming up stairs, and, says she, put them in your pocket; I put the silver in my coat pocket, and the half guineas and shillings I put in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you say as to offering the half guinea to her? - I never saw that, I know nothing of it; there were four on the table, that was all that I saw.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This is a case that comes directly within the act of parliament; this depends intirely on the credit you give to Mrs. Levy's testimony: as to the want of the evidence of Levy being produced, that does not, in my apprehension, make any great difference in this case; because, if the prisoner offered to sell any counterfeit money, he has been guilty of the offence which is within the act of parliament; it seems to me, that if any half guinea is now produced to you in evidence, which was uttered by the prisoner at the bar at a less price, it is sufficient.</p>

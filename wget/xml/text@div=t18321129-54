About a month ago, on a Saturday, I left my snuff-box on the dining-room mantle-piece at nine o'clock, and it was missed at twelve, by the servant - the end of my dining-room looks into the garden, and the side of it into the road; on coming home in the afternoon, I observed footmarks at both ends of the room, and marks which proved somebody must have got into the dining-room through the window - mine is the last house towards Crouch-end, on the right-hand side; a person coming over the fields could get into my garden - I think the footmarks were too small to be the prisoner's; they were evidently the footmarks of a boy; the box was presented to me - I understand ten guineas were given for it, but a jeweller fixed the value at the least, at five guineas.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner came to my shop on Saturday, the 20th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, and laid on the counter a very handsome silver snuff-box, requesting to knw what it was, and what it was worth; I asked him who it belonged to - he said it belonged to the mate of an East Indiaman; I asked how the mate came by it - he said the mate's father left it him; I asked him where the mate lived - he said down at the east-end of the town, and if I disputed his word, he would leave the box, and go and fetch him - I said he must not go away till he had given some better account of it, and said it was very strange that he came from the east to the west, as there were so many shops between, and I did not believe his account - I came round the counter to look for a Policeman; I looked out at the door, but could not see one, and while my back was turned, the prisoner rushed by me out at the door, and run away; I followed, and overtook him about fifty yards off - we had rather a violent struggle, and at last got him back to my shop; I am sure the box is worth more than five guineas - I would give that for it myself, as a second-hand box.</p>

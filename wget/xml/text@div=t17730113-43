I missed the playing cards about the middle of December; as to the other goods I did not miss them till I made the discovery of them. About the end of November I found a broken key in the till, my suspicion fixed on the prisoner, my <rs id="t17730113-43-deflabel250" type="occupation">maid servant</rs>

Mrs. Brown informed me she had found something in her box, and brought down the playing cards: she was desired to go up and replace them in her box. I went up and searched her box then, and found two packs of playing cards and the napkin and stockings; (the napkin and stockings produced and deposed to.) She said, on the playing cards being produced, that as young man who lives at a stationer's, the corner of Camomile-street, gave them to her. I charged her with taking them; then she said a gipsey woman came to the family, and that she gave her some cards to tell her fortune. Mr. Sturgion said, your master's mark is upon them, and that will not be believed, then she said she had taken them, and hoped I would be merciful; I said that depended upon her conduct. She went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130020"></xptr> home to her mother's, and I paid her her wages. After that my wife missed a pair of stays: then Mr. Sturgeon and I went to her mother's, and charged her with having the stays; at first she denied it, and made many protellations; after some time she confessed she had them, and said she would send them back. I asked her how she came to do it; she replied she believed the devil was got in her. The stays were sent back by somebody that day.</p>
               <p>- Sturgion. I was desired by Mr. Brown to come into his house on an apprehension of Oliver's dishonestly; I charged Oliver with having taken the cards, and she told a story of having taken some other cards. He confirmed Brown's evidence respecting the stays.</p>

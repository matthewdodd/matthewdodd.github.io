                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, in partnership with Mr. Charles Preston, at 16, Water-lane, Great Tower-street—Mr. Preston does not live in London—the prisoner was in our service as managing clerk, at a salary of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—on 13th June I had some letters of administration to take out, and I gave him two Post-office orders, which I had received from the country, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, desiring him to pay the duty and get the grant of administration—this was in the presence of another clerk—I gave the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and the other clerk gave him, I think, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge, I afterwards referred to the prisoner's books—I have his petty cash disbursement book here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—on 13th June, I find an entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as paid for stamping bond, and 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid for the grant, Court fees 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., affidavit 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and receipt 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on 24th June, there is an entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stamping bond—these entries are in the prisoner's writing; he balanced every week—I have not got the papers here, I have since passed them—on 1st or 2d August, finding the money had not been paid, I spoke to the pri<lb></lb>soner—I accused him of not having paid the money—I cannot recollect the words I used—I called his attention to these sums, as not being paid at the time—he made some evasive reply; I cannot recollect what it was; he then left the office, and I never saw him afterwards till he was in custody—I then received a letter from him—this is it—it is in his writing (<hi rend="italic">This letter bore no date.; it asserted that he had committed no fraud, that he had lost the money, and implored the prosecutor, for the sake of his wife, not to proceed against him</hi>)—this other letter is also in the prisoner's writing—it is addressed to</p>

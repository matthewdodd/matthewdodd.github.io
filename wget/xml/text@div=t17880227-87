               <p>On the 3d of December, about twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner and another coming down Holborn; I went home with them; the prisoner and I went to bed; the other asked me to take her into bed to us, which I did; about a minute afterwards, I heard the ticking of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270092"></xptr>the watch going over my ear, from the other woman to the prisoner; I had laid my breeches on the bed, and my watch under the bolster; I got up, and told them they had robbed me; the prisoner jumped up, and said, she would light a candle; I thought she was going off with my watch, and I pursued her; she was in her shift, and I in my shirt; I went a lamp or two off, and saw the watch hanging in her hand; I turned back, and took the other to the watch-house, but the property not being found upon her, she was discharged; about three weeks or a month after, I found the prisoner; she said, she did not know me; I sent for a constable and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the same person? - Yes; I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I had only drank a part of two pots of beer that night; I was in liquor when I went with them.</p>

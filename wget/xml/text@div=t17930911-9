On the 13th of July last I heard my maid halloo out, O Lord! we are robbed, we are robbed; stop thief! stop that man, I immediately ran out into the road, and I saw the prisoner running according to the description given, and I hallooed out, stop thief; stop that man with the blue coat! He was stopped with the property on him; it was the prisoner, I was present when he was searched; I have the property myself here; I locked them up in my own bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them the last time before they were stole? - I cannot recollect; they were kept in my china closet, in the front parlour; we seldom use them unles we have company; we have common things besides; the key was in the china closet; the cream jug has a cypher three letters, F. R. S. I had the things weighed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110014"></xptr>day they were taken from him, they came to three pounds two shillings, at five shillings per ounce.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to the prosecutor; I was sweeping the kitchen stairs down, my mistress sent me up for a little brandy, because my young mistress was not well; just as I was going in I met this man, the prisoner was coming out of the parlour door, I asked him what he wanted? I was a stranger to him, I never saw him before; he made no answer, he walked out of the passage, and out by the stones; and I cried out stop thief! not knowing the man had taken any thing; after he had turned and shut the gate after him, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was walking, and I heard the alarm of stop thief! and I saw two men running along, and I saw two men chuck these silver spoons and the things into a passage, and I immediately took them up, and thought proper to alarm the people that were the owners of them, but was prevented; I was attacked by two or three people, and they told me that I was the person that stole them.</p>

On the 6th of April I was out with a heavy load, between twelve and one o'clock; I went into a public-house to get a pint of beer - I was then going home to my rest, and met these two females, who asked me to stand some gin; I told them to go home - Tomkin then put her arms round my neck, and Wilson took my money; I called the officer and gave them into custody - I lost a shilling, two sixpences, one penny, and one halfpenny.</p>

               <p>JOHN MURRAY (Police-constable K 178). The prosecutor charged these women with taking his money - it was about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, in the <placeName id="t18330411-133-crimeloc742">New-road, St. George's</placeName>

               <p>DANIEL ENGLISH (Police-constable K 248). On the morning when the prisoners were brought to the station, Tomkin gave me a shilling while the other was being searched - she told me to get something to drink in the morning.</p>
               <p>Tomkin. I gave him that, as he has had many more- every time he met me he asked me to give him something to drink - he received 10s. a short time ago for hiding a fault.</p>

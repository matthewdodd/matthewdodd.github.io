                  </hi>. I am a groom in a gentleman's family—I have been used to horses for the last seven years or over—on the evening of 15th January, I was with my sister in the Lorimore-road, Walworth, which leads from the Royal-road into the main Walworth-road—I saw a hearse, with a coach attached to it behind, standing at the Canterbury Arms, next to an undertaker's shop in the Royal-road, for about twenty minutes—I then saw it start off at a tremendous pace, I should fancy at the rate of between fifteen and sixteen miles an hour—it came up the Lorimore-road towards the Walworth-road on the right-hand side of the way, the off side; it should have been on the near side—there was a man on the box driving—there were two horses abreast—I could not swear to the man—I heard him whipping the horses <hi rend="italic">most terrific;</hi> he gave, them three or more slashes—they passed a few yards from the kerb where I stood—they were going at fifteen or sixteen miles an hour then—the driver made some hallooing or shouting, to the horses as he went by—he struck the horses three or four times with the whip; I heard them smack very loud—after they passed me they ran into a little cart that was coming out of John-street, in an opposite direction—it was partly in John-street and partly in the Lorimore-road when the pole of the hearse ran into it, just coming out of the turning into the Lorimore-road—the horse's head was turned towards the left—I heard the crash, and ran to the spot—I heard a groan, and somebody called out, "Oh, my leg!"—one of the hearse-horses was lying down, and the horse that was in the cart was lying down also; and I saw a man leaning head foremost out of the cart—I went to him and asked what was the matter—he said he could not move—I daresay there were five or six persons then on the spot—I did not see the driver of the hearse when I first ran up—I saw some one down on the ground by the horse's head; I could not say whether that was the driver—the horses were going fast when I first saw them, but after the lashing they went faster; they were being lashed before they got up to me, and the driver continued to lash them afterwards—I assisted in taking the injured man to St. Thomas Hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MONTAGUE WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far were you from the Canterbury Arms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 100 or 120 yards when the horses started, I was walking at a Blow pace backwards and forwards—the horses might have got about forty yards on when they were proceeding at the rate of fifteen or sixteen miles an hour—the Lorimore-road is not very narrow; it is all about the same width—the driver was shouting—I only saw one man on the spot when the accident happened—I should not know him again I was so excited—five or six persons were up before the man was on the ground, when he was in the cart; I believe one of them is here—I did not hear anything said at that time about the pole of the hearse being broke—if the strap which attaches the horse to the pole is broken, it might, probably, cause the horse to bear away from the pole, and it would be necessary to keep it close to the pole with the whip.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>) On the evening of 15th January I was in my shop at the corner of South-street, facing the Lorimore-road—it is just halfway between the Canterbury Arms and where the accident hap<lb></lb>pened, on the left-hand side—I was at the shop-door—I had just done serving a customer—I heard something coming from the direction of the Canterbury Arms, as if it had run away—I ran out and saw the hearse coming along on its wrong side, at a pace, in my judgment (and I have been used to horses all my life), of at least twelve miles an hour—he passed my shop, and just as he got past the driver gave the horses three slashes; it sounded similar to a four-horse coach-whip—he gave it to both horses; I won't be certain whether he hit both, but I distinctly heard the three slashes—they appeared to be given in the direction of the off horse—he was shouting, apparently, like a drunken man—I walked up Richard-terrace towards John-street, and saw a cart coming out of John-street; it was partly to John-street, and partly in Lorimore-road—the pole of the hearse caught the front of the cart, and I believe the pole of the cart caught the man's leg—there was a lamp on the side of the collision from where I was, just the width of the street—it was about a quarter to 6 o'clock—I assisted, with others, in getting the man out of the cart, as the horse was <hi rend="italic">obstreperous</hi>—I saw that it was Mr. Smith's cart—I had never seen the cart or the</p>

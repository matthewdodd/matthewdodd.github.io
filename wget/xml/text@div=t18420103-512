                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, and have a shop in Brunswick-street, Blackwall, and another in High-street, Poplar; I live in Brunswick-street; the prisoner had the management of the shop in High-street, at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and his living. I marked a crown-piece, a half-crown, three shillings, and a sixpence, and gave them to Sydenham, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, with directions to go to my shop in High-street, and purchase a moleskin jacket, two pairs of stockings, and a pair of drawers, which he was to bring to me—he did so—the jacket had my mark on it—I went to the shop about a quarter-past nine, which was the usual time at which I had done so lately—it was the prisoner's business to account to me for the goods sold—he kept a day-book, which I have here—there is no entry of the jacket in it—this is a temporary day-book, which I gave him to make entries in daily, on account of his neglecting the previous one I gave him—I was to copy this out myself every evening—I spoke to the prisoner about his having done more business than be bad entered in the day-book—he said he had done no more than he had entered in the book—I went to the till and found two half-crowns and a shilling of the marked money I had sent by Sydenham—I afterwards saw a marked crown-piece, a half-crown, and a shilling in the hands of Ser<lb></lb>geant Holmes—it was part of the marked money which I had given to Sydenham—the jacket I received from Sydenham was one which belonged to the shop in High-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tagley-street, Commercial-road. The prosecutor gave me a five-shilling piece, three half-crowns, three shillings, and one sixpence, marked money—I had no other money about me—I went to the shop in High-street, Poplar, to purchase three or four articles to the amount of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the first thing I asked for was a moleskin jacket—I tried on three or four, and fixed on one—I then had some stock<lb></lb>ings, and a pair of flannel drawers—I paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I returned to Mr. Hall, and gave him the articles tied in paper, with the change 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I paid the money to the prisoner.</p>

At six o'clock, on the morning of the 24th of July, I missed a mare which had been turned into the field the night before at five or six o'clock - the field is enclosed; we could see where she had been tied to a gate, and had broken it all to pieces in struggling, and broken the gate down, and after that she was taken away, and a horse at the same time - I have seen her since at Queen-square, about a month ago in the possession of Webster; it was the same mare as I lost I am certain - she was in good condition when she was taken away; when I saw her she was in a very bad condition.</p>

             (policeman). In July last I was on duty in Middlesex-mews, Lisson-grove; on a Thursday or Friday morning, the latter end of the month (I cannot say the date,) I saw the prisoner Dawes there; Griffiths is a stable keeper in the mews - it was about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning; Dawes was riding a bay horse or mare into the mews; he said to me,"What do you think of this little thing; I went away from here at twelve o'clock, and have been twenty-seven miles since?" the mare was a small size, the exact size and colour that Mr. Smith had described; she appeared to be very much distressed, and in great heat - he went and knocked at Griffiths' stable-door, the door was opened, and the mare put in, and he went in, and in about four or five minutes there was a black horse driven in in a green chaise-cart - I did not see Griffiths when the mare was put in; I noticed it, but did nothing - the black horse appeared in great distress and great heat; the hair was clotted with dirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Griffiths keeps a livery stable? A. Yes; I knew him before, for about three weeks or a month; I was in my police dress - Dawes could see I was an officer; I never saw him before.</p>

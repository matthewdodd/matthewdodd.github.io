               <p>Bezer Blundell. I was going along Russel street the 3d of October, and the Prisoner came to me, and desired me to go along with her, and treat her: I told her I had but one Halfpenny, but I went with her to one Gerrard's, in <placeName id="t17401015-13-crimeloc69">Windsor-Court, Drury-Lane</placeName>

When she had taken it, she went down Stairs, but none of the People of the House offered to stop her. After I had taken her, and she was in Prison, I went to her to get my Watch, some of her Friends came to me, and said, if I would sign a Note of 10 l. they would tell me where I might find it; this done, they told me it was wrapped up in a Piece of white Paper, in the Cellar. I should not have prosecuted, but that I found afterwards that I was bound in a Recognizance of 40 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came to me, and offered me 5 l. to tell him where it was, and said, I was very like the Woman who took it.</p>
               <p>Blundell. I did tell her, I would not appear against her, if she would tell me where it was: there was no Indecency passed between us, and I had very little Conversation with her, for I had not been with her above five Minutes, before she took my Watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the Man in all my Life, till he came to the Goal, and offered me 5l. to tell him of any Body that had got his Watch; I have had my Friends here these 4 or 5 Days, but they are gone now. <rs id="t17401015-13-verdict70" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon of Lower Richmond Road, Putney—on Saturday night, 10th October, about 10.30 I went to Tidy's house in Gay Street, and saw a boy there about two years old, dead—I found a number of bruises and burns on the body, face and arms, a large bruise over the stomach, a very large bruise over the left lip and round the front of the stomach and all down the left leg and about the private—there were also several boles in the skin, which looked like burns with the point of a poker or something of that sort—there was one small wound about the middle of the back—it was an abrasion through both skins, just over the spine where it was very thin—it appeared to be done by a blunt instrument—the burns were not very large or very deep, but sufficient to destroy the skin—there were about a dozen burns on the whole body and half a dozen bruises, but one or two of them were so large that they reached from the uncle to the hip—I don't think they could have been the effect of one injury—there was a burn on the wrist which looked as if a hot poker had been drawn across it, not with the point—the body was very thin and it cooled down very rapidly after death, which is a sign that it had not been well nourished—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, examination on Thursday the 15th, and found two bruises on the head, one about two inches behind the ear, and the other on the crown of the head, and corresponding</p>

               <p>with place behind the ear I found a large clot of blood about the size of a walnut, inside the brain—the skull was not fractured—it would be hard to fracture a child's skull, because it is elastic, but it does not follow that harm would not be done inside—death arose from concussion of the brain producing that clot of blood—it was the blow behind the ear which caused that—I don't think the blow on the top of the head would have caused it—the stomach was inflamed on its front surface corresponding with the bruise on the skin and part of the large intestines close to it, that inflamation would not cause death by itself, but I think all the wounds together might have caused death sooner or later without the one behind the ear—the intestines were empty, but healthy—he could not have had much food for several days, but such an absence of nutrition would not have caused death—he did not die of mere starvation—the injur behind the ear must have been done with something blunt, because there was no wound on the skin—I think it must have been something harder than a fist—the child might have fallen on that part, but if so he must have fallen against something projecting, such as a boar, bed, or fire-place—it could not have been done against the ground—he must have fallen heavily—I don't think he fell from a height.</p>

I live at Blythe Cottages, Putney, and am the wife of James Luther, a clerk—the prisoner was a lodger in our house—she had two children brought there to take care of on the 10th September—she only occupied one room—she had no servant or person with her—the eldest child was about five and the youngest about two—it seemed a healthy child, it could walk of itself—there are only four rooms in the house—her room was over the parlour, and we occupied the kitchen—I heard nothing for the first week, but afterwards my attention was attracted by hearing severe slaps, as if-with the hand—I never saw her touch the children—I spoke to her on several occasions and said I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not have that noise and disturbance in the house; as the children cried, and I should speak to their father or fetch a policeman—she gave as a reason that they were very dirty and hindered her, and that was why she did it—after that she was a great deal better <hi rend="italic">for</hi> a day or two, and then she commenced again, but I was away from home a great deal, I did not often see the children.</p>

I am the wife of David Sadler, a chimney sweep, and live at the Cooper's Arms, Putney—one day, at the end of September, a fortnight before the prisoner was taken, I was sitting at breakfast in my downstairs room—our yard adjoins the prisoner's yard—I heard a child being very much slapped and heard it crying—a female's voice said "I will learn you to be clean, look at your pinafore, how dirty it is," and then I heard the slaps again, and heard the child cry again—that went on for about half an hour—from the crying I should think the child was a boy about two years old—I have heard crying and whining at other times, but that is the only time I have heard smacks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am uncle to the prosecutor in the last case, and carry on business as a manufacturer of ivory and an ivory merchant in Primrose-street—I do not know the prisoner at all—this ivory before me was handed to me by Mr. Pye—I fully believe it is my property—I am sure it is—I cut in oil—this ivory is in an unfinished stare—I never sell it in this state—there are three or four different stages of manufacture here, altogether—I never heard, in all my experience, of any person dealing with ivory in these different stages, all mixed up together—they are kept separate in the shop—I think they have been taken in this state—it is quite probable that these pieces have been cut within the last two or three months—it might be a little more or less; not fifteen years ago, or fifteen months—they are worth between twenty-five shillings and thirty shillings a gross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> They are of different sizes, are they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my people cut in oil—I believe my nephew is the only one in the trade who cuts in water—the trade generally in all parts of the kingdom out in oil, to the best of my knowledge—ivory discolours if it is not kept very carefully; some ivory will discolour while it is being cut, and some will remain free from discolouration for a considerable period—if it is carefully kept, and if it is cut in water, it remains a good colour for some months—in some cases</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186407110050"></xptr>
               <p>ivory out in oil discolours, and in Rome cases it does not—I have known it discolour as soon as it is cut, and I have known it keep clear for a considerable period—we try to prevent our ivory discolouring, and in the majority of cases we succeed—I have about four or five hundred gross in my warehouse—I have not personally missed any—we took stock last Christmas—a horn presser would know very little of the ivory cutting; it is quite a different branch of trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got what you call a stepping machine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, manufactured for our own purpose; the one piece is what we call <hi rend="italic">shaped,</hi> and the other is <hi rend="italic">stepped</hi>—one is more round than the other—that process is peculiar to my own establishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not other dealers shape or step? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not by that process—the result is that one is a circular cut, and the other is a straight cut—I know the difference when they are finished—I fancy it is an advantage to have a circular cut—I have not taken out a patent—any other ivory dealer in the kingdom could have the same machinery as I have, if he went to the expense—I thought it was worth while—my nephew thinks differently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there are different modes of bevelling, there is one which you call stepping, and then other fine processes which make it smooth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have a machine for it—when the bevelling is finished I could tell whether it had been done with my machine, or not—I should know they were different—my place is not above 300 yards from my nephew's.</p>
               <p>

The Prisoner came one Saturday night, about the 18th or 19th of December, and took the back, room behind mine; on the day he was taken I saw one of the shirts, marked T. W. at the watch-house. I think the property was taken at different times. He was taken up last Saturday week; he had left the lodgings on the Tuesday, without giving any notice. I missed the articles stated in the indictment before he was taken up. I have seen the shirt, the spectacles, and two handkerchiefs since.</p>
               <p>- BOLTON. I am the wife of the last witness. This property was locked up in a drawer; the coats were in a box; the money was there when I went out on Tuesday: there was one sovereign and twenty-three shillings in sil ver - I think there were four half-crowns: I cannot tell whether the waistcoats or the breeches were there on Tuesday - I am sure the shirt is one which I had had to wash. When I came home on Tuesday the prisoner was in his own room, and I said</p>
               <p>"Hey, hey what is all this about;" seeing all the things scattered about. He said</p>
               <p>"I want a sheet of writing paper" - I went to my drawer to get it and he went off.</p>

               <p>Q.

Ten guineas my brother sent me from Berwick on Tweed, and the rest I saved up myself, by hard work, to bind my child to a trade; my brother has been a very good friend to me ever since my husband died.</p>

               <p>Court to Thomas. Did you let this woman go home? - I did, Sunday morning, I took her to the watch-house and locked her up in the watch-house till ten o'clock that morning, and then took her to the Virginia Planter, and begged of the landlord to take care of her; at ten o'clock I went to fetch her, I locked her up again till Sunday night, and then she gave account of herself; she was not charged with any felony at this time, she told me a good story, and where she lived; I said, I do not want to confine you if you will come to the justice's the next morning and prove your property, you shall have it.</p>

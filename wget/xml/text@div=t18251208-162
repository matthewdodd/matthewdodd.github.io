The prisoner, with another person, came to my shop about seven o'clock in the evening of the 30th of November - his companion asked for a shirt - I shewed him three - there was one which he said he would give 1s. 6d. for - I said I could not take it - he then wrapped it up and took it away - I ran after him, but he got away - I stopped the prisoner, and asked where his friend lived - he said he did not know; I detained him; I had heard them talking outside the door for seven or eight minutes before they came in, and one of them said "Cheapen one."</p>

            . I lodge at Mrs. Derry's. On this night I was up stairs, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went down and saw the prisoner sitting in the shop; the officer came and took him - he got up to go, and I told him to sit down again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Baker and Basket public-house, in Red-lion-street, having a pint of beer, and a young man came in and asked me to go with him to buy a shirt. We went to this lady's house - we were not at the window above a minute before we went in; he said he would give her 1s. 6d. - she said she could not take it - he said no more, but took it up and ran away - the woman said I must stay.</p>

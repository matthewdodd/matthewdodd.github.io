                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Upper Fitzroy-street. On the 24th January, I was called in to examine the body of Eliza Donald, in a small street, near Cromer-street, St. Pancras—she was a fine healthy young woman, about twenty years of age—she had a bruise on the right eye, (a common black eye,) and a bruise on the right side of the body, above the hip, between the hip and the ribs, from the abdomen down to the edge of the hip—there was one bruise on the lower part of the abdomen, near the groin—that bruise must have been inflicted with vio<lb></lb>lence—on examining the body internally, I found marks of extensive in<lb></lb>flammation of the peritoneum covering the inside of the abdomen—that is a very dangerous inflammation—it appeared to be more severe in the parts corresponding with the external injuries—I concluded that the external injuries were the original cause of the inflammation which caused her death—I have no doubt of it—she was a very healthy subject—there was nothing but the inflammation to account for her death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, but found no marks of inflammation about them—she was a tall strong woman—considerably taller than the prisoner, but I suppose not much stronger—she was not particularly muscular, but healthy and well formed—there was no gangrene about the inflammation—gangrene is not a common effect of peritoneal inflammation—the extensive inflammation was the immediate cause of death—there was a large deposit of lymph between the membranes of the peritoneum—that would produce death, by the effect it produced on the constitution—the severe inflammation produced, a deposit of lymph—we see that effect in very strong inflamma<lb></lb>tion—it never ends in suppuration, or very rarely—I have seen a case of supposed death from peritoneal inflammation—I never saw a case of peri<lb></lb>toneal inflammation where the marks of inflammation were so severe at this—it is a very common thing for a woman after child-birth to die of peritoneal inflammation—we do not usually find suppuration there—it does not generally produce mortification—if the internal membrane had been attacked with inflammation instead of the external, the effect would have been different—suppuration is more common in other parts of the body than in the peritoneum—I did not see her during her lifetime.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-surgeon to Mr. Delisair. I saw the de<lb></lb>ceased before death, on the Saturday afternoon about three o'clock—she died the following day at one o'clock—I found her labouring under severe inflammation of the peritoneum—I did not examine her to see any external bruise, but she complained of severe pain on the right side—there was certainly severe inflammation on the side where she told me she had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040097"></xptr>
               <p>hurt—I saw her again about five or six o'clock in the evening—I said when I first saw her that I did not think she would live till the next day—her pulse was sinking—I found her worse in the evening—I saw her body examined after death by Mr. Ladbury, and agree with him in opinion—I found bruises where she complained of the severe pain—I have not a doubt she died from inflammation caused by the injuries she told me she had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You first saw her about a week after the injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she had had no medical advice or treatment before that—she had not been out since the Tuesday—she was a girl of the town—I knew that from the house I found her in—if she had been drinking after the accident that would irritate and increase the inflammation, and make that mortal which might not otherwise have been so—if she had been very abstemious, and had proper treatment, she certainly might have been saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not drinking immediately after the injury, instead of retiring to rest, aggravate it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If inflammation was going on at the time, drink would increase that, no doubt—a little bleeding might have put it all to rights, but that is according to the state of the inflammation—understand<lb></lb>ing that she was out on Monday and Tuesday, and not confined to her bed till Tuesday night, I consider that at first the inflammation was not very active.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased, Eliza Donald—she was about twenty years of age, and was an unfortunate girl. On Sunday, the 13th of January, I went with her to No. 11, Zion-terrace, which is a bad house, and is in the next terrace to where I live—I was standing at the next door, No. 12, and saw the prisoner go in—she had not been in there two minutes before I heard a scuffle, and saw her pushed out, and the door shut immediately—I did not see who pushed her out, whether it was a male or fe<lb></lb>male—it was not with violence—I went and spoke to the deceased on her being pushed out—I saw the prisoner immediately after come out of the house—she is also an unfortunate girl—I saw her come behind Donald and strike her on the back of the neck with her fist, and they both fell—the deceased had not struck her or given her any provocation that I saw—I should have seen it if she had—the prisoner was very much intoxicated, more so than the deceased—they had both been drinking—a young girl came out of No. 8, and hit Martin to make her leave go of Donald's hair—I saw the prisoner kick Donald with her feet several times, but I cannot exactly say where it was—it was in the stomach—she was on the ground at the time—the prisoner had got up—I think the kicked her about three times, not more, and then the prisoner staggered very much against the railings—the deceased got up after the kicking, and walked into No. 9—she did not appear much hurt—I did not see the prisoner kick her any where else but in the lower part of her belly, not her hips—she fell against the wall when she fell—she did not return any of the kicks—I did not see any provocation given by Donald—I saw the prisoner holding her by her hair—I saw her eye was a little red when she got up, but I did not see any blow struck in the face at all—she fell with her face against the pave<lb></lb>ment, and on her side against the wall.</p>

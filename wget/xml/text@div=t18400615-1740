                  </hi>I am clerk to an engineer. On Saturday evening, the 30th of May, a few minutes before twelve o'clock, I was passing through Red-lion-street, Whitechapel, and seeing a crowd round Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">COX'S</hi>door, and having previously known Mr.<hi rend="smallCaps">COX, </hi>I went to see what was the matter—I found he bad taken a boy, named Carey, into custody for stealing a woman's purse—he was tried in the New Court this morn<lb></lb>ing and transported—after I had got in, a tremendous rush was made at the door, with violent cries of " Let the boy go, what do you want to keep him for? "—Scott was very prominent among them—I held the door to prevent any one from coming in, and he made a blow at me through the glass—be broke the square of glass, and struck me—the blow almost stunned me—I was obliged to leave go of the door, a rush then took place into the house, but I gave Scott in charge, and the policeman took the boy to the station-house—an attempt was made to rescue him—I saw Goodson with the mob, but did not see him do any thing—there were a hundred or a hundred and fifty persons.</p>

No, but my mouth did—the boy was not in my custody, but I considered that I was taking care of him, as well as Mr. Cox—there were six or eight persons inside the door—Scott came inside when I let go of the door—I did not see him do any thing more after that,</p>

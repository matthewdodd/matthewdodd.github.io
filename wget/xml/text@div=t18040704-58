             sworn. - I live at the Angel inn: On the 30th of April I lost a great coat from off the coach-box, after it came in at night; I saw the coat between eight and nine that night, and I missed it the next morning; the gates are not shut till eleven o'clock, or after; the prisoners both worked in the yard, one is horse-keeper, and the other is employed in washing and cleaning the coaches.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your great coat again? - A. On the 9th of June; the prisoners were taken up to Bow-street on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that they ever had it in their possession of your own knowledge? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I drive a chaise for Mr. Woodland.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he keep the Angel? - A. No; I was out of place at that time; they brought the coat to me, and wanted me to go with them to pawn it, and I did; it was night when we went to pawn it; it was pawned in Drury-lane, just before you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040063"></xptr>come to Long-acre; I do not know the pawnbroker's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both of the prisoners go? - A. No, only Dobey; they both of them asked me if I would go along with them to pawn it; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was only meant as a joke; they had agreed to take it out as soon as he came to town? - A. Yes, they were drunk, and we got drunk the next morning too.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk at the time? - A. I was not very drunk at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Did not the prisoners say, as soon as they had got the money, they would take it out? - A. They denied it; I went to Barnsley afterwards, and he owned that they had took the coat from the coach-office; he told me I should have the coat after a while; this was five weeks afterwards; I had offered five shillings the next morning to drink, if any body would come forward, and I think I offered very fair.</p>

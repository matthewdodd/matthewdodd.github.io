               <p>Q. Who was that man? - A. That is the man at the bar; I asked him where he was going with that chest; he made no reply, but threw the chest down, and ran away directly; a young man that was with me followed him and took him, and I took care of the chest; I got some neighbours to help the chest up upon my back; I put the chest down on the wharf, and laid it by till the prisoner was in hold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.You did not see the prisoner on the wharf? - A. No, not till we brought him there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a vast quantity of goods on the wharf? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These things are brought in carts to the wharf? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, for aught you know, this might have been taken from the cart before it got to the wharf? - A. I cannot say.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street. I was in my shop, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I looked out, and saw the prisoner passing; I went after him, and two men stopped him - he dragged them across the street, to Mr. Yardley's area, and laid down; I then took him to a light, where he was searched - but nothing found on him; he struggled very much - we found the handkerchief in the area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you lose sight of him? A. No; he was taken five yards from my door - I am a constable, and took him to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

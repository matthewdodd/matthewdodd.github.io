            , at the Horse-shoe and Magpye, in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Court. This is not a conviction to be countenanced, for a man to go for the purpose to lead a man to commit a felony, and then to bring evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Court. With what intention did you go to enquire for Anderson? - The shopman told me them people could sell me some bad pieces, and he said if you have a mind to buy some bad gold, you may; I said I would, for I could pass them: he sent me to the Horse-shoe and Magpye.</p>

               <p>Then you went to buy it on purpose to pass it? - No, my Lord, on purpose to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Is this the first time you have employed yourself that way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let us hear the conversation? - The conversation was to apprehend such people, to bring them to justice.</p>
               <p>What did you go to the Horse-shoe and Magpye for? - For Anderson.</p>
               <p>For what? - On purpose to buy half a guinea of him.</p>
               <p>What did you intend to do with the half guinea? - I intended to deliver no money for it till I went to the runners; when I saw him he produced half a guinea; I had only three shillings in my pocket; he said he would take five shillings, which I agreed to give him; he told me he would take half a crown in part of payment; I told him if he would come with me I would give him the five shillings; I told him I lived in Leather-lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150170"></xptr>Where did you give him the money? - No, he took the half guinea back in his pocket: then he came up with me to Turnstile, Holborn, but he would not go with me for the money; I told him I did not like to run in trust, but I was going to take him to another house; then I turned up into High-street, Bloomsbury, there I met Umpage, I told him about it, then Umpage told me to go and buy it; I went for it, and gave him half a crown, and I promised him the remainder; when I went back for the bad silver, he gave me the half guinea, and I gave him the half crown; he said he would trust me till the next day.</p>
               <p>What excuse did you make him for not bring the whole money? - I made no excuse at all, he took the half crown very contentedly; I was to bring the half crown at night, Mr. Umpage, and I, and one or two, went down to look for him, and did not find him: about eleven on the Saturday I met with the prisoner at the Horse-shoe and Magpye; I asked him why he did not come at night; he said he could not get what he was to bring. He was taken up that morning; I gave the half guinea to Mr. Umpage.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the same you bought of the prisoner? - I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>From what circumstance do you know it? - By the making.</p>
               <p>Is it gold or false metal? - False metal.</p>
               <p>I immagine that cannot be told without it is assayed? - The missing is not like the Tower milling, I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Umpage. When did this happen? - Pritchard came to me on the 13th of August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the prosecutor what money he gave me; I leave myself entirely to the Court to plead for me: He offered half price for it; I would not take half a crown for it; he came to me on Saturday morning, and brought a crown piece and half a crown piece, here, says he, I have got money enough, you must bring the half guinea. I never had a half guinea but that in my life; I never saw a bad half guinea before.</p>
               <p>Court. If you supposed this to be a good half guinea, why did you sell it? - I am partner in a news-walk, I received a little money, and this amongst it, and I suspected a man, and he said if I would go and take my oath before a Justice of peace, he would take it of me: you must think me a madman to fell this to strangers I never saw before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him a very good character; and one witness, who said he believed the Prosecutor would swear false, if he could get any thing by it.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This is a felony, by the act of King William, without any specific punishment; here is a very great difference between the means used to obtain evidence of a felony already committed, and drawing a man into the commission of a crime; it is just the same, as if anybody hearing that a man had the character of a thief, was to leave property in his way, in order that he might steal it, and then prosecute him for the felony: it is extremely different from making use even of indirect means to obtain proof of a felony already committed. Here the felony was committed at the instigation of the witness; he does not stand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150171"></xptr> directly in the light of an accomplice, in which case, there being no evidence but his, the law would not admit you to convict the prisoner on his testimony alone; yet he does not appear more deserving of credit, and the whole rests on his single testimony; for all that any other witness can prove is, that he himself produced a bad half guinea; but the prosecutor has fully proved the charge against the prisoner, if you think him intitled to credit, however you may disapprove the manner in which he acted.</p>

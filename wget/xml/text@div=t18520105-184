                  </hi>. I am chief clerk of Bow-street—I took down the cvidence of the defendant on a charge of attempting to pick pockets—he was sworn—Mr. Hall Presided—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>, "Last night I was in company with the last witness in Drury-lane Theatre—my attention was called to the prisoner Adam, who I saw join the other prisoner—the last witness said Something to me, which caused me to look at the prisoner Adam; and I then saw his left hand in the pocket of a female—I told Moss not to lose sight of them, and I went and spoke to the female, telling her to follow in; but she did not, ail I do not know her name or where she lives—going down-stairs I saw the prisoner Adam behind the other, and heard Francatelli my, 'Push against me—the other replied, 'All right, Robert'—when they got into Russell-street we took them into custody—I found only a pair of gloves, which do not fit him, on Adam, a purse, and a small quantity of money—the purse he said had been given to him by Francatelli, as a present for his sister. Henry Attwood.") The prisoner Adam tried the gloves before the Magistrate, and they do fit him; whereupon the Magistrate inquired why Attwood had stated that the gloves do not fit; upon which witness replied, "They do not fit <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and I therefore thought, looking at his hands and mine, that they would not fit him"—the Magistrate then repri<lb></lb>manded the witness Attwood for making such a surmise.</p>

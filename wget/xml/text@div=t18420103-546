                  </hi>. I am the son of James Oldridge, who keeps a chandler's-shop in Ogle-street. On Monday, the 27th of December, the prisoner came to the shop, in company with a man and woman, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening—my father gave them a glass of gin each—while the prisoner was there I saw her make a kind of shuffle with her cloak—after they were gone I missed a piece of bacon—I went with my father, and found them both at the Sir Isaac Newton public-house—we called the other woman out first, and she called the prisoner out—I told her we had missed the bacon from the shop, and I did not wish to hurt her,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, at Grosvenor-street West, Pimlico. In the evening of 1st Dec., the prisoner came in about 7 o'clock—he asked for a half quartern notched brick—I had not one—he had another loaf and paid me half a crown—I gave him change, and he left—as he was leaving, I noticed the half crown; it was a good one—I put it in the till—there was no other half crown there, only two or three sixpences—in about five minutes a female came in, and asked for some sweet stuff; I went round to serve her, and the prisoner came back and said the loaf would not do—e brought it back, put it on the counter, and gave me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I ad given him, and I gave his half crown back; I had but that one—the woman then said she would not have the sweet stuff, she would have some biscuits—the prisoner then said, if he took a cottage loaf would I change it if it would not do—I said, "Yes"—he took a cottage loaf, and gave me a half crown, and I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back—I tried the half crown, and found it was bad—I am positive it was not the half crown which I had given him—he was going out, and I ran round the counter to try to stop him—he got out before I got round, and the female who was in the shop shut the door after him—that I prevented my following him—I opened the door and he was gone; I saw through the window that he ran through the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rank, and then I lost sight of him—he had taken my two good shillings and the loaf, and the good halt crown, and left me the bad half crown—the woman had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of biscuits, and went away; I do not know what became of her—I kept the half crown in my pocket till the next day, and</p>

I was in Grosvenor-street on 2nd Dec, about a quarter before 4 o'clock; I saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Croft following him—I ran after him, and called, "Stop him!"—he passed by the tail of a coal wagon, in Eaton-street, and I distinctly saw him throw a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece into the wagon—he was stopped by a young man, I think his name is Goodyear, at the corner of Ranelagh-street, and given into custody—the crown piece was taken out of the wagon—I saw it thrown in, and I saw it taken out and given to Mr. Croft.</p>

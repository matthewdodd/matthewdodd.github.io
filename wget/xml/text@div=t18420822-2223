                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Great Western Railway police-constable</hi>.) I am em<lb></lb>ployed at Bull Bridge, at Hayes. On Tuesday, the 2nd of August, there was a truck there containing a quantity of spelter—on the night of Tues<lb></lb>day, the 2nd of August, I watched the truck in which it was—I went round between nine and ten o'clock—it was safe then—it was covered with a sort of tarpaulin, tied down quite safe by a cord—between ten and eleven, I found that the cord was cut—I fastened it again—some time after, I went out, and found it was slipped off the corner of the truck, which must have been done purposely—it could not have come off itself—in the morning I reported what I had observed to the clerk—it was un<lb></lb>der the Railway Company's care—I do not know the prisoner—I was pre<lb></lb>sent when Davey examined this spelter—he missed eight lumps out of 403.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of Wednesday I counted some spelter, there ought to have been 403 lumps—I found 395, eight were gone—I gave information of the loss to Webber—the spelter had "M R" marked on it—it belonged to Mines Royal Company—this piece is marked in that way (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am constable of Iver. The Company's yard where this was is at Hayes, in the county of Middlesex—I received information of this on the 4th of August—I apprehended the prisoner, and on the 5th I found the property in the water of the canal, close underneath where he stood—on my journey back with the prisoner I met Talbot, with a dog—I took him, and put him in the cage—I afterwards received information from the lad, went and searched the place, and found seven pieces of spelter—the eighth was brought to me afterwards.</p>

The officer took me to the watch-house with the pri<lb></lb>soner—the prisoner said there was no harm in telling me what he had done—I said, "No, not a bit"—he said he had been stealing some zinc, that he stole them out of Bull Bridge-yard, and put them in the canal<lb></lb>bridge hole—he said there was another concerned in it, but he would not mention his name—he said he went after copper, but he went to the wrong truck, and got zinc, if he had had copper it would have been worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me How many bits he took at a time—he said he saw a policeman coming over the railway, and he ran away, and left his shoes, watched the policeman back, then ran back and got two bits more, and got</p>

                  </hi>. In consequence of Larkins's directions, I took these lamps of spelter out of the water in the hole just by the bridge—I have known the prisoner from his birth—before we went before the Magistrate the prisoner said he should wish to speak to me, but being a prisoner be supposed he did not dare to speak to me—he wished to speak to me privately—I said, "You can"—we went out of the room to another—he he said, what a fool he was for confessing to his fellow prisoner about his stealing the property—if he had not confessed they could only have given him six months, and it was him and my brother that got it from the place, and put it into the water—he lives close by this canal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Customs, and live at 6, Elizabeth-place, Rotherhithe—about 8 o'clock on the morning of 26th July, I was on the Surrey end of London-bridge, reading a notice about the election; whilst doing so, I observed the prisoner standing very close to me, and on looking down I saw my watch in his hand—he was trying to get it off the guard—I snatched it out of his hand and said, "You scoundrel, you have got</p>

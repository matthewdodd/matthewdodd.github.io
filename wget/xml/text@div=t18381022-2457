The prisoner was an apprentice, and had been one voyage—we all slept on board—it was the prisoner's turn to watch on deck that night—I wound my watch up at half-past eight o'clock, and placed it in the cabin for him to keep watch by—the other articles were in the fore part of the vessel, and belonged to Mr. M'Intire—I went to bed, and awoke about three o'clock in the morning, and went forwards—the prisoner was missing, and my watch was gone from the cabin—I went on shore with two men, and met some policemen, who gave us information, and we found him at Greenwich station-house with all the property—he had no business to leave the ship—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

I stepped on it, and picked it up. I did not see any one look at me: my parcels came down; I put them into my apron all together. I paid for my things. I went out of the shop some distance; the young man came after me, and said I had got a gown in a mistake. I said I did not know that I had. I went back again into the shop; he took my apron aside and took the gown out. He called Mr. Thompson; he told him to call a policeman. 1 begged of Mr. Thompson for mercy; I told him I did not know what it was. I asked him if I might take my bundle home, or leave it with him; they said I must take it with me. As I and the policeman were going to the station, I looked to see if my parcels were right, and I found a pair of stays, which must have been with the gown, as I did not know what it was until</p>

               <p>I was in the shop again. When I was searched, they called my articles over; I said there was a pair of stays. I could not say any more then; I was overpowered. In a short time after, Mr. Thompson's young man came to the station, and said Mr. Thompson had missed a pair of stays. They did not know whether I had got them, but asked if there was such a thing in my articles; then I said, 'Yes;' they said I stood charged with stealing a pair of stays also: I could not speak to them. When I was before the Magistrate, they said a woman in the shop said I was pulling the pin out of the gown; but that is false, the pin caught in my cloak, as they pushed me, I then put my hand, to loosen it from my cloak. I never was before a Judge till now."</p>

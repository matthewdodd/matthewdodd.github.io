                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Dalton, a bookseller, of Cockspur-street—on Friday, 14th July, between 12 and 1 o'clock, the prisoner came for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage-stamps—I gave him three sheets—two sheets of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, each, and one of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he appeared to count them atten<lb></lb>tively—he looked at them, and put his fingers over them, and then asked me to wrap them in paper for him—I did so, and gave them to him—he gave me a sovereign and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in payment, and was about to leave the shop—I had no suspicion of him at all—when I put the sovereign on the counter</p>

               <p>the sound of it attracted my attention, and I called to the prisoner and told him I believed it was bad—he said he did not know it was bad—I marked it at once, and then tested it with a good one in the scales—I then sent for a policeman and gave the prisoner into custody with the sovereign—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked the prisoner where he came from, and he said from somebody in Drury-lane, either Mr. Jones or his master, I don't know which—he asked if he might have the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps—I did not let him have them.</p>

I was called into Mr. Dalton's shop on this day, and the prisoner was given into my custody with this sovereign—in answer to a question at Mr. Dalton's shop, the prisoner said that his master, Mr. Jones, had sent him from Drury-lane to get 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps—when he got to the station, in answer to the inspector, he said a stranger to him, about three yards from Mr. Dalton's, had given him the sovereign and two shillings to get 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps, and he said that the stranger offered him sixpence to do so—I inquired about a Mr. Jones, but I could not find any one—his father lives at 3, Whitehorse-court, Drury-lane—he is in Court.</p>

                  </hi>. This is a bad sovereign—it is only a good imitation when it has just left the battery—it is much lighter than an ordinary sovereign—it would look as good as any sovereign when first tendered—the colour does not last—it will turn quite black, and if kept in a purse, the colour will wear off.</p>

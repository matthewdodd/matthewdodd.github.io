A number of them got round me, pushed me about, tore off the skirt of my coat, and my pocket, which contained several letters and bills which I had paid. On turning round I caught the prisoner's hand in my breeches-pocket, which had 7 s. or 7 s. 6 d. in it at the time - when I got clear of the mob I found only 18 d. remaining. My knife and several other things were gone. I am sure the prisoner was one of them. I came home, told two or three people of it, and saw the prisoner next morning playing on a dung-heap with another lad, in the Jolly Butcher's yard, and knew him directly - I sent for Allen, who took him. I had seen him pass our door eight or nine times before. I live<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180052"></xptr>within four doors of the Jolly Butchers. When I was robbed the skirt of my coat was thrown at me again. It was cut so as to take my inside and outside pocket; it was cut through the seam and then completely torn off. I am certain it was first cut with some sharp instrument. I was much alarmed at the time and resisted, but while some held my arms the others cut my coat away.</p>

John Marks called upon me in that month—he said that he had sent a pianoforte, which he had bought of us, I think to Melbourne, and from the return sale of that he had an order for twelve to give me—I said twelve was a large number to order at once; but he said, from the account that he had had of the description of instrument that was wanted, he should not hesitate to</p>

               <p>after he got out of his trouble, out of Whitecross Street—Simmons and Samuel Marks carried on business in Long Acre as coach makers—their place of business was very nearly opposite to that of John Marks—at the latter end, I think, of last Nov., I was requested by John Marks to go to Mr. Collins's with a van for some pianos—I brought away six, by John Marks's directions, from Mr. Collins's; three each time, in John Marks's van, which he had had made by a man of the name of Lee—I took them to a mews in Great Queen Street, Long Acre—there was a coach house there, where they used to put carriages in—I have seen Simmons and Samuel Marks in that coach house; they helped me unload the last three that I brought there—when I took the pianos to this coach house, I saw a man of the name of <hi rend="italic">Bill.</hi> I do not know his other name, that used to work for Samuel Marks—Simmons and Samuel Marks were in the coach house while these pianos were there, and they told me I was to put them at the further end of the coach house, which I did—they remained there till I took the first load of varnish to the Eastern Counties Railway—that might be about three weeks or a fortnight after I brought them; but you will see by the Eastern Counties' Railway date, that was the day I took the first load of four pianos away by the directions of Simmons and Samuel Marks—John Marks told me that his brother Samuel wanted to see me, I went to him, and he told me he was going to get a van and horse of Mr. Bewer, a man who lets out horses and carts in Bedfordbury, and they were to go away—I took the pianos away after I had received those directions, in the van and horse—he did not tell me where to take them—he told me I was to drive over Waterloo Bridge, and Simmons and Samuel Marks would meet me over Waterloo Bridge—I started with the van and pianos, and went over Water<lb></lb>loo Bridge, and they met me just over the bridge, where the public house is, on the left hand side—they got up there, and instructed me to drive on—I had four pianos in the van—I turned to go along the Cornwall Road—they told me to turn round the turning, and keep on there until I got to Kent Street, in the Borough—they wanted me to stop back there, but I made some demur, and they had some conversation between each other, and I went on—they got out of the van—I turned up to Mr. Mandeville's back premises, where there is a public house at the corner—they got some man to help unload the pianos, and I stopped in the van and helped to get them out—that was the first time—I took two more pianos there by their directions, on the following Monday, and two crates of canvas—they were the pianos that had come from Messrs. Collins—it was on the Saturday that I took the four, and on the following Monday I took two, and some crates of canvas which had been bought by John Marks, of Mr. Unite, of St. Alban's Place, New Road—they did not go with me on the Monday; I was ordered to go down to St. Martin's Lane, by John Marks; he wanted to see me, and he ordered me to take them where I took the others—he asked me if I thought I could find the place out; I said, "Yes"—I saw Sim<lb></lb>mons also—he was up stairs, in Mr. Marks's room—he told me to be care<lb></lb>ful—I left those things there—I never saw Mandeville before—I never received any directions as to bringing those goods back—I had no more to do with them—I did not pack the canvas in the crates.</p>

Wilkinson and Kidd, the army saddlers, of Oxford Street—I first was told to take them to the Adelphi, and afterwards I was given instructions to go to the Lyceum Theatre—I commenced moving those things in May—John Marks and Samuel Marks, and Simmons, helped me load the first load—Samuel Marks sent his man up next morning with a horse, and I helped put the horse in the van, but I was not to say anything to his man, and of course I did not; I put the horse in, and I met him and Mr. Simmons—it was about 7 o'clock when I met them the first morning—Mr. Simmons was the first person to come, and Mr. Samuel Marks the next—Simmons came with a pair of morning slippers on, and he drove the horse and ran away, and Mr. Samuel Marks took me to a coffee shop, and kept me there some time—I did not know at that time where Simmons had driven the van with the goods to—from some suspicion I had, I employed two men, named Richard<lb></lb>son and Young, to watch where they drove the van to—I took about eight van loads of goods from the bankrupt's premises to the Lyceum Theatres—the value of the cases, as near to I can guess, was about 7, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never knew myself to what place in London the van with those goods was driven; I never saw the van, but I went with William Young, on Sunday, to Wool Quay, and there saw one of the packages with the direction turned over, directed to Ipswich—I there identified one of the cases that I had driven in the van from Bell Street; it had three pairs of wheels in it—I knew it again—in consequence of some information which was conveyed to me, I sent Young down to Ipswich; I did not go there myself—when I took the goods from Bell Street, Paddington, to drive them to the Lyceum Theatre, they were not directed, only numbered in rotation—I wrote on them out<lb></lb>side, in pencil mark, what the cases were; sometimes Mr. Samuel Marks used to come and put it down in a book, No. 1 contains such an article, and Mr. Lee used to come up stairs, and help me mark them, and plane the writing off—there was no address—I remember the bankruptcy of John Marks happening on 28th May—before the bankruptcy, John Marks told me I was to go and get shaved, and put on my coat, and go along with him; I did not put on my coat; I put on a jacket, and went with him—he told me I had no business to send the man Young down to Ipswich; I denied it to John Marks, but he took a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> with me, and in the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> he questioned me about it, and I still denied it—he took me in the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> to Bernard Street; that is the residence of Samuel Marks; the first I saw there was Samuel Marks, then I afterwards saw Simmons, and we</p>

               <p>went up stairs into Mr. Samuel Marks's back drawing room—John Marks said, in the presence of the three, that he would not have me forfeit my word for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were all talking to me, and I said I could not answer all three at one time; if they put any questions to me singly, I would answer—Mr. Simmons said, "What have I done to you? had you not sent Young down, we should have been all gentlemen"—I did not learn, until the Saturday night, that anything had happened at Ipswich; when I saw Mrs. Simmons in the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> with the crimson curtain drawn down; I waited till John Marks came down, and he told the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> an to drive to the Surrey Theatre; he told me that he had had a telegraphic message from Ipswich, that Samuel Marks and Simmons were locked up, and they would not take bail for them—I saw Samuel Marks on Friday, 29th May, at his house, in Bernard Street—I never saw the goods again that I removed to Ipswich—I know a person of the name of Forsdick, who lives near Reigate—I have seen him there—I was down there with Sim<lb></lb>mons—he is a game keeper, and has a small cottage and a barn about two miles from the station—Simmons took me down there on Friday, June 5th—that was after the bankruptcy—I went in a dog cart; I met him the other side of Kennington Gate; he had brought Harriet Jones with him—he asked me to go down with him to remove those goods that were in the barn, for the man belonging to the barn had sent a letter stating, I believe, that if he did not remove the goods, he would throw the barn gates open immediately—when we went down, Simmons pointed the barn out to me—we went on to Mr. Forsdick's house, and slept there that night, and had supper, and I returned with him on the Saturday morning—I saw pianos, iron bedsteads, cloths, riding saddles, harness saddle rugs and clothes, in the barn—I had seen them before—I met Simmons and Samuel Marks some<lb></lb>times in Trinity Square, and sometimes at a public house called the World turned Upside Down—I had taken those goods from Bell Street on a four-wheeled truck to that place, and Simmons and Samuel Marks together took them into the South-eastern Railway—I had given them sometimes into Simmons's, and sometimes into Samuel Marks's care—I had never taken them to any railway or place by which they might have left London—I identified the cases that I saw in the barn at Reigate as those I had removed from Bell Street, and given into the care of Simmons and Samuel Marks—I had a plane, to plane the numbers off them—Simmons, and Samuel Marks, and John Marks, had given me directions as to that—one of them had bought a plane for that purpose—Simmons had it in the dog cart, and it was done up; I thought it was a bar of soap—I could identify those goods, as having removed them—I had commenced removing them from Bell Street in January, 1856 or 1857, and giving them in their care—there were ninety-four large packing cases for exportation—the goods that were there might be worth 8, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not remove them all in January—I removed them at different times—Simmons wanted me to stop at Reigate, but I told him I should not stop then, I wanted to go to Brighton—I returned with him; he wanted to put me down this side of Waterloo Bridge; I would not; he drove me over, and he said, "It does not look well to see you with me; you must go up to Samuel Marks's house, and be careful how you go up there"—I received directions to go down to Reigate from Samuel Marks, John Marks, and Simmons, and they told me to be very careful how I removed those goods—I was to go down to get the goods away from the barn—I went to Brighton on Saturday night by the 8 o'clock train, and I returned by the express, which I was not</p>

               <p>aware did not stop at Reigate—got out, and got into the Parliamentary; and when I got to Reigate, I met a Mr. Liddell there—the directions given to me were to plane all the numbers off, and mark them "C" and a diamond, and send the goods on to the Bricklayers' Arms, from Mr. Forsdick to Mr. Coleman, left till called for—I took the cards off that were on the packages, and left them in the barn—these (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) are the cards which I took off—I took those off in the barn where the goods were—they had not those cards on when they left Bell Street—some of these are in Simmons's handwriting, the others are in Samuel Marks's—when I left the packages at the World turned Upside Down, and gave them into Simmons's and Marks's care, they had no address on them—having taken the addresses off the various ninety-four cases in the barn, I went to a Mr. Burrell, a carrier, at Reigate, and made arrangements with him to remove the cases—when I got to Reigate, Harriet Jones was down there, and told me something—I got Burrell, the carrier, to take them down to the railway station, and forward them to Reading by the cross line—goods go that way to Liverpool by the Great Western—saw the whole ninety-four cases so sent; they were addressed from Coleman to Coleman, Coburg Dock, Liverpool, left till called for—I left them there to be sent to Liverpool—I came to town that night, and went to see John Marks—he began swearing at me, and asked if anybody had seen me—I said, "Yes, Mr. Liddell"—he said, "I know that"—he told me I was not to stop there, that he had been examined at the Bankruptcy Court, and had sworn that he did not know where I was; and if they knew that I had had an interview with him, they would take him up for perjury—he told me to go to his brother's house, which I did—I took a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> from the Yorkshire Stingo to Russell Square, got out there, and discharged the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and walked on to Samuel Marks's house, and slept there that night—that was the night after I came from Reigate—I saw Samuel Marks and Simmons next morning at Samuel Marks's house—I told them what I had done, and gave Samuel Marks the receipts of the railway for the goods—there were some things at my place, and they told me to get a horse and cart, and remove them away that night, for the officers of the Bankruptcy Court were going to search my house, and if the thing were found there it would hurt them; this was on Friday, 12th June—before I went down to Reigate, they told me that if I was seen by anybody, I was to tell them that I was removing the goods for the benefit of the creditors; they might get hold of the goods, but they were not to get hold of me, I was to escape if I could—on Saturday, 13th June, I received directions from Samuel Marks to go to Cambridge; Simmons and John Marks were present—I was to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first, but they afterwards gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Samuel Marks gave me the money—I was to go to Mr. Brown, a shoe maker, at Barnwell, which is about a mile from Cambridge, and I was to tell Brown that I had come down to pack up the things that he had got—I did not see any quantity of goods there that night, I did the next morning; I saw the varnish, the black japan, and the gold size; it was all loose—I had to go and buy a lot of timber—I bought three different lots of timber, and had a carpenter named Bradbury to make the cases.</p>

I have known Simmons seven or eight years—he was a publican when I first knew him, and had a house next to the Surrey Theatre, called the Surrey Coal Hole—in Nov., 1856, he came to me and asked me if I would oblige him by minding some goods for a friend of his for about six months—I said I would do so if it would oblige him—he said the party bought them of a man that was in want of money, and he said he</p>

Capper and Woolley, of Fenchurch Street, and instructed me to make arrangements with them for ninety-four cases of goods to Liverpool—I was directed to go down to Reading to see if the goods had been forwarded on to Liverpool—when I got there I did not find the goods, or get any information about them——I afterwards went to Liverpool, and saw on the jetty a number of cases, which I understood were the ninety-four cases I had gone about—they were marked with a diamond and C in the centre—a man was employed to take care of them until they were shipped for Australia—I did not employ him—they were shipped in the <hi rend="italic">Boanerges.</hi> for Sydney—I gave directions for them to be shipped—I have not heard of them since—I got the bills of lading and sent them to Samuel Marks—(<hi rend="italic">David Harris, managing clerk to Messrs.

On Friday evening, 22nd May, I was consulted by Mr. Beckley and Mr. Brown, who were creditors of John Marks—I went with them to Mr. Paul's warehouse at Ipswich, and saw a large quantity of goods—in conse<lb></lb>quence of information a warrant was obtained by the superintendent at Ipswich, upon which Simmons and Samuel Marks were taken into custody—I saw sixty, seventy, or eighty cases of goods there; I forget the exact quantity; there was a large warehouse full of them—the prisoners were taken before a magistrate on the Saturday, and remanded till the Wednesday, when the case against them was withdrawn in consequence of an arrange<lb></lb>ment—I only knew Simmons by the name of Abraham Simmons at that time—on the Wednesday morning that the case was to have been heard, John Marks and his attorney, Mr. Solomons, called on me at my office—on the night the other prisoners were taken, or when they were remanded, Simmons stated, "The goods belong to John Marks, who is a respectable coach builder in the Acre; he bought them, and paid for them, and if he is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185711230039"></xptr>
               <p>telegraphed for, he will come down and satisfy you that they belong to him, and that we are innocent parties, and ought not to be here"—he also said, when before the Magistrate, that the goods were brought down to Ipswich for sale, to be turned into money at John Marks's request—on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning there was a declaration of insolvency, which was the act of Bankruptcy—I came up on the Wednesday night, and John Marks was made a bankrupt on the Thursday morning—at the time the declaration was signed, John Marks also made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, to enable us to take possession of the goods immediately—we then went before the Magistrate—I explained the matter to the creditors present, and stated, that as the goods were given up to them, and John Marks had signed a declaration of insolvency, we wished to withdraw the case, to which the Magistrate consented, and they were discharged—I then took the three prisoners into the adjoining room, the Grand Jury room, and Mr. Solomons and two or three other parties came with them—I said to Simmons and Samuel Marks, "I think you ought to know upon what terms you have been discharged"—I then told them that John Marks, to save them, as they were innocent parties (Marks had used those words), had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors of all his effects, and had also made a declaration of insolvency—I was going on to put a question to them about some other goods, but Simmons or Samuel Marks interrupted me by saying that the van and two horses belonged to Simmons; they were not the bankrupt's—there was a van and two horses, and a well bred mare that Simmons had been riding about the country on—I did not observe what name was on the van—Samuel Marks said, "The van and two horses belong to me and Simmons, and the blood mare to Simmons"—I then said to them, "It is your duty to tell me if you know of any other goods which have been secreted, or in any way belong to John Marks. I have been told you have sent some other goods to Norwich; have you done so?"—Simmons said, "We have not sent any goods to Norwich or anywhere else, and we have no other goods but these"—Samuel Marks said, "Quite so; this is all we have;" and John Marks added, "They cannot have done so; this is the whole lot"—I came up to London that same evening, and the Commission was opened next morning—I saw Samuel Marks at the Bankruptcy Court, and I think I saw Simmons, I will not say actually in the Court room, but in the building.</p>

I remember a number of cases coming in May last, and after that two gentle<lb></lb>men, whom I believe to be Simmons and Samuel Marks, came—Marks came into the warehouse, and asked me if there were any goods lying there, and whether he could see them—I got the cases, and he saw the goods—as we walked up the warehouse, he asked me, if he paid, could the goods lie there such a thing as twelve months—I said it rested entirely with my governor, Mr. Paul, but it was not usual for goods to lie there that length of time—I opened the doors to give light to the warehouse, and he said, "They are all right, and lie well"—they were afterwards taken away in a van.</p>

               <p>their names then—they both spoke to me, and they went and looked at them, and agreed to take them—I do not know that any particular name was given the first time, but afterwards Simmons gave the name of "George Green, 46, Chandos Street"—an agreement was signed by Simmons in the name of George Green—I have a copy of it here; I have not got the one which was signed—after it was signed it was given up to Simmons—the date of the agreement was 21st May—when the warehouse was taken, I asked particularly what kind of goods were to be deposited there, because I thought there might be some gunpowder; and they said, "Cases and crates, and there might be some carriages"—they told me that they were goods intended to be sent to Australia, but the markets there were very bad—the rent was paid the same day, without my asking for it—I have not seen either of them from that day until the present time.</p>

I have known Simmons ever since about last Jan. or Feb.—I know Samuel Marks—I did not know John Marks until I saw him in Court—in the spring of this year Simmons came down to my cottage—I cannot say to two or three weeks when I first saw him there, but it was some time about Jan. or March—he wanted me to take in some furniture, to take care of it for about eight months—I showed him a little room in my house, and I said I had got two empty attics up stairs where he could stow away a few things—he said, very well, he should send them; and, after about a fortnight or three weeks, a letter came to me—he came down again after I had the first parcel of things—the things were too many for me to take them—I took my pony and cart to fetch the few things I expected; when I got there, there were twenty-five packages, something like that, more or less—I came back with my pony and cart, and met Mr. Burrell coming with his carts and horses, and I asked him to go down and fetch them, and I would pay him for bringing them up; and he said he would—afterwards a large number of cases of goods came from time to time—there were about twenty-five at first—I cannot tell how many came altogether—I put them into an empty barn—Simmons and Samuel Marks came down to see the goods in the barn—Marks said to me, talking to Simmons at the same time, that it was a very nice place, and it was very convenient, and he should like to engage it for eight or twelve months—the goods remained there until Whitsuntide week—I know Molloy—he came down with Simmons to my place, with a horse and chaise, or dog cart—in consequence of something I had heard, my wife wrote a letter to Simmons, to tell him to come and take the goods away the next day, or I should open the barn doors and expose them; and he and Molloy came down the next day, and the goods were taken away—somebody that they employed in the place superintended the goods being taken away; I never went nigh the place at all—they remained, I should think, three or four days till the goods were taken away—Burrell, the carrier, fetched them there, and fetched them away as well—I never saw anything of Simmons, or Samuel Marks, after the goods had been taken away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">for Simmons.</hi> relied upon the same objection; if the legislature had contem<lb></lb>plated any other person than a bankrupt being guilty of this offence, they would have stated so in express terms, and used the words "if any person," instead of, "any bankrupt;" in the case of concealing the birth, the words of the statute were, "if any woman shall conceal," etc., and there was an express section to enable a man to be convicted as an accessary to that offence; he also relied strongly upon the objection, that until the bankrupt had passed his last examina<lb></lb>tion, the felony was not complete within the meaning of the statute, and although the case of Rex v.

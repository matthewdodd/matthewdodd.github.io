On Tuesday the 20th of October, the prisoner and a woman came to hire a chaise of me; they said they had hired chaises of a Mr. Warren before, but he being out had recommended them to me; the prisoner wanted the chaise the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090012"></xptr> next morning. I asked his address; he said, No. 6, Duke-street, Smithfield. I sent and enquired after him, and heard a good character of him. I took it on Thursday morning myself; he said it was to go to a common (I forget the name) two miles below Woolwich; he said he should return by seven or eight in the evening; I said then, I would send my man to bring it home; he bid me do so, and he would send me the money for the hire of the chaise. I sent my man at eight in the evening; he staid till ten, but the chaise did not come. I heard nothing of it till the Saturday following, and on Monday I saw my horse and chaise which I had let to the prisoner at the George in Drury-lane, in the possession of one Nelson. It was that which I let to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I was sent for on Thursday night to the Blue Boar in Holborn. I did not go that night; I went at eleven o'clock the next morning; I was then applied to by the prisoner to buy some articles of furniture, as I am a broker; then he mentioned a horse and chaise; he was exceedingly drunk; I did not care to deal with him; I thought he had borrowed the chaise, and was going to dispose of it. I went to the public office in Bow-street, and gave information of it, and the horse and chaise was removed to the George in Drury-lane. I was at the George on the Monday, when Mr. Smith saw the horse and chaise; it was the same that had been offered to me. The prisoner was very drunk at all the different times that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>There was another person in company, I believe, a Mrs. Grant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She and you have been long acquainted, I believe? - No. I never saw her but once before.</p>
               <p>Was not there a good deal of joking conversation between you and her about the horse and chaise? - No.</p>
               <p>You remember the cypher on the chaise; did not you say it was her husband's chaise? - No; she said so.</p>
               <p>Have not you been the fabricator of this business? - I have been the fabricator so far as this; I went to the public office in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Do you believe the man was so drunk that he did not know what he was about? - I believe he meant to return it when he was sober .</p>

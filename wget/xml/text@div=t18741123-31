                  </hi>. I understand English a little, not much—I was a seaman on board a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta</hi>—I shipped on board her in March last at Akyab, in the Bay of Bengal—I don't know in which month the ship arrived in England—there was a seaman on board named Fugeer</p>

I am a Lascar—I think thirty-three of us altogether shipped from Akyab, all Lascars; a Serang shipped us, Mahomed Abdul, and he came to England with us—the only English on board were two mates, one captain and two boys, five altogether—the deceased was quite in good health when he shipped, the same like me—he did his work quickly and readily of course, he was not lazy, none of the Lascars were lazy; they did their work readily of course—the captain say "He very lazy, he very lazy," he say "lazy" to everybody, but we no lazy, I work before in another ship like this ship, when we got to work of course we did well, when no work we stop in our place—the captain always called us dirty black men, I was not dirty; how do I know if my companions were: sometimes when we are at work at that time we are dirty, but of</p>

Turn to and go and wash the deck;" at first we did not, and afterwards the captain told the Serang to turn to and wash the deck and everybody has gone to work and did it—we did turn to directly the captain ordered us—I am not Englishman, Sir, I am black man; I can't understand proper English, what I understand I answer, what I don't understand I can't answer—I did not see Ameroodee go up to the captain in a threatening attitude—when he got sick I see him sometimes go for medicine—I did not see him go up to the captain when he was ordered to wash the deck—I see the captain strike him, not at that time, I can't say proper that time he hit him; I did not see what he went for at that time—I can't understand what "threatening" means.</p>

Until they arrived—I saw the captain strike him five or six days before we arrived—I saw it, I think that was after we left Cork—the pilot came on board at Cork—when the pilot came on board the captain was striking the men, he did not strike them before the pilot, the pilot was aft and he came forward and struck them—all the men saw it, it was with a rope on the back—the last time I saw the captain strike Fugeer Ali with the belaying pin was I think twenty or twenty-five days before we got to Cork; after that he struck him with—the rope, but he did not strike him with the pin after that—I will swear it was not more than twenty or twenty-five days—the head bled—he was pumping and the captain said he was not. pumping hard, he was not using his strength—the Lascars were neither very good Lascars nor very bad—I signed articles as <hi rend="italic">burra-lindal</hi> or chief boatswain's mate—I had been to sea before, I have always done Serangs work—I have been in sea-going ships—I have been from Calcutta to Jedda, a port in the Red Sea—I have been ten times to the Mauritius and five times to England, twice as a Lascar and three times as a tindal.</p>

I was second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta</hi>, and sailed with her on the voyage from Akyab to London—I joined her in Bahia at the Brazils, and went with her from Bahia to Akyab—besides myself, there were on board nine men, Europeans, and two boys, who are here now—at Akyab we shipped a crew of thirty-two or thirty-three' Lascars, I don't know which—Fugeer Ali was one of. them—I observed him when he came on board; he was in good health—after leaving Akyab, about a month, as near as I can remember, I saw the captain beat him with the rope's end, and with his open hand, and sometimes with a wooden belaying pin—he struck him on the head-with the belaying pin, sometimes on the arm, and sometimes on the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>—they were pretty smart blows—the first time the captain struck him I saw blood come out of his head, all over him—he generally struck him morning and evening, but it was continually kept up; I don't remember how often—we pumped the water out of the vessel every day and every watch at night—one day, about a month before we got home, I saw the captain strike Fugeer Ali three heavy blows one after the other on the head with a wooden belaying pin; the blood came out all over his head and shoulders—I did not overhaul his head—I did not see him use the belaying pin on Fugeer Ali again in this way between the first time and the time just before we got to England<lb></lb>I can only mention twice that I saw him myself, but I saw him strike him with the rope's" end and his open hand all about his shoulders and head and legs—on one occasion I saw him strike him twice with his open hand on the ears—on coming home one of his ears swelled up a great deal; it was greatly swollen up, and towards the latter end of the <hi rend="italic">voyage</hi>, a month before we got in here, he was not fit for anything—he was not fit to work, he was getting so weak and so unwell; whether he was diseased or not, I do not know—he was always complaining about being unwell.</p>

I never sailed with a Lascar crew before—we had not nasty weather in the bay of Bengal; as near as I can remember, about eight weeks we had hardly any wind—after that, from the Mauritius to the Cape, we had squally, cold weather—she was a large vessel of 1,279 tonnage—she was not a good sailer—we were a little over six months in making the voyage; it is an average voyage of about four months and a half—when I first went on board I did not notice Fugeer Ali particularly, so that I cannot say what his appearance was as regards health—the head of this lot of Lascars was the Serang; his name was Abdul, I believe—it was his duty to keep the men in order under the officers of the vessel—the Lascars are a difficult lot to manage, if you have to go amongst men able to speak no English, and you can't speak the native language—they were a lazy, sleepy lot, and they would sleep. for a week towards the latter end of the voyage, whether blowing or not, but not when they left Akyab—towards the latter end of the voyage they were a dirty lot too; that was after we got in bad weather, two months and a half or a month and a half before we got home; when we wanted</p>

               <p>the most work out of them they were the least inclined to do any—there were great complaints about their filth in their berths—about eight of them used to make their berths filthy, instead of leaving them for natural purposes—there was a great deal of difficulty, in fact it was not possible at times, to make them work—I myself have been obliged to rope's end them; as far as I know I never injured any of them—a decent, orderly crew of eighteen English seamen could have brought this vessel to England—a good many of these Lascars did not understand their work, and a good many of them shipped as able seamen who knew nothing whatever about their duties—two of them were shipped as steersmen, and they could not steer—the captain was a good deal on deck morning and night; it was an anxious kind of voyage to him, with a crew of that kind—I have seen the captain take the wheel myself in bad weather—I can steer, and I have steered the vessel too the first mate, Shurtz, has also steered—I do not know anything of one of the Lascars drawing a knife upon the captain—I saw one of the men who fell overboard draw a wooden belaying pin on the mate one day; the mate was getting the jib out at the time, and he had ordered the man to look after the halyards or one of the ropes; instead of fastening the rope with the belaying pin, which I saw him take from the rail, he hove it off and let go of it—he did no t actually hit the mate, and I believe the mate took the pin away from him—I might have had good reason to complain of Fugeer Ali myself, but I don't remember having done so—I have got him out of his berth for the purpose of doing his work, and directly my back was turned he would be off again—that occurred constantly for about a month before we got to London—I had not to complain of him before that—the captain was a good seaman, and always at his post—we were short of food for about a month and a half, and we were obliged to break into a cargo of rice.</p>

I am Missionary to the Asiatics of London—on Sunday, 20th September, I was at the Home, I saw Fugeer Ali there, he was in bed, he was very ill indeed, he appeared to be almost in a dying state, he spoke very feebly—Sergeant Hansom came there, and in consequence of what he said I put to Fugeer Ali all the officer's questions, he gave distinct answers to each; the questions were put twice over and answers given, the same in each case—the officer wrote each answer down, or appeared to do so, and Fugeer Ali put his mark after it was read over to him—we went through it with him, we went over the questions and answers—the questions were not written down, but the answers were—afterwards the prisoner and the mate were brought in—the sergeant then asked the same questions again; he looked at his paper and asked the same questions again through me, and I put the same questions over again to Fugeer Ali and elicited the same answers—after we had been through those questions they shifted the captain and the mate into each other's places to test the mind of the sick man, and asked some of the questions over again, such as "Which is the mate," "Which is the captain," "Who struck you," and so on, and he indicated one or the other just the same—he answered correctly the same as he had done at first.</p>

On the voyage, about a month and a half after we left Akyab, the first mate beat me on the head with a capstan bar, about two months ago; this occurred daily; he also struck me in the belly with the belaying pin. The mate struck me on the arm with the belaying pin; this was continued all the way to London. The captain struck me on the left ear with an iron belaying pin, and when I fell down he kicked me in the loins; this occurred daily. I believe I am dying. I was a strong hearty man when I began the voyage. I have been at sea two years. I was never impudent or mutinous."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon practicing in the East India Road—on 19th September I was called to the Stranger's Asiatic Home, and saw the deceased Fugeer Ali—I also saw him next day, Sunday—his general condition was very emaciated and very weak—he had a depression of the bridge of the nose as if the nose was broken, and a scar extending from the top of the head backwards about four inches, the scalp, at the upper end being considerably raised, with a scab on it, and surrounded by dense thickening over an area of an inch in all directions—the wound on the bead was not wholly healed, a scab covered a certain part at the top of the raised portion—the unhealed part was covered by a scab; it was still a wound covered over with a scab; both ears were thickened, and in the left was an abscess which had discharged a little, both matter and blood, but it never emptied itself till two or three days after—it was an ordinary abscess, not very bad; it was about the size of a walnut—the right ear had a scar as well as thickening—I could see no scar on the left ear, but there was an abscess in it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230038"></xptr>
               <p>there were three other scars on the head, one about an inch long, and two others about half that length, quite healed—he had an abrasion on the left leg, and sores on both legs, and both fore arms—they were also healed, except the abrasion I mentioned before—he indicated pain in his belly, which was swollen and distended by fluid—his gums indicated that he was suffering from scurvy, but not badly—that was the only indication of scurvy I saw about him—the wounds and marks on the head and nose could not have been produced by any cause which I could account for except violence—I attribute the condition of the ear to concussion from a blow; a blow from this belaying pin would be sufficient to explain it, and the blows on the head too, except the smaller one—I know no case of abscess arising from poorness of blood and short diet—the smaller wounds were quite healed, and had probably been healed a couple of months—they must have been the result of blows—supposing the abscess to have been produced by a blow, I cannot form any judgment as to how long before the blow was given—it had discharged, from time to time, before I saw it, so that it had emptied itself and re-filled, but repeated blows would keep it alive—the large wound on the head had none of the character of an old scar, but I feel it impossible to put a date to it—he was in great danger the first two days I saw him from extreme exhaustion—I attended him day by day from his admission, and did everything I could for him, but he died on 5th October—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on 6th October, but discovered no other marks of violence than those I saw during life—he bad dropsy of the bladder, resulting from chronic disease of the liver—he had also evidence of old peritonitis and enlargement of spleen, which attends that same disease of the liver—under the scab on the scalp I found a channel or <hi rend="italic">sinus</hi> leading down to the covering of the bone, and around the opening the thickened fibrous remains of an injury—the contusion around accounted for the thickening which was noticed prior to the death—there was not much cutting about the face—when the scalp was cut into a copious discharge of serum escaped, that was the result of the attack of erysipelas on 30th September, which arose from the abscess and the wound in the left ear—the immediate cause of death was erysipelas—the brain and its membranes were perfectly healthy—the spleen was very much enlarged, some blood was effused into its structure, and its surface adhered to the walls of the abdomen from peritonitis, which is a common consequence of disease of the liver—the right lung was closely adhering to the lining of the chest; the lungs were in a similar condition to the scalp, and there was some bronchitis—there was no contagious disease, but there was a discharge of matter from the scalp which might produce disease in another person—assuming that the abscess was caused by the wound on the head which was caused by a blow, and the erysipelas supervened, I am of opinion that the death was caused by the blow received—that would be the more likely looking at the state of health in which I believed him to be—the discharge from the abscess would be weakening to a very slight degree—wounds on the head bleed profusely, and would therefore further weaken a patient.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. My opinion is, that the abscess in the ear was the proximate cause of death; that is, that it brought on erysipelas, which produced death; that is my calm medical opinion—I know no natural cause calculated to produce an abscess in that part of the ear—the construction of the ear is exceedingly delicate, but the abscess was in the part external to the head, not in the part run<lb></lb>ning</p>

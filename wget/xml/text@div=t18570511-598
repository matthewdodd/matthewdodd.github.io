               <p>knowledge is derived from what I actually saw her write—I saw her writing; I did not have it in my hand, but I saw it before her, and I looked at it as my attention was drawn to it—I did not read it—I read little words, but not a sentence or anything of that kind, my glance was so casual—it was about the second week in May, 1855, that she acknowledged some writing to be her's; I had had so many anonymous communications in the same handwriting that these are in, that I had occasion to go to the Magistrate about them; I taxed the prisoner with being the author of them; she asked me my ground for so doing, and I said, "This bill, Miss Hamilton, which you acknowledge to be your handwriting, is so exactly like the writing in the letters that I received, that I can form no other opinion but that you are the author of them"—she said, "I am not, the bill is my writing"—she said she supposed some one had been employed to copy her writing—I have not got the bill with me; it was seen by others, and acknowledged in the presence of others to be her handwriting—I have formed a very great opinion of her handwriting from that circumstance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the City of London—I have been employed for some time in endeavouring to trace letters of this kind—I took the prisoner into custody on Wednesday, 22nd April; Thain was with me—she was taken to the station; I told her we took her into custody on suspicion of writing these abominable, disgusting letters to Messrs. Welch and Margetson, and numerous other persons in the City—she said, "How can you say so, Mr. Bull? how can you prove it?"—she was living at No. 5, Bridge water Square, at this time—I received this key from the female searcher—I asked the prisoner if it was her key; she said, "Yes," of her room door—I found it open the room where she lived—I went there with Thain, accompanied by Mr. Bruff, the landlord box there I found these two letters, one addressed to Mr. Simmons, No. 21, Gutter Lane, Post-office; and the other, "For the person who conducts the stock and mantle business;" one of them is of the most filthy description—on 1st Dec., I saw the prisoner write a letter which I have here—I have also another letter addressed to me at the police station; I spoke to the pri<lb></lb>soner about that letter the same day that I received it—I said, "I have received this letter from you, Miss Hamilton;" she said, "Yes, I wanted to see you, Mr. Bull"—to the best of my belief, these two letters of 24th March and 1st April, are in her handwriting—I also produce two letters which I found in a cupboard at Mrs. Burley's—I went there in consequence of what the pri<lb></lb>soner said—when Thain and I waited on the prisoner, and told her we were very anxious to find out this matter, the prisoner said, "If you searched for stolen property you would find it, would you not?"—I said, "Yes, if it was in the house"—she said, "Well, if you go to Mrs. Burley's, I have no doubt you will find some letters there"—we made an appointment to go there with her; we wanted to go at once, but she said, "No, you had better go in the evening," which we did, about 9 o'clock—the prisoner went in first—Thain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110050"></xptr>
               <p>and I went in seven or eight minutes afterwards—I looked over the room, and she said, "Look in the cupboard, Mr. Bull, look in the cupboard;" I did so, and there found these two letters; they were at the corner of the cupboard in a saucer; I believe these to be in her handwriting—Mrs. Burley was in the room; I should say she was drunk; from inquiries I made, I find she drinks about sixty pennyworths of rum a day—she is a fortune teller—upon these letters being found, she said in the prisoner's presence, "It is a plant upon me; I know nothing of them"—Mrs. Burley was taken into custody, and remanded for a week, and was then discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I can only say it is all entirely false; when it first commenced I was working in the City; they were determined to ruin me; at every house where I was at work they would send in these letters, to myself, and also to the people of the house; the consequence was, I had to give up my work at several warehouses; Mr. Hellaby's, Mr. Blenkiron's, and others; it has been going on for several years; they used to send girls to work for me, who would stay till dinner time, and then go away, and always took something with them; they have taken my books, and even torn leaves out of my books; I believe it to be done by somebody who owes me a grudge; why do not they produce the parties to whom the money was to be sent? surely, if I was the person, that was to have the money, they would know me; the officers tried very hard to force money upon me, which I refused, as it was merely a snare to make out that I was extorting money; the letter to Mr. Simmonds was enclosed in one addressed to Emily Taylor, a girl who worked for me; they have produced the enclosure, but they do not produce the other which was on my desk—(<hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES THAIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> We saw no such letter as she refers to.)—All I can say is, I never wrote the letters; and as for that book, I do not see why I should mutilate my own book, when I had plenty of writing paper in my desk at the time; no person ever presumed to identify me with these letters till 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward was offered, and I believe it has been done by the officers to get the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for they said they were sure, if I would assist them, they would find it out; I do not know whether my handwriting does resemble any of these letters, but I will ask you to look at the letters I sent to the officer Bull, and see; I had occasion to write to him frequently, why does he not show my letters?—(<hi rend="italic">The letter written by the prisoner in Bull's presence was put in, and the letter sent to Bull was read, as follows: "Mr. Bull, if you can step round for one moment, it would greatly oblige me. I wish to ask you just one question, and will not detain you long.</hi>")</p>

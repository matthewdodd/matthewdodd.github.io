                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Messrs. Knight &amp; Co., engravers, of 13 and 16, King's Head Court, Shoe Lane—on the morning of 29th June I went to a marine store dealer's, in Shoe Lone, and saw some brass which had been taken from a room of my masters'—the prisoner lives in the same house—my masters occupy the top port of the house; and, in a room at the top, the brass cuttings were kept.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Commercial-road. I produce two pieces of cotton; one of them I took in from the prisoner Parker, and I have no doubt the other was pawned by her - I knew her by frequenting the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When was the one piece pawned by her? A. On the 15th of October; the prosecutor came to see if he could find any of his property in our stock; I don't think he put a mark on this piece the first time he came, but I believe he did the second; either he or his foreman came again; the first time they came, he examined this piece, and found some private mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not mark it the second time? A. I think he did; I believe he took the measure the first time, to see what length it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do I understand you to say, that the prosecutor put a mark on this remnant the second time he came to the shop? A. I believe he did - I will not swear he did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear whether he did or not? A. I do not remember.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutor; I went to the pawnbroker's, and on looking at the goods by candle-light, I thought I discovered marks on this piece, but I was not certain; I could see a mark on this other - I know them to be my master's, from my own marks being on them; they had been taken from the pile in the warehouse - Parry was employed as porter to pack up and to carry out goods occasionally.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you seen this brown remnant last? A. It might be three months; I cannot tell what hands it had gone through after that; I will not swear when I had seen it in the warehouse - I first saw this piece at the pawnbroker's on the 26th of October - I did not quite identify it then, from seeing the marks by candle-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you so recognise it then, that you would presume to swear to it? A. I did; I went a second time, because I had seen it first by candle-light, and I could not distinctly make out one of the marks; I said I saw a mark immediately, and I recognised it faintly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear to me most positively, that the first time you examined this, you recognized it to be your master's; and did I not ask you why you went a second time, if you could recognise it the first? A. I went five times to satisfy myself; I saw marks faintly, but being by candle-light, I was not certain.</p>

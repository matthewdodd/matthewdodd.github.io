               <p>Q. You are a widow we understand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it that this happened at your shop, that you have come to relate? - The 20th day of last July, about three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160030"></xptr>o'clock in the afternoon; the two prisoners came into the shop to look at some muslin handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at this time? - Only myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them by sight before, or were they strangers to you? - Entire strangers.</p>
               <p>Q. On their asking to look at some muslin handkerchiefs, what did you do? - I shewed them some, they bought one, and paid me a shilling in part.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price they agreed for? - Half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both bargain with you? - They both whispered together, but it was Hill that bought the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the earnest? - Herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about it? -She told me she would give me the shilling, and she would come again by and by, and have the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. That you agreed to, did you? - Yes; then after a little while they left the shop and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they seen any other articles than the muslin handkerchiefs? - They looked at some cottons, a great many; they took them up in their hands as they hung up, and asked the price.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they look at as they hung up? - Cottons for gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. But they did not bargain with you for any of the cottons? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in your shop altogether at this time; what time do you imagine they staid? - I cannot say justly, it might be ten minutes,</p>
               <p>Q. And then they went out together? - Yes, both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you miss any thing, either during the time that they staid in your shop, or after they were gone? - Neither, till a gentleman came to the door, and asked me if I had lost any thing (Mr. Algar.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long after they wore gone, did Mr. Algar come to your door? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a neighbour of your's? - No, I never see him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence of some enquiry from Mr. Algar, did you then miss any thing? - Yes, I looked immediately, and desired him to run after them.</p>
               <p>Q. On Mr. Algar's coming to you, what was it you missed from your shop? - The first was dimity, that stood in the window, and a gentleman's worked muslin handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss the handkerchief from? - It hung in the window also.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you acquainted Mr. Algar of this, and he went in pursuit you understood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see them come into the shop, and you see them go out of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had they of taking these things, and your not observing them? - I did not see them, the door is at the edge of the window, and I was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the door face the counter? - It is at the end, the counter goes up end ways to the window, and the door is at the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed only these two articles then? - Not then I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see any of the prisoners? - Mr. Algar ran after them, and brought them back in a very short time, it might be five or ten minutes</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before Mr. Algar brought the prisoners back, and after he had given you the alarm, missed any thing else? - No, I did not look, I was so surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring them back to your shop, do you mean that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought to your shop, what passed? - There were another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160031"></xptr>or two with Mr. Algar, one was Mr. Pearce, and the other was a person named Hobdill, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought back to your shop, was there any search made? - The constable was with them, and they searched them, and then took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them searched? - No, I did not, I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when they came back? - I asked them why they robbed me of my goods? they said they had got none; and while we were talking Mr. Algar brought the goods in himself; the constable was in before with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Algar bring the prisoners back, or the constable? - The constable came in with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Algar bring with him? - He brought all the property with him, some cambrick which I sell at twelve shillings a yard, near two yards of it, not quite; the dimity that I had missed from the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not missed the cambrick till that time? - No; another muslin handkerchief I missed, and a dirty yard of muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring the muslin handkerchief likewise? - Yes, altogether, and about a yard of muslin, and a lace cap.</p>
               <p>Q. As to two of these articles you had missed them before, but what do you say to the cambrick, the yard of muslin, and lace cap how do you know they were your's? - They were in the shop before, I am sure of it; they had been in a box where I had been taking some handkerchiefs out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that box stand? - On the counter, where I was shewing them the handkerchiefs out of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the handkerchief which Hill had agreed for, was not the handkerchief that was taken away? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them in the same box? - While I was looking the handkerchiefs out I see them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you see them then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not missed them before Algar returned? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see them first afterwards? - As soon as Mr. Algar brought them in.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things that were so found? - They tossed them over the pales before he got at them.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you now as to your own knowledge, what became of the articles after they were produced at your shop? - Tied up in an handkerchief, and the constable took them with him.</p>

               <p>Q. And they are here I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. You say you are a widow woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any family live with you? - I had one daughter, but she was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner in your business? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you taken any account of your goods in your shop? - About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold any article in the course of that day, the same sort as these we are talking about? - I don't know that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear to the best of your recollection, that you had not sold any articles of the same quality in the course of that day? - I can, upon my word.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons do you think might have been in your shop, and purchased different articles, in the course of that day? - Nothing of that sort as I know of that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Hill was the person that looked at this box, that my lord has been asking about? - Yes, she was the person.</p>

               <p>I am a plumber and glazier, and headborough of Hoxton. On Monday, the 10th of July, I was going with some goods of my own business into French-row, to do a job; I see Mr. Algar running very fast, and I enquired of a girl that stood by what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of any informations you received, join Mr. Algar? - No, I went an opposite way, thinking to meet any body that be might be in pursuit of; I went past the green gate, Mr. Algar went up Ratcliff row, I went up the City-road, and looked into a field, where I supposed that the prisoners might have come, for I apprehended in my own mind, that they came down St. George's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation is the field that joins George's-row? - North west of the green gate; I see the two prisoners in that field, and I suspected them, and I approached them slowly, expecting to see the man that was in pursuit of them overtake them, which accordingly I did; when he came up to them, he said something of this nature, it is you that have stole the goods, or something like it, I cannot exactly recollect the words; and Elizabeth Hill swore at him, and made a blow at him;

             I thought behaved in a very becoming manner, she cried; I told Hill that if she made any piece of work, that I would tie them both together, I shewed her that I was an officer, and they came along with me, I took them to the prosecutrix's house (Mrs. Tidd's) I searched their pockets, and found a number of duplicates, but nothing that was of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the property was picked up in the field? - No, I see something white laying in the field, at the distance I suppose of eighty yards from the place where I stood and where I took them; my feet were almost as high as the sence; and I said to Mr. Algar, you had better go and fetch the goods, for fear they should be takes away; this was pretty near to Mrs. Tidd's house, and he went and brought the goods; what I have got in this bundle. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Tidd own them? - Yes, she owned them immediately, she said they were her goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were produced before the magistrate, and you have had the care of them? - Yes, I have had the care of them ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. So the distance where something white was discovered, was about eighty yards?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after before you see something white again? - As nigh as I can judge about six or seven minutes, I cannot tell to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Hill was pretty violent, she made use of her tongue, the other prisoner conducted herself very becoming? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hill. This gentleman told me when he came up, that I had wronged a woman; I said I had not, they did not lay hold of our hands, nor nothing, but we walked to the shop, and they searched us, and found nothing on us.</p>

               <p>I am a goldsmith, No. 3, opposite St. George's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say respecting the present indictment? - I was passing at the time; I went down George's-row when I heard the cry of stop thief, I was going to pass it till I heard the noise; I see the two prisoners come running before me</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the row when you first see them - Yes, and Mr. Algar; I see him behind them, and he hallooed out stop thief! and I see two women come running, and I did not offer to stop them, because I was afraid indeed. When they came up to me, which was in St. George's-row, where I stood, they turned round the corner, and then threw some things over into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them throw any thing in the field? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say which it was? - No, I cannot positively say that, it was one of the two, but which I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it like? - It appeared to me like linen, white.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from the place? - I did not take particular notice, but I look on it it was about ten or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do on seeing it? - I walked down into the field where they ran to after they had thrown the things over.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it one or both that threw the things over? - It was but one as I observed, but which it was I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see them do? - After one had thrown the things over, they then ran down the field, by the side of it, Mr. Algar he went after them into the field, and I walked down after them into the field myself, and then I see Mr. Pearce come across the field, and he took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the picking up of the articles - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not go back with Algar? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You never see the things at all till you got to Mrs. Tidd's? - I did not see them at Mrs. Tidd's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to Mrs. Tidd's? - Not that day, but I see the things before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at the time the things were thrown over, you were ten or fifteen yards distant; how far might you be from the corner, where the turning was? - I suppose about five yards from the corner.</p>

               <p>Q. Had they thrown the things before you turned the corner or after? - I did not turn the corner, they turned the corner; it was after they turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you see them do it? - Yes, I did, they had turned the corner, and I was opposite them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always told the same story; did you tell Mr. Williams that you see them throw what they did throw over into the field? - Yes. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told Mr. William's exactly as you said now? - Yes, exactly, to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him that you see the prisoner in the field, but whether they had thrown away the things or not, you did not know? - No, not to my knowledge, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago were you examined before the justice? - I did not set down the time, it may be four, five or six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say whether you said so or not before the justice? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hill. The magistrate took him back to lock me up, because he would not answer, they asked him a great many questions before he would say any thing.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160036"></xptr>(Mrs. Tidd deposes to the things, as all having her marks on them, and were in the window, and in the box from which she shewed the handkerchief that the prisoner Hill bargained for.)</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Tidd. What is the lowest value of all these things together, that you can set on them? - Two pounds fourteen shillings and eight-pence was my selling price.</p>
               <p>Jury. What would they cost you? - About two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long might you have had these articles in your shop, may you have had them a twelvemonth? - Not a twelvemonth, I might have had some of them six months.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of dimity is there? - Eight yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hill. Sarah Dancer and I were walking up Old street, and I passed by that gentlewoman's door; we came down a turning, but what turning it was I don't know; we passed by this gentlewoman's door, and I saw this handkerchief at the window, and I went in and asked the price of it, she asked me half a crown, and I bid her two and four-pence, she said she could not take it; then after that a woman came in for half a yard of flannel, and she asked me if I was in any particular hurry? and I told her no; she told the woman she had no flannel; the woman asked her if she had any tape; the woman bought some quantity of tape of her, but what I cannot tell; I told her I would not trouble her for nothing; I bargained with her for a bed gown, and she asked me two shillings a yard, and I did not approve of the bad-gown, and I gave her a shilling off the handkerchief; she took out a piece of the bed-gown to see if I would approve of it, I said I would consider of it; I came out of the shop, and went down the street; I don't know what street it was, I see a mob, Sarah Dancer, and I made up to the mob, there were about seven or eight people, I cannot tell exactly how many; and that gentleman in a white coat tapped me on the shoulder, and said I must go along with him; I asked him where? he said I had robbed a gentlewoman; I went with them to the prosecutrix's house, and then they asked me if I had any objection to take off my things? and I said no, and they took me into a passage, and took off all my things, and they told me to put them all on again, and I did, and then they got a coach and put me into the watch-house, and then they took me before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Dancer called five witnesses who gave her a good character, said she worked at childrens pump making.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Hill called two witnesses to her character, and said that she had lived in service.</p>

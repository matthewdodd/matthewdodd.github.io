                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Henry Tuff, a clothier, in Richard-street, Woolwich. On Saturday, 2nd Aug., I missed from the shop window a black cloth Oxonian coat—it is an open window, the coat could be reached from the outside—I have since gone through the stock, and missed three pairs of trowsers, a waistcoat, and another coat.</p>

               <p>on 3rd Aug., in the name of Mary Furness—I have also a pair of black trowsers—I did not take them in, I found them in our stock—I have a black cloth Oxonian coat, that was taken in by our young man—he is not here—he was not bound over.</p>

I searched the prisoner's house, No. 11, Myrtle-place, Albert-road, Woolwich—I did not know they were living there until I went—I found them living there as man and wife—I searched a box in their bed room, and found this waist-coft and pair of black trowsers (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I found twelve duplicates in a small box in the same room; four of them relate to the articles in question—I asked Furness where he got the trowsers and waistcoat from, and some other things that were there—he said his tailor made the suit of clothes up at the dockyard—I asked where the tailor lived—he said he did not know exactly—I did not take away the things then—I followed after Roche, she was taken on another charge—I afterwards went back to the room, and found the things—I had locked up the room, and had the key—there were a great quantity of things stolen from different shops, which I have got in my possession now.</p>

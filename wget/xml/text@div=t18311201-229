               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JOHNSTON. I live in Addle-street. On the 20th of September the prisoner came to my house, and said he wanted a piece of black cloth, and black kerseymere for a cash customer of his westward; I sent them by a porter - the prisoner and I met the porter at Dimsdale's, St. Ann's, chop-house; the goods were delivered to him, in my presence: we dismissed the porter there, and the prisoner took the goods out under his arm - he did not tell me where they were going, but said it was a cash customer in that neighbourhood; he said he was going to sell them for cash to a customer of his; he came back with the goods, and said he had failed in selling them; he proposed as we had dismissed the porter, that he should leave them at Dimsdale's all night - I agreed; I saw him two or three days after, and proposed sending for them - he said I was not known at the house, and they would not deliver them to me; I saw him again in a few days, and said they ought to be sent for - he said he would send for them; I saw him again in a day or two - he told me he had sent Cleasby for them with a written order; on seeing him again, he said he had sent Cleasby with a note for them, but they refused to deliver them, not knowing his hand-writing - I called at Dimdale's the next day but one; I saw the prisoner in the City afterwards, and told him he had told me a falsehood, for Dimsdale had told me they had been gone this ten days or a fortnight, and that he, Sykes, had taken them away - he said I was mistaken, that he had taken them from Dimsdale's, and left them with Burrows, a tailor, for cash: I inquired who Burrows was - he said he was an intimate friend and companion of

            's, who I knew; I said, "If so he must be a highly respectable man" - I saw him again in a day or two afterwards, and urged the necessity of his calling on Burrows, for the cash or telling me where he lived, that I might call myself, and get it - he said Burrows was gone over to Boulogne on an excursion with Mr. Thompson, and would not be back for a week; I at last called at Thompson's, and when I met the prisoner again, I told him Mr. Thompson's man did not seem to know Burrows - he said that was all nonsense,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010104"></xptr>that the foreman did not know all Mr. Thompson's acquaintances; he told me afterwards that Thompson and Burrows had returned, and he would go for the money - he came back, and told me they had slept but one night in town, and had gone out on a shooting party; I at last gave him into custody - I was to have had the money immediately after the 20th of September, but for his representations; Cleasby was taken up by me on another charge, and in his possession was found a duplicate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he returned and said he had not met with the cash customers, why did you not have the goods back? A. He proposed that they should be left at the house, and we should send the porter for them next day, as he was gone; I conceived he was then bound to send them home - if he had sold them for cash the next day, I should not have found any fault.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have given him credit for them if he had sold them? A. No; he was my agent only - he was bound to sell only in my name, and with my invoice; that was our general agreement - he never sold on his own account, to my knowledge; I did not furnish him with an invoice, because I expected the goods back - if he had met with a customer he was to make out an invoice in my name, and give a receipt in my name, as my agent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you keep a warehouse in Addle-street? A. It is a warehouse for me and others; a general deposit for two or three different people - Wilkinson keeps the warehouse; I have been there about six months - I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act about eighteen months ago; I seldom have so little as 50l. worth of goods at the warehouse - I dare say I have that amount now, but will not swear it, as I have been so engaged in this business; the prisoner was in my employ- his employment ceased when I discovered this; it commenced about the 10th or 12th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some dissolution of a connexion between you before? A. I trusted him with some small commissions, and gave him credit for some small sums; I never employed him to pawn goods for me, or to get them pawned - there was a written agreement between us when I dismissed him, which was about the 8th or 10th of November; and after I made a charge against him at Worship-street, I destroyed that agreement, because I dismissed him; he had lost my confidence, and I tore it up in his presence - the charge at Worship-street was about two other cloths; I think that was on the 2nd of November -(looking at three papers) these are my hand-writing; I believe this invoice is all my writing, except the signature of Sykes - here is my own signature; the prisoner came to Worship-street of his own accord one day, and I agreed to let him go, on the 2nd of November, without bail, and he was to come on the Monday - he came again in the meantime, and was detained on another charge; he came one day when I did not attend; I had told him I would not, in consequence of promises - I preferred this charge at the Mansion-house, on the 24th of November, I think; I had my suspicions about this cloth when at Worship-street, but had not seen Thompson himself - I knew a duplicate had been found on the 5th of November, but did not know it was for my cloth; I received the duplicate from Cleasby, about the 8th or 9th of November - 9l. 10s. had been obtained on the cloth: the prisoner was not present when I received the duplicate - I got a duplicate for 10l. from Sykes, about the 8th of November; it was after I had got the first from Cleasby, and after he was at Worship-street- it is dated the 29th of October; I had both these duplicates when I agreed not to appear at Worship-street - I got the one dated in October after he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not get that ticket from him the very morning of the day you was to appear against him? A. No, I am certain I did not get it till after I was to appear against him at Worship-street; I will not swear it was not on the same day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who did you receive it from? A.From the prisoner, about the 8th; I did not prefer this charge till the 24th - I had seen him several times between the 8th and 24th, and never took any steps.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not receive from him, 4l. in money? A. I did after his discharge - I mean after the time I had appeared against him; I received it on the 3rd or 4th; he was discharged on the 7th: I advanced him 10s. 6d. when he was discharged - I do not know that it was to pay his fees; I knew my cloth was gone, but I had not seen Thompson to ascertain if he knew Burrows.</p>

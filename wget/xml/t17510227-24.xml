             for 1. l. 10 s. the prisoner brought it. When I came to settle accounts with Mr. Revil he denied it, then I examined it more particularly, and look upon it to be extremely well forged; I should have been unwilling to have sworn it was not Mr. Revil's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Revil write?</p>
               <p>Hankey, Esq; No, I never did, but I am well acquainted with his hand writing; the prisoner was taken up for an attempt of the like kind, and he confessed to me he forged this very note for 1 l. 10 s. and also, after that, before the alderman at Guild-hall, and that he had also forged the other two draughts. He said he had no accomplice, saying, he was himself alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hopes of mercy to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Hankey, Esq; No, my lord, I did not ; he had no reasonable expectation of mercy, for he said he knew he should be hang'd.</p>

             he shew'd it to me; he observed upon it, it was a very small draught for Mr. Revil to draw, and said it was likely the balance of some account, but I had not at that time any reason to suppose it to be forg'd; it was given up by Mr. Revil, and return'd as not allow'd by him. The prisoner acknowledged it to be a forgery to me several times, and also before Mr. alderman Whitaker, before whom they were all three produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a voluntary confession?</p>
               <p>Cole. It was, my lord, before so much as a question was asked him. As he saw two or three people coming to him, he said he knew what they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270010"></xptr> came about, and he knew he should be hang'd for what he had done.</p>

               <p>Christopher Green. I live at the crown in St. Catherine's street. The prisoner at the bar came, I think, to lodge at my house on the 19th of Jan. he agreed with me for a room for his wife and two children; he staid 7 days; he owed me about 17 s. 9 d. he said he had got upwards of 40 l. due to him at Mr. Revil's, and being to go abroad, said he was afraid he should go away without it. He brought this note for 1 l. 10 s. desired I'd step with it, and he'd get ready; I was willing to get my money, so went to Sir

            . I have known the prisoner since the year 47; he was in my service as second clerk and behaved very honest. I recommended him to Mr. Revil as a person I had a good opinion of. I never, till this charge, heard any thing to his discredit.</p>

            . The prisoner came to Mr. Revil's in April, 1748, and lived with him till Midsummer last; I was his fellow clerk, and I know no dishonesty by him during that time.</p>
               <p>There were two other indictments against him for 20 l. each, drawn upon Sir Joseph and Company, but being found guilty, they were not tried.</p>

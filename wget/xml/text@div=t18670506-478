                  </hi>. I am a travelling inspector attached to the missing letter department of the General Post Office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier employed in the south-west district at Pimlico, and his walk was the Wilton Place walk—on the afternoon of 29th April I went to the district office, and shortly after six the prisoner was brought into the postmaster's room—he was about to go out on the six o'clock delivery—I asked him to let me see all his letters—he produced from his pouch two bundles tied up, arranged for delivery—I looked over them, and said, "I believe you were on duty here between twelve and one o'clock to-day, and you went out on your delivery to Wilton Place walk at that time?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you see anything of a letter directed to Mr. E. J. Lance, hatter, &amp;c, 12, Middle Row North, Knightsbridge, London?"—he said, "Yes; I delivered the letter at Mr. Lance's shopn—I said, "I am aware you delivered one letter there, but that is not the one I am speaking to you about"—he said, "I had but one letter for Mr. Lance"—I said, "There was another letter for Mr. Lance sorted to you, and you did not deliver it, and it was owing to so many complaints of letters being lost, containing stamps, notes, and other things, in your delivery that it was purposely sent to find out by whom they are taken"—he said, "I had but one letter for Mr. Lance, and that I delivered"—I then directed Rumbold the officer to search him, and raw him take from the inside of his coat pocket these two letters, one directed to Upper Charles Street, S.W.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060018"></xptr>
               <p>and another to Hunter Street, neither of them in his delivery; one con<lb></lb>tains postage stamps worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other stamps worth 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "How do you account for having these in your possession?"—he said, "I don't know anything about them"—I said, "It is very singular that they should have got into the inside of your coat pocket like that without your knowledge"—he repeated, "I don't know anything about them"—they bear the post-mark of the 29th—one was posted in London, and the other at Cheltenham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were they taken out of his pocket like this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were not open then, they were opened before the Magistrate—I don't recollect seeing any paper taken from his pocket—there is only one postman on his round after the first delivery in the morning; there are three in the morning—the letter in question has never been found—there was no hesitation about his answering as to these letters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the south<lb></lb>west district—the prisoner was employed there—on the afternoon of 29th April he was on duty there from about five minutes past four until about five minutes past six—it was his duty when the East Central bag arrived to cut it open, take the bundles out, open them, and place them before the stampers, and after they were stamped to clear them and pass them over to the sorters to be sorted—these two letters would have come in the East Central bag; it is not his duty to assist in the sorting, I can't say whether he did or not—after they are sorted they are cleared by a person appointed to clear them, and delivered to the letter-carriers to take out—these letters were not in the prisoner's walk, if they were missorted to him his duty would be to place them back to be resorted to their proper walks, he had no business to carry them out—he went out on his delivery about five minutes past six—I then communicated with Mr. Jeffreys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know how many letters were sorted to his delivery that did not belong to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; as far as I know, these might have been the only two—the prisoner has been in the service about twelve years—he came with a good character—when first I knew him I always considered him a man of very excellent character—I have been told he is married—I have heard he has been taking care of a house of Lord Alfred Paget's, in Grosvenor Place, for the last five years.</p>

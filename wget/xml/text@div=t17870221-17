               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Akers, hairdresser, in Spital-fields: on the 20th of January, on a Saturday evening, between four and five, coming out of Catherine-wheel-alley, I saw Farmer the prisoner, at Mr. Davis's shop-window, and the other at the lottery office window; the next door to Mr. Davis's; I made a stop, and looked at Farmer, when they saw me, they walked away; I saw no more of them till between ten and eleven the same night; I saw the window up; I saw Farmer take hold of the ham, and pull it, and Farmer saw me, and let it go; I believe Akers was by at the lottery-office, but I am not positive of that; then I saw Akers take the ham out of the window, and put it on his head.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you watched them? - Yes, I went over the way to Half-moon-alley, and I left my things at the oil shop, and told them what I left them for, and I saw Akers with the ham on his head, and I think Farmer was at the lottery-office window; I went and gave the alarm at the shop, and the man came from the back part of the shop, and asked which way they went; I told him they ran down Artillery-lane; we pursued them, and the patrol took Farmer the corner of Union-street, the new opening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Akers. Ask the boy if I was the person that was standing at the lottery-office window? - I am positive he was the person that was at the lottery-office window, which was very well illuminated, and there were lights in the other shops.</p>

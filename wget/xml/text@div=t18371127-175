                  </hi>. I am a saddler and harness-maker, and live in Berwick-street, Soho. The prisoner had been in my service from five to six months—he was employed to receive money—on the 20th of No<lb></lb>vember I sent him to one of my workmen, who was authorised to receive rents of some houses, to bring the money to me, with a message to collect further rents—he did not bring me the money he should have received, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not return the same day, but the day following—I then made inquiry and found he had received it—he ought to have accounted immediately on his return.</p>

                  </hi>. I had collected some money for Mr. Moriarty—on the 20th of November the prisoner came and received from me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid him to give to Mr. Moriarty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The money was converted to my own use, but I did not do it with a felonious intention—I had the money at home, but I had not reached home when I was taken—he met me in the street and gave me into custody—-my wife and brother brought the money down the following morning—had I been home, or to the shop, without accounting for the money, it would have been a different thing, but I could have replaced it—I had received greater sums of money than that for him—I never was guilty of a dishonest action.</p>

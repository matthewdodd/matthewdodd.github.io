            . I am one of the prosecutors travellers. I went to Long in prison, and told him he had sent a letter to the prosecutor, he said, Yes; I said "It is only an acknowledgement of your guilt, but it gives no explanation" - and I was come to know the extent of the robbery, and if he could tell me who else was concerned. I neither threatened or promised him; I said "Ashman is in custody," he said, "Yes," I said, "Do you think you have stolen five hundred pieces," he said he should think not, but it might be three hundred; that he generally took them out in the morning, and delivered them to Treble in Whitecross-street, and that he carried some home to his own house. Nothing was said about the satin papers in question.</p>

            . I have come from Clerkenwell prison, and am a paper-hanger. I lived at No. 232, Upper Thames-street. About sixteen years ago, I was introduced to Ashman. I was then a clerk in the Crown Office, and he was servant to Miss Thurlow, the late Lord Thurlow's daughter. In 1815, I took him to learn my business, he worked for Mr. Lawrence with me. About the beginning of this year, he asked me to assist in doing some painting at his brother's in Long-lane, Borough, which I did, and while we were there, we agreed to share in what work we each did. The last job we did was at Mr. Fox's, Blackfriar's-road. I procured paper for him to paper a house in Dorset-place, he gave me the job to paper it for him, as a journeyman, at so much a piece. I got the paper from Long, who was then porter to the prosecutors; one room was satin paper, and the rest common. I did not get it all from Long. Ashman afterwards called on me, and said he had five or six houses to paper, for Mr. Clemence, and asked me if Long could procure him some paper; he knew Long was servant to the prosecutors. Long also kept a little chandler's shop, and lived in the back parlour. Ashman knew he did not deal in paper. I said I would speak to him about it, which I did; he said he would procure some, and brought two parcels of twelve pieces each, they were not satin paper. Ashman took the two parcels of common paper away. I lodged at Long's, and on Saturday morning Long brought some satin paper home into my room. On the day before I had seen Ashman, who said he was coming to my place to know if Long had brought the papers. I said he had not; he said he particularly wanted them to finish his job, and would call to-morrow morning for them, and if he could get one of his rooms papered he could get a bill on Clemence for 20 l. or 25 l. Long brought them on Saturday, and about ten o'clock in the morning Ashman came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050052"></xptr>and saw them on the floor; he was to give 5 s. a piece for it. The trade price was 8 s. 6 d. he carried the papers and I carried the paste and kettles, over the water, to Dorset-place. We met Clemence near Kennington chapel. Ashman crossed over and had some conversation with him; they then crossed over, and we shewed him the patterns, of the paper; he said he thought they would do very well. We put the paper up on Monday. I went with him to Clemence's house that day, and waited outside, and when he came out, he said Clemence had accepted the bill, and he would get the money to pay Long; for Fox, in Blackfriar's-road, owed him a bill. I waited while he went to Fox, he came out and said he had got 2 l. on account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you lived with Long - A. One year. I have only taken goods from him within twelve-months. I have paid him 2 l. or 3 l. at a time for paper. My wife has seen Ashman and Long together, and he has asked my wife to ask Long to get him paper. He never paid for these particular papers. I have sold twenty pieces of paper to 
               <persName id="t18211205-75-person907">Mr. Scuddy</persName>
             of Edmond-place, and to several people.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not held out to them that you could get paper much lower than any one else - A. I have said I could get them as cheap as any one, not 40 per cent. lower.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Ashman you could get paper much lower on account of your connexion with the tradesmen who built Furnival's Inn - A. No, I worked at Furnival's Inn, I was in custody a week, and applied to be admitted as a witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you often go to Long's, where he worked. - A. I never went to the factory, I believe I went with Long that morning to fetch them, he brought them to me at the bottom of Whitecross-street, and I took them to Thames-street. Ashman came and took them away. I lived with Cox and Co. in 1819. I was not turned away. I was walking between Whitecross-street and Golden-lane, when he brought the paper. Ashman always bought the paper, it was his job, he knew how it was got, and knew they could not be got honestly at the price. I have told him the fair price, and he has bought of the makers. I received the paper between Whitecross-street and Golden-lane. I believe it was in the city.</p>

I said I was short, and he asked if he might draw a bill for 20 l. I agreed, we crossed over to Treble, they shewed me a roll of paper which I approved of, and they went on.

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of November I found Ashman at a public house, in the London-road. I asked him to walk out and lay hold of my arm. I told him I had something unpleasant to communicate to him. He asked me what it was. I said, I believed he had pawned some paper in Blackfriar's-road; he said he never pawned any paper in his life. I asked if he had pawned any in the name of Green - He denied that, and after walking some distance towards the pawnbroker's, he said, "I believe I know what you allude to, I received some tickets from Mrs. Treble." I asked if he had the duplicates, or had taken the paper out. He said he had not - he afterwards said he believed he took three pieces out to finish a job; he had said once or twice before, that he knew nothing of the paper or duplicates. I said then you have the duplicates; he said, No, he had burnt them. I got some paper from Slark.</p>

            . These papers are ours. The pattern is quite new, nobody else made it, we only sold twenty pieces, and those went to Edinburgh. The paper on Clemence's drawing-room is ours - I have seen it. The trade price for satin paper is 8 s. 6 d. a piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Tradesmen sometimes sell at low prices - A. Yes; but not 40 per cent. below the price.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Ashman made a long defence, the substance of which was that Treble supplied him with the paper, representing that he was able to procure it at a low price, from his connexion with the tradesmen at Furnival's Inn, and that he paid him a fair price.</p>

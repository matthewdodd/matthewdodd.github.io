I am manager to Charles Woolley, of Aldgate, a carman and contractor—the prisoner was in his employment about three weeks—on Friday, 14th February, he was sent to the London Docks for three hogsheads of sugar, one of which he was to deliver in Covent Garden, another in Maryborough Street, and the other in the Queen's Road, Bays<lb></lb>water—he ought to have been back with his van about 3 o'clock—he came between 7 and 8 o'clock, the worse for liquor—his wages were 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

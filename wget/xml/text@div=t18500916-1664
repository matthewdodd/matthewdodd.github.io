                  </hi>. I keep the Robin Hood beer-shop, at Greenwich. On 1st Sept. the prisoners came for a pot of ale in a can, and a pot to drink it out of—they said they lived at 4, Bryan's-yard, and would return them next morning at nine o'clock—I lent them to them, and have not seen them since—the male had been drinking at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness. In consequence of information, on 2nd Sept. I went to Bryan's-yard, and several other houses, and could not find the prisoners—I went to No. 4, in Bryan's-yard, and Bryan's-rents, and to 6, Bryan's-yard.</p>

In consequence of information, I inquired for the prisoners at about a dozen houses in Bryan's-yard, and could not find any trace of them—I saw the male on the railway, and told him I would go with him to his house—he took me to 6, Straight's-mouth, which is about 100 yards off—I found them there, and told them they were charged with stealing a pot and can of Mr. Leach's—the male said he never had a can—I searched the house, but did not find anything.</p>

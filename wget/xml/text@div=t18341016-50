               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you served an ejectment on any body? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was investigated several times at the police-office? A. Yes. I was at Marlborough-street when Mr. Holland made a charge against Walker for an assault - there was no charge against me - I have no recollection of Walker stating that he kept possession in consequence of some agreement with Hawkes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to HENRY HOLLAND, ESQ. Q. Had you any transaction with Walker by which he could lose 200l. by you? A. No. An agent of mine put a distress into the house to secure the remaining property of Hawkes, and some trifles belonging to Walker were taken, but the whole did not sell for 4l.; therefore they must have been extremely trifling - Walker occupied part of the house while Hawkes was there, and he claimed to continue there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you given direction, in any way, to eject Hawkes? A. No - he was my tenant at the time he absconded - Walker had lodged in the house before, and was there when Hawkes left; and at the Christmas following, I gave a notice to quit, addressed to Hawkes, or whom it might concern - I knew that Walker was in possession after Hawkes had disappeared.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had not Hawkes, before that, given up the key? A. Yes, to my agent, but I never saw it.</p>

             (police-constable K 62). On Tuesday morning, the 25th of September, I was in Harford-street, and saw some lead rolled up on the top of the house, No. 48 - I did not see any one there - I watched till night, but did not see any one come out of the house - on the next morning, at twenty minutes past six o'clock, I missed the lead<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160035"></xptr>- I continued to watch the premises till twenty minutes past eleven o'clock - I then saw Isaac Walker bring a truck to the door, and all three of the prisoners assisted in putting a large box into it - the two younger prisoners went out with the truck, and the elder returned to the house - I followed the truck to No. 34, Bedfordbury, to the house of a man of the name of Carr, a marine-store dealer - they took the box in - I was close to them - I went into the shop - Alfred Walker took up the cover of the box, and I saw the lead - he let the cover slip on again - I took it up and put my hand on the lead - I had it weighed and marked - I left the lead there while I went for another policeman - there were 164lbs. of lead - when the other officer came, we weighed the lead again, and then took the prisoners to the station-house - the elder Walker came to the office in the evening, and he was taken - I afterwards went on the roof of the house, and the lead fitted the roof exactly.</p>

Not exactly with him, but directly after him - the box was opened in my presence, so as to enable me to see what was in it, and then the lid slipped down again - I desired the marine-store dealer to take care of the lead - I did not leave the prisoners in custody - I was not in uniform - I said I was an officer.</p>

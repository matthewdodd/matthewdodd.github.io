               <p>Without saying any thing to you? - He swore he would lie with me; I told him, he should not; he damned me, and said he would lie with me, let the consequence be what it would, and he threw me down; it is a very indecent matter to mention, but I am obliged to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must mention what he did undoubtedly. - He set his knee in the first place on my breast and stomach, and used me in the most inhuman manner.</p>
               <p>Describe what he did. - He effected his purpose in a very cruel manner; he tore me with his hands, and said I was not big enough for him.</p>
               <p>What did he do after he put his knee on your stomach? - It is a bold circumstance to mention by a woman.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing he did to you after he put his knee on your stomach? - He took my cloaths up; he put his fingers and tore my private parts.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said, I was not large enough for him, but he would make me big enough.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing he did? - He proceeded, and had knowledge of me.</p>
               <p>You mean carnal knowledge? - Carnal knowledge, against my consent; I cried out several times, and he put something into my mouth, which I imagined to be a handkerchief; as soon as he had completed his whole desire he fled out of the room, and went down stairs, and left me in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you see any more of him? - No.</p>
               <p>He went quite away? - Yes; as soon as I was able to get up I came down stairs, and came out of doors; and as I was passing by the window I thought I saw the glimpse of a man at work in the house; I went back and asked who belonged to the house, and whether it was inhabited; he said it was not inhabited, but it was repairing by one Hatfield; I said I had been cruelly used, and asked where Hatfield lived; he said he lived at Tower-hill, the corner of Savage-gardens, and that he went out a short time before; I said he had used me very ill: I went home directly, and went immediately to bed.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you came home? - It might be upwards of two o'clock, I cannot say to a minute or two; I went to bed, band continued very ill, by reason of the inhuman usage I had received, and the sorvement; I kept my bed four days.</p>
               <p>Did you send for any assistance? - No; I was ashamed; I only told one lodger in the house; the second morning, seeing me in bed, she asked me the reason; I told her I was in a very bad condition, for I had been very badly used by a man that I had not found but; she came down the third morning; I was still in bed; she asked me if I was no better; I said, no, I was very ill; she asked me if I would have a little wine mulled; and she brought me the wine and a little tea: I told her the whole circumstances as I have now related; she asked me why I did not acquaint Mr. Jenkins; I said I was ashamed: I told Mr. Jenkins; I believe it was about the fourth day, by her persuasions; she said it was a pity I should be so badly used without telling it; I said I had no friends, I had nobody to relate my case to: Mr. Jenkins was in a passion when he heard it, and said it was hard treatment;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150030"></xptr> he asked me if I knew where he lived; and he went to Mr. Hatfield's house; there was nobody there but his wife, I believe: Mr. Jenkins being ignorant how to proceed, he said he had a countryman, and attorney, and he would ask him how to proceed.</p>

               <p>It was 5 weeks before you went before a justice? Did you ever employ Jenkins to make it up? - I never employed him to make it up; I desired Mr. Jenkins to let me have proper justice done me according to law.</p>

               <p>You must relate the fact. - I found her in a very ill state indeed.</p>
               <p>In what respect was she in an ill state? - She had a great discharge of blood come from her in a most violent manner indeed, and likewise spitting of blood; I know it must be by ill usage.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was by ill usage? - I saw it in the proper manner where it came from.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was by ill usage, and not from a natural cause? - I am sure to the contrary; about three weeks before she was as all women in common are; I am confident it was from ill usage.</p>

               <p>About five or six days before the last sessions the prosecutrix came to me, and told me, Hatfield had used her very ill; that he had carried her to a house repairing, and had lain with her; she wanted my assistance; I went with her to Hatfield; I told Hatfield what she complained of; Hatfield produced to me immediately a receipt, which her attorney had given him; seeing this receipt I went to her and asked what she meant by not acquainting me that there was such a receipt, and by not telling me she had employed a lawyer; she said, he has got the three guineas, and will not give me any thing: the receipt being in the name of Griffiths, I advised her to go to Griffiths: I saw Hatfield again on another occasion; I had a bill of his; I told him then that the best way was, though he might have paid the money to Griffiths, and he had not given it her, his best way was to give her something to make it up; Hatfield expressed his willingness to do that; I saw her again, and asked her why she did not make it up; she said, she had no objection; I offered her half a guinea or a guinea; she said, she had been two guineas out of pocket, and she would consider of it for a day or two, two or three days after that she said, she would take three guineas; I told Hatfield of it; he refused to pay that; I acquainted her with it: she then preferred her bill.</p>
               <p>Was any body present at this conversation between you and her? - The shoe-maker was present, and another person, at the time I offered her half a guinea or a guinea.</p>

               <p>About three weeks and one day after this affair happened, the prosecutrix was brought to me by one Mrs. Bartrum; she represented to me that Jenkins was her husband, and that it had made such an uneasiness between her and her husband, that they should never be happy more; she said, it happened on the Saturday week; she desired me to put it back a week or fortnight; I said, I would not swear a false thing for my grandmother; she then said, she never had mentioned the thing to any other woman, and her reason for not mentioning it to the lodgers particularly, was because she would not expose herself to her lodgers; she cursed Jenkins for a fool, and said, if he had not denied her, they should have got more than the guinea and half which the petty-fogging lawyer offered them; she never told me what condition she was in, nor gave me any account of it; she always particularly desired when she first conversed with me, that the thing should be kept a secret from Harrison.</p>

               <p>HARRISON. I heard the conversation between Mrs. Austin and the prosecutrix; I heard the prosecutrix say, that Jenkins was a fool to deny her as his wife; I understood that she meant by that it had spoiled the opportunity of making a market of Hatfield; this woman asked my advice, and told me that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150033"></xptr> had been told, that she ought to tell of a rape to some woman within twenty-four or forty-eight hours; but she was very unhappy, for she had never told it to any woman till she had told it to Mrs. Bartrum; she wanted me to write to Hatfield, to say that Griffiths had proved a rogue to her, that she had never received a single shilling, and did expect satisfaction from him.</p>

               <p>I was at Jenkins's when Hudson came in; Hudson said, what is the matter; said the prosecutrix, I am not very well, I have been badly injured; I don't know if I shall ever recover it, she said, he had used her so ill; Hudson said, you had better make it up; I have authority to give you a couple of guineas; she said, A couple of guineas! I have been at more expence than that; I have been three guineas out of pocket; I don't know whether my life may not be at stake; I will not take it; I want to have Hatfield prosecuted: Hudson said, call upon me at my house to-morrow, or this afternoon, and he said he had an action against Hatfield for a note of 20 l. and he should arrest him if he did not pay it soon.</p>

               <p>These parties were all before me on two different days; I did not chuse to determine the matter the first day, because Griffiths was not present; they said, that he was gone to Guildford, or somewhere in Surry, and would be present the next day; Griffiths came and behaved in a very insolent manner; when I got possession of this receipt, I asked him how he came to draw such a receipt; I apprehended that Jenkins or Clarke had applied to him: they told me at first that he said he would write a letter, and would take out an action against the prisoner; when I read the receipt, I observed it was worded in such a manner, that it was indecent to him as a man, and scandalous to him as a lawyer; I asked him if he had taken out a writ; he said, no action was commenced; I asked him how he should presume to say Jenkins's lawful wife, or any body's whore? I asked him if he knew she was his wife or his where; he said, no, he did not know that she was; I asked Mrs. Clarke and Jenkins if they had given him any authority for that; they said, they had not.</p>
               <p>Did Griffiths pretend he had any authority to make it up? - He said, he had; they both denied it; I asked him, whether he had ever given them any part of the money; I said, you have expressed it in the receipt to be in full of all demands and damages, for Jenkins and lawful wife: he said, he had kept the three guineas for the trouble he had himself; I told him, he ought to be struck off the list of attornies: the woman said, that she had told a woman that lodged in the house two or three, or three or four days after it happened.</p>

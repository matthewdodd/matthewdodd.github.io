            . I live in Chapel-place, Brompton, with my father, who was door-keeper at the Italian opera-house, but is now out of employ; I am a shop-boy or light porter. On the 5th of October. I heard a noise at <placeName id="t18311201-126-crimeloc674">No. 14, Chapel-place</placeName>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18311201-126-defend1054 t18311201-126-deflabel675"></join> - I found a few people outside the house; they were not making a noise -I heard a noise inside the door, and saw a Policeman parading up and down Chapel-place; I heard him say if there was any noise in the street, by man, woman, or child, he would take them in charge - the door being open, I went in to see what was the matter; Allden followed me in - as soon as I went in I heard the sound of a bell inside, and something else - I believe it was a tea-board, but I had not been in the passage five minutes before the prisoner came out of his parlour; I believe the noise was to serenade his marriage - I stood directly opposite the parlour door; he came out, and made no more to do but run a knife into my right side - he ran from me, and went towards Allden, but I did not see him stab him, but I heard Allden cry out- I had nothing in my hand when he came out, but when I first went in I had an empty quart pot, and knocked it against the wall two or three times, but I was desired to lay it down, and did so: I suppose the serenading was not agreeable to him - I cannot say whether he was angry, for I had not been there long.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know the prisoner? A. Only by sight; I never spoke to him -I went into his passage, seeing the neighbours there; I know the people were tormenting him night after night, but I had nothing to do with it - I made a noise with the quart pot: I knocked it against the opposite wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not been irritated by a gang of boys in this manner? A. He had been irritated the night previous - I did not intend to make a noise when I went, but seeing other people do so, I did so for my own amusement; they were all grown people there - some of them were tormenting him; six or eight people were there - I heard the Policeman say if any body made a noise outside he would take them, but if there was a noise inside he could not prevent it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not the Policeman tell them if they went inside they might make as much noise as they liked? A. It was something to that effect: he did say so - I believe the prisoner had been married the day previous; he had given the persons no provocation.</p>

On the 5th of October I was going to bed, about half-past ten o'clock; my father was at the door, and called me down - I saw a few people assembled outside No. 14, where the prisoner lives; he had been married the day before - I went, and mixed with them; the Policeman said the first that made a noise outside should be taken to the watch-house, but if there was any noise inside he could not prevent it, they might make what noise they liked - I went in; six or eight people were there - I had a tea-board, and there was a person with a bell; Miles had a pewter pot - they were all making a noise; the bell was put into my hand - I began ringing it; this continued three or four minutes - I then saw Pearson open his room door, and come out; he stabbed Miles in his right side, then came, and stabbed me in the left side<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010071"></xptr>with a knife; I have seen the knife since - it went through my coat and waistcoat; I was taken to Dr. Anderson's, Brompton-road - he dressed the wound, and I was taken to St. George's-hospital; he stabbed us the instant he came out - he had no malice towards me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were ringing the bell three or four minutes? A. Yes - it was a little hand-bell; I heard no kettles - Weller and Driver were beating the teatray with their fists; the Policeman said we might go in and make what noise we liked - we made as much noise as we could, and no doubt irritated him very much.</p>

            . I live in Chapel-place, and am a paper-stainer. I went to the house to see Thompson, the landlord, but was not one of this party: I saw Miles and Allden there - the noise continued four or five minutes; the prisoner came out of his room with a knife in his hand - I saw him stab them both; I caught hold of Allden, unbuttoned his clothes, and put my hand on the wound - I took him to Dr. Anderson's, and then to the hospital; it was a pointed shoemaker's knife - the doctor said the wound was an inch and a half deep; the prisoner might be irritated - I have heard the boys in the street making a noise; he has insulted people as they passed his window, and children have made a noise - he has come out with a strap, and hurt a boy very much, which I believe caused it; there were grown up people there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Who were the grown up people? A. I knew Miles and Allden, but not the others; Mr. and Mrs. Driver were there - one of them had a tea-board; the prisoner lived in the front parlour, and this was done in the passage - it is a lodging-house.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Chapel-place; I heard a noise, and went to quiet them - when I got to No. 14, it was over; five or six people were standing in the street - some at their own doors, and some looking out of window; I inquired what the noise was about, and understood there had been a wedding - I stood there a moment or two; some person came out of No. 10 or 11 with something in his hand, and hit it - I went to tell them the very first who made a noise in the street I would take them to the watch-house - I saw Miles and Allden go into No. 14; a female said, "If the Policeman won't let us do it in the street, we can go inside;" the landlord was standing in the door-way of his apartment, and I believe I said the landlord was master of his own house - I believe I said they might go to their own apartments and make a noise; I was standing a little distance from the door, and heard somebody say Allden was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you not know the persons did not live in that house? A. Yes; if I told them to go in, and make as much noise as they liked, it is more than I recollect - I was on duty in the street, and should think the landlord master of his own house; if he had called me to prevent it, I should.</p>

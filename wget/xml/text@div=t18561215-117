I saw the prisoner in the shop, about half past 8 o'clock in the evening—he asked for a penny pie, I served him, he gave me a half crown—I gave him change, and he went out—I put the half crown in the till—there was only one other half crown there, which I had taken of a female a few minutes before—I left them both in the till till my master came home, and gave them to him—I did not mark them—on the 21st I saw the prisoner again—I knew him at once when he came into the shop—he asked for a penny pie, and gave me a half crown—I went to my master, and gave it him, and told him it was the same man that had come on the Tuesday evening.</p>

            . I am an excise-officer, and one of the River Inspectors. I live on the <placeName id="t18240603-217-crimeloc1131">Hartshorn Wharf</placeName>

On the morning of the 2d of June, having been rather restless in the night, I went into a room which overlooks the river, and saw a vessel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030079"></xptr>come into the wharf. I then looked on the wharf, and saw the prisoner with a pint pewter pot in his right hand, and a tube in his left. I saw him put this tube into a puncheon, and draw liquor out of it, and put it into the pint pot - he went to a dust-bin immediately opposite, and put the contests of the pot into something I did not know what - he then came back, did so a second time, and then put the bung in with his hand. I saw the liquor run into the pint; he then went on to the puncheons in the next tier near the dust-bin; I saw him draw some liquor from there, and put it into the dust-bin; the first puncheon was foreign Geneva. I believe it belonged to the Crown - the second was Geneva too - they both belonged to the Board of Excise. I left the window; and after going to my bed-room and dressing, I went down, and then found the prisoner in his watch-box on the premises, about ten yards from those puncheons. I called him; he came to me; and I inquired where the officer was who had charge of these spirits - he said his feet were swelled, and he had sent him to the lodge to rest himself. I sent him to the lodge, while I went to the dust-bin, and discovered two bladders, four glass, and one stone bottle, and a pint pewter pot. I asked the other officer if he had charge of these spirits - he said,</p>
               <p>"I have." I said,</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry you have broken your trust;" - he said the prisoner had told him, in consequence of his feet swelling, he might go down for half an hour, and he would take care of his charge. I then asked the prisoner how he could do so - he said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake forgive me this time, and I will never do so any more." I put the pot and the other things into my premises, and communicated this to the officer who came in the morning to take possession of the place. I then went back with him into the wharf; this was about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were these seized spirits - A. Yes; they had been seized by the Crown; but I cannot say whether they had been tried and undergone a legal condemnation.</p>

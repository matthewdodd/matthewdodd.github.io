                  </hi>. I am single—I did live with Osmotherly till I went into Guy's Hospital, five weeks ago, through illness. We lived at 15, Henry-street, Woolwich—when I left, I left my box of clothes packed up, locked, and corded, with Mrs. Cheeseman, who lodged in the house, ready to travel by the carrier—I left some directions with it—Osmotherly said he would call for it, and send it by the carrier to my brother at Hounslow; it had a packing-case sewed all round it; and when I saw it again it was broken open in this way (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are two dresses, four yards of print, a pair of boots, a pair of shoes, three yards calico, four handkerchiefs, two brushes, and other things now missing—there was a coffee-pot in the box, wrapped up in the lining of an old dress; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not authorise any one to open the box or take anything out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Cheeseman, of Henry-street, Woolwich—Thompson lodged in the same house, she left this box in my care with some directions—in three weeks' time Osmotherly came, said he was just come out of barracks and wanted the box, for his brother was waiting down at the battalion, and he wanted to send it to London to Thompson.—I gave it him—it was then in the same state as when Thompson left it with me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 49). On 11th Nov., I went to a house in Limery-buildings, Woolwich, and in the kitchen found the prisoners and an<lb></lb>other marine, and the box and contents, the lid was broken off and the things strewed about the room—Osmotherly was in the act of looking into a tea-caddy in the box—I asked him whose property it was—he said his wife's, she was going to make use of it—he then said it was Ann Thompson's, whom he had been living with—I asked how it was broken open—he said he was in such a passion, he broke it open—I saw a coffee-pot lying by the side of the fire wrapped up in a piece of linen—I asked who it belonged to—Johnson said it was hers—I took them both to the stations, and on the way Osmotherly said, if he did not get locked up he would have a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> with the things next day.</p>

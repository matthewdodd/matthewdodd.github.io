                  </hi>. I am colour-sergeant in the Woolwich division of marines—I have been so nearly twenty-three years. I was on duty at the barracks on the 28th of Sept.—the prisoner was a private marine at the bar<lb></lb>racks, on active service—he was a prisoner at large in the barracks, for forg<lb></lb>ing a pass—I saw him at half-past nine in the evening on the 28th of Sept., at the time of the muster, at the calling of the roll in the barracks—he had his cloth trowsers on and check shirt and no jacket—the fatigue dress of a marine is a slop-frock to go to work in, the same as the prisoner wears now—his white jacket is his summer dress—I saw him on the 28th with his fatigue-frock on—that is the dress the marines use when they are cleaning the bar<lb></lb>racks and at dirty work—they are not permitted to wear that dress out of barracks—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at ten o'clock-the next day at Greenwich—the corporal of the guard came and called me up that night, about a quarter before one—I called the roll in the rooms, and awoke everybody up—I found that the prisoner was absent—I attended the police-court, and the police-constable came with me, with some lead, which I saw fitted on the roof of the barracks over No. 4 barrack-room—it is a piece of lead that goes against the chimney to keep the wet from lodging there—there had been holdfasts to keep it on, and on comparing the lead, the holdfasts fitted exactly—I had noticed the lead there safe at six o'clock in the evening on the 28th—it is my duty to look round the barracks—the lead was there then, and on the 29th it was gone—it had left a regular opening on die barracks—I examined the prisoner's kit on the night of the 28th, and his frock was not there—these are government barracks, the property of the Queen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On the 28th of Sept. I went to Greenwich; I had agreed to meet a man and woman there; I did not find the party; I had a pint or two of beer; it was time to shut up; I came out, and coming towards Deptford, I met a marine, dressed the same as myself, in a white jacket and a frock; he was running; he said he was going to desert, and asked me to go with him; I said I should do no such thing; I left him to go his way, and I went mine; I have since understood that man has deserted; I went on to the bar-racks as fast as I could, and I saw a party standing near the barrack-gate; I thought they might be officers; I thought, "I know I am guilty, I have broken my confinement; but I will go straight in;" I was going to the gate, and the policeman accused me of this; I am as innocent as a child.</p>

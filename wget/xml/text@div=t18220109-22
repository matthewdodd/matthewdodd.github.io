            , a Police officer. I was employed in December last, by Kinsey, the officer, to meet the prisoner; my husband also attended on different occasions. I was introduced to the prisoner on the evening of the 11th of December, at the door of the Horseshoe, public-house, Goswell-street, (I did not know him before) by a woman, as a person from Kent, who dealt in smuggled goods, and wished to be supplied with notes; they called them screens - she said I wanted 5 l. screens; she called the prisoner Job Jones, he said it was too late to get me any that night; the people were gone to bed, where they were at. He told me to meet him again at six o'clock the next evening, at the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went there next evening, did you see Kinsey - A. I met Kinsey at the Jacob's Wells, public-house; my husband was there, and the woman; I was searched there, they gave me a sovereign - I had no other money, but some silver, which Kinsey gave me to spend; I had no note of any kind. I went to the Horseshoe, public-house, with the woman - when I went in, the prisoner was there, he desired me to wait a-bit, and he went out; I remained there, and in about five or ten minutes he brought me the 5 l. screen; he laid it on the table, wrapped up in a bit of brown paper - I took it up, and laid the sovereign down, and he took it up; he told me the tens were better than the fives; I said if I had any luck with the 5 l., I thought I should take a 10 l.; we parted. I went immediately to the Jacob's Wells, and gave Kinsey the note - I wrote my name and date on it, (looks at a note), this is it, it has</p>
               <p>"Bought of Job Jones, 12th December, 1821, at the Horseshoe, public-house, Goswell-street, for 1 l., by me, H. Goff." I saw him again next day, he rather refused to serve me, he said he could not serve me that day; I must come on Thursday, for the man was out of town who supplied him. I went on Thursday the 20th, but he was so busy, I stopped till night; and could not get served - I did not see him doing any thing, but he could not attend to me; there was a great many people there, he appointed to meet me at two o'clock the next day. I went to the Jacob's Wells, Kinsey and my husband were there - I was searched, and received a sovereign, and some silver from Kinsey. I went to the Horseshoe, public-house, where I saw the prisoner; I told him I wanted another 5 l. screen; he went with me down Old-street Road, to the White Horse, public-house, Brick-lane; I waited there while he went to fetch the note, he returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and brought me a 5 l. note, wrapped up in a bit of a newspaper, and put it into my hand - I looked at it, and gave him the sovereign; we had something to drink, which I paid for; we came back to the Horseshoe, public-house, where I parted with him. I went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, gave the note to Kinsey, and marked it, (looks at one), this is it; it has</p>
               <p>"H. Goff bought this note of Job Jones, at the White Horse, public-house, Brick-lane, 21st December, 1821." Next day, (22d) I went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, and was searched as before, and received a sovereign and some silver, and went to the Horseshoe, public-house; I went in and looked, and saw the prisoner, he came out - I told him I came for another 5 l. screen, we went together down Seward-street, to the Leopard, public-house, and had a pint of beer - he went out, and I went out, and walked up and down by the house; he went away, and brought a 5 l. note, and gave it to me; I looked at it, and gave him the sovereign - I said if I had any luck with it, I should come and see him again on Monday, or the day after Christmas day. I went and gave the note to Kinsey, after marking it, at the Edingboro' Castle, public-house, (looks at one), this is it; it is marked as the others. I went the day after Christmas day, he was not there - I saw him on Thursday the 27th. Before that, I went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, and saw Kinsey, my husband, 
               <persName id="t18220109-22-person219">Lawrence</persName>
             an officer, and Welch; I was searched, and Kinsey gave me a sovereign, marked with a K, on the dragon side - I had no note about me; the sovereign was wrapped up in a bit of a lottery bill of Hazard's, and Kinsey kept the other part. I went to the Horseshoe, public-house, and saw the prisoner; I told him I wanted two, I was to ask for two, but only buy one. We went together from there, to the White Horse, public-house, Brick-lane - I walked backwards and forwards before the house while he fetched the notes; he came back to me, and we went into the passage of the house; I told him I had altered my mind, and could take but one - he only had one in a piece of blue paper, which he gave me; I gave him the sovereign which he put in his pocket without looking at it, and in the paper in which I received it; we came along together near to the Pitt's Head, public-house, Old-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090011"></xptr>Road, and he was apprehended there, as I gave the officer a signal; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon when he was taken. I went home; (looks at a note), this is the one I received; I have written,</p>
               <p>"H. Goff bought this note of Job Jones, at the White Horse, public-house, Brick-lane, for 1 l., 27th December, 1821." I gave it to Kinsey, that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who introduced you to the prisoner - 
               <persName id="t18220109-22-person220">A. Mary Dowling</persName>
            . Whenever I applied to him, he went away, and returned with them; this is the first time I was ever employed on such business. My husband introduced Dowling to me; she called the prisoner Job Jones, and he answered to that name - she told him my husband dealt largely in bad notes, but we had a bad sort and wanted a better; he said he could supply me with any amount.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. In what way did you ask him for them - A. I said I wanted to be supplied with them, he said he could supply me to any amount.</p>

            ; in consequence of information which she gave me, I introduced her to Mrs. Goff, and went in company with them to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, Barbican, on the 11th of December. Next day, I went there again, Goff was to buy a 5 l. forged note. I gave her a sovereign; I searched her in the presence of her husband, to see that she had no other money or notes, she had none - she then went towards the Horseshoe, public-house, Goswell-street, with Dowling, Goff and I followed them and saw them go in; they might be there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, they came out together. We went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, they followed us, Mrs. Goff gave me a 5 l. note (looks at one) this is it; I signed it at the time,</p>
               <p>"12th December, 1821." I met her again on the 21st, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house, and searched her - she was to buy a 5 l. note of Job Jones; I gave her a sovereign, Goff, Lawrence, and I followed her to the Horseshoe, Dowling was not with her; she went into the Horseshoe, and came out alone in a few minutes; we returned to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, where she gave me a 5 l. note; (looks at one) this is it. On the 22d, I saw her again, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house, searched her as before, and gave her another sovereign. Goff and Lawrence, the constable, of Lambeth, were with me. We followed her, and saw her go into the Horseshoe, public-house, she came out in a few minutes in company with the prisoner; they went up Goswell-street, towards Seward-street, and there we lost sight of them - I do not know where they went. I returned to the Horseshoe, public-house. In about half an hour, I saw Mrs. Goff and the prisoner, they parted at the door of the Horseshoe, public-house, the prisoner went in, and Mrs. Goff came on to me; we went to the Edinburgh Castle, public-house, Sweeting's-alley, Cornhill, where she gave me a note, (looks at one), this is it; she wrote on it by my direction, and I put my name 22, 12, 21, on it; I saw her again on the 27th, about two o'clock, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house; Goff, Lawrence, and Welsh, were with me - I searched her, she had no money or note; I gave her a sovereign which I marked with a K, on the dragon side; her husband tore one of Hazard's lottery bills in two, and it was wrapped up in part of it - I kept the other piece; I only gave her one sovereign, which would buy one note; we all followed her, and saw her go into the Horseshoe; she came out in two or three minutes in company with the prisoner; they went up Goswell-street, we were at the Pitt's Head, at the corner of Old-street, Goff was with me; Lawrence, and Welsh, were to follow the prisoner; Mr. Goff, and Lawrence came and gave me information - I saw the prisoner and Mrs. Goff within three yards of the Pitt's Head,; I took him, and took him into the Pitt's Head, handcuffed him, and took him to the Crown, tavern, Clerkenwell, where Lawrence and Goff searched him; Goff said he had found the marked sovereign, and gave it me; I looked at it, and gave it him back; it was wrapped up in part of the lottery bill as before - Lawrence found a 5 l. note on him, I saw him take it from his right hand coat pocket, it appeared to be put in in a careless way; about 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and nine bad shillings wrapped up in paper, were also found on him, there was 3 s. or 4 s. in a row, wrapped in soft paper. Lawrence wrote on the note, and also myself, (looks at one) this is the note; I wrote 27, 12, 21 on it; he was asked how he came by the sovereign, he said he had had it above a fortnight, and took it for some poultry, and that he picked up the counterfeit shillings. I gave Goff the sovereign, and the paper in which it was wrapped; I produce the other part of the bill - I went and found Mrs. Goff at home, in New-street, Lambeth-walk, she gave me a 5 l. note, (looks at one) this is it; we all marked it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Goff, his wife, and Dowling, planned the arrangement - A. Yes. I acted on Dowling's information; I have not seen her since the 14th of December, she had two guineas from Mrs. Goff and has absconded. I searched Goff as diligent as if I expected to find something, though I did not - I believe if she had a note concealed about her, I should have found it. The note found on the prisoner was rumpled. Dowling said this man was in the habit of supplying bad notes.</p>

I have heard the witness's account, I was with him every day after the 17th - I went to the Horseshoe, public-house, every day; on the 17th I saw the prisoner and Mrs. Goff there, she came into the tap-room, looked round, and went out again; the prisoner jumped up and followed her, he returned in five or six minutes; he stopped about twenty minutes, and then somebody came in and spoke to him, and he said to that person,</p>

               <p>"D - n me, I have lost earning 24 s." The house is one used by bad characters; there are hostlers and waggoners come there. The account of the officers is all true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended - A. Yes; he was handcuffed, and taken to the Crown, tavern, Clerkenwell; I found a 5 l. note, in his right hand pocket, and marked it, (looks at it), this is the same - I saw Goff take something out of his pocket, which he said was a sovereign. I was present when a sovereign was given to Mrs. Goff, wrapped in a piece of Hazard's lottery bill; that produced is the same, Kinsey gave it her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the 5 l. note - A. In his jacket pocket, every thing but the good silver was there.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes; I have been so upwards of twenty-seven years; (looks at one note, bought on the 27th), this is forged in all respects; it is signed</p>
               <p>"H. Whiting," but is not his hand writing - the others are all forged in every respect; also that found on the prisoner; they all appear from the same plate, and is a plate which has come to my knowledge within the last year.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on Saffron-hill. On the 17th of May I met the prisoner in Farringdon-street—I treated him—I had a sovereign and a half and a half-crown, in a silk handkerchief—I told him I should go and buy a hat, he said he had one to dispose of—I said, "Fetch it;" he did so, and it was split across the top—I said I did not like it—he asked 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I gave him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I took a half-crown out of the handkerchief, and gave it to him, and said, "Go, and get change for this, and bring it back"—he did so—the rest of the money was then in the handkerchief, and I put it and the rest of the money into my trowsers-pocket—he accompanied me to the Not<lb></lb>tingham Arms beer-shop, and treated me there—I was rather the worse for liquor—I knew what I was doing when I gave him the half-crown—I had the money when I went to the Nottingham Arms—after that I went home and missed my handkerchief from my pocket—I have never seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bishop's Head-court. I was at the Notting<lb></lb>ham Arms when the prosecutor and prisoner came there—they had four or five pints of ale—the prosecutor was very drunk indeed—the prisoner ap<lb></lb>peared to have been drinking, but was comparatively sober—the prosecutor went out and came back—the prisoner said, "Don't be a beast; let me button up your breeches," and the prosecutor assented to it—I saw the prisoner place his hand at the waistband of the prosecutor's trowsers, and the other hand under, as if working something out—he then sat down on the seat, and I saw the prisoner put his hand round the prosecutor—Mr. Hopkins made a noise on the table for me to notice it—the prisoner then went out, and then Mr. Hopkins said something to me.</p>

Gwillin called my attention to the prisoner—I saw the prisoner with a red silk handkerchief in his left hand—I saw him button the prosecutor's trowsers up—I made a noise with my pipe on the table to make my friend notice it—the prisoner sat a very short time, and went away—the prosecutor left a little after—he had been drinking, but was capable of taking care of himself—the prisoner was sober—the prosecutor called the prisoner <hi rend="italic">Bill—I</hi> did not tell the prosecutor—he stayed about ten minutes after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and reside at Cnpbham-fano, West Ham. On Sunday morning, the 22nd of January, between nine and ten o'clock, I went into the Marsh, where I had some sheep, and found only seven instead of eight—I found the entrails of a ewe, with two young lambs attached to it—I observed footsteps, and traced them some distance, and found the foot of a sheep—I saw a knife lying a distance off—I took it up, it had some blood and fat on it—I traced the footsteps further on Over some fields and over several fences, and observed, fat and blood and wool adhering to the fences—the traces of the footsteps ended at the back part of the prisoner's house, in Well-street, Maryland-point, Stratford, in the parish of West Ham—the back of his house joins one of the fields Into which I traced the footsteps—on the Tuesday following I found the skin of sheep on a dunghill, covered over with dung, about half the distances between where the sheep was killed, and the prisoner's house, and four or five rods from the road—I gave information to the patrol—the prisoner was taken in the house of a person named Lively Collins, in well-street—at the time he was taken I saw his sister, Norah, come out of the house with a pair of high shoes—I heard her say to the prisoner, "I will take can of your shoes," and she went in the direction of the prisoner's house—one of my sheep had been in lamb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse-patrol of West Ham. I received in<lb></lb>fonnation from the prosecutor on Sunday morning, the 22nd of January, in consequence of which I went with Gutteridge into Well-street, to the house of a person who goes by the name of Bony Mack—I suspected him—we found nothing there—when we came out, I saw the prisoner coming out of the court leading from his own house—we did not suspect him then—he had a pair of high shoes on, not laced—I passed him—we walked down the court together, and I got over the wall into Mr. Balcot's field, adjoining the wall of the prisoner's house, and in a privy belonging to the prisoner's house I saw the back-bone of a sheep—part of the bricks on the wall were pulled down—there was Some fat on the wall, which appeared to have been smeared on while warm, and some bits of wool—the back-bone was whole—we did not take it out at the time—I went into the noose with Gutteridge, went up-stairs, looked under the head of the bed, and found this jacket—it has fat, and some little bits of wool on it now; there was a knife in the pocket, both bloody and greasy—I afterwards went in search of the prisoner, and found him in the house of Lively Collins, in well-street—he had got no shoes on then—he was pulling a pair of stock<lb></lb>ings</p>

                  </hi>. I found the back-bone of the sheep in the privy—I have heard Johnson's evidence—it is quite correct—I saw the prisoner going over a wall into his mother's yard, out of his sister's—he was all over soot—I was near to him—he is not a chimney-sweeper—I followed him into another house, and he jumped out of the window there, but at last I secured him—I examined his house, but found no mutton at all—when he was taken, a pair of shoes was handed to him in the room, which he could scarcely get on his feet.</p>

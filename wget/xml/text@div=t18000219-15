               <p>Q. Mr. Hunter has a share in the business, has he not? - A. No; he has been dead a good many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he a son in the business? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not laid things in the way of the prisoner in order to detect him? - A. No; I never had the smallest reason to suspect him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have left an iron chest open, and not missed any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner in the habit of buying things of you? - A. He did buy one shirt, and one neckcloth, and one handkerchief, but he did not pay for them; he was to pay for them when he received his wages.</p>

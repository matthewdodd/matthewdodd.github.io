I am the wife of Edward Dell, a wardrobe dealer, of Baldwin's Gardens—on Wednesday evening, 13th December, I employed Ryan at Houndsditch to carry a bundle of clothes to Moorgate railway<lb></lb>station—I did not know him before—on arriving there I paid his fare and my own, the clothes were put into the break, he got in, and before I could get in the train went off—as it was starting, I said to him "You wait at Farringdon station for me"—I went to Farringdon station by the next train, which started two minutes afterwards, but on getting there did not find Ryan or the clothes—he was brought to me on the Friday by a friend of mine, and said that he had been looking for me, and had placed the goods in the station-house—I only found part of them there, and have not seen the rest.</p>

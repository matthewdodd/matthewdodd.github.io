I apprehended the prisoner at the Brown Bear dancing-rooms, Knightsbridge, on 22d Dec.—she was charged with stealing a shawl—she denied it, and it has never been found—she gave her address at 10, Arthur-street, Trevor-square, and told me she occupied the front kitchen—I went and searched a work-box there—I found this little box with these necklaces in it, and all these articles except the cups and saucers—I found nine duplicates, one relates to two images, which the pawnbroker will produce; the rest were of her own clothes—I do not know whether Lipscomb was in the house—there was the landlord and landlady, and several lodgers, who are not here.</p>

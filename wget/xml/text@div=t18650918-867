I live at 13, Kirby-street, Hatton-garden, and am a stationer—the prisoner and the prosecutor live at 34, Baldwin's-gardens—on the morning of 23d August, about a quarter-past 1, I was in bed with the prosecutor in his house—I heard the prisoner come home—he had some words with his wife, and suddenly he called out, "I will stand no more of this; I will have your b——liver out"—he then smashed the panel of the door, and the prosecutor got up, and pushed the washing-stand against the door, and put on his trousers—the prisoner was outside, threatening him, and said, "Come out, you b——counter-jumper"—the door was then forced open, and the prosecutor and the prisoner rushed on to one another—a terrific struggle took place, and they both fell to the ground—the pro<lb></lb>secutor then <hi rend="italic">got</hi> up, and went down stairs to fetch a constable, and came up again bleeding from the neck—I did not see any blood when he went down—he said to me, "He has tried to cut my throat"—the prisoner was then standing outside his door—I think he could hear it—I saw a gash upon the prosecutor's neck at the time—he fainted, and was taken to the hospital—the constable came up, and the prisoner was given in charge—the constable picked up these two knives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from, the, Boor of the room—I did not see either of them in the prisoner's hand.</p>

I live at 34, Baldwin's Gardens, and am a barometer<lb></lb>maker—the prisoner lives in the same house—on the morning of 23rd August, after I had gone to bed, I heard the prisoner return home to his room, and heard him and his wife quarrelling, and she screamed out—he then came to my door and said, "You b——counter-jumper, are you there, come out, I will have your b——liver out"—the panel of the door was then split through in the middle—I called to my mother to light a candle—I got up, put a wash-stand to the door, and my mother held it while I put on my trousers and boots—the door was then pushed in, the prisoner came in, and we met and struggled together—he rushed towards me, I saw him coming, and we closed and fought—we fell in the struggle, he was under me—I felt several blows, but I did not feel stabbed—I felt a tightness of the muscles when I fell, and then felt blood—I thought there was something wrong, and ran down for a policeman—he came up stairs with me—I saw him pick up the knives, and then I fainted—I am quite positive I had no wound when this struggle began—my shirt was drenched with blood—I never saw these knives before—I had never spoken to the prisoner before in my life—he and his wife used to quarrel frequently—I believed he was going to attack me when he came into the room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 157).

I am surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's-inn-road—about a quarter to 2, on the morning of the 23rd August, the prosecutor was brought there by the policeman—I found him weak and faint from loss of blood—he had a wound at the back of his neck, on the left side, rather more than an inch long, and about half an inch in, depth—one in the left shoulder about half an inch long, and about, the same depth, and also a slight scratch on the left arm—this knife might have caused either of the wounds—he is well now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This prosecutor called my daughter a prostitute—she told me and my wife of it. I sent to him and he would not come out. The next day he met my wife, and threatened to kick her down stairs; and on this night I called him to come out if he was a man; two of them rushed on to me, and knocked me down like a bullock, and his mother came out and hit me with a jug, and made a wound on my hand; and then the prosecutor hit me again, and I took this knife up in self defence.

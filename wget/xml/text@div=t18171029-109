On the 21st of October, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, the bell rang-my wife answered the door - She sent me on the opposite side of the way, I immediately went over, and saw the prisoner untying the hammercloth from Lord Ellenborough's coach, which stood in the front shop - He rolled it up, got off the wheel, and walked away with it, in his arms; I went after him, collared him, and brought him back with it. I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GILES. I am a harness-maker. I was going to breakfast on the 21st of October, and saw the prisoner lurking about Mr. Howe's door, knowing Mr. Howe's men, I suspected him, and went to the corner of Little Queen-street, and saw him turn up the end of the hammercloth of Lord Ellenborough's coach; I rang the bell, and the last witness came across the way to me, I then pointed the prisoner out to him. I saw him roll the cloth up, and get down with it. I assisted in securing him.</p>

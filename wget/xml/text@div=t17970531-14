               <p>Q. Before she had said any thing of this, did you say to her that it was of no use for her to deny it? - A. I told her, I thought it would be better to confess; I can speak to both the towels, they are of a very particular manufacture, they were made in India by a friend of my own.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe the prisoner was recommended to you by General Fox? - A. By Mrs Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, when she came to you, she had a character? - A. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. The articles stated in the indictment, consist of towels, veal, and pork? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not your intention, originally, I believe, to have prosecuted her at this place, you intended to have prosecuted her at Hicks's-Hall? - A. I had not made up my mind; in consequence of having examined her trunks, after this, I had reason to suppose, there were things of General Fox's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you it not, in your mind, to try her at Clerkenwell? - A. I intended to try her where I thought she would be transported, that is what I intended.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the whole? - A. About six or seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any agreement with the prisoner at the bar, when she came to you, about wages? - A. Yes; I agreed with her by the year.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any agreement for a month's warning, or a month's wages? - A. None; it is a rule in my family not to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her she was to go on the first of May? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How long notice had you given her of it? - A. Not above a week, or a week and two days.</p>
               <p>Q. You have paid her her wages? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are still indebted to her for her wages? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This night she was standing at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she stand at the door all the time of the search? - A. No; she was present in the room all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she immediately taken into custody that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire her to come to your house again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day? - A. I believe, on the Monday; she did not come on the Monday, she came on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday, though you had made the charge against her, she came to your house on the Tuesday? - A. Yes; I sent one of my servants for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she then taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did she come? - A. in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in the morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had taken that time to consider whether you should take her into custody or not? - A. It was in consequence of finding a great number of things in her box, with the initials of Mrs. Fox upon them, and in the hopes that he would certainly come first, and prefer a bill of indictment himself</p>

               <p>Q. You have not paid her her wages even now? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not she first committed for stealing a towel? - A. She was committed for stealing the towel and the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. And she said, she had had the meat at the butcher's, and meant to pay for it? - A. She said so.</p>

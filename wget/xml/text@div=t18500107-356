                  </hi>. I live at Bow-common, and am a carman. I knew the prisoner about twelve years ago—he was then apprenticed to a smith, and left before his time was up—I do not know that I have seen him since till the afternoon after Christmas-day, as I was going along Bridge-street, Step<lb></lb>ney, when he invited me indoors—he asked me to have a drop of ale, and I had one glass—he then asked me to have some gin, or something out of a bottle—I had two glasses of it, which had a stupifying effect on me, such as I never felt before, and made me unwell—I had only had a pint of beer in the course of the day. and this was at half-past three o'clock—the prisoner's mother, who is near sixty years old, and two other females were present, but those two females left—we then went to a beer-shop, and they invited me back again to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185001070062"></xptr>
               <p>the house—I felt queer, and asked to go backwards—Mrs. Balls showed me the place, and went away—I saw no more of her—in about a minute the pri<lb></lb>soner came and dragged me out, saying, "What are you doing here, taking liberties with my mother?"—I said, "I do not know about taking liberties, I only asked leave to come here"—he dragged me out by the collar, and knocked me down on the floor by a blow with his fist—I said, "What have I done, that I am going to be knocked down?"—he knocked me down again, and did not allow me to say anything—I said, "If I have misbehaved myself, call a policeman," and he said, "I will see about calling a policeman," and upon that he pulled me into the house, got a poker and a knife, and said, "You b—r, if you move an inch I will murder you"—I called "Murder!" and "Police!" as hard as I could—he then locked the door—he had another man in the house to assist him, and he robbed me of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., my hat, and silk handker<lb></lb>chief—when he dragged me into the house I said, "What have I done, that you use me in that way?"—he said, "I will let you know," and bit me on the head with the poker—I bled nearly two quarts—I called out "Murder!"—the prisoner held me while the other man robbed me of the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my right-hand trowsers-pocket—I suspect it was the other man—I felt either his or the prisoner's hand in my pocket—supposing it was the other man, the prisoner must have seen it—some people came round the door—a woman let in the police, and while the prisoner was trying to stop them, I got out at the back window, and went to the doctor's—there is no ground for charging me with taking liberties with his mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Martin Barr, of 8, Bow Common-lane. On the day after Christmas-day I was passing the prisoner's house, and heard a disturbance—I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner standing at the door, which was fastened, with something in his hand—I cannot say whether it was a knife or poker—Calvert was sitting on a seat, and made an attempt to leave—the prisoner said if he attempted to leave he was a dead man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Saville-place, Mile-end. I saw Calvert on the Wednesday evening, and saw a wound in his forehead, in a downward direction, about an inch in length—it was incised, but not a clean cut wound—it might have been done by a sharp-edged poker—he was very not pallid—there were marks of blood over him—I cannot tell whether he had bled very much—a wound inflicted by a poker might hare been very dangerous, in consequence of concussion, and of erysipelas—I attended him till the Sunday—all wounds on the head are of a dangerous character more or less.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and lodge at the prisoner's father and mother's house.

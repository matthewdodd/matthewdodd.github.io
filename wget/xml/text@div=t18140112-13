On the 8th of November last, the prisoner came into my shop; he asked to look at a watch, stating that he had seen it in the front sash. I took it out; he said he must have a chain with it. It was a silver hunting watch, a gold chain, and he chosed three seals. I put them all together, set the watch right; we could not agree about the key; I gave him a gilt key to wind the watch until I got the gold key made. He said he had not the money for it in his pocket; he said if you will send it to No. 4, Southampton-row, I will send the money by the bearer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any name - A. He did not. He was dressed in a middling way. I called my young man. The prisoner went out of the house. I said to my young man, John, follow the gentleman immediately, and remember you do not leave the goods without the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive from your boy any note - A. I went to the house myself to No. 4, Southampton-row; I found a check upon the banker, I think Hammersley and Co. Pall Mall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with that check to the bankers - A. I did not. I sent a friend just to enquire a day or two after; he is not here.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Vincent. I went with the watch, chain, and seals, to 4, Southampton-row. I there saw the prisoner in the parlour; I produced the watch, chain, and seals; he tendered me a check; I laid them on the table. The prisoner wrote that check while I waited. This is the check. I refused the check. I put the watch, chain, and seals, in my pocket. After I had gone out he called me back, and requested I would let let him shew the watch to his father. I came back.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back where was he - A. In the passage then. He said, give me back the watch, chain, and seals, to let my father see it; we both then went into the parlour. I waited about ten minutes, and rung the parlour bell; I found he was gone out of the house. I never took the check; I left it on the table, and was going home with the watch. I thought I would go home; I sent for my master; he came.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. On the 19th of November he came to me, and had articles to the amount of fifteen pounds; he came and had the articles; he gave my young man a check; my young man took the check. Two days after that I met him in the Park; I told him the manner he had treated my young man, the check was not paid; it is drawn upon Drummond. The prisoner gave me the watch, chain, seals, and key, and begged I would take no further notice of it, he would come the next day, and bring me the money. That was the 21st of November. This is the watch, chain, seals, and key.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the watch that the prisoner had, and two of the seals. The chain is not mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young man said he would not take the check; the young man went out of the door; I called him back again; I asked him if he would allow me to take the watch to a friend, to shew him the purchase, to know whether the agreed with the terms. My intention was to have paid him, but I was not able to pay at that time.</p>

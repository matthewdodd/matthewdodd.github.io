               <p>Q. What is your brother's business? - A. Sometimes he works in the brick-fields, and sometimes looks after horses. About seven or eight weeks ago, I think it was on a Friday, John Wheeler, and Thomas Hall, and I, were drinking at the Little King's arms, at Brentford, till about ten o'clock, then we walked about till about half past twelve or one o'clock, and then we went to Kew bridge-house, Mr. Syme's, the Star and Garter, with a rasp and a soldering iron that Hall used in his business; we took down two of the shutters, Hall and I wrenched them out at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your brother do? - A. He stood by; Thomas Hall then broke a square of glass, and took a rump of beef out at the window through the broken square, and very nigh a whole cheese, and a loin of mutton, the beef was raw and the mutton too, and a piece of beef that was ready dressed, two small apple-pies, and a bundle of things that we pulled out through the broken glass; Hall put his hand in, and reached at them; there were two counterpanes and a morning gown, a petticoat, a shift, and a table cloth, that is all that I know of that was in the bundle, except a carving knife, a brass weight, and two or three small neck handkerchiefs; I threw the knife and the weight away, and the rest of the things we took to Mr. Skilsby's, and there was a piece of a sugar-loaf; then we went to Hammersmith, and slept in a coke oven all night; in the morning, we went to the Little King's-arms, we got there a little after seven o'clock, we staid there till about eight o'clock, and then Wheeler and Hall went to Mr. Skilsby's again.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Skilsby? - A. He keeps an old-cloaths shop; when they came back, they said, Mr. Skilsby would not have any thing to do with them; they brought a piece of beef with them that was drest for breakfast, and we had that for breakfast; then we returned to Hammersmith, and went to the World's-end, at Chelsea, and had some beer, then we went again to Hammersmith, to John Groom's, to borrow his horse, we all three went to the door, but Thomas Hall went in to borrow the horse, to get the things away at night; I went home, and both of them told me afterwards, that they went that evening, and got them away; they said, they had left the sugar-loaf, and one of the counterpanes at Mr. Skilsby's, and the rest of the things they brought away; they said, they had left the loin of mutton, and rump of beef, at

               <p>Q. How long before that time was it, that these things were brought to your house? - A. I think it was a fortnight before; they came about seven o'clock at night, on foot, and called for some gin, and after I had served them, they told me they wanted to speak to me; then they asked me if I wanted to buy some things, I went into the parlour, and I told them, I should not buy them, and then they told me I might, for they were their own property; I being a countrywoman, and not knowing any better, I went back to the room again, and bought them; there were two counterpanes, a flannel night-gown, a shift, a piece of cheese, and a table-cloth, they asked me 30s. for them, I told them I would give them 20s. and then they said, I should have them; I gave them 18s. in money, and 2s. the reckoning; the things were left with me, they are here now, the constable took them away from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were taken up upon a charge of receiving these goods, knowing them to be stolen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was committed to jail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your husband too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Thomas Wheeler, that fellow behind you, was admitted an evidence, you know, and you and your husband, at the same time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, as you were admitted an evidence, you were obliged to swear to somebody? - A. Yes.</p>

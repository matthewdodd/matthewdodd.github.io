               <p>I live in Tottenham-Court Road. On the 18th of April, as I was returning from the city, (I had supped at the Horse-shoe and Magpie, and parted with my company) just as the clock struck eleven, in my way home, up Holborn, I met with the prisoner; she asked me for a glass of wine, and represented herself as perishing for want of a glass of wine; I said, if the glass of wine would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250047"></xptr> keep her from perishing, she should have it; I went into an open room, and ordered a bottle of wine; I paid for it, and went out; my way lay through the yard; going through the yard, she importuned me for a shilling; I told her she was impertinent, and would give her nothing; she said, D - n your eyes! you shall: she then gave me a violent push, in consequence of which I fell with my shoulder against the wall, on the right side, on some dung; she took from me eight guineas and a half, eight shillings, and my pocket-book out of my left-side waistcoat pocket; I missed it as soon as I got from her; I ran into the street, and called for the watch; the watch did not come; I went into the house, and asked if they knew the woman; the bar-maid said, yes; her name was Miss Walker: I told her I had been robbed of eight guineas and a half, eight shillings, and my pocket-book; I searched after the prisoner; I took up another woman, who said she knew her; the prisoner was taken the next morning; I knew her perfectly well to be the same woman: I never found my pocket-book nor money.</p>
               <p>Had you drank freely that afternoon? - No: I was perfectly sober. She pushed me down, threw herself against me, and took the money out of my pocket by force; I struggled with her about three minutes before I could disentangle myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, the first time, I pushed him against the wall, he fell on one side, and I robbed him; the second time he said, as he came out of the door, I held him together by both his arms, and so robbed his Worship: I said I must have three hands to rob him when I had hold of both his arms.</p>
               <p>Bowman. She spit in the justice's face, and beat the constables. I missed my pocketbook and money, when I got into the middle of Holborn; I ran as fast as I could into Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did you relate the same story to the justice you have told me now, that she hit you a blow and knocked you down, and threw herself upon you? - Yes; and if the information is here, I dare say you will find it so.</p>

On the 18th of this month, about half after eleven, the prosecutor came into our house with the woman at the bar; they staid not quite half an hour; and above a quarter of an hour they were in the parlour, there was nobody there but the prosecutor and the prisoner; they were alone, but the door was not shut.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his coming back? - Yes: he asked me if I knew her; I said, yes; I know her person and name: Mr. Parry went out in pursuit of her with him immediately.</p>

Is it probable that I should knock a man down, who declared he had no cash about him, and I saw no cash? There was a coachman he knew; he came out and told him he had been robbed by somebody of eight guineas, but he could not tell how; he said he picked up a girl, and went into the French-horn, at three in the morning, and gave her half a guinea to be connected with her; that he wanted her to tell him where one Miss Mee lived, as he chose to lie with her above any other woman.

               <p>I am a coachman. I know Mr. Bowman. When I drove the stage from Pinner to Stanmore, he lived at Harrow-well Common. I was in company with him about ten minutes that night: he said he was robbed between one and two o'clock, at the Coach and Horses in Holborn; he was in company with three girls and two men; he came in with them, and treated them with drams; he treated me with a glass; when he had so done, the girls went about their business. He said, Gray, I have not money to pay; I said I would lend him some; then he put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and pulled out a handful of gold and silver, and paid for it; I said, I wish I had as much as you; afterwards he told me he had been robbed, but he said he did not know how; he asked me to go along with him; I told him I was very much tired, and begged to be excused; he said he wanted to go to the French-horn; the first girl he met, who stands here, he took her round the middle, and took her into the French-horn, into a private room; and I left them.</p>

               <p>Then you don't believe what she has said? - No: I was in the room; he offered to give this woman half a guinea to tell where the prisoner lodged, and said that he had a particular attachment to her.</p>

            They were dressed in brown clothes; I heard the knocker of Mr. Hill's door go once, which caused me to pay attention. I heard it lock and unlock several times afterwards. I went down the alley ten or fifteen yards and saw two more who were talking together, one of them had a drab coat, and the other a light drab; they crossed the way and came up towards Mr. Hill's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where they went to. - A. I did not, I did not stop.</p>

               <p>Q. Where you on the evening of March the 26th sent down to Mr. Hill's to give information. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you and Mr. Hill and William Hall come up together to the house. - A. We did, Sir; when we came up to the door William Hall, Mr. Hill's servant, unlocked the door and found it fast on the inside, it was bolted; we were there a minute, or hardly that; we heard some people running down stairs. I suppose in putting the key in the door some noise was made, of course we knew it was two or three by the footsteps, they made a great noise by running down; they wanted to be out very quick; the door at the top was opened big enough to get my arm in, or another man's arm through; the top inside bolt was forced; Mr. Hill's young man turned the lock at the same time, or else I believe they would have pushed out; they ran down stairs for the purpose.</p>

               <p>Skinner. The young man turned the key at that moment; you may depend upon it they would all have got away if they had not been prevented.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have let them if you could have helped it. - A. Truly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send Mr. Hill then for assistance. - A. I believe a person there did.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Hill was gone what then. - A. We entered the house; we forced the door open, there were a great number of people, we thought we were strong enough, we forced the door open and got in; I was the second person that got in, William Hall was the first; when I got in I laid hold of Moore; I found him standing against the door, I never left him after I found him, till I left him in St. Sepulchre's watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe. - A. I observed him shifting very much; I thought he wanted to pull out a pistol, he could do nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing drop from him. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by shifting. - A. He was feeling in his breeches and waistcoat pockets. I thought he had a pistol there, and I thought it my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060021"></xptr>duty to take care of that; I thought myself in an awkward situation, I kept hold of him till I delivered him in the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did Skinner lay hold of. - A. He laid hold of Moore, I laid hold of Smith. I found Smith at the further side of the dining room, up one pair of stairs; I caught hold of him by the collar, I held him, he ruffled about a good deal; I thought he was feeling for something to defend himself; he said you have got me, have not you. I said I have and I mean to keep you; I took him to the watchhouse myself; I never loosened him at all.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. I did pitch on Moore.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. I was coming by, I had been into Green harbour court to look for a friend; I was going from there into Shoe-lane, Caroline court, No. 19, where I live; coming by, I saw a mob about Mr. Hill's door, I curiously went into the mob, I saw them forcing the door open; I went up stairs with the rest of the people; when I got upon the top of the landing place, I was knocked down on the stairs, and was trampled over by many persons; I got up with great to do; I was taken into custody for what and for why I could not tell; I was taken into the room, and was violently ill used; afterwards I was taken to the watchhouse, where I was ransacked, and every thing taken from me, which I had, which was but very little; and I have been brought here as innocent as ever a young man in the world was.</p>
               <p>Moore's Defence. I was coming by at the time, and seeing a number of people at the door, I went across, and when they forced the door open, I went up stairs with them; as soon as I got upon the top of the stairs, they caught hold of me and took me in custody; they said I was one of the men; I was troubled to get up stairs, there were twenty before me; I asked them what they wanted with me; they knocked me down in the room; I told them to use me well, I came up at the same time they did, what did they use me in that kind of a manner for.</p>
               <p>Davis's Defence.

I was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Adams, the prosecutor. I went to the door to the milk woman, and saw the prisoner coming down stairs with a bundle of things in her apron; I seized her by the gown. The prisoner had then got out of the door, and was turning round; I pulled her back into the house and pushed her into a back parlour where my master and mistress and two young ladies were. The prisoner being questioned about these things, which she then had in her possession, said a short gentleman in green clothes gave her the bundle. Then she let them drop.</p>

               <p>Adams. The watch and buckles were concealed in her stays; the greatest part of them were in the bundle. Upon first being questioned about these things, she said a man in the two-pair-of-stairs room gave them to her. I went up stairs and found four drawers in one room broke open; I missed the watch and buckles. I had had the muslin gown in my possession half an hour before it was found upon the prisoner. I came down again to the prisoner, and charged her with having taken, besides the things found in the bundle, the watch and buckles. She denied having taken them; upon which I took her into a little room apart to search her. She took them out of her stays, and laid them down. Then she went down upon her knees and asked pardon.</p>

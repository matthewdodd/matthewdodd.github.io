            , which laid off the Tower, on the Middlesex side of the River; I received three casks on board, marked C. Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The prisoner, Wilkinson, delivered them to me out of a boat; he managed the boat, nobody else was in it - he said they contained guinea grain, which is a grain smaller than pepper, of a triangular form - the boat had "Marsh and Co." painted on it; the casks remained on board until the 10th of October, Warmby and I had charge of them; they were never opened while under my care - I went ashore two or three times a-day, and have remained ashore four hours, but was never ashore at night. On the 10th of October, Mr. Albert came on board and enquired for the chests; I knew him to be a searcher of the Customs. They had been stowed away the day before; he ordered me to assist in unheading them, I did so, and found ashes, cinders, and things of no value in them; it was not guinea grain.</p>

            . I was a tide-waiter on board the vessel. I remember Wilkinson bringing the chests; I and the last witness were never absent from the ship together - the chests were never opened while under my charge; I was present when Albert saw them, they contained rubbish - when Wilkinson brought them, Dorney asked him for a searcher's note, he said it was unnecessary, for it was guinea grain - a searcher's note ought to come with all packages; it contains the number and marks of the goods, and the searcher's name - we were satisfied with his answer, and took it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was the vessel going to sail - A. Yes; for Amsterdam, the crew were on board, it consisted of the captain, his wife, and brother, who was steersman, the cook, and two children - I slept in the hold where the casks were, when one of us was in bed, the other was on deck; it was the first time I was on board for the Customs, and I was strange to the business.</p>

             re-examined. There is a drawback on guinea grain, I did not know that it required a searcher's note, I expect one with every thing that has a drawback, but thought it was unnecessary with this; I received one about five days after.</p>

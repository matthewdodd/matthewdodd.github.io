On the 30th of November, about three in the afternoon, I was in the three pair of stairs room; I thought I heard a noise in the next room; I opened the door, and went in, and saw the prisoners standing facing the drawers; I called to him, and said, you man, you have no business there; he turned his face; on my opening the door, I saw his face very bad; he tried to screen himself behind the linen that was hanging to dry; directly when I called to him he passed me, and went to down stairs. My shop is a mason's shop. My sister saw him on the first floor and tried to lay hold of him, he passed her, and got into the shop, and then he pushed her down, and got into the street, and was taken immediately. I am the sole owner of the house; my sister is not in partnership with me; I have a lease of the house; it was my mothers's trade, it has come to me; I have the whole property in the house. Nothing was taken away. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow keeper and milkman, of Lower-road, Deptford. On 15th Jan. I left my house and shop secured at 8 o'clock at night—the front door was fastened with a lock and chain inside; I came out at the back door, and locked that after me—I left no one in the house—I was away all night—I came back at half past 6 o'clock next morning, and found the front door open; there were no marks of violence—I missed three silver spoons, a silver butter knife, a single barrelled gun, two great coats, a double barrelled pistol, a half crown, and some halfpence—the</p>

               <p>spoons had been in a tea tray in the front or back room, I cannot say which—the butter knife was in a desk, locked up; the gun was hanging over the mantel-piece in the back room—they must have taken the keys out of my coat pocket, for I found them in the desk—these spoons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, and are what I lost, and this is my gun—the place is used as a milk shop; it is in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford—no one sleeps there—nobody uses the house besides me; I was the last person there—the prisoner has never been employed about the premises; I know nothing of him.</p>

I received information of this robbery, and made inquiries—I called at Mr. Wade's, a pawnbroker in the Kent-road, and Mr. Filmore's, in the Kent-road—one is two miles and a half, and the other is three miles from the prosecutor's house—I found the spoons and butter knife at Mr. Wade's, and the gun at Mr. Filmore's—I went in search of the prisoner from the description given by the pawnbrokers—I met him going up East-lane, and asked him his name—he said, "What do you want to know for?"—I said I was a policeman—he said his name was Thompson—I said, "I do not believe your name is Thompson, I believe it is Fuller"—I asked him why he gave the name of Thompson; he said his father was in difficulties, and he thought I wanted <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—I told him the charge; he said, "A pretty thing indeed, breaking into a house"—I took him to Mr. Wade's, and Mr. Haywood identified him—he said he thought the pawnbroker made a mistake in the person—he was taken to the station.</p>

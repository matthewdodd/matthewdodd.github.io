When it came to be 10 o'clock, I ordered the woman to go away, and we went to bed, we always take up the plate, either I, or the maid, we lie together. When we came to count the plate, we missed a silver pint mug, we have but two pints, and we had used both at supper, one with strong beer, and the other with small. We came down and searched about the house and cellar, but could not find it. I recollected the prisoner ( who is a soldier quartered at our house) had some small beer carried up into his bed-chamber. We went up stairs, and knocked at his door for about half an hour, and he made no answer; I ordered the door to be broke open, there we saw the small beer in a pewter mug, he was in bed, and fast asleep. I ordered the maid to look about, and she found the silver mug in his coat pocket, there was no other person in that room but him. We fetched the watch and constable. When he was awaked, he was charged with taking it; he both then, and before the magistrate, said, he knew nothing of it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched to the prosecutor's house, I took a watchman along with me. When I came there, I cannot say whether the prisoner was asleep or not. I think he bore too much trouble to awake him, I suspected it was a sham sleep. When we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176109160054"></xptr> got him to dress himself, and was come down stairs, I asked him if he knew any thing of a silver pint mug He said, he did not. I ordered the watchman to search him, and this mug was taken out of his coat pocket. [Produced in court, and deposed to. ]</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner submit willingly to be searched?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I said, you must be searched. He said, with all my heart.</p>

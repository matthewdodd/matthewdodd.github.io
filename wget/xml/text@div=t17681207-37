            . I saw the prisoner and deceased, just before they set-to to fight. They fought for a wager.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any quarrel?</p>
               <p>Roberts. They were drinking together the over-night, on the 6th of September. I was not present when the wager was laid. The deceased fought the prisoner a guinea to his half guinea. I was with them the morning they fought, at the Three Jolly Batchers, in White Cross-street. That was Wednesday the 7th, at about eleven o'clock. They went out of the house to a ruinous sort of a place. They shook hands and stripped, and set to fighting. they fought some time. There were a great many people there. They broke in and shoved people about when the deceased was down; before he could get up again, they shoved people over him. I was obliged to take the poor man away. I said to the deceased, will you fight any more? yes, said he, I will fight again. They went in and fought again as long as he could: he laid down, and said he could fight no more: I tried to lift him up, he said, let me lay; and they were the last words I ever heard him speak. We got a chair and carried him to the public house where we came out of, and kept him there some time. Then we got a coach, thinking him a dead man, and took him home to his friends, in Peter-street, Clerkenwell parish; we got him to bed, and went up to the same house where we took him from, and in about an hour we had news come that he was taken to the hospital. I went to the hospital the same day, about six in the evening. He never spoke a word after the words, Let me lay. I saw him just before he died. The prisoner was at the public house when news was brought in by a young fellow that he was dead. The prisoner jumped up in a sort of brave manner, and said, D - n his eyes, I should not have fought, unless I had thought of killing of him. I jumped up and laid hold of him by the collar, and said, Mr. Knight you ought to be confined, I will take care of you till a proper officer comes. A young fellow said, he is not dead, but he is all but dead: then I let the prisoner go, and we ran to the hospital, and just saw him alive, and he expired immediately. I went up the street after the prisoner: he was at a public house with a great many of his acquaintance that behaved very bad at the fight. They said, Roberts, you have no business with it, let him go; the people said to me, you make yourself very busy; so I let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070034"></xptr>Roberts. I believe he was not drunk. He had been at public houses.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the public house before they went to fight?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Not a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner want the deceased to wave the wager?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner offer the deceased a shilling, if he would give up the wager?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear the deceased say, he would not take 10 s. and 5 s. 3 d. for the wager?</p>
               <p>Roberts. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the father of the deceased at the fight?</p>
               <p>Roberts. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not encourage his son to fight longer than he chose?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I did not see the father till I got the young fellow away, and they made out the ring again.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell how they came to fight?</p>
               <p>Bridges. No, I do not know how they came to fight: Roberts and I came together, after it was over. I heard the prisoner d - n his eyes and say, he would not have fought him, unless he thought to have killed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you there before they fought?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I was there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour before. I saw them going to fight. I did not see any foul play.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the deceased, Ball, being taken out of the ring?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I do; he came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who persuaded him to go back?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I do not know who persuaded him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any words the deceased said?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I remember he said, Let me lay. The last words he said were, Let me lay. We took him to the public house, and from thence we carried him in a coach home. I went in the coach with him. He bled all the way he went from his mouth and left eye and ears. He did not speak in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I had hold of his left-hand when he died. He could not speak then. I, and a person that is not here, and Mr. Burgess, apprehended the prisoner. The people that belonged to him, of his own sort, came round us, and was rescued from us. We were obliged to let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bridges. He is a tin-men by trade. When we told him Bob was dead; he said, he would knock my eye out. I told him I would not fight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodcar. I am a pupil to Mr. Young in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, I was not there when the deceased was brought in, he had been there about an hour before I came in; he was dead, I examined the body, and found several bruises, especially on his left eye. In all probability he died in an hour after he received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the body?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodcar. The coroner did not require it, therefore we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodcar. I judge, from the report we received, that as he was in full health before that time, that he died of the bruises and hurt he had then received. The eye was entirely closed when I came.</p>

            . I was going down White-Cross Street upon business. I saw a great mob in the Street, and a parcel of women said, the rogue will kill the man, there is such a mob about him. I asked what was the matter, they told me they were fighting down in the back ruins; I went down and into the ring. They broke very near me; Bell was down and the prisoner upon him; the prisoner's second pulled him up; just as he got up, his left foot kicked the deceased in the breast; I spoke of it; some that belonged to him said, what business had I with it? and told me I deserved a good licking. I got out of the ring; after that I saw them bring Bell up to a wall, there he stood as though he was dying, (they were both strangers to me) I said, Gentlemen, do not let them fight again, for I believe that man is dying. I kept out of the ring, hearing the prisoner had a very bad company belonged to him; presently they carried the deceased into a public-house, and I went in; the man seemed to be a dying.</p>

            . I saw the beginning of it, I keep the public-house; it was the night of a chair-club, a three-pence half-penny club. On the 6th of September, the night before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070035"></xptr> fight, the chairman did not behave so well as he should do; there was 2 s. and 3 d. half-penny missing; the deceased said, it was a very bad thing, so words arose: I was the loser of it. I said to the deceased, never mind it. Knight took the chairman's part; the chairman was a journeyman watch-maker. The prisoner was bragging, and said he could lick Ball. Ball said, what signifies what he says? I said, do not mind what he says. Said Anderson to Ball, I will back you, if you will fight him; they wanted to put their money into my hands. I would not take it. I said to Knight, what signifies fighting now, fight to-morrow; he went out naked, and I kept him out a quarter of an hour, and said, I would not let him in, unless he would be quiet. Then another would back the prisoner, for half a guinea, they aggrivated the deceased, and he said, he would fight a guinea to half a guinea. The bet was made, and they agreed to meet the next day, by ten o'clock, or lose their money; they put some money down, I know not how much. They came and fought down a packthread ground the next day, they neither of them drank much, they drank nothing at all to signify. I did not go down with them, only a butcher came and said, let us go down and see them fight; we were there just before they set too. I saw them strip.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they fight?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I believe, first and last, they might fight two or three and twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they fight before the ring broke in?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I believe they might fight six or seven minutes before that, the prisoner then had the worst of it to my thinking. Then there was a great mob; the ring broke again, sometimes they fought higgledy-piggledy, that a body could not see rightly. The prisoner was out of the ring while they made a fair ring again, but where he stood the while I cannot tell; I kept my own place, they set too again and there was a fall, and Ball could not get up any more, he was left behind. They asked me if I would let him come to my house? I let him. They brought him in, he had not strength to suck a lemon. I poured some vinegar down his throat, thinking that would break the clod of blood, that he might have got by straining himself in going to heave the prisoner. I ordered my maid to make the bed, and ordered my wife to get some white-wine whey made; there were a good many friends of his in the room; we persuaded the father to have a coach, and get him home. His father got a coach, and I lent him a blanket to take him away in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what the prisoner said, when he heard the man was dead?</p>
               <p>Hudson. The prisoner came in and wanted some beer to be drawn, and swore and blasted. I would not let him have any: he said. You old dog, I never fought a man, but what I intended to kill him, and blasted, and talked of fighting me; then I went and got a poker, and ordered him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Ball called a fighting man?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I never saw Ball fight in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner want to be off the wager in the morning?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I said to Ball, be ruled by me, and forfeit the money; he is too young for you. Said Ball, I am almost sure of winning, and I will fight him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear the prisoner say, he was willing not to fight?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I did hear the prisoner say to the people, they might do as they please, he would fight or not fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Who persuaded Ball to fight the second time?</p>
               <p>Hudson. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Willow-place, St. Pancras. I took the prisoner into my place about four months ago—he staid with me till the 3rd of Dec—I employed him to go and buy goods, and sell them again for me in the street—on the morning of the 3rd of Dec. I gave him some money, and sent him out to buy goods and sell them—he went away—I had a great-coat in my bed-room up stairs—I am sure it was there—I missed it after the pri<lb></lb>soner was gone—I never saw it again till a fortnight after when I saw the prisoner at the Straw-yard—he had my coat on his back—this is it—I did not lend it him—he never wore it with my knowledge—there were eight shillings, four sixpences, and twelve pence on the table down stairs that morning, and after he was gone that money was gone too.</p>

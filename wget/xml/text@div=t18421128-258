                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 266.)On the 13th of Nov. I was on duty on the Wandsworth-road, and near Vauxhall-gate, I saw the prisoner walking along the road, carrying a sack and something else in his hand—I stopped him, and it was glass, folded in the sack—I asked him where he had brought it from—he said from his master, Mr. Atfield, at Battersea—I saw wet putty on the edge, as if it had been just taken out, and said, "This glass has been just taken out of some place"—he said, "No, it has not, I bought it in a shop in Salmon-street, that is the truth of it"—I took him to the station, and he there said he had taken it out of a glass cupboard where he was living—I went to the house where he said he was living—there was no such a thing as a glass cupboard there, nor had there been—I went to Mr. Atfield, his master, and he had not taken it from there—I went to the shop where he said he had bought it, and they had no recollection of any person buying such a thing there, neither did they know it—I then found Mr. Wix, <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He has sworn quite false; when he asked me how I came by the glass, I said it belonged to myself; I had it in my hand, not in the sack; I told him I had it from my own home, that I had had it in my possession seven or eight weeks; I had taken it out of a cupboard which I burnt, not being worth the trouble of moving; the sack I borrowed of a labourer; we met another constable; he told me to try and get away, and said, "I will do what I can for you." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am building a house in Battersea-fields—I missed some panes of glass from some sashes there—I cannot identify the glass, but they fit the openings in the sashes, and some pieces of glass which were found on the wall on the premises fit two broken squares found on the prisoner—I noticed the pieces of glass on the wall before the policeman came, but I did not know what they were, and did not disturb them—these are the same number of panes I missed, and they are the same size and quality.</p>

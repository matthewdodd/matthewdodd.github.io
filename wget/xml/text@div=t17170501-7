The Prosecutor depos'd, That having been at Limehouse, and coming home, near Stepney, the Prisoner fell into his company, and pretended she wanted to buy gold-colour'd Silk, which he, being a <rs id="t17170501-7-viclabel37" type="occupation">Weaver</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17170501-7-victim58 t17170501-7-viclabel37"></join>, was willing to sell her; That she came with him near his own house, and then he bid her go into a neighbouring Ale-house and he would go fetch her gold-colour'd Silk; whereupon he went home and put a purse with 20 Guineas into his Wast-coat pocket, but did not go to the Ale-house to show it her, but sent his boy for her to come home to see it; That she being with him in the Chamber, took his Purse out of his pocket, and taking out a Guinea bid the Boy fetch a bottle of Cyder and a quartern of Brandy, and then put his Purse again into his pocket; that afterwards examining his Purse, expecting to find the remaining 19 Guineas, he found but 9. Whereupon he sent for a Constable to apprehend her, but in the interim she desir'd to go to do her Occasions, and before the Officer came made an Elopement. The Prosecutor's Boy depos'd, That his master came home at the time beforementioned, and put the bag of Guineas into his pocket, and seat him to the Sugar Loaf in Coverlays Fields to call the Prisoner to him; that she was admitted into his chamber, and there was very familiar with his Master, taking his Purse out of his pocket, and thence a Guinea, bidding him fench a bottle of Cyder and a quartern of Brandy; which he refusing to do, and not willing to go out of the room and leave them together, because he said he suspected her to be a very ill person, and his master not to be very capable, therefore he would not go out of the room; so the Liquors were fetch'd by another. And that the Prisoner desir'd his absence, threating that if he offer'd to speak a word against their Conversation she would kill him upon the spot. And that when his mistress came in, he inform'd her what sort of a Companion his master had gotten with him; whereupon she went in and interrupted their Conversation, and examining her Husband's purs missed 10 Guineas. The Prisoner in defence gave an account of the matter to this purpose: That as she was selling Oranges the Prosecutor bought a dozen of her, giving her a, Shilling for them; that he liked his bargain and her so well, that he carried her to a Publick house, and treated her and another Woman very generously with Beer, Cyder and Brandy; staying out all night, that they were at several places, and particularly at Stepney; that he was very sweet upon her, courting her, telling her he was a single Man, importuning her to go home with him and be his Housekeeper; that she was prevail'd upon by his Importunity and fair Offers: At length he sent for a Coach, and making use of that conveniency, convey'd her into Coverlays Fields near his own house, gave her money to go into the Sugar Loaf Ale-house to stay there till she heard further from him. Accordingly she attended at the Ale-house as he directed, till his Servant came to call her home, whither she went, was well receiv'd, and kindly admitted into his Chamber. That the former civilities were repeated; he puiling out a Guinea and sending for a bottle of Cyder and quartern of Brandy, showing her his cupboard of plate: and that while she was pleasing her self with the thoughts of what she was brought to be mistress of, the Prosecutor's Wife, to her great surprize, came in, and made such a noise in her Ears, that she not sustaining the storm any longer, got away as soon as she could, to her no small mortification at the great Disappointment she had met with, incoming to a Nest so well feather'd. The Court putting the question home to the Prosecutor, whether in truth he did not pick up the Prisoner? he frankly acknowledg'd he did pick her up, but not to pick his Pocket. But was answer'd, that considering the Years he always bore abroad, and that he had a Wife at home, him loss of 10 Guineas (were they lost) was not too great a punishment for his scandalous Practices, tho' that would not excuse her could the Felony be proved upon her. Tho' there was one thing remarkable, that she treated the Prosecutor with a modesry unusual to such Practitioners, in that she took no more than 10 Guineas out of 20, when they commonly take all if they can get it, and only leave their Cully the rest. It plainly appearing the Prosecutor was so very much in drink that he might possibly mistake as to the number of his Guineas, the Jury <rs id="t17170501-7-verdict38" type="verdictDescription">

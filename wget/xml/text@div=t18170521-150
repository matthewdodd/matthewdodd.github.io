On the 30th of April, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I discovered that the lead had been taken from the roof of the scullery, with the water-pipe and bason - I had seen them safe two or three days before. I found it at Mr. Vidler's, and on comparing it with the place it exactly fitted.</p>
               <p>JOHN DRAKE. I am servant to Mr. Vidler, who is a coach-smith. On the 30th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in a field behind Mr. Hodges's house, with three or four pieces of leaden pipe in his hand - He appeared to be coming from the back of the premises. I stopped him, and told him he was going the way to the gallows - He made me no answer - I knew him before. I let him go about his business. I found about thirty pounds of lead concealed under some timber in the field - He came from that way. I afterwards saw it fitted to the building-it exactly corresponded.</p>

               <p>JOHN WAITHMAN. I am a bird-catcher. I was in the field, and saw the prisoner about six o'clock in the morning. He asked me if there had been any nose (if any person had said any thing), and if there would be any pull-(being taken up). I said, there had been some lead found under the timber - He went away.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GOODENOUGH. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody about seven o'clock that morning. He said he found the lead, and that he must thieve, or do something else.</p>

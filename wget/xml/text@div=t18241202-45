On the 16th of November I was in the office; the prisoner came in, and said he had brought a paper, and was sent by a gentleman a little lower down to shew it to Mr. Green. I said he was out of town, but took the paper out of his hand, and looked at it; he asked me to shew it to the lady of the house, saying that it was a passport, and he wanted to get a little money to take him to his own country. I think he said to Hanover. I gave him 1 d.; he said he had been a long time raising money. I said if he called to-morrow, I would endeavour to get him some, and if he went to the Mendicity Society they might relieve him; he remained in the office, and produced some duplicates and a watch - there were seven sovereigns on the corner of the desk where I sat - I did not see him touch them, but the moment he went out, I missed two. I immediately went out, and saw him just turning the corner of Brook-street, Grosvenor-square. I called Stop thief! a gentleman endeavoured to stop him; he was taken, and gave up one sovereign to me in Grosvenor-square. I took him to Marlborough-street - he was searched there, and the watch which he was had produced, and 5 d. found on him - Mr. Emery, who stopped him, gave me another sovereign.</p>

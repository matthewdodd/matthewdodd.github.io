On the 16th of August last, I lost a tea chest, two pair of shoes, and a pair of candlesticks. I was gone a journey out into the country of Essex. I locked the door and bolted the gate, and made every thing secure, there was nobody in the house. I cannot say to the day. I was gone a fortnight, and I returned on the 16th, and then I missed them. I went to the pawnbroker, at Hammersmith, and found the candlesticks pawned, his name is Lawrence. I went and setched my wife, and she swore to the property, we went to the justice's and took out a warrant on the information of the pawnbroker.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner? - Yes; very well, for some years. He brought a pair of candlesticks on the 16th of August last, Saturday, for eighteen pence, he used to come to my shop, and his wife too; I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. When he has pledged things has he redeemed them again? - Yes, and his wife too.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the candlesticks that Mr. Talbot had of you, the same that the prisoner pledged with you? - They are the same, because I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you when things are pawned to you mark them with a ticket? - We sew a duplicate to them; they had, I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Talbot. They are my candlesticks, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is no artificial mark, it is occasioned by the candlestick falling on the ground? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any other candlestick falling on the ground might have the same mark? Yes, but it may not fall in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say when they were first produced to you that you could not swear to them? - I setched my wife, and she did, and I could swear after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at the first time that you could not swear to them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. He is a very industrious man, I have known him for some years.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce a tea chest and two pair of shoes. I am the officer that took him. I am the constable of Hammersmith. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170161"></xptr>the 18th, Mr. Lawrence, and Mr. Tal- bot came to me; Mr. Talbot said he had been robbed, and that he had got the mark of his property; I took the prisoner, and had a warrant to search his house; going towards his house, he asked me where I was going to? I said I was going to search his house, for a tea chest, and two pair of shoes, he said, the tea chest he had not got; the shoes he had; going up towards his house, in the road to his house, I asked him where the tea chest was? he said it was not far, it was not out of the field.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What did you say to the prisoner before any thing of that past? you told him it would be better for him to confess? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Or rather it would be worse for him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do recollect? - I do perfectly recollect. He then said he would shew me where it was; accordingly we went with him, and he went to a dunghill; he then said it is somewhere here, I cannot say exactly to the spot; he went about there parts up the dunghill, and he scratched with his hand and could not find it; he said, I believe I am too high, it is lower; accordingly he came lower and scratched up the dung and found it, and then we went to his house, and when we came there, he said, you need not search I will give you the shoes, they are no service to me; he then went to a cupboard, in the cupboard there was a bag, and in the bag there were the shoes, and he took them out, and gave them me into my hand; from thence we proceeded to the justice, and he was committed for re-examination, because Mr. Talbot did not know at the present time what he had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him whose shoes you wanted? - Yes, mentioned Mr. Talbot's name. I said I was going to search for Mr. Talbot's tea chest and shoes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. This is really a very pretty story. So you mean to tell us, that without your making any promise, or any threat on your part, he voluntarily told you all this story. It is very astonishing!</p>
               <p>Court. This man has a wife and family, has he? - He has a wife and three children.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - He works in the ground as a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. To Talbot. Did you find your house broke open? or how had they entered into your house? - In at the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his master and another witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was walking in my master's grounds, I saw a man hiding something in the dunghill, not knowing what it was; but when I came nearer he seemed as if he was doing something for himself. I came up to him, and I said halloo, and he hallooed to me again; and he asked if I did not work in the gardening grounds? I told him I did; and he told me there were a couple of pair of old shoes if I would accept them; with that I took them shoes home, and got up the next morning to see what he was hiding, and I went to this dunghill, and I found the top of a candlestick at first, and afterwards another, and in pulling out the other I found the tea chest. I watched till nine o'clock the next day, to see if any body would come. On Saturday night I took the two candlesticks out of the dunghill, and took to Mr. Lawrence's for eighteen pence, when they took me, I was at my work, and shewed them where the things were.</p>

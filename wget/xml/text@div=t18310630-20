On the 21st of May I lost my money out of my box - I do not know the date, but it was about six weeks ago; it was on the Saturday before I went to the Police-office the box was broke open; there was a little box in it, containing five sovereigns and two half-sovereigns; the prisoner had been taking care of the room from Monday till Saturday - she went away at twelve o'clock on Saturday, and I missed my money between twelve and one, within an hour of her leaving - I had seen my money on the Thursday morning; the box was locked, and I had the key - I had not been to it since the Thursday; the little box was taken away, as well as the money - there was nothing in it but the sovereigns and half-sovereigns; I did not see the prisoner again till Monday, when she was in custody at Marylebone-office - the Policeman showed me my money; she had been taken on the Saturday.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and had a room in Cragan's house; the prosecutrix, another woman, and I and my wife lodged in that room - there are two beds in it. On Saturday, the 21st of May, the prosecutrix told me of her loss - I went with one Maloney in pursuit of the prisoner as far as Brentford, getting into Hounslow - John Carr, the officer, was with me, and he took her; I saw her searched - five sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 7s. 4 1/2d. were found upon her - she had the sovereigns and half-sovereigns in a little tin box, but not the other money - as we came along she said, "I don't know what is to become of me now about this here money;" I did not threaten or promise her any thing - I said I did not know what would become of her, but she had behaved rather foolish to have any thing to do with the money; she said nothing more to me.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to pursue her? A. She had left the house at twelve o'clock - I understood she was going into the country again - she had been with me from the Monday morning till the Saturday, as a servant, and slept in my room; I had hired her by the week, which would not be up until the Monday - she left of her own accord, and did not let me know she was going.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable of the Kensington division. I was on duty at Brentford on the 21st of May, and saw Pickley running through the streets at Brentford, in his shirt-sleeves, about ten minutes after six o'clock in the afternoon, another man was with him - he was coming in a direction from town; I went, and asked him what was the matter - he said a woman had robbed him of six sovereigns; in consequence of his information I followed the prisoner, and took her going into Hounslow, about two miles and a half from where I first saw Pickley - I laid my hand on the prisoner, told her I had ran far enough after her, and that she was my prisoner - I brought her into a public-house to search her; she took this tin box out of her pocket, and thought to conceal it; I caught it in her hand, took it from her, opened it, and found in it five sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and two rings - Pickley was present, and when he saw the sovereigns turned out he said, "That is the money;" she was present, but said nothing - I brought her to Brentford, kept her there till the 23rd, and then brought her to Marylebone-office; Pickley walked with her from Hounslow, but I did not hear what passed between them - I beard him say to Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, that she took 6l. from this woman; I did not see that taken down - this ribbon and two rings were in the box.</p>

This is not the box my money was in - mine was a wooden one; I have not seen it since - I have no mark on the sovereigns, but it is the same quantity of money as I lost.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. She has a half-sovereign and two rings belonging to me.</p>
               <p>ELLEN HERRING. Here are five sovereigns and two half-sovereigns, which belong to me - there are no other half-sovereigns: this piece of ribbon is mine, and was in my box with the money - my box was locked all the week - when I found it broken open, the hasp was drawn out; I did not find it out till I went to the box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, at Deptford. I live on the same side as Mrs. Edney—on Sunday morning, the 30th of June, at three o'clock I was up—I saw the prisoner Mills and, I have every reason to believe, Jones, standing close to the Garrick's Head, looking up the street—I crossed to go to my employment, and then observed Mills getting up to the window, supported by the other man—I saw him put his hand into the window, as well as it was possible for a man to see in the situation I stood, his back being towards me—I could not see what he took, but I saw his hand come out and go to his companion below—he then got down and walked up the street towards Deptford—I returned across the road, entered the gate, and they were passing me on the other side of the way—I believe they did not see me—I saw a policeman twenty or thirty yards before them, and I saw them pass him—a little bit after, I went to the policeman and gave him infor<lb></lb>mation—I know it was Mills, because I have known him nearly four years—I was about thirty yards from him when the fact was committed—it was quite daylight.</p>

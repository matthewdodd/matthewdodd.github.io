            . I am a carpenter, and was at work at the same house. I was coming from breakfast, and met the woman in the passage. I stopped her to see what she had got; she said she wanted some shaving, and asked me for some. I told her there were none and so let her go out. Then I went to look into the parlour, and seeing nobody there, I followed the woman to see what she had got, and turning her apron aside I there saw this basket. I asked her how it, and she said a chare-woman her for it. I knowing it was my brother's property, called him up, and he owned it directly.</p>

               <p>I was coming through the square; there was a poor woman go into that empty house, and said, there find a basket. I went in for it very innocently, and I have suffered severely for it.</p>

               <p>Q. In what part of the house do you sleep. - A. In the first floor, above the shop in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you say it was when you heard any thing. - A. About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>A. What sort of a noise did you hear. - A. A rattling of glass, it appeared to me to come from the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. On hearing this noise did you get out of bed. - A. I did, I went to the front window and threw up the sash, I saw two men cross the street, one with a wooden leg.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160054"></xptr>Q. Could you distinguish at that time that one had a wooden leg. - A. I could, it was quite moon light when they crossed from the house; they made a stop about half a minute, by that time the watchman was coming along, crying the hour of past three; one ran off a few yards, and the other walked very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman came near the door, did they run and walk the same way. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This throwing up the sash would have alarmed them one would have thought. - A. No, I threw up the sash very quietly, I put my head out of the window, and I at first supposed they saw me, I supposed afterwards they did not, because they came back to the window again; I alarmed Mr. Wilcox, and he came down.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the watchman gone by before Wilcox came down. - A. Not above two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Wilcox into the shop. - A. Wilcox came down into my room first, where I slept; he instantly went down stairs, and I followed him, he then went into the shop after four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to stay so long. - A. There was a door backwards that we unbolted, that we might go back wards.</p>
               <p>Q. On going into the shop what did you observe. A. I saw a man at the window, pulling the glass out, with a handkerchief on his head under his hat; I perceived the hand in the hole of the window, the hand was moving the goods that lay against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Wilcox in the shop at that time. - A. I believe he was in the back room, I desired him to go out to them, otherwise the goods would be taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. When Wilcox was gone into the back room you saw the hand in at the window. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us correctly what you saw. - A. I saw the hand in when I came back into the shop, still seeing the man standing at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the hand in at the window before you desired. Wilcox to go round. - A. Yes, and saw the goods move likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed a man with a handkerchief round his head, pulling the glass out of the window, did Wilcox go out of the shop into the little room before you. - A. I believe he went out before me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that after he was gone that you perceived this hand in at the window. - A. It was after he was in the little room.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand it was you cannot tell. - A. It was the hand of the man that had the handkerchief on his head, standing at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him then standing at the window, as you had done before, - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Say what you saw done to the goods. - A. I saw the goods move once or twice that lay across the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were they. - A. Cordovan boot legs, I saw the hand move them as they were upon the shelf, I expected them every minute to tumble.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hole large enough to have drawn out these boot legs. - A. I do not think it was large enough without taking the whole of it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in fact none of them was drawn off the shelf. - A. None, they were moved two inches from the place where they lay, but still on the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Having seen this what did you do. - A. I laid hold of the door to pull it open (as I expected the man standing at the window would be knocked down, Mr. Wilcox was gone round with an intent to do it), and with two sudden pulls at the door I opened it, I found it tied on the outside the first pull, I gave it a harder pull the second time, and broke the string, and then I went into the street, I ran across the street and seized the prisoner Bowen right opposite, he was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Tools at that time.</p>
               <p>A. Yes, he was in the custody of Mr. Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Tools was the man that was standing at the window. - A. Yes, it was not half a minute from my pulling open the door that he was in the custody of Mr. Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether Bowen, the man that you laid hold of, that you had seen him out of the window. - A. I saw a wooden legged man and another man, but I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the wooden legged man. - A. Tools.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when either of the prisoners were searched. - A. I was, I am not certain from which of their pockets the instruments were taken; a person brought an iron crow, but where it came from I do not know; I tried the impression made on the place, and it fitted exactly the marks on the shutters.</p>

               <p>Court. You said the gimblet was found in Tools' pocket and in Bowen's, that is not so. - A. No, only in Tools; I am sure the little saw was found in Bowen's pocket, I saw it taken out.</p>

             sworn. I am the officer of the night, of the precinct of Wellclose, I arrived at the watchhouse about five minutes after the prisoners were brought in; Thomas delivered these things to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160055"></xptr>me, I produce a gimblet, a flannel jacket, and a black bag, and there was a little saw, which I have had the misfortune to drop as I was coming along yesterday; there I understood were taken from the pocket of Tools, and this gimblet I understood was taken from the door, there was a mark of a gimblet on the post of the door.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found the gimblet, it was bored in the post of the window, I pulled it out, and carried it to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Thomas) Did you receive a gimblet from any body. - A. Yes, from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Wood) Do you undertake to say that you saw any of these boot legs moved up from the shelf. - A. Only being moved on the shelf, I saw his hand at the legs, the legs laid so close to the window, he could not put his hand in without shoving them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him lift them up at all. - A. I saw them move from him, I saw the end of one half dozen move round, I expected that they would be taken out when I went to Mr. Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Q. What size are the legs. - A. The legs are about eighteen inches long, and as the legs lay across the window, one half dozen was turned round from the rest, just at the time the hand was taken from the window, and the blow was given by Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is whether you saw them lifted up from the place where they were. - A. They moved, I did not see them lifted up, only a drawing on, a little moving round.</p>
               <p>Bowen's Defence. I am innocent of the crime I am accused of.</p>
               <p>Tools' Defence. I am totally ignorant of what is alledged against me.</p>
               <p>Bowen called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

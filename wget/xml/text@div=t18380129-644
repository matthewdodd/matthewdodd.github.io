                  </hi>. I live at Deptford. Smith is a lodger of mine—I know the prisoner—he asked me to let him lie down, on the 9th of January, and I showed him up stairs to the room where Smith sleeps—he laid down, and then came and drank with me—after that Smith missed a sheet—I was not there.</p>

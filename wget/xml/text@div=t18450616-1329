                  </hi>. I am the son of Samuel Ralph Jutson; he has a shed on his premises, which are in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. We had been missing lead from the roof of that shed for the last five or six weeks—we had Mr. Hopper placed there to watch—he was watching there last Sunday night—my attention had not been called to the roof of the shed shortly before that—I had seen it about two months back—on Mon<lb></lb>day morning, about five o'clock, intimation was given to me of this parti<lb></lb>cular fact—I went to the shed, and found the roof had been broken through, and a vast deal of lead had been taken from the premises—part of the roof had been taken off, where a party could get through, and then drop the lead—the prisoners had then been taken, and the lead was gone—I did not see whether the lead fitted the roof, but I saw a vast quantity was gone off the roof.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 525.) On Sunday night last I was stationed in the second floor back room of another house which commanded a view of the roof of Mr. Jutson's shed—on Monday night I was there again, and about one o'clock on Tuesday morning I saw the prisoner Satch on the roof of the shed, within four yards of me—I could see he was getting the lead up—he made some noise in doing it—I saw him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I made any alarm—I saw him dispose of two pieces of the lead by putting them down through a hole in the roof—I then went and placed two other constables in other parts, and on my return I saw the prisoner still at work—I called out, "What business have you there?"—he looked round, but could not see any one—he then stooped down, and began his work again—I called to him a second time, and said, "Why don't you be off, you have no business there"—I then turned my light full on his face—he dropped down on his stomach, worked himself backwards, and got down the hole like a rat—I then ran round into a court which led away from that part of the pre<lb></lb>mises, and while I stood there the two prisoners were brought down by a constable that I had placed there—I afterwards went into the shed, and found two pieces of lead—I found one piece corresponded with the lead on the roof, where it had been broken off—there was a great deal of lead gone from the roof—the piece that corresponded was on the shed—it was partly cut off, and partly on—the other two pieces were in the shed—at the time Satch put the lead down the hole, I could not hear anything—it appeared to be handed down—I should say there was some one underneath to re<lb></lb>ceive it, it was done so quietly—the lead we found in the shed was right under the hole—I did not hour any noise by its falling.</p>

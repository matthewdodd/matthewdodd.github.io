                  </hi>. I am the son of the unfortunate deceased. He was in the habit of keeping an oyster stall in Mortimer-street; he had done so for four or five years, off and on—I know nothing of this accident—I was present, but I saw nothing of it till I was struck myself, which stupified me for a moment; I was taken to the hospital with my father—I stood on the side of my father, nearer to Langham-place—I did not see the omnibuses coming—I was struck by the Chelsea and Islington omnibus on the ear and side of the head, and my father was struck too—the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> passed on from me, I got away—I cannot say where my father was struck—a gentleman who was having oysters pulled the table away, and we both got entangled somehow—I had the flaps of my coat torn off—I know that locality very well—there is a large public house directly opposite that stall—it is what is called a gin palace—there is a great deal of light there—there are four large lamps in front of that house in Mor<lb></lb>timer-street, and one lamp in Portland-street, and there are some smaller jets in the window—the stall was directly on the pavement, opposite that public house—the four legs of the stall stood on the pavement, about three or four inches from the road—I do not know who was driving the Chelsea and Isling<lb></lb>ton omnibus—I have had conversations with both the prisoners since—I spoke to Wood on the Sunday after the Saturday night when this happened—he said he did not know of it till the policeman told him on Sunday morning—he did not know there had been an accident at all—I said it was odd his con<lb></lb>ductor had not seen it—he said he had had a few words with his conductor in</p>

I knew the deceased by sight, I did not know his name—on 17th Sept., between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was in Mortimer-street, about two yards from the public house, which is at the corner of Mortimer-street and Great Portland-street—I believe it is what they call a gin palace—I think there is a great deal of light there—I saw the two <hi rend="italic">'busses</hi> coming along at the rate of between eight and nine miles an hour—they were from fifteen to twenty yards from me—I saw the Chelsea and Islington <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> coming along very nearly on the kerb—the wheel was grinding the kerb, and seeing the old oyster man in danger, I called to the Chelsea and Islington man to <hi rend="italic">hold hard</hi>—I do not know whether he heard me, or whether he could not pull his horses up, but I think he was not coming so fast but he could have heard and have pulled up—when he came near the old gentleman, the roll-bolt, as we call it, that is, the bar which the traces are fastened to, caught the old gentleman at the bottom of the belly—he vomited blood very fast—it went on the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>, some touched the panel.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 99, Great Portland-street, and am a painter. I have seen the deceased man, for the last twelve months, standing at the corner—there is a large public house opposite, which has five lamps, four in Mortimer-street, and one in Great Portland-street—on the night of 17th Sept. I was standing directly opposite the stall—the deceased was opening oysters for a young man who was standing near him—the deceased's son was standing opposite me, alongside of his father, to the left—I saw two omnibuses coming up the road at the rate of from eight to nine miles an hour—it was the noise of the two omnibuses that drew my attention to look round—I do not know the width of Mortimer-street; there is plenty of room for three omnibuses to pass—when I looked round the omnibuses were from twenty to twenty-five yards off—the Islington and Chelsea was half an omnibus' length in front of the Clapton—the Clapton was behind nearly the length of the horses—I saw them distinctly, there was nothing to obstruct my view as they came along—I caught hold of the stall, and said, "By G—d you will be killed!"—it struck the son, and the bar caught the old man and crushed him against the post—I said, "0, my G—d, you have killed the man!"—I took hold of the tub the oysters were in, and handed it in at the bar of the public house—I came out immediately, and said, "You had no right to gallop like that"—it was either to the driver or the conductor of the Islington omnibus that 1 said that—the Clapton had then gone away—when I said that, the driver and the conductor were together; they were both off the omnibus, at the horses' heads—I said it in presence of the driver, if not to the driver—he said I had better mind my own business—I heard that the horse had grazed the fore leg—I went round to see, and saw a mark of mud as if the fore leg of the grey horse had been touched with the hind wheel of the other omnibus—it was too high for the fore wheel to have made the mark—I heard the driver of the Chelsea omnibus say, "He fouled me"—the other omnibus was then gone.</p>

               <p>at the end of Mortimer-street—I was coming to the post to where this stall was—I first heard a noise of omnibuses coming at a furious pace—I got to the middle of the road in front of the first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, as I saw there would bean accident of some kind take place from the position of the two omnibuses being so close together, and close on the corner—what I thought would happen was, that one of the omnibuses would be upset, and break in the public house front—I then saw the collision at the corner; and what appeared to me was, that the splinter bar of the Chelsea omnibus had caught the old man, and jammed him against the post—there was a stoppage for a moment, and the Clapton <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> drew round the corner—I then ran across the road, and saw the old man lying in some one's arms with his head back, as if he was dead—in my judgment, these two omnibuses were driving at a pace dan-gerous to each other—they were driving at a dangerous pace.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of this unfortunate business, I was a passenger on the Chelsea omnibus. It was standing at the corner of Regent-street, when I got up; it was the first—the Clapton omnibus started from very near the Circus; it overtook us at the corner of Mortimer-street—there was a van or wagon in the way, just coming out of Mortimer-street, as we were turning round—we turned into Mortimer-street—the Chelsea omnibus was on the near side; we were going a moderate pace on to the corner where the oyster stall was—just as we were going to turn that corner, the other rushed right across, and that was what caused the accident—supposing the Chelsea omnibus had not been swerved from its course, it would have been able to turn the corner, and to have avoided the stall.</p>

I was sitting on the offside, next the coachman—I got up in the middle of Regent-street—I remember the Clapton omnibus—I cannot recollect seeing the last witness; there was a person sitting on my right—the Clapton omnibus was at the corner—the Chelsea went on, and the Clapton followed it and turned Mortimer-street—when we got near the stall, and got the horses pretty well over the place, the Clapton driver turned his horses round, and pressed the Chelsea omnibus round, supposing that this pressure on the Chelsea omnibus had not taken place, in my opinion the Chelsea omnibus would have cleared the man and his stall—it is my full impression that there was plenty of room.</p>

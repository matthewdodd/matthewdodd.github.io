                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Frederick Braithwaite and an-other—they are engineers. Case was in their service as groom—on the 11th of September, about half-past one o'clock, I saw him at their stable-door—a cart came into the yard to take some dung out—I saw Case take a bag with something in it, and put it into the cart-Pritchard, who was the carman, began to load the cart, and Case pulled the long dung over the bag—I let them load the cart, and as it was going I stopped them—I asked Case what was in the bag he put in the cart—he said, nothing but a little hay-seed that he had shaken out—I called a man named Scanlan to get the dung off, and the sack felt like oats—I had it pulled out, and found in it about a bushel and a half of oats, which I believe were the property of Mr. Braithwaite and his partner-Pritchard said he must go to his father—I went after him, and in the meantime Case took the bag up stain and emptied the oats into the bin again—I followed him and asked him what he did that for, and he said, "The best way too"-Pritchard was so near to Case, when they were put into the cart, that he must have Ken it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a jeweller, and am living at the Globe Hotel, Hatton Garden—on Saturday night, 20th December, I was between Holborn and Oxford Street, where some omni-busses stand, and met the two female prisoners—Sullivan, who speaks a little French, asked me to go home with her, before doing so I went with both women to have a glass, but that was only a momentary affair, just inside the house and out again—we then went to Sullivan's lodging, which is down a turning; I don't know the name of—I went into a house with them, and into a room on the ground floor—both the women went into the room with me, and one of them locked the door, I can't say which—I then took off my clothes upon which one of them extinguished the candle and at that moment three men came in who rushed on me and robbed me of my watch and chain, which were in the left breast pocket of the coat I had taken off, and of a parcel containing jewellery—1 had put my clothes on a chair, and they were thrown down when the three men rushed in, and when I found my clothes there was nothing in them—the room door was unlocked from the outside—the men struck me; I rushed upon them—I see one of them here—I defended myself—they did not strike me, they robbed me of my things, and when I cried "Thief" and "Help" then they struck me.</p>

I only saw them take my clothes. and throw them on the ground—I defended myself and tried to take the clothes away from them, as much as I could—I went quite near <hi rend="italic">to them</hi> and then I halloaed out, and they went out and closed the door and locked me in, and then I broke the door in—my clothes remained inside, and I picked them up right and left—when I went into the room I looked round and took off my coat and under coat, and waistcoat, and that was all—I then went to the bed, and at that moment the candle <hi rend="italic">was</hi> extinguished—my clothes were on the other side of the room—as soon as the candle was extinguished I saw the shadow of the men who came in—they went to my clothes and searched them—I was 3 or 4 yards from my clothes when they searched them, they then threw them down and ran away—I did not strike them till they went out, when I ran after them.</p>

I was called about 12.30 to 7, Bennett's Buildings, which is no thoroughfare—I heard a disturbance and the landlord who was standing at the top of the court told me something—I know the house, it is a brothel—I went into a room on the left on the ground floor and found Sullivan on the bed, and the prosecutor inside the door with his clothes on—the door was unlocked and open—I could not understand the prosecutor's language so I spoke to Sullivan, and asked her if she knew anything of this affair, and said that I should take her to the station for robbing and being concerned in assaulting the man—she said nothing—I took her to the station and on the way she said that she was innocent and knew nothing about it.</p>

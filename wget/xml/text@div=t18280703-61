               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this an uncommon pillar? A. I know it by some marks on it, and the top is not straight; that might happen with others - I have seen the prisoner twice before - I do not know that he is in the habit of making such things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you leave them? A. At half-past five o'clock; this pillar was hanging up against the wall; the shop-door was broken, but the stairs were open.</p>

            . I am a broker. I bought this pillar of the prisoner on the 12th or 13th of June, for 8s. 6d.; he told me he had made it - and said, he was a gas-fitter; I have know him about two years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examnied. Q. Has he not sold such things to you? A. Yes, frequently; I understood he made this too short for an order, and he sold it to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did he live? A. I was to find him at a wine-vaults, where he was know by the name of the Gas-fitter.</p>

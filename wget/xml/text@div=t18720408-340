                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Everall, who keeps dining-rooms at Charles Street, Soho Square—on the 18th March the prisoner was living in my house—about 1 o'clock in the morning I was aroused by a disturbance in my room—I got up to get a light, but laid hold of a man, who pulled me up to the prisoner's bedroom, where he locked the door—I called "Police," and Mr. Blackman came and took him—my husband's watch was gone—it had a cap for it very like this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which Mr. Blackman brought me from the street—the watch and chain were worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the window of the prisoner's room was a little open, and the blind torn down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live within two doors of the prisoner—about 1 o'clock on 8th March I heard screaming in the prisoner's house—there is an empty house next to us—Mr. Everall let me in, and I found Mrs. Everall standing at a bedroom door at the top of the house—I said "Open the door, or I will kick it open"—the prisoner opened it—he was in his shirt—Mrs. Everall said that she had lost her watch—he declared that he had not got it—the window was open, and I said "This is where the watch has gone"—I waited till the crowd had gone, and then picked up this watch-cap, which she identified—the house is three stories high, and the prisoner's window looked on the street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 238). On 8th March, about 1 o'clock, I heard cries of "Police" in the prosecutor's house—I went there, and took the prisoner in custody—I made a search in the street, but there were a number of people there, and I could find nothing—after they had gone I made another search, and found these small pieces of glass, which look like pieces of a watch glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was lodging in the house. I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a bed. I heard a row on the stairs, opened the door, and wanted to know what was the matter; she said that she was trying to get her husband to bed. When I went to bed an organ was playing outside, which was the reason I opened the window, and in opening it the string of the blind broke. She said "My husband has lost his watch." There was a tremendous row, and she ran up again and said that she was certain I was the man who stole the watch. I said "I have never been out of my room, and you are welcome to search it." The man is 81 years old, and she had to shove him up stairs. After I had been there some time, she came up and said that she could let my room for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a lady and gentleman if I would go. I refused, and then she came and said I had got the watch. The police concluded that I had thrown the watch out of my window because the window was up. The woman cannot swear that this is part of her husband's watch. She said that it was done in the dark, and there were other lodgers besides me. A man who pays 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his room is entitled to put the window up if he likes.</p>

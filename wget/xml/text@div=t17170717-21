             deposed, that he being provided by his Gang with a Ladder and Rope, got in at her Casement-Window when no body was in the House, and set a Bar against the Door that no body might come in to interrupt him, and having stollen the Goods, got out at the Back-Window by the help of a Rope. Thomas Motley deposed, that he took the Prisoner with one of his Shirts upon his Back. Another Evidence deposed, that the Prisoner had owned the taking of the Shirts, and 10 s.6 d. in Money. The Prisoner in Court owned the Fact in part, that he did go in at the Window as had been testified, and took the Shirts and 10 s.6 d. but pleaded it was no Robbery, in that it was his own House, and he only took what was his own, saying that the Prosecutor was his Wife's Mother, who skreen'd her Daughter to live in an adulterous manner with the said Thomas Motley, who had ruined him, had thrown him into the Marshalsea with a sham Action, kept him there 16 Weeks, and that the Night they knew he would come out of Prison, they got out of the House, and locked it up that he might not get in; That he had brought home 60 l. and his Wife and the said Thomas Motley had made it all away and ruined him; and that when he went away he left 6 good Shirts, and took the 2 he carried away to be his own, and that as for the Money, he took it out of his Wife's Snuff-box. All this was amply confirmed by the Neighbourhood, and much more, who deposed that he did not do this privately, but before Scores of the Neighbours who advised him to it, they adding, that Thomas Motley had, when the Prisoner had come home to his Wife, beaten him in a very barbarous manner, and that Motley had a Wife of his own at Deptford, but used to leave his own Bed to turn the Prisoner out of his, and lie with his Wife. Others gave the Prisoner a very good Character, and added, he had been the most abused that any Man was; whereupon the Jury <rs id="t17170717-21-verdict99" type="verdictDescription">

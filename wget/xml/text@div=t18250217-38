On the 30th of September I lost a coat and a pelisse from my room, which is on the ground floor - I had brushed them a very few minutes before they were taken, which was about eight o'clock in the evening - the house is let out to lodgers, and the street door is sometimes open. The prisoner came in, and set down as a friend; we had a pint of beer, and he staid about a quarter of an hour: he got up from the table, and went towards the fire - he then returned, and took my coat and a pelisse from a nail in the room, and got out of the door before I could get to it. I and my wife met him again on the 12th of January - she took hold of his arm, but he got from her - and was stopped by some other person.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner come into our room; I went for a pot of porter by his desire, and before I returned he was gone - my husband cried out, "That man has robbed me:" he was not then out of sight; some persons followed him, but he got away - we met him again on the 12th of January, in Broad-street, St. Giles's; he was secured. We have never seen the property since.</p>

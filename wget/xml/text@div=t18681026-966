                  </hi>. I am a musician of 25, Well's Lane, Streatham—on 10th October, I was with some friends at the Greyhound, at Streatham, all the evening from 7.30 or 8 o'clock—when I had been there three quarters of an hour, there was a quarrel on the other side of a partition to where we were—the partition door flew open, and I saw a man on the floor, and the prisoner and several other men beating him—I pulled the man from the floor and got him away—one of the men knocked me, but I took no notice—I fastened the door; the landlord made the men quiet, and there was an end of that—the man I rescued was a good deal hurt—I left the house at a</p>

               <p>few minutes before 12—I noticed three or four of the party talking together before I left, and saw the prisoner come there twice—when I and my friends had got about fifty yards from the house, we waited on the tow-path, bidding our friends good night—I stepped into the road and the prisoner came upon me, and said, "You are the b—I want," and assaulted me two or three times in the road—I saw a knife in his hand—he cut my coat; but did not touch my flesh, then—I got very faint, and remember no more until after I had my arm dressed, when I indentified the prisoner at the station—I have not the least doubt of his being the person who struck me; I saw him twice in the house, and saw him receive some bread and cheese from the landlord—my clothes were smothered with blood—some people came to my assistance.</p>

I am a carpenter, of 25, Well's Lane, Streatham—I was at the Greyhound with Glossop—we wished our friends good night at a little after 12 o'clock—and as soon as we left them the prisoner came up to Glossop, and said, "You are the b—we want," and struck him two or three times with a knife—I tried to lay hold of him, but he cut me twice on the hand, and ran away—I ran after him—I am sure he had a sharp instrument like a knife—my fingers were cut clean—I did not lose sight of him—I caught him about a hundred yards off—I saw that Glossop was wounded, and heard the blood rushing from his arm—when I caught the prisoner I saw something shining in his hand—I detained him till the police came.</p>

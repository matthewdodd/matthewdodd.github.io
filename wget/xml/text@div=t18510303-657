                  </hi>. In Oct., 1849, I was delivery-foreman in the service of the London Dock Company. My duty was at the South Quay Warehouse—I have known Fennell some years, but not to he intimately acquainted with him till about six months before this; about the middle of 1849, I should say—I always understood him to be a commission-agent—in October, 1849, his place of business was at 9 A, Billiter-street, in the neighbourhood of Fenchurch-street—it was my duty to deliver out goods at the Docks, upon presentation of the warrant, after it had been to the office, and had been signed—goods are delivered from loop-holes into a cart, wagon, or any conveyance underneath—a pass would be required, which would pass them out of the Docks—previous to Oct., 1849, Fennell and I had made an agreement that he should purchase some warrants for rice in the market at as low a price as he possibly could, for which I would substitute coffee—the ordinary mode of purchasing coffee lying in the Docks, is to purchase the warrants in the market—in Oct. 1849, there</p>

               <p>was some coffee lying in the South Quay Warehouse, on the 28th floor, which had come by the <hi rend="italic">John Grey</hi>—the prisoner and I made an agreement about it; he informed me that he had bought the rice, or purchased the warrant for it (for lot 108, I believe); and as soon as I had any bags of coffee ready for him, he would come and fetch them away—we always deliver by lots—the whole of the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">John Grey</hi> was not rice—he said he should send the warrant down on a certain day, for four bags, when I was ready—there were at that time many thousand bags of coffee warehoused there—on 17th Oct., 1849, this warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought to me; I received it; it is a warrant for sixteen bags of rice, upon which is endorsed an order for four, upon which I had the power of delivering four bags, and no more—I do not exactly know the man's name that brought it—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was a warrant for sixteen bags of rice, imported in the</hi> John Grey, <hi rend="italic">July,</hi> 1849, <hi rend="italic">deliverable to Erhnfeldt and Co., on which teas endorsed,</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Please deliver four bags to bearer. W. B. Phillips. for Shentin and Co,</hi>")—(<hi rend="italic">Elston was here brought into Court</hi>)—that is the man who brought the warrant to me—the warrant is generally for a portion of the goods only—it is very seldom that the whole is delivered at once—these are my initials on this order; when they are put upon it, it goes to the office, to be counter-signed, with a pass-note, which I give at the time; the counter-pass is then given for the delivery out of the Docks—on receiving this order, I took four bags of coffee from the stores from the South Quay Warehouse—it was in bags which I had made up from the Company's stores—I deliv<lb></lb>ered the bags of coffee to Elston's truck, or rather to Cox's truck, and delivered him this pass—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Pass Cox's truck, with four bags of rice, 389, 108, 588, and 322, ex <hi rend="italic">John Grey,</hi> by order of Erhnfeldt and Co.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185103030003"></xptr>
               <p>I gave information—I did not apply to the Customs for a situation when I came out of prison—I did not apply to them before Jan.—I have never been in prison on any other occasion; I am quite positive of that—I have been charged once; that was for misdemeanor, I suppose you call it—I was going through the street, and saw a <hi rend="italic">row;</hi> a policeman taking a man for being drank and disorderly, or something of the sort; they pulled the man along roughly; I said, "Allow him to get up, and he will walk quietly;" subse<lb></lb>quently be was released by his acquaintances, and I was taken into custody; taken before a Magistrate, and fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was not for assaulting the police, bat for assisting the prisoner, intercepting the policeman in the execution of his duty; it was while I was in the service of the London Docks—I have been in their service nearly thirteen years—I am positive I have never been charged with anything else—I was only on that occasion before a Magistrate, or before any tribunal previous to this transaction, only at that time—I have never been in custody, or charged, since I was discharged—I made these bags of coffee up from the stores in the Company's warehouse, or bags which ought to have been delivered; I made them up—I am not acquainted with the value of the coffee sweeping!—I should say 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound would not be along price, considering the duty would be 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound upon the sweepings, or any coffee—I did not find the sweepings on the floor, and make them up; they were taken into No. 52 floor, in the warehouse, and I took them from there in the clean state; that is what I mean by making them up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said you were discharged from the docks for substituting one bag of coffee for another, what do you mean by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well; when an order came for delivery one bag could not be found, and the beg was taken from the same cargo, but from the following lot—I discovered it myself—it was discovered by the Customs—they called the attention of the Dock people to it, and I was discharged by the Docks, and prosecuted by the Customs—if the rice-warrants cost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the market, that would have to be deducted from the price the coffee fetched, and the remainder we were to receive 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound upon—I do not know the price of the coffee—I never knew what price it fetched—I have seen it quoted in the price list from 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hundred weight, but perhaps more than that—I have seen those prices—I have seen rice quoted at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but am only speaking of what I have seen in the price list.</p>

                  </hi>. In the year 1849 I entered into the prisoner's service—he occupied a room at 9, Billiter-square, Fenchurch-street—I had to sweep the office, take messages, and go of errands—I have been to the South quay, at the London Docks, for him—I knew a man of the name of Compton there—I have teen him there—Mr. Fennell hat sent me</p>

               <p>there to him—he wrote a note, which I took, and was directed to him by the men—I have not gone to see him there by Mr. Fennell's direction very often—I cannot say how many times—I once brought back an answer—I do not recollect what it was—I think it was not written, but by word—I think it was to meet him at the Crown and Anvil, in Swan-street, Minories—I do not know when he sent that message—I saw my master go to the Crown and Anvil once—I recollect Elston bringing four bags of coffee to the office—I know it was coffee, because I saw it opened, I believe, by Mr. Fennell—I think I saw him open it, I will not be certain—it contained sweepings—I saw a little taken out of the bag—it was Mr. Fennell, I suppose, that took that out—I saw him a little while after the bags were brought—he did not say anything when he came in—he saw the bags, but did not order anything to be done with them—I saw one opened, that was when my master was in the room—I did not see anybody else there—it is not a very large room—I saw the coffee that was taken out—it was put on the boards, that is, where the samples an usually put—I did not put it on the boards—there was no one else there but me and my master—I cannot say at all how long it remained there—I did not see it there the next day—the bags of coffee were there a few days—I did not see my master take the samples out—I do not know what became of the bags; I think they must have been delivered away in my absence—my master was not at home when the bags of coffee came—I do not think he said anything when he came in—he saw them there, but did not say anything about them—I did not say anything about them to him—he asked me if I had paid the man for the coffee, and I told him I had paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say he said anything about coffee to you? did he use the word coffee, or did he simply ask you if you had paid the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect—the coffee was there—he could see it—I went into his service on 1st Oct., 1849—I have no recollection whether this transaction was a week, a fortnight, or three months, after I went into his service—I was in his employment about eight months—I do not know what he was; I think he must have been a commission-agent—I am fifteen years old—I have been paid for my attendance—I do not know whether it is by the Customs—I have not received money from the Customs; it was from Mr. Bridges, a police-inspector—I have received about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I think—I have never been at the Customs, at the office of the solicitor—Mr. Bridges did not come to me first; Mr. Evans, a police-inspector, came to me and paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when he saw me—he did not give it me, it was my uncle—I can read and write—I do not know my catechism, not all of it—my uncle only gave me one shilling; I spent it for myself—nobody has given me any money but my uncle and Mr. Bridges—I understand the nature of an oath, that I am to tell the truth, and the whole truth—on my oath nobody else has given me any money except my master; that has nothing to do with this—I do not know a gentleman named Weale.</p>

            . I am a broker. The prisoner brought a copper to my shop to sell, and asked 20 s. for it - we did not agree, and he took it to Lowther's, a few doors off. I think it was on the 31st of July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before - A. Never. He talked some time to me, which made me notice him. I know him to be the man, or I would not say so. He said he had no use for the copper, and wished to sell it.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Bell-street. I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge. I have seen a person, since this transaction, so much like him, that I will not exactly swear positively that he is the man. A person came to me in a direction from Burdett's with a copper, which I bought of him - he said he was a little embarrassed in business, and had sold all his things to a broker, and the copper was the last thing he had to sell. I gave him a stove, worth 8 s., and 8 s. in money for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have seen a person so like him, that a person never seeing him before might be mistaken - A. He really is; for I ran after him myself, and pointed him out to Mrs. Burdett, and she ran also, but said she thought him a shorter man, and not like him. I did not feel comfortable after the prisoner was committed, I thought the other man so like him. The man I bought it of was ten minutes with me - it was about ten o'clock in the morning; I had a full opportunity of seeing him.</p>

            . On the 31st of July, early in the morning, I went with Metcalfe to Lowther's, and found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110090"></xptr>the copper; and from the description he gave the Magistrate, I apprehended the prisoner - and from a name given me a man who had worked in the prosecutor's garden. He said he knew nothing of it. I said he could go with me, and if the people did not know him, I would let him go. He objected. I said if he did not, I must take him by force. Burdett and Lowther said he was the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You got a description of a person who worked in Metcalfe's garden - A. Yes. Metcalfe said a person answering the description Lowther gave, had worked in his garden. I found him coming out from work at seven o'clock, and said I wanted him to go to Bell-street, he said he would not go unless I shewed him my warrant. I said I would handcuff him, and then he went peaceably. Lowther always said he was the man; I do not think he ever made any doubt of him. I will not swear that he did not - I never heard him doubt about it.</p>

            . Lowther was out when I first went there. I saw him next morning, and he equivocated - he went out of the way, and threw every obstacle in the way of our apprehending the man; but when he described him, I immediately said, that from the description he and Burdett gave, I had the fullest conviction that it was the prisoner. I have not fitted the copper to the place - it was wrenched out with a bracket. I have not seen it compared, but there is white plaster on it corresponding with where it was taken from; the workmen had put whitewash in it, and I threw some out; where the lime has been, it is marked - I had observed this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you never seen a copper with lime in it before - A. I do not know that I ever did; it is not second hand.</p>

            . Lowther shewed me where he had flattened it out; a bracket had been left in the kitchen, which had been worked round it to raise the brick work; there were marks where the bricks had been raised against the rim; there are marks of mortar on the bracket, and marks of the bracket on the wall.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see it in the state it was brought to Lowther - A. No; I know it from its general appearance; I bought it myself, the weight is sixteen pounds and a half.</p>

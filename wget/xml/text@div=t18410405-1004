                  </hi>. I am a silversmith and pawnbroker, and live at Nos. 18 and 19, Bolingbroke-row, Walworth; one is a silversmith's, and the other a pawnbroker's shop. On the 3rd of February, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, as I came into the pawnbrokers shop, I found the female prisoner there, and a ring was put into my hand by the shop-man—she asked 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I asked her what it was—she said it was a dia<lb></lb>mond ring—I said, "Prior to lending you so much on a valuable ring, perhaps you will give me your name and address?"—she gave me, Franklin, No. 18, Walworth-road"—I said, "I will accompany you, and see that it is right"—she then said, "I don't live there, I live at Islington"—I said, "What part of Islington?"—she said, "Vineyard"—and was about to make some addition, but caught the word up, and said, "Goswell<lb></lb>terrace," (I think, No. 5,) and said, "The ring was given to me by a gen<lb></lb>tleman who slept with me last night, and said that he lived at No. 18, Walworth-road—I desired my young man to fetch a policeman—she-heard me, and desired me to consider her respectability—while my man was gone for the policeman I had come round the counter and stood near the door, and saw the prisoner Harding walk by the shop and return in almost a second—he passed and repassed, and as he passed tire door I heard a person cough twice—Franklin desired me to let her go, and de<lb></lb>clared to God she had never been in my shop before, and if I would let her go, and give her the ring, she would never come into it more—when I heard the cough the door was partly open, but chained—I pulled it open, and Harding was looking in at the window of the silversmith's shop—he took no notice of me, but walked gradually on towards the turnpike—I stood some time, and looked after him—there is the Fountain beer-shop, kept by Garrett, five or six doors from my shop, between that and the turnpike—he passed that, and went towards the turnpike—I saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner Frenaby standing at the beer-shop door, looking towards my shop—when Harding passed, he took no notice at all of Frenaby—my young man returned without a policeman, and I and him took Franklin to the station ourselves—as I came out of my own door, Frenaby stood at the beer-shop door, and as we came near it, on our way to the station, he gradually withdrew into the house—he had an opportunity of seeing Franklin with us—we all three passed the beer-shop door, and I saw Fre<lb></lb>naby standing just against the bar—he took no notice of Franklin—a few doors past the beer-shop I met Harding coming towards us—he passed, holding his head down, without taking any notice whatever—I turned round afterwards, and saw him looking after us, and in a few seconds Frenaby came from the beer-shop door and seemed to join him in conversation—Harding was going in a direction from the station, but they both turned round and followed us, but I did not see them come through the turnpike—the material in this ring is a very good imitation of a diamond—it is set transparent, which lessens the suspicion—it is paste, not a stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband, at No. 5, Goswell-terrace. Harding came to lodge with me on the 24th of December—Franklin had told me that she expected some friends out of the country, and she wanted a room for them, and he came the same evening with Franklin—he had a cloak on—he brought goods—Franklin paid me the rent for the first fort<lb></lb>night</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the night of the 11th of February I took Harding and his wife into custody, at No. 5, Goswell-terrace—I said I had a warrant against him and his wife—he asked, "What for?"—I said for a transaction connected with some pins which had been pledged at different pawnbrokers—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

Kibbear and Evans; he afterwards refused to make any more purchases of the Jews, but went and made his purchases himself of the makers—I asked him, whether Frenaby had not occasionally worn his cloak—he said, "Oh yes, repeatedly; I have repeatedly lent him my cloak, and so has Mary Ann Franklin my wife's; the one she has got on now is her's—he said he had been a jeweller; that he had been brought into it entirely through Fre<lb></lb>naby; that he was respectably connected, and that Frenaby had been his journeyman—I had seen some duplicates at Frenaby's lodging, and I asked Harding where the duplicates were—he said, he had deposited them with a friend of his, at No. 8, Wynyatt-street—I went there, and found the du<lb></lb>plicate of the cloak, which I took out, and have produced—I found Fre<lb></lb>naby at the Pheasant public-house, Gray's Inn-lane, the following morn<lb></lb>ing, the 12th—I told him what he was charged with—he said nothing.</p>

               <p>warrant was granted—I should not have taken him if he had said nothing, without having the landlord up, to see if that was the Mr. Harding—it was perhaps two or three minutes before I was satisfied that he was the man—I asked many questions after I was satisfied he was the party; but that was after he told me his positive determination of turning Queen's evi<lb></lb>dence; and I repeatedly cautioned him, that he had better reserve what he bad to say till he went before the Magistrate—he said, "No, I mean to tell all I know; I don't mean to conceal any fact before the Magis<lb></lb>trate"—I did not put several questions to him after cautioning him not to say any thing—a general conversation took place between us on the way to the station, in which he was perfectly communicative; and even without having said any thing for a minute or two, he would break out again, to tell roe some circumstance connected with the transaction—I did not get any thing from him at that time by asking him questions—it was after he had said he would turn Queen's evidence that I asked him if a female was not with him at Boyce's—I put that question to gain information which he was readily disposed to give—my first questions were, to see whether or no I had the right man, not to gain information of the entire offence, and that he was the person who committed it—it was after he said he would tell all he knew, that I asked him about waiting in the beer-shop—I asked him about the cloak previous to being convinced he was the man—I had been in the house more than an hour before he came home, and had seen the landlord—I gained information from him, that a person named Harding lived in the room, but he did not describe him to me—Harding came in, and let himself up stairs, without being seen by me or the land<lb></lb>lord.</p>

               <p>- PINNER sworn.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - About fourteen. I am servant to Mr. Firmage. On Christmas night I was at the next door; I saw the prisoner cross the way, and take two pint pots off the rails.</p>
               <p>Whose pots were they? - Mr. Firmage's. I put them on the rails. It was seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Could you see him? - Yes; it was only next door; He went a few doors farther, and put them in his pocket; he then returned, I thought, to take some more. I went over the way, and told the watchman of it, who was at my master's door.</p>

               <p>I was going by Mr. Firmage's door, and the boy came and told me, that a man over the way had taken two of his master's pots and put them in his pocket. I went to lay hold of him, and he made a stroke at me with a stick, and ran away. I pursued him and took him. I asked him what he had done with the pots; he said they were Mr. Firmage's pots, that he was only playing the rogue with the boy, and would bring them to Mr. Firmage. I secured him, and brought him to Mr. Firmage's. The pots were not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Firmage. When the prisoner was brought to my house, we got a candle and lantern and searched the stable yard which he ran through, and found the pint pots on a dung-hill in the corner of the yard. Ayres was not with us when we found the pots.</p>

               <p>It is all right what Mr. Firmage says; I was so much in liquor that I did not know what I did at the time.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Clapp of the Grosvenor Arms, Buckingham Palace Road—on 3rd July about 11 p.m. I served the prisoner with a glass of ale—he gave me a shilling which I put into the till and gave him the change—shortly afterwards he came in again and gave me another shilling which I put near the other and gave him the change—he went out and returned in less than five minutes for a penny cigar, he gave me another shilling and I gave him the change, two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces and the rest in copper—I tried the shilling and found it bent easily—I then took the second shilling from there—I had put it with the farthings, tried it and it bent easily—I gave one of the shillings to my husband who went outside and brought the prisoner in, who said he was not aware it was bad—I gave the other shilling to the constable.</p>

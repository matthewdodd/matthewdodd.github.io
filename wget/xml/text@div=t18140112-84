               <p>Q. Did they carry any bones for you on the 29th of December - A. They did, their carts received fourteen loads, but we heard they only received thirteen loads. Their carts were employed to carry bones to their dock at Whitefriars, and the road they should take is through Gray's-inn-lane, Fetter-lane, and Water-lane; that is the direct road from Battle-bridge to their dock; Fleet-market would be out of the way. The prisoner was a carter; he was employed, and took several loads that day, and particular the last. About seven o'clock the prisoner had a load of bones at our house, Battle-bridge; he had two horses to his cart; the horse between the shafts was a grey horse; the prisoner was the driver of that cart. The prisoner said at the magistrate's that he did not drive that load. I am quite certain that he did; I saw him go with it. It would take half an hour to go from our house at Battle-bridge to Whitefriars dock. I am certain he drove the last load of bones; the load of that cart was worth four pounds ten shillings.</p>

The prisoner was not with his cart; the man that was with it was driving the horses as fast as he could drive them. The cart appeared to me to be empty, by the rattle of it. It was dark; I could not tell who the man was that was driving of it.</p>

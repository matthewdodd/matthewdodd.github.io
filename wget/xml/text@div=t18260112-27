            ; I have been there five months, and live there with my family. On the night of the 12th of December I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock, and saw every thing fast and secure; the pannel of the back door, leading into the yard, was secure and unbroken when I went to bed; I was alarmed by the watchman springing his rattle about one o'clock, and got up - I found the prisoner in his custody, in the passage. I found the yard door open, and a considerable portion of the brick-work of the wall, by the side of the door, pulled down - there was a small hole there before, to let the fowls through; it had been broken more, to enable him to unfasten the bottom bolt, but the pannel was broken to get to the upper bolt. I found a dark lantern in a shed on the premises; I never saw it there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had not searched the shed to know whether it was there before? A. No. The wall was in a decayed state before; nothing but a fork was found upon the prisoner; he at first pretended to be drunk, but when he got to the watch-house he was quite sober.</p>

            . I lodge in this house. On the 12th of December, at one o'clock, I was sitting up at work, and heard a noise below, in the house; I thought somebody was up - I opened the front window, and called the watchman; he went to the back of the premises - I know no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you observed this brick wall? A. It was in a very decayed state; there was a hole for the fowls to go through; I saw that hole the day before - I suppose a boy could get through it.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is in Dorrington-street and Great Warner-street. On the 12th of December, about ten minutes past one o'clock, Hurrell called me, and said she heard an unusual noise in the house; I went and tried the shutters, which were fast - I went into the back yard; there are two doors to the yard, one of which is never fastened; as soon as I got in there I saw the prisoner come out of the passage of the dwelling-house; I made a spring to lay hold of him - he threw himself into the covered skittle-ground, and got under some forms; I secured him there, sprung my rattle, and took him into the house. I found the pannel of the door broken, and the brick-work pulled down - he could not get through the hole; the pannel had been broken to get at the top bolt. I found a dark lantern in the place where he threw himself down to hide; the pannel was in three pieces and had only been tacked in. I dare say forty bricks were pulled out of the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And yet a man could not get through? A. It was a large hole, but extended upwards, to find the bolt - I think a middling sized boy could not get through. Nothing but a fork was found upon him. - The pannel had been sawed; he said he was drunk, but did not appear so in the least.</p>

            . I am headborough of Clerkenwell. I went to the house and found the pannel broken. I dare say the hole in the wall was three feet by two, sufficient for a man to get through; it was not the pannel of the door that was sawed, but the lining - it had been done to get at the top bolt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The aperture in the wall was three feet by two? A. I did not measure it, but suppose it was nearly three feet high, and eighteen inches or two feet broad.</p>
               <p>ROBERT MEAGLE re-examined. I had seen the aper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120019"></xptr>ture in the wall the day before, but not in the evening - it was not large enough then to admit a man through; I saw this door secure, with both bolts, when I went to bed, and left nobody up but Hurrell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As they brought me along I was used cruelly, and cut over the head and arms. They said as we went to the office, "You are not gone yet - this will do to go to the Old Bailey with."</p>
               <p>ROBERT MEAGLE. I have seen the prisoner at my house once or twice - he was there on the evening in question, and went backward three or four times with his companions.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He had been drinking? A. Not to make himself drunk - he and three others had four pots of beer; I saw him leave the house. There is a thoroughfare through the house in the day time, but not all night; it is not a public thoroughfare. I give the persons in Red Lion-yard leave to go through - they come through the bar, and through my yard - the doors are locked at night.</p>

I had not gone far before two or three cross'd me, and the first run, I believe he had an Eye upon the Chain of my Watch, and got the Watch, then he cry'd, Hallow, and they all run away, down Gracechurch-street ; I immediately put my Hand to my Pocket, and said, 'tis gone, 'tis in vain to go after them; I then told the People. I had a Mischance, and lost my Watch: I look'd into the Papers to see if it were advertised, and not finding that, in a few Days I advertised it my self, and then a Person came to me, (I think it was Tuesday was Seven-Night ) and said, he believed there was a Man in the Poultry-Compter could tell me something of it; I went there, and

I said, Yes: Upon which I asked him, if he could not procure me my Watch again? He said, he would endeavour to procure me my Watch; he said, he was the Man that took it from me. The Watch is in Court. This is the Watch.</p>

The Prisoner at the Bar, and W. Bryers passed him, and when I saw him, I turned back from him, and walked before him; then they turned round and seized his Arms, and kept him that he could not go any farther, then I turn'd round and came up to his Face, and took his Watch out of his Pocket, the Watch which is now produced, is the same Watch I took from him, we run down Gracechurch-street immediately; we sold the Watch jointly, to one Jack the Sailor, who is now in Newgate, and he sold it to the Person I got it of; we sold it for two Guineas, and divided the Money.</p>

My Lord, this vile Rogue is only going to swear my Life away to save his own, and there is Evidence against him now, at this Time; and when I was carried to Woodstreet-Compter, to him, he said, he would not hurt a Hair of my Head; but he only did it to make his Information stronger than the others. <rs id="t17420714-25-verdict123" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Jefferys, in Thames-street, he is an ironmonger; I first saw him with this tobacco about him, opposite to Dice's-key, between one and two; to the best of my knowledge and judgment, there were twenty four or twenty five pound, there was as much as would fill a large hay basket; my master stopped him, the tobacco was concealed in his coat, and his pockets, and up as high as his breast, he had a great coat on, it was in the pockets of his great coat, and in the pockets of the other, it was buttoned up between his great coat and waistcoat; when my master stopped him, he asked what he had there, he said he had a little tobacco from on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Did he say what ship? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he describe what sort of a ship? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he use he word ship, or lighter? - Ship; my master charged the watch with him; I went by my master's orders to get a constable, and during the time he came down, I assisted him in taking the tobacco from the prisoner; the prisoner said, pray let me throw the tobacco into a passage, which leads to our house by a private door, but that was objected to; I told him not to throw it in, but throw it out before the watchman who had charge of him, which he rather seemed to object to; and when the tobacco was all thrown out from his clothes, I went and fetched a basket from out of the shop, and put it in, and I had much to do to press it down, and after pressing it, and kneeling upon it, there was more than would fill the basket; the prisoner very much objected to be tied.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How happened you to be out at that time in the morning? - I was with my master.</p>
               <p>What were you doing? - My master had a few friends at his country house, and in going home with his friends he was insulted by the watch, he told the watchman he did not understand his meaning in being insulted; he went home with his friends, and came back to his house, and begged of me to go with him to the watch-house, I went to the watch-house, and enquired into the ill behavour, and ill treatment of the watchmen towards him, they did not seem to pay any attention to what he said; coming to the door I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was anybody with you when you met the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Where is your master's country house? - At Hackney.</p>
               <p>What time did you return? - Near ten.</p>
               <p>A little jolly? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>How had he spent his time till half past one? - In going home with his friends, in coming back, and going to the watch-house; he went home with his friends to Water-lane, near the Custom-house, he returned between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>What did he do with himself from that time till half past one? - He went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Was not your master out of humour that night? - I do not know that he was.</p>
               <p>Was he or was he not out of humour? - He was not Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, he was in as good humour as he is generally.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140157"></xptr>Then this good humoured man, at half past ten went out settling a dispute; do you mean to swear that he was in perfect good humour, and that he staid three hours and a half? - He was two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Then this good humoured man was two hours and a half settling a dispute, you admit that? - Well then, Sir, it shall be so.</p>
               <p>Do you remember this prisoner stating, that somebody had stolen this tobacco, and that he ran after them and picked it up? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he bailed afterwards? - I heard so.</p>
               <p>What Judge bailed him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it was one of the Judges of the King's Bench? - I presume nobody else can.</p>
               <p>Do you remember your master saying anything about paying the piper for all this? - What is paying the piper?</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him say any thing of that import? - No.</p>
               <p>He never did say it? - No, not till the transaction happened.</p>
               <p>Ho! ho! how long have you been an ironmonger, they have spoiled you very much! did not your master say something of this sort, that the watchman having used him very ill, he had resolved to make the prisoner suffer for it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You swear he did not? - I will, he never said he would take up any watchman, or make a watchman suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Was not you in liquor? - I never was any ways disguised in liquor.</p>
               <p>Did this transaction happen as you have stated it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person on whom the tobacco was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>HUMPHRY JEFFRYS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an ironmonger, I have nothing more to say than what my young man has related; on the 3d of July my friends came to see me at Hackney, and staid till ten; at ten I arrived in Thames-street, I then went with them to Water-lane, and went from their house between ten and eleven, and I saw some very suspicious people; I says to one of the watchmen, I wish you would give some little attendance, for I see some people that appear very suspicious; this is a watchman whose name I do not know, but I gave information to the constable; his reply was, d - n you, I do not know anybody looks more suspicious than yourself, and if you do not get away I will send you to the Compter or the watch-house, and I thought he would; I told him I would pay him another visit, and I went to my friends, and staid half an hour, then I came back, and saw this watchman off his stand, and two men attempting to steal something; I then went and took my young man, the last witness, to the watch-house, to make a complaint to the constable of the night, and to the watchmen, and he went with me to the watch-house, and when we got there he was gone his rounds, and I staid there till he came in, and in coming back I stopped the prisoner at the bar, very much stuffed, I imagined he had something that was not his own property; ther e was nobody with him.</p>
               <p>At that time he was quite a stranger to you? - Yes, I never saw him before, to the best of my knowledge; I stopped him near Dice key gate-way, he was walking towards the Custom-house, I asked him what he had there, he said a little tobacco; I asked him where he got it from, he said from on board a ship; I charged him with the watch, who was near me, he went into a passage, and there he begged to unload himself; I saw the tobacco pulled from him, he had it all about him, particularly about the skirts of his great coat.</p>
               <p>Had he any between his coat and waistcoat? - I am not particular to that, I gave charge of him and the tobacco; my young man put it into a basket, like a hay basket, and he had a good deal of trouble to put it in, but that may be the lightness of it, the constable has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was not till the third examination that the prisoner was committed, did you attend at the first and second? - I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140158"></xptr>Did you tell your story? - Yes, my servant did not attend; I told my story as I have done now, with the same particulars, the first, second, and third time.</p>
               <p>You swore to your account, did not you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you at the second? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive notice of the news of the persons that would be bail? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was he going the direct way to the Custom-house? - No, I think not, the direct way is the foot path, he was in the road way.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was he or was he not in the direct road to the Custom-house? - He was not, because he was not on the foot path.</p>
               <p>We have had evidence that you are a good natured man, do not put yourself in a passion, I will have an answer if I sit here till midnight; upon your oath, was he in the direct way to the Custom-house? - Upon my oath I do not believe that to be the direct road for a foot passenger, because he was behind the corner of some buildings.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, whether that street is not the direct road to the Custom-house? - It is certainly; but I will not be brow beat by any man.</p>
               <p>Nor am I so young in my profession to be brow beat by the greatest ironmonger in the kingdom; the man was in Thames-street, and Thames-street was in the way to the Custom-house? - Yes; when it was weighed it weighed twelve pounds and three quarters, but from the appearance it was more.</p>
               <p>Was that cask out of which it was taken ever weighed or no? - I know nothing of the cask.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it was weighed or no? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What sort of tobacco was it? - It was tied up as tobacco generally appears out of ships.</p>
               <p>Unmanufactured? - I am not a judge of it.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know what it is called by those that are? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Have you looked at it? - I have not.</p>
               <p>How soon must this man have come within the view of the watchmen of the Custom-house if he had gone on? - In ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of himself before the Mayor? - That he saw a man drop it, and he ran and took it up, and was going to carry it to the Custom-house, and he produced a white bag.</p>
               <p>Would it have been the cause of this man's discharge from his employment as a watchman if he had been found absent without such an excuse as that he was going to carry tobacco to the Custom-house? - I am so much unacquainted with the Custom-house business that I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to me such as comes from abroad? - I only saw it separated about; my young man and him took it up, he did not come the foot path, but turned into that corner.</p>

               <p>Was not you near enough to observe whether he observed you or not? - I do not think he did see me; he might see the watchman opposite.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did I hear right that you do not think he saw you? - I think not, at the time he was passing; the constable has had the tobacco ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jeffrys sent his young man to the watch-house; I came to the watch-house, Mr. Jeffrys was there with the prisoner; Mr. Jeffrys seemed to be very troublesome, and asked what watchmen I had on; he sat there two hours, and was very troublesome; indeed I went down when he said the tobacco was in Mr. Jeffry's passage; he shewed me the tobacco; I have had it ever since; it is now in Court. (Produced.) it is now unmanufactured as the other was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe this is like a great many thousands of hogsheads, so that if you had lost it out of your pocket last night, you could not have sworn to it today? - Not at all, I have not compared it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140159"></xptr>Fennel. The prisoner told me going along, that he had got the tobacco from on board a ship, that is all that he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Jeffrys had been at the watch-house some time? - He was there a long while, and when I came back he said the watchmen had been using him very ill, I took the watchman off for his abuse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jeffrys was a little out of humour that night? - I believe he was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>He is not a good natured man in his cups? - I have been a constable in that part three years, I do my duty as much as I can.</p>
               <p>Then you would not by choice, if you had a parcel of stolen goods, come through your beat? - We do our duty as well as we can, I belong to the same employ as the prisoner; I had the first charge of the lighter that evening, it was all safe at twelve, no tobacco was missing; in the morning the head of one of the hogsheads was out, and about six pounds gone; I could not know the tobacco again; all tobaccos that come to the keys are in that way; the ship watchman was not there at six in the morning; I have known the prisoner three years.</p>
               <p>Is Thames-street the nearest way from that lighter to the Custom-house? - Much handler than going through the keys for the casks, I should have come that way myself.</p>
               <p>I need hardly ask you what his general reputation was, was it a good one? - I never heard any complaint in the world; he has a pretty place in the India House; I do not believe this quantity of tobacco could come out of that hole.</p>
               <p>There is a vast deal of this tobacco smuggled, as we all know? - Yes, it is a common practice.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

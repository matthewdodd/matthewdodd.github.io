                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Haslam, Appleton, Co., tea merchants, 45, Eastcheap—in March, 1872, the prisoner entered our employment as traveller, at a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—afterwards he took up his abode at Newcastle and we increased his salary to 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in June, 1873, I went to see how, he was getting on at Newcastle—I found that he had received one or two small amounts which he had not remitted and I told him it was altogether contrary to the arrangement and threatened him with dismissal, but having feeling for him I overlooked the matter and his arrangement went on—his instructions were to advise us of money the same day as received; it may be not possible to remit on the same day but it is on the neext—in October, 1873, I again communicated with him and I believe he came to London—in January, 1875; his salary was increased to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—in June, 1875, an arrangement was come to that-Wheeler should be employed to assist him—he was his brother-in-law—in November, 1875, Brassington came to London—between these dates I was at New<lb></lb>castle and saw the prisoner, and I told him the arrangement with his brother-in-law was thoroughly unsatisfactory and the sooner he could get Wheeler into some other employment the better—then in November fol<lb></lb>lowing he came to London on matters of business generally—his salary was reduced 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Wheeler had an additional 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in February, 1876, I was informed by Brassington that Wheeler had got other employment—on 23rd March an investigation was made into the books by Mr. Betram—in con<lb></lb>sequence we sent a statement to Messrs. Byers &amp; Young, our oustomers, of 85, Clayton Street, New<lb></lb>castle-on-Tyne—it is the custom with our customers to allow three months' credit—we allow a discount for cash at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, four months' discount we allow—we wrote to the prisoner in the ordinary course, telling him that we had sent these statements—he did not know the contents—we gave him the amounts. (<hi rend="italic">The statement teas handed in; it was addressed to Messrs. Byers &amp; Young, containing different date and different sums, amounting to </hi>246<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d., and asking for a remittance.</hi>)We received this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)for Byers &amp;.

(<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> 71, Clayton Street, New<lb></lb>jastle-on-Tyne, March 24th 1876. Messrs. Haslam, Appleton, &amp; Co. Gentlemen,—No orders.

Mr. Webb was present at the interview with his wife—he is, I believe, an experienced detective officer—I did not offer to adandon the prosecution, I may have said to the wife "I could not promise anything, but if she knew where he was I should advise her to come to London"—his salary was 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—he knew that was to cover his expenses when he agreed to the salary.

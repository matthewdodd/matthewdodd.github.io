             was one of them, and the prisoner another. We dined altogether in the field, about one o'clock, and were all in good humour at dinner - we had a pot of strong beer each. We got up from dinner between one and two, and went across the swath of clover towards our work. Words occurred between Johnson and Richardson - Johnson swore that he had a foot wider swath than Richardson - he said he would lay him 1 s. that he had. They continued walking further across the field - we were nearly all together. Richardson said to Johnson, with an oath, that he would strike him - we all had our scythes; Johnson threw down his, and, with an oath, told him to hit him, if he liked. Richardson still repeated that he would strike Johnson, but I never saw that he did, nor did I see him make any attempt to strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anything to hinder your seeing him if he had - A. No; I was within two poles of him - he possibly might have hit him, but I never saw him - my back was sometimes towards him - I was walking before them sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. After Johnson threw down his scythe, what was next done - A. Richardson still threatened to hit him. Johnson picked up his scythe, and, with an oath, swore he would chop his legs off. He had hold of the handles of his scythe as if he was going to mow, holding it in both hands. He stepped up to him with his scythe as soon as he possibly could pick it up, and said he would chop his legs off.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180024"></xptr>They stood hesitating together some little time, and then the prisoner struck him with the scythe. Richardson had not got his scythe, he had laid it down.</p>
               <p>Q. After Johnson had taken up his scythe, had Richardson used words of any kind to him, and before he struck at Richardson - A. They stood wrangling together - the prisoner struck him with the scythe, and Richardson directly fell backward, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord! Oh dear! - You have killed me!" I ran to Johnson and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord! Oh dear! What have you done! - are you not ashamed of yourself?" He said he would serve any man so that meddled with him; he was in a passion at that time. I was so much frightened at seeing the deceased lay bleeding there, that I ran immediately for a horse and cart to carry him away. I was not gone half an hour, and when I returned Johnson was gone - Richardson laid as I had left him; we put him into the cart and took him home. He said he was dying, and died in a few hours. I saw him after he was dead. The prisoner lived near Hadley. I never saw him afterwards till this month, when he was in custody at the Town Hall, Borough.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the deceased a stout young man - A. He was tall and thin, but stouter than the prisoner - the whole cause of the quarrel was about their work - we were all very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at any time that Richardson had clenched his fist, as if to strike him - A. No, he threatened him; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, I am a good mind to hit you." I did not look at him till I saw Johnson pick up his scythe. I was walking before them; he struck him in the left thigh; the scythe went through one thigh and struck the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you know that the man was a quarrelsome fellow, he was a quarreling with you before - A. He quarrelled with me the year before that, but not on this day; they were both very hot tempered resolute men. I have known him quarrel, but there was no quarrel on that day before this circumstance - he was of a hasty temper.</p>

            . In June, 1821, I was working in Mr. Paris's field, on a Friday, and dined with the men - we were all in a very good humour at dinner, and after that, words occurred between the prisoner and Richardson, about which had got the biggestswath from the ground - I do not know which began it; they kept wrangling, and I left them; but before that, the prisoner asked me to measure the swath, I said I would not, and begged of them to come to work - they still kept wrangling, and I heard Richardson say to Johnson, that if he called him so again, he would knock him down. I did not hear Johnson make any answer. I went on a little farther, and then heard Richardson scream out. I instantly turned round, and saw him lay bleeding on the ground. I went back to him immediately - he was laying flat on his back with his heels up in the air - I do not recollect his speaking. I saw the prisoner at that time, but did not observe what he was doing; the scythe laid on the ground a very little way from Richardson. I asked the prisoner if he was not ashamed of what he had done; he said No, he was not ashamed for he would serve any person so who hit him. I helped afterwards to put Richardson into a cart, and tied five handkerchiefs round the wound on his thigh, before I could staunch the blood; we took him home - he died that afternoon. I did not see Johnson again till he was apprehended; he lived in Enfield parish, and had a wife and children. I have to state that Richardson was certainly a very aggravating, domineering man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far off were you when you heard the scream - A. About twenty yards, or more. I could not see Richardson strike him if he ever did.</p>

            . I was working for Mr. Paris at this time; we finished dinner between one and two o'clock, and were very good friends; but, on the way to our work, words passed between the prisoner and Richardson; they laid a bet, which had the biggest swath. I left them at high words, and was going down the field. I turned my head, and saw Johnson coming down the field with his scythe on his shoulder - he had laid it down to measure their work, when I turned to go away. I turned and saw him with his scythe, and saw the deceased coming after him - he also had his scythe on his shoulder - they were still at high words. I turned round and saw the deceased have his left hand up, with his fist clenched, holding it towards Johnson (he was a left handed man) he was within reach of him - they were almost close together - he was near enough to hit him. I kept my eye on him, and did not see him hit him.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time he held up his fist, had Johnson his scythe in his hand - A. Not at that moment, but when Richardson held up his fist, Johnson picked up his scythe, and cut him down. I saw the blood flow from the wound; he fell instantly, and the blood came from his thigh. I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Lord have mercy upon me." I went to fetch the surgeon, and when I came back, he was taken home. I saw him when he was dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I think you must have seen him hit me, when he held his fist up - A. I never saw him strike him, only hold up his hand as if to strike him.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it possible for him to hit him, and you not have seen it - A. Not at that instant. I had turned back, hearing them at high words. He might have hit him before I turned back, and I not have seen it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you saw the prisoner cut him down did you speak to him - A. No, my Lord; I ran off for a surgeon.</p>

            . I was working in the field when this happened. We all dined together in good temper, and as we crossed towards the work, words arose between the deceased and prisoner, about which had done the most work. I went on about my business, and began to work at some distance. Johnson came to me soon after, and asked if I had got any money in my pocket - I said I believed I had 4 s.; he asked me to let him have it - I gave it to him, and he went away. I did not know what had happened then - I was twenty or thirty poles from where the quarrel began.

            . I am a surgeon. On the 9th of June 1821, I was sent for to see the deceased. I found him wounded in the thigh, about six inches above the knee: the principal wound was a very extensive one in the left thigh - the principal artery was divided; he died between three and four o'clock. His death was occasioned by the division of that artery. The wound was on the side of his thigh, and passed through - it might have been done with a scythe.</p>

The deceased had been quarrelling all day about mowing, with Austin; and when he challenged to fight me, the row began. He said he would lay me a pot of beer that his work was two feet more than mine - Austin and Beckett measured it, and mine was two feet more. I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, Jem, I have won." He said,</p>

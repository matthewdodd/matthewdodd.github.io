                  </hi>, I am the prisoner's mother—I remember her being con<lb></lb>fined on 24th Jan. last year—she had twins, a male and female—on 31st Jun. I was in the room—her husband was there—she was in bed, and the children with her—she suckled them then, but did not so so many hours after—this was on Saturday—I had observed what I considered insanity on the Thursday before—she wished me to see to her children, and thought she was dying, and was talking very much on religious subjects, and seemed very restive indeed—I found she did not know what she was talking about—she talked so strangely we did not know what to make of her—on this Saturday, while she was in bed, I asked her husband to take particular care of her, as she was very violent—to the child and with me—there was no reason whatever for that violence—I told her husband to take care of her, and watch her while I went to the fire-place—he turned round, and said to me, "Mother, she has</p>

               <p>thrown here down on the child," and when he went to remove her, I saw her make a catch at the child, and bite it on the cheek—her husband took the child away from her—I observed that the child's cheek was bit—I believe there were two marks on the cheek—her husband had to pull her head back to get the child from her—I took the child to Mr. Mason, the doctor, and went back to my daughter—she then appeared in a more raving state—her husband had tied her down with the sheet, on account of the violence she dis<lb></lb>played—she talked about religion, and told us to take care of her children—first she said she would have them, and then she said she would not have them—I considered she was raving mad—she was in a raving state—I was at the baptism of the child—its name was James King—it lived three weeks and two days.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Newington. On 31st Jan., about ten o'clock in the evening, last witness brought a male child to my house—the face all round the mouth and left cheek was covered with blood—on removing the blood, I discovered several punctured wounds, a slit of the left angle of the mouth, one puncture through the upper lip, another near the line of the nostril, and another near the eye—there was a complete circle round the left cheek, which was very tumefied—there were marks of teeth; inflammation and suppuration followed—I attended the child about three weeks, and then it died—I went out of humanity to see the prisoner—I found her raving mad with puerperal mania—I saw her the same night after seeing the child—she was not capable of hold<lb></lb>ing conversation—in my judgement, she was decidedly insane, and perfectly unconscious of what she was saying or doing.</p>

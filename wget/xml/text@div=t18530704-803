We have correspondents in New York, carrying on business under the name of Duncan, Shearman, and Co.—they furnish persons coming from the United States with letters of credit upon our bank—those letters of credit contain a list of their correspondents in the principal towns on the Continent—they are called circular letters of credit—it is the practice, upon a person applying for a sum of money to any of those correspondents, for him to draw upon the Union Bank of London, and for the bankers cashing the draft to endorse the sum on the back of the letters of credit—that is in the case of the letter of credit being used abroad—I have never been in Berlin or St. Petersburg, but I have seen many hundreds of these bills—the object of the endorsement on the letter by the bankers cashing the draft, is to let the bank see that the amount mentioned in the body of the bill has not been exceeded—when the last sum which the bearer is entitled to draw upon is drawn, the last banker keeps the letter of credit—I have seen this letter of credit (<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced</hi>)—it is in the usual form—in Nov., 1852, we received advice from Duncan and Shearman of a letter of credit having been issued to Gabriel Sans Garrett.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the force of the evidence was the other way, and that the evidence might be given</hi>)—the letter of credit which the prisoner produced was numbered 41, in favour of Gabriel Sans Garrett, for 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was drawn upon a form identical with this (<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced</hi>)—I have the letter of which we received from Duncan, Shearman, and Co.—I should not produce that to the party presenting the letter of credit; I should compare it for my own information—we have not received any advice of any other letter of credit issued to a person of that name, or of any other numbered 41—after I had compared the letter of credit with the advice, the prisoner drew a check—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—he drew this at the time—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"London, 11th Dec, 1852. Union Bank of London. Pay self general L. of C, or bearer, number 41, fifty pounds, on account of Duncan, Shearman, and Co. Gabriel S.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, carrying on business at No. 5, Adam-court, Old Broad-street, City. We have also a house of business at St. Petersburg, the firm there is Wilson and Co.; in London it is John Wilson, jun., and Co.—our house at St. Petersburg is in the habit of paying letters of credit from the house of Duncan, Shearman, and Co., of New York—we received the four bills that have been produced from our house at St. Petersburg, three of them on 2nd March, and the other on 4th March, by post—we keep an account with Williams, Deacon, and Co., of Birchin-lane—we paid three of the bills into our account there, the other, the one for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we presented ourselves—it was afterwards presented by Mr. Burwash, on our account—none of them were paid—they are all made payable to our firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> On 17th Jan. I saw the prisoner at St. Petersburg; he produced a letter of credit from the house of Duncan, Shearman, and Co.; it was numbered 41, and was in favour of himself, for the amount of 5,210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I noticed the endorsements on the letter, they purported to be endorsements of payments previously made on the same letter by the Union Bank, of London, and by Brothers Schincklen, of Berlin—I do not remember positively the amount of the first endorsement of payment by the Union Bank of London, I believe it was for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner requested an advance from our house in favour of the letter—I advanced him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first instance, and he drew this bill for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I endorsed that 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the letter of credit, and returned the letter to him—on 21st Feb. (New Style), he came again, and produced the same letter—we then advanced him a further sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and endorsed that on the letter—he then drew these two bills for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 22nd Feb. he came again, and stated that he wanted a larger sum of money, to pay for some diamonds which he had purchased—he mentioned in the first instance that he should want 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we advanced him that sum—that was on the faith of the letter of credit—on that same afternoon he made another application for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, which we also advanced—we paid him in Russian money, or rather we paid parties to whom he had given orders on us—I paid him myself a small sum in cash—I ultimately arranged the balance with him, on the footing of the advance of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I endorsed those advances, as I had done the others, on the letter of credit,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185307040052"></xptr>
               <p>and returned it to him—those advances did not exhaust the letter of credit as altered to 2,510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., therefore it was returned to him.</p>

               <p>Moses and Son, in Aldgate—I saw the prisoner there—I followed him to Bridge-street, and there I lost him; I afterwards took him into custody, in Bryanstone-street, Oxford-street—I asked him if his name was Mi.

As to the second question, it could not be contended that there was any intent to obtain money by the prisoner in this country, the transaction as far as he was concerned, was closed when he received the money; it must have been a matter of indifference to him what became of the bills, he could have no interest in their presentation; indeed it would have been more to his advantage that they should never be presented at all.

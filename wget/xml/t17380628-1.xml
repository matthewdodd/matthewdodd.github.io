The Watch not being set, we dogg'd him out of Bishopsgate-Street, into Widegate Alley, and imagin'd he was fuddl'd. At the Gingerbread Baker's he lighted his Pipe, and then went towards Smock Alley; we follow'd him, with each of us a Stick in our Hands, and intended to knock him down; but Austin ran up to him in Smock Alley, and snatch'd off his Hat, and gave it the Prisoner Fellows. I ran to the Tenter Grounds, in Moorefields, and there he (Fellows) came to me with the Hat, which I kept all Night in my own Custody, and next Morning I pawn'd it, next Door to the two Horns, near Shoreditch Church. The Prosecutor Nix appear'd that Morning against Austin, before the Justice, and being positive to him he was committed. Three or four Days after this, I was taken up for another Robbery,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173806280003"></xptr> and then I made my Information. We went out together with an Intent to rob who we could; for Austin and Moreland having been out together a whole Fortnight, Night and Day, they had spent and made away with all we had to live upon, so we resolved to go out upon the Highway to get what we could.

I went with him before Justice Dennet the next Day, and there he swore he saw him take off his Hat, and give it to another, who ran away with it.</p>

            . I live in Three Tun-Alley, and saw the Constable, the Watch, and the Prisoner Austin together, between 11 and 12 o'Clock at Night, the 23d of May. I went down with them to the Tower Jail, and there the Prosecutor said, he was not the Man that took his Hat off; but next Morning before the Justice, he swore he did take it. He said indeed (the Night before) that he was one that belonged to the other Fellows, and before we went to Justice Dennet with him, one of their Company came down, and propos'd making the Matter up, and the Prosecutor seem'd willing to do it.</p>

He lay in the Shop, where I weave rich Brocades, and have had great Quantities of Gold, Silver and Silk; I never knew that he wrong'd me while he liv'd with me. He quitted my Service the 13th of May, on account of some Words which he had with his Mistress; but what the Quarrel was, I can't tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine importer, and carry on business at 87, Great Tower-street, under the firm of I. Mather and Co.—the prisoner was formerly in my service as clerk—his salary at first was 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was about two and a half or three years in my service; he absconded in February, 1861—I had no notice that he was going to leave me—I heard nothing of him until he was taken into custody in this year—I had a customer of the name of Basil Wood and Co., of New Bond-street—I had not supplied was to that firm when the prisoner was with me, or had any business transac<lb></lb>tions with them—this is one of our invoices—it relates to goods supplied by me to Basil Wood and Co.—that invoice was sent to them—the prisoner had no authority from me, in March, 1862, to receive from Basil Wood and Co. the sum of 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or any amount on my account—this invoice is receipted, I.

               <p>think it was in January or December—the prisoner was not in the habit of accepting bills for the firm—he never accepted accommodation bills—I swear that he never accepted one bill for me—I appeared at the Thames police-court at the first examination, and was examined—it is not a fact that a warrent was applied for to take me there because I would not go—I swear that—I went there of my own free will—I had not to be coerced in any way to go—there are not several actions pending against me on account of transactions of the prisoner with the London Dock Company; there are aganist the prisoner—I don't know that there are any against the prisoner and myself jointly—nobody is trying to make me pay money in the other courts—I only allowed the prisoner a profit upon three transactions—I had settlements with him from time to time, at which the profits were struck off the transactions he had had—I do not know of any bill for 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was sent to Austria, which the prisoner accepted—there was no such bill—I know of no such bill which was payable at the prisoner's bankers which went to Austria, or anywhere, on account of wine—there is no sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to the prisoner upon commission or profit; not a farthing.</p>

Mather for goods supplied; it is dated 21st March, 1862—the prisoner called on me after that, on a Satur<lb></lb>day, the usual day for collecting debts; it was the next day to the date of the invoice, the 22d—he asked bow we got on with his Hungarian wines, or something like that; and, I believe, he mentioned that the parcel which was out of the ship <hi rend="italic">John Bull</hi> was disposed of, but that by the <hi rend="italic">Cosmopolitan</hi> remained—he asked if he could take some money—I believe his words were, "Can you give me some money?" and then he said, "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will do"—I said, "I can give you a cheque"—I got the invoice from the drawer, and gave it to him, and I gave him a cheque—he said, "Don't cross the cheque"</p>

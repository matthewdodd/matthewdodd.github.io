                  </hi>. I am a fancy goods dealer, of 166, Piccadilly—I have been a little over four years in the country—before that I lived at Paris, and had some business transactions with the prisoner there—he lives on big income—I know his writing—in February last I received this letter by post, at Piccadilly, in this envelope—it is signed by the prisoner—the signature only is his—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was translated by an interpreter as follows,</hi> "Great thief. Before killing thee I give thee fair warning. Boulevard, Montmartre, Saumade")—that is his address in Paris—on 30th April I received this other letter—the signature only is by the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Transmitted</hi>: "Paris, April 30, 1869. Great thief. If thou wilt not send me some money I will threaten thee")—that letter was brought to me by a gentle<lb></lb>man—I had not seen the prisoner between the two letters—about 30th September, it was four weeks last Wednesday, I was in my parlour, and he came into the shop—my wife would not let me go out—she went out and spoke to him (I had last seen him in England about a year and ten month ago)—a constable was sent for, and he was given in custody—I cannot say what day that was, but it was about two hours before I went to the Police Court—I only came out of the parlour when the constable was there, after my wife had given the prisoner in charge.</p>

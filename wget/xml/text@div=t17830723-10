             le Bone, at four o'clock, about three weeks ago, I was standing by the dead wall behind my box, I saw this gentleman the prisoner twisting Mr. Robinson's knocker off, I laid hold on him, and he pulled me some way, he had between five and six inches of it when I saw him; I measured it, and we had a scuffle, and the patrol came and said he would cut his head off; he had more knockers in his bosom, and he would not part with them, till King the beadle knocked him down.</p>
               <p>(Several knockers produced.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>All I have to say is, there was a person that I met that had this knocker, and he asked me to hold his bag, and will you please to ask the witness if he did not take that knocker off himself, and bring it to the watch-house, and the lower spindle both? - He had between five and six inches out, and I took the remainder out.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, he is indicted for stealing a knocker, he did not steal that knocker, although he was in all probability, attempting to steal it; in the present state, the knocker was affixed to the freehold, and therefore no felony could be committed; and as to the knob that was taken off, that is not mentioned in the indictment, therefore you must acquit the prisoner.</p>

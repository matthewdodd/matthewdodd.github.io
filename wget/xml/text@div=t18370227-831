                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a butcher in Clare-street, Drury-lane. The prisoner was in my employ in February, and had been so five or six months—he had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, board and lodging, and perqui<lb></lb>sites—I sent him with a joint of meat on the 4th of February to Mr. Sands for which he was to receive 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remember his returning; it was his duty to account to me or my mother—he said to my mother, "Sands has not paid"—my mother desired him to go to his supper, and she made an entry in the book—on the Saturday following I sent a joint of meat by another person to Mr. Sands, and a bill for the two joints, the lad came back without the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and told me it had been paid—the prisoner was then at supper—I asked him if Mr. Sands had paid—he said he could not give me an answer at present—I said, I thought it was rather strange, and I was determined to have an answer; he said the fact was, he knew a little of Mr. Sands' affairs, he could not give me an answer at present—I told him to go about his business, and he left me the next morning—on the Thursday between Satur<lb></lb>day the 4th and 11th, my mother sent him out with a bill of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was in the shop when he went, but not when he returned—I was summoned on the Tuesday week following for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wages—I did not consider I owed him it—he had received 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Thursday—I had him taken on this charge—on the Monday after he had left me, on the Sunday he came for his box—when I came from Smithfield on the Monday, the publican told me he had been there the day before threatening to summons me.</p>

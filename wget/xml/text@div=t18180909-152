On the 25th of June, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with a bundle of writing-paper, and asked me to buy it; I refused. A little boy came in and paid me some money, the prisoner watched to see where I put it, which made me suspect him. I turned my back to get a customer some herbs, the prisoner said he should wait till my wife came down. I went to the till and found the drawer out, he was off immediately; I went after him, there was 3l. in notes and 4l. of silver in it - I could not find him. Next day I got an officer, who took me to a skeale-ground, and told me to point him out, he saw me and staried off, and said, Nose, and Jackson is behind; he pulled some silver out of his pocket and gave it to another man. I called the officer, he came and took him.</p>

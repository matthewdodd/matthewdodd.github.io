            . I live in Gardiner's-lane, York-street, Westminster. On the 19th of January I was at the Blue Anchor, public-house, York-street, the prisoner came in with two others, and sat down by me - they tried several times to pick my pocket. My wife came in and asked me if I was going home; they would not let me out. I went round the table, and went out - they followed me.

The other two, which were Frost and Armfield, were convicted last Sessions. I am certain the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I noticed them particularly.</p>
               <p>RODERIC M'DONALD. My father keeps the public-house. I saw the prisoner there with two others, they set by Burt, and followed him out; Burt returned in about five minutess, and said he was robbed. When they were in the house the prisoner came to me and asked if Burt was a pensioner - it was the last day for paying the Chelsea pensioners.</p>

            . I went to fetch my husband, Armfield was sitting with him - my husband had been drinking a little, but knew what he was about. Armfield went out of the door with him, I followed them, and Frost and the prisoner followed me immediately - they all stopped and robbed my husband under the gateway - they laid hold of his arms, unbuttoned his coat, took his watch, and then ran away. We returned to the public-house and gave information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was under a dark gateway. My husband was sensible.</p>

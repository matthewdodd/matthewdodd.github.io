No; Mrs. Davis lives in the lower room, she has a door to herself, and that door does not go up stairs; it is a back door that leads up stairs, and comes into a stone passage that leads into the court; Mrs. Davis came round to me when I called her; I had stopped the prisoner then; she told me to let her pass, as she had nothing but what belonged to her.</p>

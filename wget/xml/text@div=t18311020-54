            . I found the bales were not so sound as some others, it being damaged coffee, and the coffee might have got out - the prisoner said he had delivered them in the same state as he received them; I weighed them in his presence, and found a deficiency of 83lbs.</p>
               <p>JOHN COLES re-examined. Q.What time should the prisoner have returned to you? A. I should have thought two hours would have been sufficient for him, but he was gone from eleven o'clock till three; after he was in custody he admitted to me that there were two men who had robbed the bales, and made him drunk - he told me their names, and I know one of them has lived by pilfering carts for some time; he said they had robbed all the bales, more or less; I had not made him any promise or threat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you offer me a sovereign if I would tell you who the two men were? A. No - I did not.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.Did he tell you he had suffered any loss, when he came home? A. No, I did not know it till the next morning, when I went to Mr. Swannell's, to know if there were any more orders.</p>

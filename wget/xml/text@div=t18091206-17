               <p>Q. On the 8th of November you had the care of a box, had not you - A. Yes, I had, it belonged to a society of taylors that used the house.</p>
               <p>Q. It contained the contributions of the society - I believe so, I know nothing of the contents of the box at all, it was left in my care.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the keys of it - A. The stewards: there were three locks and keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the stewards - A. Douglas was one, the name of the other I do not know. I had the charge of the box during the time of their sitting, it was in the club room, and sometimes I took it in my sleeping-room. On the 8th of November it was in the club room.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the club room was not locked, was it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you see the box last - A. About one at night. They were obliged to make their monthly payments. The stewards did not leave the room till one at night.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it after the club had left your house, did you - A. I did, they called me up in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the box - A. The same morning about seven o'clock, my wife missed the box and the servant; she apprized me of it; I came down stairs and found the box missing, and the prisoner at the bar also.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you - A. About ten or eleven days.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what time she left your house - A. I cannot say, she went into the room about one o'clock; I saw her after the club was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the box and the girl again - A. On Friday last about nine o'clock in the evening, there was a person, that knew that she committed this robbery, saw her in Rose street, Long-acre, at a door way, sitting there; he came and informed me, I went to Rose-street and saw her, she was sitting in a door way much intoxicated. I said, is this you Ann; she said, yes master. I gave her in charge to a watchman, and took her to the watchhouse; when she was in the watchhouse, she told me that the box was at a shoe-blacks place, in a court in Shire-lane; I went there, and one of the officers of Bow-street went with me, and found the box according to her direction; the box was forced open, there were the books in number, but the cash was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no such thing in it, as he said; I took this box, I do not deny; he told me if I would tell where the box was, he would forgive me. The cash in it was of little consequence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said the loss of the books to the society was the most consequence; I did not say I would forgive her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lock it afterwards - A. Yes, I kept one key, the other steward the other, and the landlord kept the third.</p>

               <p>Q. When you spoke of one o'clock in the morning you mean the Wednesday morning. - A. I do. They met on the 7th.</p>
               <p>THOMAS. On the Wednesday morning between six and seven o'clock I met her, she came towards me in Russell-Court, Covent Garden; she passed me, I went from there to the shop, and there they told me that Mr. Doyle's servant had taken the club box away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing when you saw her. - Yes, this very box.</p>

I searched the prisoner; I found they had not searched her, and in her bonnet, I found this parchment, a certificate of her marriage; I found a two pound note and a guinea in it, she did not like me to take her bonnet off, and when I came to her bosom she was rather refractory again. I found a rag in her bosom, in that rag was a seven shilling piece, seven or eight shillings in silver, and in her right hand I found some half-pence, and three shillings in silver. The silver and gold I gave up by order of the magistrate. The note I have kept; this is the note.</p>

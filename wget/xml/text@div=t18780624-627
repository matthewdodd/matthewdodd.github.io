                  </hi>. I reside at 15, Montagu Street, Portman Square, and am a farmer at Upper Burleigh, Chester—from December, 1876, till March, 1878 the prisoner was in my employ as butler and general servant—he used to sell hay for me, and receive the money—on 12th March he said that Mr. Leaver wanted half a load, and I instructed him to deliver it—I had them in my employ a carman named Godfrey—the prisoner left me towards the end of March, and delivered me up this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was kept in his writing, which I identify—there is an entry here of half a load of hay delivered to Mr. Leaver which he told me was then owing for—the amount is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I applied to Mr. Leaver for that sum, but have not received it—I have not received the hay back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I believe the hay was sent on the evening of 12th March—the hay was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load, but I believe you told me it was damaged by wet, and consequently 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was left to you—I don't remember anything happening on the 14th—all I can swear to is that the hay went to Leaver on the 13th, and then when you left my service you told me that the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down in your book was still owing—I find here in Nicholls's account a quarter of a load delivered on 15th March—I do not see a similar entry in Mrs. Harris's account.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a job master, of 15, Berkeley Mews, Connaught Square—about 13th March I ordered half a load of hay of Mr. Harris by the prisoner, and it was brought on the 13th by the carter when I was</p>

               <p>there—I said "Well, it has been fine for three days, and now it is raining you may take it back"—I refused to take it, and it was not delivered to me then or subsequently—the prisoner has not presented me with an account in respect of the hay—Mr. Harris made a communication to me, and I denied owing for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I turned the hay away because it was wet—you were up that morning—I don't know whether you were with the carman—I don't recollect your coming the Monday or Tuesday after, and saying "What do you think of the hay?"—that might have been before—I have bought lots of hay of you—I said they would have more room for the hay round at Cox's, and Mr. Cox took it in—the carter came round and told me—that was <hi rend="italic">a</hi> load of hay, I don't know which.</p>

I am a carman in Mr. Harris's employ—I re<lb></lb>member going to Mr. Leaver's with the prisoner on 13th March with half a load of hay—it was a wet morning, and he didn't care about taking it in and the prisoner bade me bring the hay round to the Mews, Mr. Harris's mother's, where I saw the coachman, and he put it in the empty horse<lb></lb>stall, and said "If my horse gets loose and pulls a truss of hay I shan't be answerable for it"—I went off, and know no more of the hay.</p>

Half a load may be 18 trusses—you brought some hay there three or four times and I told you the same thing over again—I don't know whether you took that away in a greengrocer's cart—I do not remember a quarter of a load being delivered to me on the 15th—27 trusses would fill the stable up.</p>

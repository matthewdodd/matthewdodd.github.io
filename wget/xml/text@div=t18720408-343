                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi>). On 18th March, about 1 o'clock a.m., I was on duty at Colney Hatch—I saw a fire in an unfinished building belonging to Mr. Hingston, in Brett's Stile Lane, Edmonton—the joists and the boards and flooring were on fire—I saw the prisoner standing against a carpenter's bench close to the fire, right in the centre of the room, looking</p>

               <p>on—he caught sight of me, and made a dart to the left, across a field—I ran after him, and fell into a gravel hole—I called "Police!" and Childs came to my assistance—we both returned to the building, and put out the fire—on Tuesday, 19th, I received information of where the prisoner was, and on the 20th I took him in custody at his home at Springfield Park, Wood Green—I told him the charge—he said "I knew it was you, and I know very well it was me, and it is no good for me to deny it; it was through drink that I did it"—there had been shavings in some part of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Brett's Stile Lane, Colney Hatch—on 18th March, Child called me to the fire at a few minutes to 1 o'clock—I assisted in putting the fire out; but did not see the prisoner—the boards were very much soaked by the weather, which enabled it to be put out sooner, as the fire did not get a hold.</p>

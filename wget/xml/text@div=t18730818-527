                  </hi>. I live at 6, Arlington Square, and am a solicitor's clerk—I for many years knew a gentleman named Cooper, a solicitor—I have some knowledge of the prisoner; he used to call at the office occasionally, and do work for Mr. Cooper—Mr. Cooper died at my residence on 24th June, 1871—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 2nd July, 1873—it is in the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Cooper's mother's name was Susanna Lally—she married a second time—I was most intimate with her before her death—I do not think I was at her house the night before she died—she lay ill for some days—she did not leave Mr. Cooper 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think her estate was sworn under 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was oversworn—the whole of her property did not go to Mr. Cooper—there were certain legacies appearing by the will—I was not the residuary legatee—the residue of her will went to Mr. Cooper, who then made his will—I swear that I did not get 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Mr. Cooper, I had not a shilling, and when the estate is realised it will not pay the legacies—as far as I can recollect there was a legacy to my mother<lb></lb>in-law, I think of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to my son, I think of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to my wife 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; independent of her present or any future husband; to his two maiden aunts, the Misses Cooksley, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a legacy to his old managing clerk, who was with him for 23 years—I had been with him for 26 years—the will is registered at Doctors' Commons, and I have the Probate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness continued.</hi> Mrs. Lally at the time of her death was not possessed of a great many valuable paintings—she had two or three—I think she had two that were considered of value—I forget how many there were valued by the valuer—what furniture was not sold Mr. Cooper brought round to my house—she may have been buried on the 23rd March, 1871—she died in March, 1871—immediately after her death Mr. Cooper came and-lived with me—he had lived with me for many years previously to that—he died on the 24th June, 1871, and was buried a few days afterwards—he died, I believe, on a Saturday, and, I think, was buried the Wednesday or Thursday following—I did not write to the maiden aunts, inviting them to the funeral; they were old ladies—I am almost certain that I sent them a telegram on the Sunday after he died: "Melancholy news of poor Samuel. Prepare for the worst. I will write you further to-morrow. "They were old ladies, therefore I did not say your nephew is dead, and they received a letter on the 26th—I have no doubt the telegram produced is the first I sent them after he was dead, and here is a letter from them acknowledging mine—I proved the will on 3rd July—that was about as soon as I could have proved it—I produce a rough draft of the will made by Mr. Cooper—the whole of it is in his writing, with the exception of a few alterations<lb></lb>he was very negligent in his way of doing these things—the prisoner was never clerk to Mr. Cooper or to me—he used to call there for processes for service, and he was dismissed by Mr. Cooper for various transactions—some</p>

               <p>three or four years before Mr. Cooper's death he forbad the prisoner to come near the office, and he applied to me for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as due from Mr. Cooper to him—Mrs. Armstrong is my mother-in-law—on proving the will leave was reserved to ray co-executor and he renounced—he received no money from me—the attesting witnesses were Charles Leech and Jane Bellamy, servants of mine, one still resides with me and the other is in a situation somewhere by Kingsland—I think Leech was about 16 or 17 years of age—Mr. Cooper died very suddenly, in a fit—the medical man who was there when I returned was Dr. Johnson, of 8, Arlington Square, next door to me—no inquest was held—I did not enter his death in a newspaper—I believe about two hours and a half elapsed between the seizure and the death—they sent for several medical men, but the gentle<lb></lb>man next door arrived, and the others were stopped—(<hi rend="italic">The register of death was here read</hi>)—I was absent when the medical man was there—I went down to see the aunts not very long after the funeral; I no doubt told them what was left them—I cannot tell whether I advanced one of them 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—I had to administer to Mrs. Lally's will as well as being executor to Mr. Cooper; I may have done so—I remember Mr. Henry Thomas Colea, I recollect that he died; he was no relation of mine—I was not benefited under his will; I was joint executor with another for the purpose of carrying on certain Chancery suits for him—my wife and my son did not receive considerable legacies under the will—I think he left them 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, but the estate was insolvent and there was not sufficient to pay the liabilities—the costs were deducted—I know that the prisoner wrote some scandalous letters to the aunts; they informed me of it—the first, as far as I can recollect, was October the 14th—these letters pro<lb></lb>duced appear to be in my writing; (<hi rend="italic">Dated 2nd and 3rd July, October</hi> 30, 2<hi rend="italic">nd December, and 3rd December t</hi> 1871). Mr. Cooper's insolvency was before I knew him—I have no idea what he paid in the pound—I never resided with a Madame de Vine, in Newman Street, Oxford Street—there was never such an insinuation as my being indicted for keeping an im<lb></lb>proper house—I never went by any other ñame than Levien—I daresay my brothers, when I have been a boy, have called me "Joe"—I am not at all surprised to hear that the prisoner applied to the Home Office in this matter after his threat to me, when he came and demanded 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he may also have applied to the Coroner; he may also have applied to the Attorney<lb></lb>General; nothing surprises me—my co-executor was one of Mr. Cooper's clerks, to whom he left 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was Mr. Cooper's managing clerk—I had not done any business with Mr. Cooper for many years—I had no office with him in Lincoln's Inn Fields—he lived in my house eight or ten years formerly, then he lived with his mother, and after his mother's death he returned—I think for twenty-six years he was not three days absent from my house—my co-executor was prevented from acting with me partly by his suffering from gout—he renounced the executorship; he never called at my house in his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Cooper was on terms of great friendship with me, and he expressed great gratitude to my wife and myself for attending him in a serious illness he had—he had seen very little of the two old ladies; he left them 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—about a month or six weeks after Mr. Cooper's death the prisoner waited in the street for me to leave my house, and came up and said "So, Mr. Levien, Mr. Cooper is dead"—I said "Yes," and passed on—he said "I suppose you know he owes me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Mr. Williamson,</p>

               <p>don't address me in the street"—I passed on; he followed me up, and said "I expect you will pay"—I passed on, he followed me to the corner of the terrace, and called out "I will stick to you; "I went into the road—I was once going into one of the Courts in Westminster Hall, and there was a man near, evidently a stranger to him; he went up to the man, pulled him by the sleeve, and pointed, evidently calling the man's attention to me; he was pointing and saying something to the man—I met him on another occasion in Leicester Square; he followed at my heels, and said "I will put Wate on to you, you will give him back his license"—a short time after that I received a letter from the prisoner's attorney, in which he said that he had been instructed by Mr. Wate to claim a license for horse breaking, which had been deposited with Mr. Cooper by a Mr. Bunting, in 1864"—I searched everywhere, and could find no such thing—he issued a writ; I entered an appearance, and searched at the Patent Office, and found that in 1864 a provisional protection for such a thing had been granted, for which 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid, but beyond that no such license had ever been granted, either here or in any other country; I entered an appearance and the proceedings dropped—from the end of 1871 down to the time I caused the prisoner to be arrested I had had information from the Misses Cooksley that he had been writing to them—I treated the prisoner with contempt until I found I was compelled to prosecute him—my co-executor under the will had some claims against the estate; he renounced, and it was settled by Mr. Cooper—I have paid the old ladies their legacies, with the exception of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, which they have consented to take at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter, as the rents come in, rather than sell the property, and then they might not realise.</p>

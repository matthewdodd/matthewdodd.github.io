We searched what we understood to be his bed-room, and found this parallel vice, and in a box this piece of ivory, two sets of letters and figures, and a pawnbroker's ticket for an opera-glass, which we got out - this is all my property - the prisoner had access to it all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Where did he lodge? A. In the house of another workman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from his information that you went there? A. Yes; the prisoner was a labourer - the landlord was a superior workman to him; the box in which the vice was, was open, the other was locked - these letters are made by a workman of our's out of doors. I cannot swear to any of this property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you missed these articles before they were discovered? A. No; there was one letter left behind in the place where these were taken from, and that was missing from these letters when they were found. I am able to say, that two sets of letters had been taken from the place where the letter was found - they were in a case of property which we have in trust. I had taken an account of it perhaps twelve months before; it had been regularly entered in our books by the clerk.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ, and am landlord of the house where the prisoner lives. I was at home when the officer searched. I had received information on the Sunday evening, that the prisoner had some articles in his box, and I told the prosecutor. I saw this property found, (which to the best of my belief is my master's) in his bed-room; I found this key in the cabinet, which fits the vice which was in the prisoner's cupboard. <rs id="t18251208-63-verdict311" type="verdictDescription">

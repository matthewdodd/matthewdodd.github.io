                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Manners, and live at 195, St. Leonard's Road—the prisoner and deceased lodged there as man and wife—on 27th December, about 8 in the morning, I saw the prisoner after he had spoken to my little girl—he said "Go up stairs to Harriet"—I asked what for—he said "Harriet is bad"—I went up with him, and found the deceased lying in the middle of the bed, partly dressed and unconscious—her mouth was cut, and her eyes black and shut—I saw a cut, on the right eye, I think, and blood was flowing from it—I lifted up her chin, and called her "Harriet! Harriet!" but she made me no answer—she only moved her hand and her mouth—the prisoner said should ho go and fetch three-pennyworth of brandy—I said "Yes," and he went and fetched it—she took it—I fed her with it with a spoon; she swallowed it, but it had no effect upon her—she never spoke at all—I said to the prisoner "Who-ever done this?"—he said he did not know—he then left, and said he was going to his employer at the Isle of Dogs—between 11 and 12 o'clock I sent for a doctor—I stayed with the deceased until the prisoner returned, between 1 and 2 in the afternoon—she seemed just in the same condition, quite unconscious—she moved her hands and mouth, but never spoke—I was not with her when she died—I had seen her last before this on Boxing night (Tuesday), between 8 and 9—I saw her and the prisoner both at the Elder Tree public-house, Poplar—she went out and went home, and the prisoner stopped with me and my husband, and we went to the St. Leonard's Arms—we did not go home till about 11 o'clock, but the prisoner left us about 10, and went home with a pot of half-and-half in a can—that was the last I saw of him that night—when I went into his room the next morning I saw the can on the table—it was the publican's can—Mrs. Hogan took it up when the potman called for it, and I saw blood on it, as if it had been taken hold of with a hand stained with blood—that was about 9 or 10 o'clock—the prisoner had left before that—Mrs. Hogan wiped off the blood—it was about the middle of the can—I let lodgings at this time—besides the prisoner and deceased Mr. and Mrs. Hogan were lodging with me, and two or three men lodgers—the prisoner has lodged with me three or four years—the deceased had been with him about nine mouths, and they occu<lb></lb>pied that one room—she used to call him <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—all the lodgers have keys of the outer door—the prisoner's room was the back room, first floor—I slept in the front parlour, not the room under the prisoner—my little girl slept in that room, and a little boy two years old—the two men lodgers slept up stairs in the first floor front, with my sons—I went to bed that night about 11.30—I believe the prisoner and deceased were in their room then—my little girl let them in—they lived and slept in the one room—the two men lodgers were not at home that night, nor my son, they had gone to the play, and did not come home till late—their room and the prisoner's adjoin—only a wainscot separates them—I am certain the two men did come home and sleep there that, night; they came down and had their breakfast the next morning, and I saw that their bed had been slept in—when I lifted up the deceased then I saw a ring round her neck, I mean a crease, a mark like something round her neck—I can't say how that had been caused, it looked as if she had been pulled up by</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edmund Hogan, and lodge with the last witness—the prisoner and deceased occupied a room on the same floor as ours—there are three rooms on a floor—on Tuesday night, 26th Decem<lb></lb>ber, boxing-night, I heard the prisoner come home, about 10 o'clock, or it might be a few minutes after—the deceased was not with him—I had not hoard her come up—the prisoner came up stairs, and went into his own room—I heard him open the door, go in and shut it; I did not hear it locked—about four or five minutes afterwards I heard him open the door again, and come out on the landing to fetch a pail, which they kept there—I heard him move it, and I heard the deceased say "Oh, Jack, don't!"—I had heard no noise or anything before that—he went back into the room, and shut the door again—a few minutes afterwards I heard a great noise in the room, as if someone was dancing and jumping about, and it shook my room—I did not hoar anyone speak—my husband came in soon after 10 o'clock, and he began to sing; he had been out, being boxing day, and I remarked to him "<hi rend="italic">Ned</hi>, you are singing, and Harriet and Jack are dancing"—I thought they were dancing—it was quiet then for about ten minutes, and my husband and I went to bed, and when I was going to lie down I heard the noise again, as if someone was dancing, and it shook my floor, and as if someone fell up against the partition that parted their room and mine—I suppose that was about 10.30 or 10.40—I heard no<lb></lb>thing more that night—next morning Mrs. Manners called me into the prisoner's room, and I saw the deceased lying in the middle of the bed, with the clothes covered up over her—she had on her stays, an apron, petticoat and shift—the stays were laced up—her mouth was split right open down to the chin—her eyes were both black and closed, and there was a great cut on the eyebrow—I believe it was over the right eye—I spoke to her two or three times, but got no answer—there was a red mark all round her neck, as if something bad been tied tight round the neck—there was a black and blue mark round her neck—it could not have been caused by any part of her clothing, or the bed clothes—her face was very much bruised all over—I saw two great places of blood on the floor, and splashes of blood on the table—there was no cloth on the table—I saw two or three splashes of blood on the fire-place—there were no fire-irons—the blood on the floor was dry—it looked as if it had been wiped over with something—I know that they had a pail, which they used to keep on the landing, and I saw that pail in the room in the morning—I had not noticed the pail on the lauding the previous evening—it was a wooden pail, with an iron handle, and I believe three iron hoops round it—on the table I saw a public-house can—it was half full, or perhaps more, of beer—it would hold a quart, not more, I think—it looked like beer—I did not taste it—when the potman came for the can I flung the beer away, and saw a great mark, as if somebody had laid hold of it with a bloody hand—there were three or four finger-marks—the can was not painted or japanned, it was a clean tin can—I saw a broken chair in the room, with spots of blood on it, that was under the bedstead, pushed up against the wall—the back was broken right off, and the bottom was all broken up; it had no covering to it; it was a cane-bottomed chair—the deceased and I wore on friendly terms—we had been out together on the boxing-morning, and had two pints of ale—I was very often in her room—I was in there about 3.30 on boxing-day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201290024"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not notice the broken chair then—it might have been there—they had three chairs, including that—I did not see the prisoner in the room on the morning of the 25th—I saw him about 8 o'clock, as he was coming back, with three-pennyworth of brandy, that was before I went into the room—as I was going out on an errand I noticed his appearance—I noticed blood on his right hand, round his nails, and under his nails—I looked at his hand, and he put it in his right hand trouser's pocket—he was in the habit of wearing Blucher boots, similar to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the prisoner again about 1.30 in the day, when he came back from the Isle of Dogs, and I said to him "Oh, Jack, how did this happen?"—he said "I don't know, Mrs. Hogan, I was <hi rend="italic">tight</hi> last night, I was very drunk"—we used to call him Jack—there were two men lodging in the house, but they were not home when this happened—I can hear when they come in—I did not hear them at all that night—I saw them come down stairs next morning—I saw that their bed had been slept in.</p>

I arrested the prisoner at 195, St. Leonard's Street—I told him what it was for—he said "I will go with you," nothing further—at that time the room door was locked by the Coroner's officer—about 8 o'clock on Thursday the 28th, I went to the room with the divisional surgeon, Mr. Brownfield, and there found the body of the deceased—she had three heavy cuts on her face, one on the right eye, blood was then oozing out of it, one on the right side of the head above the eye, and one on the right side of the face near the chin—she also had a large black mark, a bruise, on the right arm—the room was very much upset—the little furniture that was in it was in a disordered state—there were two broken plates or dishes near the bed, with marks of blood on them, which appeared fresh at that time—I produce some plates that I found underneath the bed—I have not got the broken ones here—I pointed them out to Mrs. Hogan—un<lb></lb>derneath the bed I found part of a broken chair—it did not appear to have been broken recently—I examined that carefully—there was a large spot of blood near the fire-place, about a yard from the bed—there were spots of blood on the leaf of the table, as if the blood had spurted from the ground upwards—the leaf was down—the blood on the floor appeared as if it had been wiped over with some cloth—I did not find anything that had been used for that purpose, no towel or cloth—there was no wash-hand basin in the room—I then went to the station and charged the prisoner with causing the death of the deceased—I examined his clothes—I found blood stains on the left leg of his trowsers, they appeared fresh then, and as if they had been wiped—these are the trowsers, they are corduroy—I pointed them out to the prisoner, and said "What is this?"—he said "it is beer"—there are also marks of blood where it is</p>

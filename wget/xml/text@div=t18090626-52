               <p>Q. On the 24th of June did you lose a watch, chain, and seal, and money, and bank notes - A. Yes, something about two in the morning; I suppose it might be half after two; I lost the watch, chain, seal, half a crown, five shillings, three six-pences, and seven one pound notes. I lost it out a room of a house in <placeName id="t18090626-52-crimeloc305">Dyot-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. When had you this property safe about you - A. I know it was safe about me at the moment of my partly undressing myself, and going into bed in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. That is a point that no man says he is drunk, you know; I believe I was sober, from my recollection of every circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you begin to spend your evening, and where was it - A. I spent my evening with a friend, at the Coach and Horses, opposite of Southampton-street, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet this friend of yours - A. Oh, it could not be more than eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been on the former part of the day, before you came to the Coach and Horses - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were you employed by to work at that time - A. By the London water work company; I had been there merely iniating a young gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out that evening - A. I believe about the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from between the middle of the day, and eleven o'clock at night - A. I had been over the water on different business till nine o'clock, it was near ten I think; then I went to Mr. Hobson's in Bloomsbury-place; I drank beer there, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. At eleven o'clock you went to the Coach and Horses - who was this friend of yours - A. Mr. Walker, the printer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here - A. I rather think he is gone out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been drinking from eleven till two - A. Beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in Marchmont-place - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Dyot-street was not in your way home - A. No. Persons often wals this way or that way, without any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260045"></xptr>specific reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not drunk - A. I do not feel that I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you were you not drunk - A. I do not think that I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get to Dyot-street, and when did you get there - A. I got to Dyot-street partly by being accosted by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was two o'clock when you arrived at this house in Dyot-street - what time did you leave this public house - A. I judge from the period of time that had elapsed, from my leaving that house; I judged the prisoner being with me could not be more than an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you look at your watch - A. I did not upon that occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner - A. In Holborn, I do not recollect the spot; she accosted me, the tenor of which was to go home; I refused. Her manners were civilised; in her appearance she was different from that sort of persons about the street; she continued to solicit in a manner that excited my curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect you are upon your oath - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did your curiosity lead you up into a garret in Dyot-street - A. Yes, I went up into a terrible place.</p>
               <p>Q. So then if this was a terrible place, you were determined to undress yourself - A. Yes; in part it was my curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that you undressed yourself in part from a motive of curiosity - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. No mortal being can believe that which you have sworn to - that a man goes into a terrible place with a common prostitute, and proceeds to undress himself out of curiosity, that you have sworn, and therefore you are totally unworthy of belief - did you get into bed, sir - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that out of curiosity - A. That was part of the thing that was in my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Wicked enough! And you went into bed with a common prostitute, out of curiosity - A. Not with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you undressed yourself, got into bed in a most terrible place, along with a common prostitute - did you go to bed out of curiosity - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say you had about you when you went into this room - A. I had my watch, and its appurtenances.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it gold or silver - A. Gold; a gold chain, seal, and key; seven one pound notes, and eight or nine shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in this room - A. It must be a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman undressed - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. You undressed and got into bed there - A. There was more than one bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other respectable lodger of that house in the bed - A. I saw no other person there.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, you got into bed, where did you put the watch - A. I put the chain into the fob pocket; the woman took my breeches and put it under my head; that is to say where I was to lay my head. I never solicited for her to come to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go to bed there for - A, Curiosity,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to sleep - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman stay with you - A. She staid a very short period.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when she left you - A. The act of plunder took place; then previous to her leaving the room, she made a small stir, passed towards the door, and went out; the instant she was gone, I started up, and put my left hand under my head for my clothes, they were gone. I immediately passed into the street with my drawers and under stockings on; I saw one of the patrols. I told him I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you sober enough to know that was the woman that was with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the room - A. There was a glimmer, a poor kind of light from a candle, during part of the time; the candle was withdrawn when she left the room.</p>

               <p>Q. How long afterwards was the woman laid hold of - A. Almost instantaneously.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch found - A. It was found; I have seen it since. I went back and found my clothes scattered about the room.</p>

            . I am patrol in the parish of Bloomsbury. I know the prisoner, she lives in Phoenix-yard, Dyot-street. About three in the morning I saw the prosecutor in the street, in his night-cap.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How came you with a night-cap, did you take the night-cap in your pocket - A. I found it in the place, it was furnished by the establishment.</p>
               <p>Brewer. I found him in the street, in his night cap and drawers; he appeared to me has if he had been drinking. There was another patrol standing at the gate when he came out; he asked him if had seen a woman come by, he had been robbed of his breeches. I apprehended the woman immediately; she was within sight of him all the time. When I laid hold of her, I found the gold watch, seal, key, and chain, in her right hand; and nine shillings in her other hand. I took her to the other patrol; he found five one pound notes, and I afterwards found this old purse, and two one pound notes. The prisoner said she picked this gentleman up, that he said he was short of money, he could not afford to give her any more than a shilling; he was to pay for the use of the bed; he gave her the property for fear of being robbed; and when he got up in the morning, she was to give it him. She was going to get some gin.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I met this gentleman at the corner of Plumb-tree-street, Bloomsbury, he told me if I would take him to any place, he would pay my lodging; we went to No. 14, Dyot-street, they had no beds; from there we went to Church-lane, they were shut up; we went to Phoenix-yard, there we got a bed; he began to pull off his things; I said, you had better not pull off your clothes, he said he had some property about him, he would trust me with it; he gave me seven one pound notes, and the watch; he went to sleep, and when he awoke he was thirsty; he asked me to get something to drink, I told him I thought there were no houses open; I went to Church-lane to see if the house was open; the gentleman ran down and said I had robbed him; the patrol asked me what I had robbed him off, I said nothing but what the gentleman had given me; I gave them up immediately.</p>

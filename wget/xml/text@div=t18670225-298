                  </hi>. I live at Torquay, and am the brother of Miss Albinia Martina Dendy—my father died in April, 1846—after that time my sister Albinia continued to live with my mother till about the year 1850—about that time she went to live at the defendant's, at Rose Cottage, Feltham—my mother died in September, 1858; she had been living at a house called the Hollys, at Feltham—I had a sister named Ann Alicia Julia—shortly after my mother's death, in September, 1858, she went to live at Rose Cottage, and she moved the furniture that had belonged to my mother, or the greater portion of it, to Rose Cottage, and that was her permanent residence up to the time of her death, on 19th February, 1866—up to that time, and up to January in the present year, my sister Albinia had continued to live at Rose Cottage—when she first went to live at the defendant's his wife was alive; she died in March, 1865—the defendant had been a footman in my father's service, and some time after my father's death he acted as coachman to my mother—his wife was also a servant in my father's family; she was housekeeper and nurse—up to February, 1866, when my sister Ann Alicia died, I did not interfere in any way with the arrangements under which the defendant had charge of my sister; after her death I saw him with regard to my sister Albinia the alleged lunatic—I first saw him on the same night that I received the intelligence of the death of my other sister, but I had no conversation with him on the subject of any pecuniary arrangement; it was on 5th April, 1866, that I first spoke to him about the arrangement with regard to my sister; I saw him at his cottage, I paid him the arrears that were then due to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250049"></xptr>
               <p>him for the maintenance of my sister Albinia, which sums had been paid at the rate of 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum (namely, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum under my mother's will, and 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum), and, in consequence of his representing to me that since the death of his wife he could not afford to keep her with so small a payment, and that he wished to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year paid to him, I under<lb></lb>took to pay him that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and it was paid up to the removal of my sister on 7th January last—nothing was said specially about its in<lb></lb>cluding medical attendance, although I believe the 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had included it—since my sister's removal I have had a charge of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. sent in for medical attendance—I always considered my sister Albinia to be imbecile as far back as I can remember; she never could converse or utter a sentence, and she has since been certified to be of unsound mind—she was decidedly not able to manage her own affairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you are a member of the legal pro<lb></lb>fession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have practised as a conveyancer—I am a barrister—my sister Albinia is one year younger than myself—the defendant and his wife were not in my father's service as far back as I can remember—his wife came at a period within my recollection; I can't exactly say when—she was nurse to my sister Ann Alicia from her infancy—Alicia was three years younger than Albinia, she was forty-two when she died—the defendant was for a short time in business for himself, and at a later period he came back to the family, and remained till my father's death—after his death my mother went to live first at Southend and then at Feltham—I believe my mother and my two sisters lived for two or three months at Rose Cottage before they could find a place suitable for them—I never saw them there, but I have no doubt about it; that was in 1855—the Hollys was about 300 yards from Rose Cottage—after my mother's death my sister Alicia went to reside at Rose Cottage with her sister, and remained there till she died, by reason of an accident last year—my mother's will contained this request:—"I declare it to be my wish that Albinia should remain with the said Mary Ann Harris as long as the said Mary Ann Harris shall live"—a niece of the defendant, named Emma Harris, lived with him, and acted as assistant or servant, and attended on my sister until her removal—I have not given any information at all to the Lunacy Commissioners about my sister being under the care of the de<lb></lb>fendant—I engaged Dr. Tuke to go and visit my sister, with a view to her removal—that was on the 23rd December, 1866—I did not take any other medical man to see her previous to that—I saw Mr. Kingsford, who was in attendance upon her—my mother's will had been proved at the time I went to see my sister Alicia, on receiving the telegram about the accident—after Alicia's death a will of hers was handed to me by Mr. Harris, of 1857—by that will I inherited the freehold property—in April, 1866, another will, dated 1859, was alleged to have been discovered, and it was handed not to me, but to another person—it was before the discovery of that will that I agreed to allow the defendant the additional sum to make up 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—if the will of 1859 is established I shall be in a very different position, but it is in dispute—that will has been pro<lb></lb>pounded, the cause tried in the Probate Court, and a verdict given against me—I have applied for a new trial, and the motion is now pending—it was the day after the verdict was pronounced against me in the Probate Court that I took Dr. Tuke down to visit my sister Albinia at Feltham—the verdict was on Saturday, and on Sunday I took Dr. Tuke down—the defendant was examined as a witness on the trial—I have</p>

               <p>not noticed any violence of any kind in my sister Albinia—she would get into little passions occasionally; that is all—she is perfectly quiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MAULE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has your sister Albinia ever been made a ward in Chancery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe she has, as regards some small sum that was left her—she has no committee—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year that the defendant had, was a charge on the real estate by my mother's will for Albinia's benefit, an annuity—I believe the 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was so much in addition, which my sister Alicia used to pay during her lifetime towards her sister's main<lb></lb>tenance—that was no doubt under some agreement—it came out of Alicia's pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did your father live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Montague Street, Russell Square—he died there—I married very shortly after my father's death and went to reside in the neighbourhood of Highgate—I went to Torquay about the year 1861 or 1862—as long as I can recollect my sister Albinia was imbecile—after my father's death I saw very little of her—during my father's life she was never allowed to go out without attendance, I mean without somebody accompanying her—she was inca<lb></lb>pable of taking care of herself when out in the street—one of the ser<lb></lb>vants used generally to go with her—she very seldom went out at all when she was in London—there are two wills of my sister Alicia in ex<lb></lb>istence—I had one handed to me, and that I proved, that was the will of 1857, at least I took out administration—the other will which is now questioned, is dated 19th November, 1859—my sister Albinia was not allowed to do as she pleased; she always remained in the nursery—she did not live down stairs—she was always treated as a child, even after she became of age—she could not cut her own meat, for instance—she had not the slightest idea of the value of money; she did not know a shilling from a halfpenny—those circumstances must have been known to the defendant—I am speaking now of circumstances when my sister was living in London—I may mention that when she was living with Mr. and Mrs. Harris she lived in the kitchen with them, and my other sister had her own room—I know that of my own knowledge—she did not live in the same room with Alicia and associate with her; she only occasionally came in, to wish her good night and that sort of thing—she could neither read nor write—the defendant was aware of that, it was a matter so obvious from her general habits and manner.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a member of the Royal College of Physicians, and reside at the Manor House, Chiswick; I have also a house at 37, Albemarle Street, Piccadilly—I practise at both places—my practice is almost entirely confined to nervous affections—I saw Miss Albinia Dendy on 23rd December last year, on 30th December, and on 7th January this year, and I have attended her regularly since—the 23rd December was my first visit—I wish to state that my present attend<lb></lb>ance is under the Act of Lunacy, which compels a medical visit once a fortnight—upon my first visit I was not perfectly satisfied as to the state of the lady's mind, inasmuch as I was prevented from making an examina<lb></lb>tion, by Mr. Harris; he desired her not to answer any questions, and I could not tell until I had seen her again whether that was effectual with her or not—I went alone, I was a stranger to her up to that time; it was at Rose Cottage, Feltham; I stayed about ten minutes only—the defendant's niece, Emma Harris, was present besides the defendant and myself—on the 30th I went with Mr. Dendy, the last witness—I was also accom<lb></lb>panied by Mr. Kingsford, the medical attendant—I and Mr. Kingsford saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250051"></xptr>
               <p>her then alone, in the absence of Harris; I had very little doubt before as to the state of her mind and intellect, bat there could not be the slightest on the second interview, because she could not understand who I was or why I came, or her own position, or what she was doing at Rose Cottage, or the bearing which the death of her sister had upon her own fortunes, or in fact comprehend apparently any but the most simple possible pro<lb></lb>positions, and that very imperfectly—I tried her upon the usual subjects, as to the value of money, as to the day of the year, the time of the month, as to her own name; she could not answer her own name, unless it was put interrogatively, "Is your name Albinia?"—on that occasion I should think we were there nearly forty minutes or an hour, a long time—her state was imbecility in the first degree; she was imbecile; that certainly must have lasted many years, from childhood certainly—I saw that she was amused with a bundle of rags, and I have since seen her pleased with a doll and a toy, and that kind of thing—her age is about forty-two or forty-three, or a little older—she looks at pictures with amusement, and seems to know the subjects of some of them—I have since seen her once a fortnight—I do not hold any appointment under the Commissioners of Lunacy, I have seen her simply as visitor of a single patient; a medical mail must be appointed as a visitor, he is appointed by the committee of the person or the signer of the certificate or order of seclusion—I took upon myself to visit her, being the medical attendant; the Statute requires whoever is the medical attendant to go once a fortnight and to make, an entry ia a book—having chosen the place of Miss Dendy's residence, and being her medical attendant, I simply did my duty in going, and I have gone since with Mr. Dendy's knowledge—I told him it was necessary, and I had his tacit per<lb></lb>mission to do so—that is since the patient's removal from Rose Cottage to another establishment, the house of a clergyman near London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When were you first requested by Mr. Dendy to go to Rose Cottago to see this lady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the day that the trial ter<lb></lb>minated, after the verdict upon the trial as to the sanity of Alicia when making the will of 1859—I was a witness on that trial on behalf of Mr. Dendy—I don't think I ever spoke to Mr. Dendy in my life before that occasion, I mean till the occasion of speaking to him about his sister, the alleged lunatic; that was on the 22nd or 23rd, on the last day of the trial; it lasted many days—I was a witness, but I was not in communication with Mr. Dendy; I was instructed by the solicitors—Mr. Dendy made no application to me to visit his sister until the jury pronounced a verdiet against him on the will—I was a witness on the trial in the Probate Court, at the request of Mr. Dandy's solicitors, for the purpose of giving evidence as to the soundness of mind of Alicia—I had been consulted on that sub<lb></lb>ject; I had not seen Alicia—I had been consulted on the subject of docu<lb></lb>mentary evidence—the communication on the subject of Albinia came from me—I went to Mr. Dendy, he did not come to me; we had never spoken till then, except to say "Good morning" in Court—on the first occasion I went alone to see her on the Sunday morning—on the second occasion I asked him to accompany me, because I could not get an entrance, I was not allowed to speak to Miss Dendy—I was present when Mr. Harris was examined as a witness in the Probate Court—he saw me examined, and knew me perfectly well, and when I went down to his place I sent in iny card; he said, "This is not a proper day to come down and inter<lb></lb>fere with my family on a Sunday"—I was present when Miss Dendy was removed—she was not in the lightest degree affected, not the least, she</p>

               <p>could not be made to understand what her brother wanted to do, but when she was in the carriage she was perfectly pleased, happy, and delighted—her brother took her up in his arms and carried her out of the house like a child; I have described it that force was used to get her out; her bro<lb></lb>ther took her up in his arms and carried her out by force.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MAULE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us understand thoroughly what occurred, which you have described as the use of force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The brother begged the sister to come with him—he described that he had got a nice house for her, and she should have a drive with him—nothing had been said or done by her to provoke him to make that remark—he asked her to come out with him—she did not say she would not, but she evidently did not want to go—she made a noise, a sort of grunting noise, and Miss Harris said she was very angry—it indicated dissent—no one was with Mr. Dendy and myself when the was removed—Miss Harris was there—Mr. Dendy had the order for her removal in his pocket—I may explain that, not knowing how a lady in her state of mind and health might bear a removal of that sort, even with her own brother, I volunteered to Mr. Dendy to go down with him, in order to see that no harm happened to her—the order for removal is in effect a request to the party who is to receive a patient, to do so, under the hand of a person described as having authority to make the request—I suppose as much feeling was expressed at going as a woman in her state of mind could indicate—it was alarm—she was frightened—she could not make out whit her brother wanted—it was evidently a new thing to her, because the instant she found she Was sitting in the carriage she smiled and laughed—we stopped and spoke to a friend of hers within fifty yards, who shook hands with her in the carriage, and who noticed how smiling she looked—it was a pleasure trip for her—I was a witness on the issue of the sanity or insanity of Alicia, with regard to some will that was said to be her will—I had never seen her—it was the documents in question then that led to my going to Mr. Dendy and saying to him that some medical man must at once be sent down to see Albinia—I had read the documents—it was entirely upon the basis of those documents that I gave my evidence, professionally and scientifically, and of course upon the evidence I heard in Court—after I had given that evidence I went to Mr. Dendy upon my own mere motion—it was in consequence of my seeing him and suggesting something that I visited Rose Cottage on the Sunday—I sent in my card and explained who I was—I saw Miss Harris first—Mr. Harris at first said he was ill, but he afterwards came into the room, and when I had been there about five minutes he desired Miss Dendy not to answer any questions, and said I was a witness who had been talking of what I knew nothing about in the witness-box, and he frightened her—he said that Miss Dendy was quite rational, that I was coming down to injure her in some way or other, and she was not to answer any questions, and I left.</p>

MAULE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The Statute requires the recipient of a single lunatic patient to send true copies of the order and two certificates? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to the Commissioners in Lunacy—they are generally addressed to the Com<lb></lb>missioners, and sometimes to the secretary, but I open every document that comes into the office—it is all filtered through my hands first—this book would contain the notice of the arrival of the documents referred to—I have searched the book—the copies sent are placed in a bundle of papers accord<lb></lb>ing to their order—they are classed in circuits or districts for the Commis<lb></lb>sioners—we keep the copies as well as enter them—after they go into the hands of Mr. Rawlins, or Mr. Mitchell, they are kept by them until they are handed out to the Commissioner, to take with him when he goes to visit a patient, so that he may know her history from the document—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original document sent to us with regard to Miss Dendy's removal to her present abode.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of Messrs. Vandercomb, Law, and Co., solicitors for this prosecution—I served a notice to produce upon the prisoner, a copy of which I produce; I served it on Saturday last at Feltham. (<hi rend="italic">This was a notice to produce any order or certificate autho<lb></lb>rising him to receive or retain the said Albinia Dendy, as required by the Statute.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the evidence was insufficient to support the charge; that there was no evidence that the defendant had not such order as was required by the Statute, the book in which the entry of such order should appear not being kept by the witness who was called, but by others who were not present, and, although it might be suggested that it was a book kept under his inspection, even then it could only be referred to for the purpose of show<lb></lb>ing what it did contain, and not to prove what it did not; that there wat therefore no evidence to support the charge that the house was not licensed, or that the defendant received a person without the requisite certificate or order.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that there was evidence for the Jury that the lady in question was a lunatic or an alleged lunatic, and that the defendant received and retained her without having the order and certificate required by the Statute. It was truly stated that the proof in this case was in the nature of negative proof, and that negative was, in his opinion, established by the evidence, applying the ordinary rules of law and common sense a public duty was thrown upon the Commissioners, under the superintendence of their chief clerk, and though, as a general rule, a defendant must have his guilt proved, and was not to be called upon to establish his innocence, and where the proof was in the nature of negative proof, and where, if he had received the documents and had not transmitted them, they would be in his possession, and notice to produce was given, there was a sufficient case for the Jury to decide upon.</hi>

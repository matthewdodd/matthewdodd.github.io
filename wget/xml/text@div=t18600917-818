               <p>12 o'clock—I pulled off my coat, waistcoat, and shoes, and pulled the covering of the sofa over me, because I had to get up very early in the morning—the house was all safe when I went to bed—the windows and everything was fastened—I was awoke by feeling a certain seusation as of somebody scrambling over my face—I thought it was my wife, and I said, "Emma, you are hurting me," and then I felt a cold hand come over my face, and then a pressure on my chest—I put up my hands, and found it was a man—I rolled off directly and we had a desperate struggle—I got hold of the prisoner and held him down—it was all in the dark—we had no light—my wife came down and brought a light—we were scuffling together, she went and called my lodgers, a man and his wife, who came down and assisted in taking him—I then went outside the door, called "Police!" and fell in with the policeman on duty—this was about a quarter after 1 in the morning—I gave the prisoner in custody—on the road to the station, I heard him say to the constable that if he had been aware that I was lying there, he would have cut my b—throat—there is no shutter to our window, he had got up on our area rails; there is a space of about three feet between them and the window, it is in the main street—he must have stood on the top, got on the window-sill, and got something to open the latch; then pulled the upper window down and clambered over the two sashes—I did not see him do that, but there was no other way for him to have got in—on the upper part of the window there is a spring latch, but you can shove any<lb></lb>thing up between the window and open it.</p>

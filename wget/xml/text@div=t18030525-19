               <p>Q.Was it in an apparently agitated manner? - A. Yes; I had a stick in my hand, I lifted up my stick, and was going to strike him over the wrist, that he might drop his pistols; seeing me going to strike him, he put his hands in this way, (down by his sides;) I saw two persons in St. James's Place, standing by the end of Cleveland-court; I called, help, upon which he lifted up his right-hand, cocked the pistol, and I turned my back to him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he present it at you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How near was he to you then? - A.About the distance of a yard; I turned my back, and he fired; I felt a shock on my back as if I was struck; I endeavoured to get out of Cleveland-court to run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250015"></xptr>into St. James's Place, I fell down; when I was on the ground, he came up to me, and stooped to me, and swore at me, and cocked the pistol, and fired again.</p>
               <p>Q.The other pistol was it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When he fired the second time, your face was fronting to him? - A. Yes, I was on my right side, and looked at him; I received the shot here in my ham; they went through my breeches, through my drawers, and through the upper part of my stocking; and made several marks in my thigh, I believe three or four; upon that a number of people came, hearing the report of the pistols, and secured him, and took the pistols from him; these are the pistols. (Producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q.Were you acquainted with the prisoner before? - A. I had known him four years.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the prisoner, at any time, expressed any displeasure against you? - A. Yes, he had threatened to shoot me twenty times.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know where he was taken to? - A. He was taken to Bow-street immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.You had known this gentleman four years before - what is his situation in life? - A.I was agent for a Miss Ward, who is since married to Colonel-Major St. Paul, and I knew him from the day after she came of age; he had been a long time troublesome to her, insisting that he was in love with her, and because I would not introduce him -</p>
               <p>Q. Had he applied to you to introduce him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.More than once? - A. Yes, repeatedly, and because I refused to introduce him, and to sign certain papers which he sent to me to sign, he expressed his resentment against me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.You have known the prisoner four years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.His attachment, I believe, had been long before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.So he had opportunities of seeing the young lady before you knew him? - A. I believe not; only in this way; she lived at her father-in-law's, in Sloane-street; the prisoner had a mother who lived in Sloane-street, with Sir William Bunbury, and Miss Ward visited there.</p>
               <p>Q.You would not introduce him upon his desire? - A. I refused him.</p>
               <p>Q.He wanted you to sign something, and you refused? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon this evening he made his approach to you very much agitated, and came close to you, and presented the pistol, as you have stated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How close must you have been to him when he fired? - A.About a yard from him.</p>
               <p>Q.What was in the pistol you felt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.But received no wound? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.The second time he fired, you were probably nearer? - A.Not so near.</p>
               <p>Q.You received what was in that pistol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.But there was no wound? - A. Nothing to signify.</p>
               <p>Q.Through the whole of this time this young man has been under the insluence of this attachment to the young woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He never threatened to destroy you upon any score of jealousy? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What was the nature of the papers that he wanted you to sign? - A. That he was a respectable man, and a proper person to marry Miss Ward; and if I did not sign them, he threatened to destroy me; and he sent me copies of duels, and said that should be my fate. On the 25th of last March, in consequence of a pretended duel he produced to me, I had him up at Bow-street before Mr. Bond, and I informed him I thought I could prosecute him criminally for the threats he had used to me, but did not think it worth while; I told him I thought he was a foolish fellow, and bid him go about his business.</p>

               <p>Q.What time of the day did you see him first? - A. I believe about half past two, or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was he when you saw him? - A.He was standing at the post at Lord Carrington's door, in St. James's Place.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you, at that place, see who goes in and out of Cleveland-court? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is it from Cleveland-court? - A.About twenty yards; I saw him staying there above an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear the report of any pistol? - A. I heard the report of a pistol, and ran into Cleveland-court; Mr. Townsend was on the ground then, the prisoner was standing just by him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him do any thing? - A. I was just turned the corner when he fired the last pistol off.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did he fire the pistol at? - A. Mr. Townsend; he was lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q.After he fired, what happened? - A.My fellow-servant came up, and he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q.How near to where Mr. Townsend lay? - A.About a yard and a half; I have one shot, the other I gave to Miss Townsend, Mr. Townsend's sister.</p>

               <p>Q.At what time? - A.About four or five o'clock in the afternoon; I went up, and served some cream and milk, and he was there; I went down Pall-Mall; when I came back, he was there still.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was it before you came back? -- A.About half an hour, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q.When you last saw him, what did he do? - A. I was coming past him a second time, and before he moved, I saw Mr. Townsend come up St. James's Place; with that, he rushed by me, and shoved me off the curb stone.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did he go? - A.He went into Cleveland-court as hard as ever he could run; with that, I heard the report of the first shot, and as I came into the court, the second I saw him fire at Mr. Townsend.</p>

Yes; I merely saw the prisoner, Grant, standing in the custody of the people who came to the assistance of Mr. Townsend; I walked with Mr. Townsend to Pall-Mall, but being in a bad state of health, and unable to assist him, I returned, and there were shots put into my hand by various people; I did not see them picked up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I did intend to enter into circumstances particularly between myself and Mr. Townsend, but I have been advised to say but little upon it; it is an affair so the heart, and nothing that can be alledged against me, no, not the verdict of a Jury can affect me so much as the expression of Spencer Townsend as to a declaration of malice; I would wish your Lordship's attention to the circumstances; one of the pistols having struck Mr. Townsend on the back, and not harmed him in the least, and the other pistol that was fired from which he received no harm, I would ask whether the pistols were not presented with the handles to him, and the mouths to myself; whatever I could have thought of Mr. Townsend, I could not wish to take any advantage of him; when I loaded the pistols, I declare before God I did not apprehend any harm could come to either of us; I knew the effect of pistols loaded with swan-shot and powder.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the account on which you parted with him? - A.That unfitted him for business entirely.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he did not know that it was a criminal act to fire at a person? - A. No.</p>

            , Esq. Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in Water-street; I have known the prisoner from an insant in petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you known of the unfortunate attachment? - A. Not till within a twelvemonth past, which was since his bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether, prior to that twelvemonths, he was a peaceable, quiet, and harmless man? - A. He was of good conduct, as to his morals and behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q.The last twelve months was his conduct at all altered? - A.After that time, it appeared to be perfectly inconprehensible.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon any particular score that you were made acquainted with? - A. Upon general circumstances, particularly with regard to his bankruptcy, he persevered to the last moment in an opinion contrary to the opinion of all his creditors.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever had any conversation with him, or heard any thing from him, respecting this unfortunate attachment? - A.Very lately he has hinted at it; there appeared to me some cause of mental derangement, but from what cause I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his conduct appear compleatly contrary-to what it used to be? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He differed from his creditors about his bankruptcy, and wanted to go on longer? - A.He wanted to go on a deed of trust, and not to be a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not hear that he wanted to go on, in expectation of marrying a woman of fortune? - A. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you consider his wanting to go on under a deed of trust, in oppostion to his creditors, as a mark of insanity? - A.I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you think he was incapable of knowing good and evil? - A.His conduct was so extraordinary that I slighted him, and have known but little of him this last twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q.How often have you seen him this last twelvemonth - have you seen him half a dozen times? - A. I may have seen him half a dozen times, but I have not conversed much with him.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you venture to say, that a man you have not seen above half a dozen times in a twelvemonth, is incapable of knowing good from evil? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>JOHN GARDINER Sworn. - I have known the prisoner three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of knowing that he was pursuing an hopeless attachment to a young lady? - A. Not till within this twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you occasion to speak to him on the subject since you knew of the attachment? - A.His conduct has been such as consirmed my opinion, which I all along entertained, that he is deranged, that his mind is not right.</p>
               <p>Q.You are of opinion that he has been deranged down to what time? - A. I have thought his conduct, previous to the information he gave me of this affair, extremely strange and incoherent; he has for some time previous to this affair visited at my house, and as well as I can recollect, about a twelvemonth ago, he called upon me one evening very late, I believe about twelve o'clock; on that evening, to the best of my recollection, he related to me this affair, previously pulling out some papers from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your observation of his conduct from that time such as convinced you he was deranged? - A.Those papers were a gross attack, a gross libel, on Mr. Townsend, which he meant to publish in all the papers.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you think, upon your oath, that he has been for some time deranged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250018"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He shewed you some papers that were a libel on Mr. Townsend? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You advised him not to publish them? - A. Yes, as it would subject him to punishment.</p>
               <p>Q.You were a creditor of his? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had dealings with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him lately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is incapable of knowing good and evil? - A.From the circumstances I must think so; I have refused to trust him any more, not thinking him right in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. He wished to have a deed of trust instead of being a bankrupt, on the expectation of marrying a lady of fortune? - A. I don't know that.</p>

            . - I have known the prisoner three or four years, and a more harmless, more inoffensive man, and more unlikely to commit the outrang that has brought him here, is not within the circle of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever any conversation with him on the subject of the attachment we have been speaking of? - A.Frequently.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear to you, in those conversations you had with him, to be in his found mind? - A. In every conversation I had with him on that subject, I thought him bewildered.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take him to have a rational mind on that subject? - A.Perfectly irrational.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Do you believe him to know the difference between good and evil? - A.Perhaps he may, except in the question of this unfortunate attachment; certainly it is not the same in any topic not connected with that circumstance.</p>

             Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I have known the prisoner from his infancy.</p>
               <p>Q.Within these last four years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know of this unfortunate attachment? - A. I spoke to him of it about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his conduct in respect to that attachment? - A. It was extremely absurd and irrational in every degree.</p>
               <p>Q.Did his conduct lead you to conceive he was deranged? - A. On that subject I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Simmons. Q.You don't remember his telling you that this woman was a person of a great fortune? - A. No, I think the affair rather an affair of love than fortune.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MILLER Sworn. - I know the prisoner; I think I became acquainted with him in the end of the year 1799.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had conversations with the prisoner, or has he told you of this unfortunate attachment? - A. He gave me information of it after his affairs became deranged.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your observation of his conduct, was it the conduct of a man having the possession of his mind? - A. I am a principal creditor; he wished to have a trust deed; I was strongly for a commission of bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether as applied to this subject of the attachment, did you believe him to be an irrational agent? - A.He was not rational upon that subject.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you had many conversations with him upon that subject? - A. A good many.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you form your opinion from those conversations? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.You were his principal creditor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he owe you? - A.Six hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it very frequent for persons to with to act under a deed of trust? - A. I suppose it is.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he want this in expectation of marrying a lady of fortune? - A.He never stated that.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he ever describe the person to you? - A. Yes, as the daughter of the late Lord Ward.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he state her to be a young woman of fortune? - A. I understood her to be a person of fortune.</p>
               <p>Q.You have not seen him much since his bankruptcy? - A. I have seen him more since than before.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you conceive him conscious of moral good and evil? - A. I think he was, except when this subject came across his mind, he was quite wild.</p>
               <p>JESSE GREGSON Sworn. - Q.I believe you were solicitor to this gentleman upon his affairs being deranged? - A. Yes, I was called in to settle his affairs; the first interview I ever had with him in my life, he mentioned this young lady; I had conversed with him before on his general concerns, upon which he talked as rationally as any othere man could do; but when he touched on the subject in question, he was wholly unmanned, quite irrational, and cried like a child, and talked in so incoherent, so inconsistent a style, that it excited the observation of a gentleman with me, that he was not right in his mind, that he was certainly a madman; I had occasion to converse with him a number of times on his general affairs and his attachment to this lady; he talked quite consistent on his general affairs, but on that subject he was invariably incoherent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination. - Q.Do you mean to say, that such was the deranged state of his mind, that he was incapable of knowing good or evil? - A.Upon my oath, I should doubt very much whether at times he was capable of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was so deraged, as not to feel that it was a dreadful crime to fire at a fellowcreature? - A.I think his mind was so distracted, as not to know what he was doing, and that he might fire at Mr. Townsend without knowing whether he was doing right or wrong, or even fire at myself, or any body else, when his mind was on that sub<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250019"></xptr>ject; I conceive he was entirely incapable of knowing what he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How long is it since you made that observation? - A.The first time I ever saw him; that is about a twelvemonth ago, and it has been invariably so.</p>
               <p>Q.How many times have you seen him since? - A. A great number of times.</p>

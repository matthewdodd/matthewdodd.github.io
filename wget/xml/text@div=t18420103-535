                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 159.) On the morning of the 4th of January I was on duty in Regent-square, St. Pancras; about a quarter before eight o'clock, the prisoner Iron came with an empty basket past No. 46, Regent-square, he looked down the area, went further on, returned, and passed several times—he went down a court in Sidmouth-street, returned again about twenty-five minutes after eight, and went to the area gate, he again looked down, and stepped back—he went to the gate again—it appeared to be opened by somebody—he went down the area, and came up in about seven minutes, with the basket full of coals—I went up to him, and told him he must go to the station—he asked what for—I said, "On suspicion of stealing the coals"—on the way to the station, he said if I would let him go he would never do it again—I took the female prisoner into custody at Mr. Knight's house, No. 46.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 46, Regent-square. The prisoner Allum was my cook—in consequence of suspicion, the policeman was de<lb></lb>sired to watch—after the male prisoner was taken, I told the female I had a charge to make against her—she asked what for—I said, "For stealing property"—she said she had not taken any thing, but afterwards she said she had been in the habit of having her father down to clean the knives in the morning, and occasionally gave him broken victuals—I said she had given him other things besides—she said she had not—I accused her of the coals, and she said she had done it more than once—I have another servant, who was ill at the time, and had not got up.</p>

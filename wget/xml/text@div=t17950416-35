I suspected her, and I went up to Bow-street, and brought one of the officers, and he went with me to a place that she used in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160072"></xptr>White-house yard, Bridges-street, Covent-garden</p>

               <p>Q. How did you get to the pawnbroker? - I received that information from the prosecutor; she had found out by some means that the ring was there, by what means I don't know. I asked the pawnbroker if that was the person that had pawned the ring in question? he said it was.</p>

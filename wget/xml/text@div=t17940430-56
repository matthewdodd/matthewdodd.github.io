On the 26th of January, I lost a silver watch, I was in my own house when I lost it; the watch was hanging at my bed's head; I found it again March the 14th, at the pawnbroker's, in the Minories, after searching about a long while; I did not see her till the 9th of March, when she came and said she would trouble me for taking away her character.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of March, the prosecutor came to our house to enquire whether there was a watch pawned on the 27th of January, and I had taken one in of a woman by the name of

               <p>Q. Do you know who that woman was? - I cannot pretend to say; the watch was pawned the 27th of January, and I did not see her again till the 14th of March.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough; Mr. Nutting sent for me to take charge of the woman, and the next day I took her to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her? - I cannot recollect the day of the month; taking her there the magistrate asked me if I knew her husband? I said, yes; he said go and search him, if you can find any duplicates; I did, and could not find any; before he went to the justice he desired to speak to his wife, and I let him, and he asked her whether he knew any thing at all about her coming away from Mr. Nutting; says he, did I know any thing at all about your pledging of it? no, she said, he did not, and she was drunk, or she should not have done it. Then I took him into the magistrate, and the followed Mr. Nutting, and begged of him to be merciful, and her husband should pay for the watch as he could, if he would not put the law in force against her.</p>

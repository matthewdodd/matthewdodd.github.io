                  </hi>. I am an assistant to the Civil Service Supply Association at the stores in Bedford Street, Covent Garden—on 9th January, between 4 and half-past in the afternoon, I was engaged there attending to my business on the second floor—I saw the prisoner looking at some books in a book-case; I had suspicion, and watched him; I saw him put one under his coat and walk away—he had got as far as the front entrance on the second floor when Mr. Odell, the manager, stopped him—I told Mr. Odell that he had got a book under his coat—the prisoner said he had not—I left him with the manager—I afterwards saw the book; it is Campbell's works, worth 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. The last witness called my attention to the prisoner, and I stopped him as he was opening the door to go out—I said "Have you been dealing in the book department?"—he said "No"—I said</p>

I am manager of the book department—I was called by Mr. Odell, and went with the prisoner into the office—I noticed a peculiar gesture against the back of the desk, and I saw this book these—I said "What about this book?"—he said "I know nothing whatever about it"—he said "Will you charge me with stealing it?"—I said "How was it you came in the stores?"—he said "With a member"—I said "What is his name?"—he said "Wootton"—the name was familiar to me, and I was rather cautious how I dealt with him—he gave some address at Clapham—I sent Roland with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He gave some name as his own—to the best of my recollection it was Reuter. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM ROLAND</hi>. I received directions to go with the prisoner to 46, Holland Street, Clapham Road—he took me up one street and down another, and walked me about as if he was walking for pastime—at last he pointed to a house, and said, "Go and rap at the door"—I said, "No, you are better acquainted with the house"—I believe it was an unoccupied house—I just stooped down to see if there was any light, and he made a bolt and got away.</p>

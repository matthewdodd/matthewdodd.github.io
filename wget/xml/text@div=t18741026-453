I am an unfortunate girl, and live at Limehouse—on 4th October I saw Fernandez at a public-house at Limehouse—he paid for three glasses with "coppers and then he paid for five glasses and changed a half-sovereign, and I saw him tie his handkerchief up with the gold, I saw the glitter of the gold, but the quantity I do not know—all the three prisoners were then in the house—after the wine was drunk Hill and Regan took the prosecutor out of the house—I followed, and the man, was calling out after me "Julia"—two men who are not in custody came up, and the man was knocked down in the road and Morgan had the handkerchief in her hand—she offered it to me and said "It is a fine muffler"—the man first crawled a little on his knees and he said for God's sake would <hi rend="italic">they give</hi> him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he would forgive them the rest, and one of them threw him back<lb></lb>wards and kicked him—Hill came up and said "What is the matter?"—I said "If you don't know nobody else ought to"—she said "I defy you, you are all in the shed by the side of me"—Regan came up and said "You are a foolish girl"—I said "You take my foolish advice and go home to bed," and then he came back and said that he had only a few pieces of silver in his pocket and it was no use getting in trouble for that—the policeman said "If you want satisfaction go up before the Magistrate to-morrow"—I said "Come along with me and if you require a policeman I will show you where you will get one"—when he found I intended to go he turned back—I went with the sailor to the station and they took the charge, and two policemen were called off the beat—they went up to No. 3 in in the court, where Hill lives—she was not in doors and the policeman watched the house—I was not present when she was taken—I afterwards said "Here is the woman who had the muffler," and the policeman took her—she said</p>

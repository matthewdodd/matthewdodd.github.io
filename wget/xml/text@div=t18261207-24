I attribute her death to the sudden and great shock her constitution received from the sudden and great fall, being in a very debilitated state of constitution; she told me she did not think she should ever overcome it - this was sixteen or seventeen days before her death - she never appeared to mend - she never spoke about her death more than at that time; she said she was thrown down by some boys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. She died from debility of constitution, arising from a shock which she received? A. She certainly died from the injury - her constitution not being sufficiently good to overcome the shock, I judge the immediate cause of her death to be the fall.</p>

I knew Sarah Hood by sight - she lived in the same court- I do not know what she was. On the 9th of November, about half-past seven o'clock at night, I was in the court, and saw her there, coming from Hungerford-street; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070021"></xptr>the five prisoners, and other boys whom I did not know - I knew the prisoners well before - I heard Thomas Williams and some of the strange boys say, "Here comes the old Scotch b-wd, let us have a lark with her" - she gave them no offence at all - after saying that, they took her by the head and b-m, and ran her down the court towards her own house; when they pushed her to her door, she fell down sideways on her hip; she groaned bitterly, and said, "Oh! my thigh is broken!" Wilson, who was with me, brought out a light, and the boys tried to blow it out, but he would not let them. Thomas Williams had some mud in his hand; he went round by another boy, and kept throwing it at her as she lay in the gutter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You were among the boys? A. No, I was not - I saw it done - I was eating some fried fish; I had not been playing with them that day - some of them live in the same court - they did it for a lark; they often played with her; I did not observe that she was drunk; I never saw her in liquor.</p>

My mother, who keeps a shop in the court, called me in, and I did not see her fall - I heard her groaning, and crying "Oh! my thigh is broken" - I brought out a candle, and they tried to blow it out - Frederick Williams helped to pick her up - Thomas Williams got behind a boy, and was pelting her with mud - I saw them laughing.</p>

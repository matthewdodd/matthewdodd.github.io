                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's lodgings—I told her she was suspected of stealing Mr. Deedy's coat—she said she knew nothing about it, and requested me to go with her up stairs to her apartment, to search—I said I should—I called Mrs. Deedy up stairs, and the prisoner took several things out of her box—among them was a shawl, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of new stockings—Mrs. Deedy saw these articles, and said they were in pledge at the time the coat was stolen—the prisoner said they were not, they were taken out a week before the coat was stolen—I asked if she would go with me to the pawnbroker's where she took them out from—she said she would—I went there with her, and asked the pawnbroker if she had taken out articles on the Monday or Tuesday previous—the pawnbroker examined the tickets, and found she had not—I referred him to the 11th and 12th, and he found she had taken out these articles on Tuesday, the 12th—I found she had laid out several sums of money.</p>

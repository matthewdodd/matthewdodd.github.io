                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Reiley, of No. 25, Playhouse-yard in the parish of St. Luke. It is his dwelling house—on Friday night, 30th Aug., we went to bed a little after 12 o'clock—I fastened the door—the windows were the same as they had been ever since we had been in the house; they were kept shut down—we had six birds in cages, kept at the side of the first floor staircase window—I got up a little before 6 o'clock in the morning, I found the window as I had left it over night, but I missed five birds, and the cages as well, there was only one left—the entrance must have been effected by opening the window, and it must have been shut down again—they could not have got at the cages without opening the window—I think they could reach the window from the outside without a ladder, with assist<lb></lb>ance, for the lead over the street door was partly removed; they could read the window from that.</p>

I was on duty in Playhouse-yard, about 2 o'clock on the Saturday morning, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him what he was waiting for—he said for another man, and walked away—he was not twenty yards from Mrs. Beiley's house—he lives in White-street, Bell-alley, Goswell-street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant</hi>, G 21). I went to the prisoner's lodging, in White-street, Bell-alley, on Tuesday, 2nd Sept, about 2 o'clock in the morning—I found him in bed, and asleep, on the second floor—I awoke him—he asked what I wanted—I said I came about some bird cages—he said, "What bird cages?"—I said, "These I expect;" going over to a shelf where I saw these bird cages I now produce, covered over—I had received a description of them from Mr. Reiley, and they answered that description—I sent for him, and he came and identified them—while he was taking down a cage from the wall, the prisoner said, "That is not one of yours, Mr. Reiley"—there were several other cages in the room—I asked him where he got them from—he said he bought them—I said, "Where?"—he said, "In Club-row "—I said, "When?"—he said, "On Sunday morning"—I asked</p>

Q.</hi> It is a place celebrated for the tale of birds, and all other things, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is a market, they are nearly all bird shops and fancy shops—persons do not sell there in the street, as they do in Petti<lb></lb>coat-lane—I never knew them do so—I have not brought the cage here that the prisoner said was not Mr. Reiley's, because Mr. Reiley said it was not his—I found six more birds in cages—there were no pigeons—the prisoner's father claimed the fifth bird, which Mr. Reiley thought was his.</p>

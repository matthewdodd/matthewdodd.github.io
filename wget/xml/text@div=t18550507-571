                  </hi>. I live at Plaistow, in the parish of West Ham, and am store keeper, in the employ of Charles John Mare, ship builder, of Black<lb></lb>wall; he has no partner, but trades under the name of Mare and Co. On 21st April, about half-past 9 o'clock in the morning, I missed some gutta percha straps which were used for the machinery—the prisoner was in the employment as strap maker—in consequence of something that passed I caused him to be taken into custody by Metcalfe, the policeman, who pro<lb></lb>duced the prisoner's boots, which were soled with gutta percha—I heard the inspector ask him where he got the gutta percha from, and he said, "I have taken it"—the inspector asked him if he had any more pieces at home, and he said, "I have one"—the inspector requested the sergeant to proceed to the prisoner's house and search—he did so, in my presence, and a bundle was found containing seven pieces of gutta percha and four leather laces—I did not hear what passed—the sergeant will explain that—the prisoner's boots were taken off, and there was gutta percha on the soles—the laces are similar to those used by the firm in lacing the bands.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi> K 7). On the morning of 21st April I was sent for—I am employed on Mr. Mare's premises—the prisoner came, with a foreman, to the police office in the yard—I said to him, "How do you account for the gutta percha on your boots, there has been some lost?"—he said, "I took it from the shop"—I asked him if he had taken any more—he said he had taken one or two pieces, which were at home—I asked him, "From one shop?"—he said, "From the workshop"—I went to his house, and while I was searching a box in the corner of the room, containing some shoemaker's tools, I saw his wife standing close to another woman outside the door, in the act of passing something towards her in a bundle—I laid hold of the bundle, and found it to contain these pieces of gutta percha and four leather laces—I showed them to the store keeper, who said he believed them to be Mr. Mare's property.</p>

On the 7th of November I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock - we all retired together; I left nobody up: I saw the house properly secured - the windows and doors were safe; on going down next morning I found the parlour and drawing-room doors open - the parlour closet was open, and the back door open - I had left it shut the night before, and fastened with two bolts and a wooden bar; the glass window was taken out, and the door opened - a person could get in through that window; it was a small sash window, with no shutter, but a wooden board had been nailed over it for security, as the glass had been broken; I found that board broken down, and the whole window out - the kitchen dresser drawers were open; Miss Leak was on a visit at the house at the time - I found her box down at the kitchen door; she saw it - I missed two cloaks out of the hall, and two table-cloths from a table drawer in the hall; they were marked, and I shall know them again - I missed a pair of shoes, which I have not found.</p>

            . I am beadle of Edmonton. On the 8th of November I heard Mrs. Prior's house had been broken open - it is in the parish of Edmonton, and in Middlesex; next morning, the 9th, I was going from town to Edmonton, and saw the prisoner - I knew him before: after seeing me he turned round, and went on fast - I turned my horse to go after him, and he ran away; I followed, and overtook him - he had a bundle: I asked what he had got in it- he said it was nothing to me, or something to that effect; I told him a great many houses had been robbed at Edmonton lately, and I thought he might have some of the property - he made no answer; I asked for the bundle - he gave it up to me: I took it out of his hand - I opened it, and found some articles in it; I took the bundle home, and sent for Mrs. Prior - I have the same articles now; I asked how he came by the property - he said it was no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090005"></xptr>thing to me, but when I got about a mile on the road I asked him again how he came by it - he said a gentleman met him and asked him to carry it for him; I asked where he was going to carry it to - he said to Shoreditch church, and he was to give him a shilling for his trouble; I afterwards took off his hat, and found a table-cloth marked

            - he had not said he had any thing in his hat; I have had the table-cloth ever since - I found two common keys on him, which the Magistrate ordered me to give up to him; I produce the property - one table-cloth was in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I did not know what was in the bundle. Witness. He did not say so.</p>

            . On the 7th of November I was on a visit at Mrs. Prior's, at Edmonton, with my sister, who was in very bad health - this cloth pelisse and silk frock are mine; the muff belongs to my sister Sarah, who is fifteen years old - I am twelve years old; my sister is at home, at Holt, in Norfolk - she is now in delicate health; I know the muff to be hers - my father's name is Benjamin - these things are his property, because we are under his care, and he bought them; we both live with him - Mrs. Prior is not related to us: we went to stay a short time with her - we were there several months - the frock and muff were locked up in a deal box in Mrs. Prior's study, on the Saturday night, and the pelisse was in a deal box by it, which was not locked; I saw the box after the robbery - the deal box was broken open, the pelisse and muff gone, and the frock from the other box.</p>

             - she is an elderly infirm lady; I lived with her on the 7th of November - she rents the house, and occupies it; these table-cloths are her property - I know them by the letter P. on them, and the pattern of the diaper: they are worth 2s. each - I saw them the day before the robbery, on a table in the hall.</p>

My brother came to me on the Saturday, and said my uncle Clarke, the head messenger at the Trinity-house, had a job for me; I went to do it, and stopped at his house on Saturday and Sunday nights: I came home on Monday, and on Tuesday, as I was going there, I went into a public-house, and had a pint of beer, about one o'clock in the day, and when I came out a gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and said he would give me a shilling or two to carry the bundle - he gave me the cloth, told me to put it into my hat, and said most likely he would overtake me on the road; when the constable stopped me, I asked him to let me go back to find the gentleman, but he would not trouble about that, and said he should take me.</p>

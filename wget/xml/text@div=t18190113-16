I have some land in the parish of Wilsden, Middlesex, round the village - I had some sheep there. On Saturday evening, the 2d of January between four and five o'clock, I examined, and found them all right. On Sunday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, I missed one. I searched round the field, and found the place where it had been stuck, there were marks of blood, and footsteps where it had been caught in the corner of the field. I traced the blood and footsteps over hedges and ditches to Shade-green, which is near the prisoner's house - it appeared to be the footsteps of only one person. I searched the house of a man named Mason, but found nothing. I searched Tilbuy's house - he gave us information. We went over to Wells's house, while we were there, we saw a woman come out of the prisoner's house with three joints of mutton - it was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this - A. On the Sunday, towards the evening, just before dark. She dropped one joint as she went along, and threw the other two into a ditch, at the end of the house. I examined the ditch, and found two joints there, and the other which she had dropped - the constable went into the house. Next morning, we found the skin of a sheep in the privy - it appeared to have been killed seven or eight days. We found another skin on the adjoining premises, which is the skin of my sheep - it was buried in a bank; we also found the paunch of the sheep there - they appeared quite fresh, and must have been killed on the Sunday morning, or late on Saturday; it was marked R - I knew it to be the skin of my sheep; I compared them with the mutton which the prisoner's wife threw into the ditch, and they corresponded with the skin. The prisoner was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORRIS. The prisoner was not at home. I am sure the skin was mine.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Wilsden. The prisoner occupies a cottage of mine. On Saturday the 2d of January, I was with him - he was employed almost all day, moving some mould, and taking it off a bank, and throwing it into a ditch. The sheep-skin was found among the mould which he had been moving on the Saturday afternoon.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was with Mr. Tomlinson, and examined Wells's premises. In consequence of information, I was going to the prisoner's house and saw his wife standing at Wells's door, which I had mistaken for the prisoner's, and went in there - they are both under the same roof. I afterwards went to the prisoner's apartment, and found two joints of mutton hanging on a nail over the bed - they did not appear to be concealed - the prisoner was not at home. I went and saw Tomlinson in the ditch with two joints of mutton - I did not see him take them out. I was with him next morning, and saw the skin found in the bank; I compared it with the mutton found in the ditch and in the house, and it all appeared to belong to the same sheep. I took the prisoner into custody on Sunday evening on the adjoining premises, when he came home, and asked him how he came by the mutton? he said he had it sent to him as a present from his friends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I came from Tomlinson's house on the 3d of January, I got over a gate, saw something laying there, and heard somebody go through the hedge. I found it was meat, brought it home, and said I would not cook it to-morrow, and that if any owner came they should have it. It is clear, that if I had committed the robbery, I should not have concealed the skin in the mould, as I was going to work there next day.</p>

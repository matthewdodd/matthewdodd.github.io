                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a seaman, belonging to the ship <hi rend="italic">Vesta.</hi> About half past 12 o'clock in the morning, on 22nd July, I was coming along some street in Wapping; two men came running after me—one hit me in the face, and took hold of me behind—I fell down—I cried out, "Police!"—one of them ran away; the other one wanted to put his hand in my pocket, but being unable to get his hand into my pocket, he tore half of my coat tail away—this is my coat, and this is where he tore the piece off—he ran away with it, and I ran after him—he stopped at a door way, and I stopped as well—he had still the piece of coat in his hand—when the policeman came running, the prisoner ran away again, and just when he crossed the bridge the policeman caught him—I had in that part of my coat that he took, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a pocket handkerchief—I have not seen them since—I cannot say what the prisoner did with the skirt of the coat—I could always see the prisoner, I was so close after him—it was so dark that I could not see exactly what he was doing or throwing—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who tore off the skirt of my coat with my money in it—he is not the man who gave me the blow which made me fall down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 31). I heard the cry of "Police!" in Wapping, on 22nd July—I waited and beard the cry again—I turned and saw the prisoner running down High-street—he saw me and ran into a door way—the prosecutor came by him, and the prisoner ran out—I pursued him again—he turned and showed fight—I went in upon him and took him—I did not see anything in his hand when he was in the doorway—when I took him I told him he was charged with robbing a sailor of his purse, and 6<hi rend="italic">a.</hi>—he denied it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> We walked on, and I said, "That is one, why did you let that man go? why not take him?" <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He said there was a gang, but there was no one but himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had been to a friendly meeting, consisting of shopkeepers, watermen, and others; I left them about 10 minutes before 12 o'clock, and in going down Wapping the prosecutor and two men came out of a public house; as they came by me the prosecutor struck my left eye; I looked at him, and he made another blow at me; a man said, "Take your coat off;" I would not, and they got the prosecutor's coat, and were pulling him about;</p>

               <p>I saw there was a fight, and I ran away, because I know foreigners fight with knives; the prosecutor had a knife in his pocket.</p>

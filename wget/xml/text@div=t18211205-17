I rent part of the house, it is let out in tenements by the landlord, who lives two doors off, but he occupies the cellar under his own house; nobody belonging to him sleeps there. On the 6th of November, a few minutes before nine o'clock, I was in my shop; the sash of the window was forced up, and a pair of shoes taken from it. I saw the window shake as it went up, I ran to the street door and found it was tied outside - I gave it a jerk and broke the cord, ran out, and saw two boys running down the street very fast; I caught hold of one of them, which was Burton - I brought him back and fetched the patrol, he said he knew nothing about it, he and was innocent - nothing was found on him. I examined, and missed the shoes - I let him go as he had nothing, I have since seen my shoes in possession of Sutton, the other boy was rather bigger than Burton, it was not Hall - I only saw two boys; I am sure the window was shut down, they could not get the shoes without throwing it up, they were close to the sash - I have the cord here.</p>

On the 6th of November, he went out about five o'clock without my leave - I was ill in bed at the time, he returned at one o'clock.

            . I am brother to the last witness. I believe I am turned sixteen years old; I work at Fleur-de-lis-court. I was coming home, to Parliament-street, on the 6th of November, about half-past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners and another, (I believe there was three) in Air-street - I called the prisoner, he came to me; I only knew Burton by sight, he was one of the two. I asked Hall if he was coming home, he said No; there was something to come very easy, and he should not leave till he got it. He asked me to jump it, I said "No, I sha'nt; I do not know what you mean." I went to the corner of Air-street, stopped there, and heard the window go up - I then looked and saw him take the shoes out; I then went home directly - it was him who pushed up the window. I told my brother he would hear something before long, and then went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you live with your brother - A. We had moved into a new house which was damp, and I slept in his back room with Hall. I told my brother of it on the Saturday night - Hall was taken on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell your brother before - A. He was ill in bed on Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell him on Wednesday - A. I had not time; I go to work at eight o'clock and do not return till nine at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HALL. Q. Did not you tie the door - A. I did not, nor did I tell you it would be a good scheme.</p>
               <p>Q. You threw the window up and knocked the shoes down - A. I did not indeed; I asked him to come home, he said he should not, and I left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you carry the shoes part of the way across Air-street-fields, and tell me to take them to my master - A. No; I did not pull out a knife and cut the string the shoes were tied with</p>

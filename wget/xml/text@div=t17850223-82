               <p>How do you know the street door was on a single lock? - When I was frightened with the noise, I was particular in turning the lock back, to let myself out.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know any thing of the situation of the house at all, till you heard a noise? - One of my lodgers went out last between five and six.</p>
               <p>Did you go to see the state of the door after that? - I heard it shut, I am sure it was shut; after I heard the noise in the kitchen, I came up to the passage, and I smelt fire or like tinder burning, or linen; then I opened the street door, and looked up at my windows, I saw no light, and all my windows were shut; I had not stood a minute, before I heard my two pair of stairs door breaking open, it is my bed room; my sister was in the two pair of stairs room last, she is not here, she locked it; I then went out and looked up at my windows, and I saw a light in the room where I sleep; and I begged of my sister to stand at the door, and I would go and get Mr. Mulcaster, and he went up and took the prisoner; first saw the prisoner in the parlour, with the things mentioned in the indictment; one window of the dining room was fastened down, and the other was shut; Mr. Mulcaster had in his hands, eighteen pieces of black silk, and five handkerchiefs, and an apron, the apron is marked with my own name, A. D. the handkerchiefs I have had for some years, they were not marked; the things were all taken out of my bed room.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Dixon, how many lodgers have you? - Five, all men, creditable tradesmen that go to their work.</p>
               <p>Have they all keys to the street door? - No.</p>
               <p>Who lodges in the first floor? - I had nobody then.</p>
               <p>What time do you usually shut up your house at night? - As soon as it is dark, I had shut up my house for good, all but shutting up one window shutter, sometimes I shut both windows of the first floor; but I had been washing, and hung some clothes there; I always fasten the sash, I think it was fast then.</p>
               <p>You did not find all the fastenings of the house broke? - No.</p>
               <p>How was the window of that two pair of stairs room, which is your bed room? - It was a casement, it was shut, and none of the glass broke; there is a little sort of a slanting ledge, the house is a corner house.</p>
               <p>So that with a good deal of help, and something to hold by, a man might by chance walk along as a cat does? - Yes, they must hold by the other ledges, or by the wall, or else they could not.</p>
               <p>This is in a public street? - No.</p>
               <p>You have neighbours on each side of you, and some in front; therefore if a man chose to play the cat there, he would be observed; he could not walk along without being seen, if he were to walk along there to throw up the window? - It was a very dark night.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Between eight and nine the 3d of February the prosecutrix came to our shop door, and called as loud as she could, for God's sake Mr. Mulcaster come to our house for there are thieves in the house; it was quite dark; she said the thieves were up stairs, I took a light immediately from the parlour and run up stairs; while I was on the stairs I heard a person running up before me without shoes seemingly; when I came up to the one pair of stairs; I just slightly looked there, and I turned my eyes and saw all the things that are mentioned in the indictment, on the second pair of stairs; some upon one stair and some upon another; they were separate; I heard a bustle above stairs, and apprehending there might be more than one, I called to my son who came running after me, to go and call Mr. White, a gentleman who was in my house; my son stood on the outside of the door; I went up stairs into the two pair of stairs, and there found both the doors open, it has originally been only one room, but there is a deal partition put up to make it two; the one is a very small room, the first room is not the bed room.</p>
               <p>Was that door open of the first room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing broke about it? - The lock was broke, and the two front screws were forced out, the door opened outwards towards the stairs, and by its being wrenched towards the stairs to open it, the screws were forced up, so that it hung by the back screw.</p>
               <p>Did you see into that room? - I just looked into it; I saw men's wearing apparel looked up altogether, that was all I saw in that room; Mr. White came up, and I begged of him to listen on the stairs, and let me know if any body came down, and I looked into the bed room, I looked slightly under the bed, I came out immediately finding nobody there, I went up the third pair of stairs, and I met the prisoner coming down with his shoes in his hand; the lock of the bed room was broke, and a piece of the iron was forced off, I found this on the ground; the drawers in the second floor were cut in the upper part to let the lock out.</p>
               <p>Were they cut in more places than one? - Only in one place, there were several articles of the prosecutrix's wearing apparel laying in the room; I examined the door the next day, and both the doors were forced open seemingly with this plaisterers hammer which was found there; as I met the prisoner coming down with his shoes in his hand, I laid hold of him and asked him if there were any more, he said no; I begged Mr. White to take care of him while I searched the garret, but I found nobody in the garret, one garret window was open, but there were bars before it, so that nobody could get in or out; I took the prisoner down stairs in the parlour, and I searched him; upon him I found these two knives, this centre bit, and these matches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This centre bit in its present state is utterly unfit for any use. - Undoubtedly it is; it is of no use without a stock.</p>
               <p>If it had the best stock in the world, it would not be of any use; it is all notched; you do not find that the centre bit had been used? - No, when we came into the one pair of stairs, the sash was a little open, about half a pane or a little more.</p>
               <p>Not room enough for a man to come in? - Not in that state.</p>
               <p>And for any thing you know the sister might have come in after the alarm and put put up the window? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Coming down St. Martin's le Grand, a coachman asked me to go and call one Penny Feather up three pair of stairs, and I went up, and coming down this gentleman came and took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. After the alarm of the noise, you say your sister was with you, do you know whether your sister left you? - I knew nothing after I went out.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell then what became of her? - No.</p>

Burningham, of Throgmorton Street, and they sold them to Mr. Louis Cohen, the broker of Rothschild's—it is not the fact that I took a good deal of interest in these Russian forgeries; none whatever, except interest in what is in the papers, when there are speeches made by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, they are always interesting—I took no interest in, and knew nothing about these matters—I have been lucky and unlucky in my acquaintances—I knew Hol<lb></lb>chester, I made his acquaintance at a German coffee-house—I know that he was sentenced to twelve years' penal servitude for forging Russian notes—I never had any business with the man in my life—I had seen him, but never bad any transaction with him—I had known him some months before he was taken into custody—I used to see him very often, meeting him in the coffee-house in the afternoon—he was of my persuasion—he was not from Germany, and I don't know where from—he was not an English Jew—I used to see him pretty constantly at the coffee-house—to my astonishment he was taken of for forging Russian rouble notes—I should think that is three or four years ago—I did know that such things were going on—the knowledge of forged rouble notes did not come upon me entirely by surprise—I have read of a great many cases—I was not in communication with Holchester's wife while he was in prison—I will swear I was not—I did not call upon her by his desire while he was in prison—I did not see him while he was in prison—I say most distinctly that I did not see anything of Mrs. Holchester during the time he was in prison—I swear most distinctly I was not at the house—</p>

               <p>detect the forgers of Russian notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, and I hope you will allow. me to explain: Mr. Thomson sent one day for me, he wanted to see me; I went down to his private office, and after haying several preliminary con<lb></lb>versations, he said, "The matter turns upon these forged Russian rouble notes"—I said, "Mr. Thomson, now what is the use of your always going on and finding out the dealers with these notes; why don't you try and get at the fountain head?"—he said, "I should like to find it"—I said, "I tell you what, Mr. Thomson, if a sum of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is guaranteed in the hands of my trustees, I will make this matter a matter of study, and devote my time to it, whether for twelve months or two years; if I succeed I want 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I don't succeed I have lost my money, my time, and my labour"—I did not know that I would succeed or not—on my solemn oath I was ready to give up two years of my time, without being pretty sure whether I succeeded or not—I knew nothing about them—Mr. Thomson gave me a piece of paper and his recommendation to Mr. Robins, and with that piece of paper I went there—I went there for the purpose of being employed, not as a spy, but, if a crime was in existence, to suppress it—I did not rely upon the gratitude of Koche—he could not tell all about it, he did not—Mr. Robins did not say that he would have nothing to do with me—he said he would propose the matter to his chiefs, whoever they may be, and they declined—I afterwards met Mr. Thomson in the passage of the Old Bailey, and he said, "Mr. Robins don't want to have anything to do in it," and the remark I made to Mr. Thomson was, "I can pretty well guess what the meaning is, neither you, nor Mr. Robins, nor Mr. Kamenski want to get at the bottom of it, for the simple reason that you don't want to lose the goose with the golden eggs"—I thought I could get to the bottom of it, if I de<lb></lb>voted two years' or twelve months' labour to it.</p>

I am a glass cutter, and live in Royal Mint Street—I know the prisoner—I first saw him in March last—I did not deal with him—he gave me a sample of tobacco, to try whether it would suit me, at Mr. Harris's home—he saw me smoking, and gave me a sample—I saw him afterwards at my house in that same week—I can't say what day it was—it was between 2 and 3 o'clock—he came in and asked how I liked the tobacco—I told him I did not care about it, it was no business of mine—he said, "Very well, if that busi<lb></lb>ness don't suit you, I have got some better business for you that you can make a fortune out of"—I said, "I should like to know what that business is"—he said, "Would you like to do business with any <hi rend="italic">shymers</hi>?" that is a Hebrew word, meaning leaves from Hebrew books—I said "I do not deal in such things, it is no business for me, I am not a merchant in such a thing"—he said, "You are a foolish man if you don't understand what I am talking to you about; shall I show you a sample?"—I said, "Yes, you can show me"—my daughter was in the shop at the time, and he said, "Who is that young woman?"—I said, "That is my daughter"—he said, "Can we talk in Hebrew before her"—I said it was no harm, she was my daughter, I was not ashamed that she should see what it was—I said he could show me—he then took out his pocket book, or a paper; I did not take much notice; and he took out some Russian notes, and said, "That is the thing you can make your fortune out of"—he showed me five roubles and ten roubles—he said, "Any amount I can have if you want to do any business, from ten to one hundred roubles"—I told him that</p>

               <p>business did not suit me, and said, "Don't you come to my house any more on such business as that"—he said he could sell them to me at a shilling a piece very cheap—I told him I did not like such a business, and if he came on such a business again, I would kick him out, and give him in charge—he told me they would pass for good.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were quite shocked at the suggestion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never did business with him—I did not know what it was at first, when he spoke about <hi rend="italic">shymers</hi>—he explained afterwards that he meant forged notes<lb></lb>I was very angry—I had only seen him once before, at Harris's place—I am no friend of Harris's—I went there to buy a bit of cloth—I have been a trouble—not for robbery—I was unfortunate—it was about an action—a man exposed himself before my daughter, and I did not go against him, because his wife came to me, crying bitterly, and begged mo not to do so—and he afterwards entered an action against me for false imprisonment—it was not a false charge—he recovered damages against me, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was examined—my daughter was not—we had no trial at all, and no notice of trial—I did not pay, because I was not able, and I went to Whitecross Street—I was never in prison except upon that occasion—I am quite sure of that—there was never anything about furs, that I swear—I was never tried.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and carry on business at 14, Union Court, Old Broad Street, and have done so for about eight years—I know Zibarski—he has altered in his face, but he is the man, I know—I first saw him at Harris's place, in Leman Street—I am an acquaintance of Harris's, and have had dealings with him—I know Mr. Rewman—I have never been in company with him and Zibarski, and I never saw Frankle until the day he was brought to the Court—it is not true that Frankle, Rewman, and Harris were together with me conversing about Russian rouble notes, or anything of the kind—Zibarski came to me one night, at my office, at the latter end of May—I think about the 19th or 20th—he and Harris were outside my office, and when I came in they were standing there—Harris said, "Mr. Moses, this gentleman has some good bills that he wants to have an advance upon; can you make an advance?"—I said, "Let me see the bills?—Zibarski took out one bill, which was dated St. peters<lb></lb>burg, it was a bill for 3200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw it in his hand—he did not mention the amount, but he gave one bill into my hand and then another—I examined them—he said, "I have here a Russian merchant, and he wants to buy some goods; and I have here some good bills; can you make me to advance upon them?"—I said I would make inquiries—I did make inquiry; I did not make any advance.</p>

               <p>have cloth—I deal in pictures, and in wine and brandy—not in cigars—if anyone offers cigars to me, and I can make a profit on them, I buy them—I buy what anyone offers me—I have clothes in my warehouse at this moment, and wine, and pictures, and marble ornaments, statuary—they do not go in the way of discounts—I buy them—I do not discount bills with wine and pictures—I pay money for them—I do not import, and I do not export—I do bills—I have had several transactions with Harris—I don't recollect advancing him 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never had anything to do with engraved plates—I don't know what you mean—I never tried any speculation of Harris's about engraving plates—I don't recollect lending him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a cheque, or about that sum—I am quite sure of that—I have lent him money sometimes, sometimes 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whatever he wanted, and when he had money to spare he gave it back to me—that was not a profitable business—I have known Rewman about eight years—I have done business with him of different kinds—if he wanted money I lent it to him, and he paid it whenever it was convenient—I have done that all the time I have known him—I have done nothing else for him—I have lent him money several times on his word—I did not take his bill—there was nothing between us but dealings in money—when he wanted money I lent it to him—I have not made up my accounts, so I don't know whether there is anything between us now—I am not finding any money for the expenses of this trial—I advanced some before he was arrested; not afterwards—it was about a fortnight before he was arrested—I can't say how much, without my books—I believe it was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it has not been paid yet, it is owing now—I never heard of his paying 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Turkish and Italian Stock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker, of Catherine-wheel-alley, Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street—on Sunday night, 14th June, I had been to a funeral, and was coming home after 12 o'clock—I had been drinking—I was with my wife at the top of Catherine-wheel-alley, and the prisoner rushed out and said, "I have got you now; you have lived quite long enough"—I recollect nothing more, but next day found myself with my jaw broken, in the hospital, where I remained five weeks—some of the bones are stuck in the place now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—we were at a funeral, and were coming home at half-past 12 on Sunday, 15th June—I saw the prisoner near Catherine-wheel-alley with his back to the wall—he ran at my husband, and gave him two or three severe blows, knocked him down, and gave him two or three severe kicks—he then took a piece of iron out of his breast, and said, "I will <hi rend="italic">jaw-lock</hi> you," using fearful expres<lb></lb>sions—he rammed it into my husband's mouth, and then jumped on him—I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> myself down, and said, "Do not kill the father of my children;" and he said, "If you holloa, or make the least alarm, I will do the same to you"—my girl heard me scream, she came out and said, "Do not kill my father"—she ran for the police, and he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the piece of iron on the door-step, and ran away—we picked it up, and picked up the father, but were afraid to take him to the hospital that night for fear the prisoner should come again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he go to his business next day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he never left the house, except to go to the hospital—he is a boiler-maker—he stayed in bed till half-past 9 with his mouth all swelled, and I sent for a doctor who sent him to the hospital—my son-in-law took him there about 1 o'clock—my son-in-law was quite sober—the hospital is a mile off—I did not see the prisoner till he struck my husband—my husband was very much intoxicated, but I was quite sober, but I had taken a little.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on 15th June the prosecutor was brought there—his jaw was broken in two places, and he was bruised about the face and chest—the injuries were serious, and must have been done by great violence—this piece of iron used in a certain way would do it, and kicks would produce the bruises on the body—he remained in the hospital nearly five weeks—his life was in danger, but he is now discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the injuries be caused by a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by a single fall, they were too extensive—it is impossible to say whether they were all made by the same means—I do not think a blow from this iron would be likely to break a man's jaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might that piece of iron put into the month, and turned round, break the jaw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might, but I do not think it did—I think it was done by a kick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furnishing ironmonger, and life in Davis-street, Berkeley-square. The prisoner James Bateman was in my employ as occasional porter and assistant is the manufactory—he had been so about eighteen months—in consequence of suspicion, I went to the house of his mother, June Bateman, on Wednesday night, the 14th or 15th of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020046"></xptr>
               <p>December—it is next door to the Hanover public-house, Bays water-road—I found the two female prisoners there—I inquired for James, and his mother told me he had been gone out about ten minutes—I said I wanted him to come to work at half-past five o'clock next morning, which was half an hour earlier than usual, to oil a smoke-jack in Portman-square—she said she would tell him when he came home—she brought a tin candle<lb></lb>stick, with a pair of steel snuffers in them, to the end of the counter (it was about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening)—the snuffers were part of a packet 1 had lost a few days previous—I said, "Mrs. Bateman, these look very much like a pair of patent snuffers which I have the pattern of—they were very superior ones, and are a peculiar pattern—I never saw any other ironmonger have them—there is not a patent for them, but they are called patent—she said, "Sir, they are not yours"—I said, "I did not say they were, but if you will allow me to take them home with me, I will return them by <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> in the morning?"—as they were all over grease, I gave them into her hand to wrap in a piece of paper for me, and brought them away with me—as soon as I returned I sent my son for a parish-officer, and he went with the officer to their place—I was not present—next morning about ten o'clock, I went with the officer to their residence—Priscilla said her mother was not at home—between that time and one o'clock, I went to Smith's, a pawnbroker in Edgeware-road, to inquire if he had any cutlery, or brass candlesticks, or ironmonger's goods pawned with him—he produced two or three pairs of knives and forks, two pairs of large bran candlesticks, and one flat candlestick—I found my private mark on the largest pair—the whole of the knives had my name and address stamp on the blades—I claimed them as property lost from my warehouse—I then procured a search-warrant from Marlborough-street, and took two officers to Bateman's house, and found a japanned canister, and a tin candlestick in the shop, and the duplicate of a carving-knife and fork in her bed-room—it was the only bed-room in the house—the prisoner James slept in the house every night—it was his lodging, as I understood—I never saw him lodging there—after searching the place, the officers and I accompanied the female prisoners to Smith, the pawn broker's, and his man recognised Priscilla as one of those who pawnel the articles—we went from there to Marlborough-street office—about half-past twelve o'clock the same night, James Bateman knocked at my door—I opened it, and asked, "Who are you, Sir?"—he replied, "It is <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> come to render himself up, having heard that his mother and sister were in prison, for he had robbed me"—I asked him how he came to do such a thing—he said because his mother was in distress when he did it—I said, "I can do nothing more than deliver you into the hands of justice, and I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>search her house, on suspicion of having property of Mr. Baker's—she said she had not—I searched, and on the ground-floor found a candlestick and sugar-canister, which Mr. Baker identified—I went up stain, and found two duplicates in a chest of drawers in the bed-room—the mother said those two tickets belonged to her—she afterwards said only one of them belonged to her—she very much wanted to get them from me, by putting her hand out, saying, "That one is mine"—on looking at them I found one was for a carving-knife and fork—I said, "This must belong to Mr. Baker"—she made no reply—the duplicate she claimed was for six dram-glasses, which the prosecutor does not claim—I took both the prisoners into custody.</p>

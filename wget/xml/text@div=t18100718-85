On the 6th of July, I wanted to go out with my horse, I sent a person to feed the horse, the corn-bin was fastened; he wrenched it open, and there he saw the bed sacking. I ordered my brother to mark it, and leave it in the same situation he found it; in the afternoon, it was taken out and left under the manger, covered with straw; my brother and the foreman watched, and in consequence of their information, I got an officer and a warrant; we searched the prisoners room, in Three Tun Court, Red Cross-street; I there found in the closet, three flower baskets, a parcel of bed cords, and a new blanket. The flower baskets I am positive are mine.</p>

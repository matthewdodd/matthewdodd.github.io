            . - Q. How old are you? - A. Going of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what will become of you if you swear falsely? - A. I shall come to no good.(He is sworn). On the 6th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I had been to seek for a place; as I was going along, I saw the two prisoners look very hard at me, and then they looked in at Mr. Jackson's shop at a piece of cloth; they went past the door as far as the coffee-house, and then came back again; I stood at the corner of Cavendish-street; they both went up Cavendish-street, talking to one another, and looking back; they went round, and came through a court by Oxford-chapel; then I saw them come back to the same shop, and look at the same piece of cloth; it hung out at the door upon a piece of board, there were several pieces by it; then they went to the same coffee-house again, and then they turned round, and Hughes, the youngest one, took it up, and gave it to Madden, and she put it under her cloak; Hughes stood looking at some muslin, when Madden ran up the court as hard as ever she could; I then went in and told Mr. Jackson of it, and two of the men came out; I ran up by Oxford-chapel, but could not see Madden, I saw Hughes, and told Mr. Jackson's men that she was one of them, and they took her home to the shop, and sent for Mr. Bates, and he took her to the watch-house; about a quarter of an hour after I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080062"></xptr>Madden again; I went to the public-house the corner of Vere-street, I saw her there; she asked me if I would have any beer; I said, no, I thank you; then she was going out; I set my back against the door, and called for assistance; I told the landlord she had been robbing a shop in Oxford-road of a piece of cloth; she said, she had got none; she pulled her apron on one side, and then I saw a bit of it hanging under her cloak; I lifted up her cloak, and pulled it from her cloak; I gave it to Mr. Bates, and he has got it.(Bates, the officer, produced the property.)</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. (To Crosswell). Q. I should be glad to know how you get your livelihood? - A. I have neither mother nor father, I am a potboy when I am in work.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the owner of the public-house here where you took it from her? - A. No; I go a plaistering in the summer time; I am out of place at present, but I am going to a place at Mr. Thorogood's, a plaisterer.</p>
               <p>Jackson. Somebody informed me, not the boy, that a woman had got a remnant of cotton at a public-house the corner of Vere-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the boy say to you? - A. He said, that there were two women came to the door, and one of them took the linen from the door, and gave it to the other; one of my young men immediately went after them, and they caught the young one, Hughes; she pretended she had been with no other women at all; I immediately sent for a constable; I did not see the other till about ten or fifteen minutes afterwards; I was told she was taken at a public-house; I went to the public-house myself, and the prisoner had then this cotton in her possession, she had got it in her apron.</p>
               <p>Madden's defence. This girl that stands by, is as innocent as the child unborn; I never saw her in my life till I saw her at the watch house; that boy has been tried this Sessions at the Hall for felony; he has been in the same prison that I was in; he makes a property of swearing people's lives away; I had the property; I picked it up in the street; I am a poor distressed widow, and have three small children; I have been sick these five weeks with a decline.</p>
               <p>Hughes's defence. I am as innocent of what is laid to my charge as the baby unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Crosswell.) Have you ever been tried? A. No; I have got neither father nor mother, and I was taken up in the street late at night as a disorderly person.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not taken up for felony? - A. No; Mr. Bates took me to Marlborough-street, and I was sent to Bridewell; it will be a month next Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Bates.) Did you ever take up Crosswell? - A. The watchman brought him in as disorderly, and I took him down the next day to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not charged with felony? - A. No, he was not.</p>

             sworn. - I was constable of the night the boy was brought in; he was brought in by one Brunton, one of our watchmen; he said, he had no place to go to, and the watchman had brought him there to fit up in the watch-house; then Bates said, if Brunton did not charge him as disorderly, he would, for he wanted him to be an evidence against these two women; he was committed not as disorderly, but for the purpose of being an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Bates.) Q. Is what Mr. Brown has said, true? - A. I do not deny but what I said I would charge him as disorderly if Brunton did not, for I wanted him as a witness against these women; I had the possession of the property.</p>

I was second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Sylph</hi> steamer—in January last, she was at Bordeaux—on 30th January I was directed by the chief mate to go into the forecastle—I made a search there and found nothing in the berths, but the mate ordered me under the floor, where there is a locker that leads down into a place where we stow the cable, and there I found the prisoner, with two bottles—it was no part of the prisoner's duty to be there at that time—I did not know what the bottles contained—he gave them to me out of his own hands—I cannot say whether they were empty or full—in the place where I found the prisoner, I found six more bottles—I gave them all to the mate—before the prisoner gave me the two bottles, I said to him, "If you have anything there you had better pass it up to me," and he passed them up to the mate—I also found some oranges in a bag close to where I found the bottles—I did not count how many there were—I gave them to the mate.</p>

I am chief mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Sylph</hi>—I took an account of the cargo, but we had a Stevedore stowing the cargo—part of our cargo consisted of claret in casks and cases—on the 1st February last I gave instructions to the last witness and went with him to the forecastle—he handed two bottles to me first and then six more afterwards—the first two he got from the prisoner's hands, and the other six from the chain locker—there were also some oranges handed up to me—I did not count them at the time—there were perhaps 30 or 40, from the appearance of the bag they were in—I drew the cork and looked at the wine but did not taste it, it had</p>

               <p>the appearance of claret—I gave the bottles to the captain—I beard the last witness say to the prisoner, "If you have anything there, Jem, you had better hand it up," and the prisoner produced these two bottles, which I supposed to contain wine—I afterwards asked the prisoner if he knew any<lb></lb>thing of the matter, and he said he was not guilty of taking the wine, but he was guilty of taking the oranges—I don't think he said any more—I asked him when it was he took the oranges, and he said, "It was on Sunday"—to the best of my knowledge the casks were full when they were put on board—we did not gauge them—there did not appear to be any leakage or any deficiency.</p>

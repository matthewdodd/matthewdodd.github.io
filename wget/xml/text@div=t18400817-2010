                  </hi>. I live with Joseph Dodsworth, a blade-maker, in Ray-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner is a smith, and had been at our factory—I saw him there between the 11th and 17th August—I after<lb></lb>wards searched for him, found him at a public-house in Drury-lane, and gave him into custody in consequence of information which I bad re<lb></lb>ceived from Grubb—these are the blades—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cow Cross-street. These knives were of<lb></lb>fered at my shop for sale by the prisoner on Monday evening last, be<lb></lb>tween five and six o'clock—I asked him where he got them—he said he was sent by a. young man—I knew they were Mr. Dodsworth's knives, because I am in the habit of buying blades of him—the prisoner went out, and spoke to a man who was standing about five doors off, and they walked away together to the corner of Peter-street—the other man then came back, and said, "Those blades are my property, give them up to me "—I did not see an officer, or I should have given him into custody.</p>

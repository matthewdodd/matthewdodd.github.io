Last Monday was a week the prisoner brought in our shop four pound of wrought iron, and five pound of cast, and he looked out two pieces of iron that weighed three pound. I allowed him one for the the other. A person in the shop informed me in the mean time, I was in the back room, he had got twenty pound of iron in his breeches. He pulled out a piece of bar iron, and gave me that. The person then told me that he had had got a dozen or fourteen pound about him. I went after him, and before he got to the top of the green I took hold of him, and he pulls the iron out of his breeches, and puts it into my hand, to the amount that I told you.</p>

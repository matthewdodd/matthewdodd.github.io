On Sunday evening, 20th May, about a quarter past 7 o'clock, I was in Tottenham Court-road, between Fitzroy-court and Grafton-street, and saw a cart being driven along; there were four men in it, three were sitting on the seat, and one behind—the prisoners are three of the men—Howard was driving—it was going at a very furious rate, the horse was galloping; it was on its wrong side of the road—it was about a yard and a half from the kerb when the accident hap<lb></lb>pened <hi rend="italic"></hi>; it was going towards Oxford-street—Howard lashed the horse as soon as it passed me—between Grafton-street and London-street I saw a female crossing the road, from the east to the west—I did not see her till the cart had actually got up to her—she seemed to hesitate, and the wheel of the cart apparently knocked her down, and ran over her head and body—I saw her fall, and the cart go over her—that was on the west side, the same side as Tottenham Court chapel—after that, Howard commenced lash<lb></lb>ing his horse as hard as he was able; he did not stop—I went in pursuit of him as fast as I was able; I had got a bad hip, I could not run very fast—I sent another constable in pursuit, and I left, and went back to the woman—I afterwards saw her in University Hospital.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Kerrison, a tailor, or No. 428, Oxford-street On Sunday evening, 20th May, I was walking along Tottenham Court-road, about 10 minutes past 7 o'clock, and saw a cart going at a very rapid rate; the driver was whipping the horse smartly; it went faster after that—the cart went a little to the right, and the wheel went over a mound of earth that was in front of the kerb—that had the effect of giving the</p>

I was house surgeon at University College Hospital on Sunday night, 20th May, when Ann Legg was brought in—she was unconscious; she had a wound on the forehead about an inch in extent, not very deep, and another on the back of the head, about three inches in extent; that extended to the bone, and the skull was fractured—she died on Saturday morning—she was not at any time conscious, so as to be able to give an account of the accident—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation—the injury to the head was the cause of death; there was also rupture of the spleen, and five ribs were broken—they were such injuries as would be produced by a cart going over her body—the injury to the head I should say was produced by the fall; the rupture of the spleen of itself might account for death.</p>

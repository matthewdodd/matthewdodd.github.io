               <p>the morning of the 1st of January the prisoner came to my house—I saw him there between two and three o'clock—there was a young woman with him—they were up stairs in a room together—I heard my wife screaming murder up stairs, and went up—I saw the prisoner and the young woman; and my wife was lying on the floor streaming in blood—she was cut in several places on the bead—the prisoner had a poker in his hand—I had no sooner entered the room to see what was the matter, than he struck me with the poker on the top of my head, and I fell to the ground—he made a second blow at me, and cut me again on the left side, after I was on the ground—I then got up and tried to wrench the poker from him, but did not succeed—he got hold of a mug, and hit me on the head with it—he kept the poker in his grasp, and broke the mug in hitting me across the bead—he then made another blow at me, and by some means the poker broke into three pieces—I received a blow on my thigh—I hardly know where he struck me then, for I was almost senseless—I then sat on the sofa, and was bleeding—a policeman came in, and I recollect nothing else till I was taken to the hospital, and got my wounds dressed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On Sunday morning the 1st of January, about a quarter to two o'clock, the prisoner came to our house with a prostitute—I am sorry to say I keep a house of accommoda<lb></lb>tion—I lit them up stairs, and he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the night—about three<lb></lb>quarters of an hour after, I heard the female shriek murder—I went up to the door and asked the cause of the noise—the prisoner asked me to bring alight up stairs—I brought a light to the door, and he refused to let me in; at that time the female was crying bitterly, and shrieking murder again—I pushed my back against the door, and forced it open—I went into the room, he ran to the fire-place, seized the poker and struck me violently on tie left side of the head—I found blood coming, and shrieked murder—he struck me again on the side of the head, and struck me several times—I fell to the ground and lost my senses, and do not know what happened after<lb></lb>wards—the prisoner did not accuse the girl of robbing him—I do not know what the noise in the room was about—there was no charge of her robbing him.</p>

I was called into this house—it is a house of ill fame—I found the prosecutor sitting on the sofa, holding his head—the prisoner was in the act of pulling on his trotters—he had been without his clothes—his coat, waistcoat, and shoes were off—he had nothing in his hand that I recollect—I picked the top part of the poker off the floor—the other two pieces were put into my hand by somebody in the room, who took them off the floor—there were marks of blood on the head of the poker, as if a person had held the part which. Is put in to the fire, and struck with the other part—the prisoner said, "You thought to take me in, but I have taken you in, and it served you right"</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there about half-past three o'clock in the morning—he had several contused wounds on the side of the head—the skin was broken in several places—there was no fracture—some of the wounds were about an inch or an inch and a half in length, but not a great width—they teemed to have lost a good deal of blood, and were bleeding very freely at the time he came in—the wounds were serious, but not dangerous—they teemed to have been inflicted by a blunt instrument—such a poker as this would inflict them—there were two or three wounds on the right side of the head also, which seemed to have been inflicted by a sharp instrument—a broken mug might have inflicted them.</p>

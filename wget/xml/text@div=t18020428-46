               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of the person? - A. I saw him but a very little time; I then lost sight of him; it was a bonnet I had just brought from the milliner's; the bonnet was picked up, and given to me; the prisoner said he had been knocked down by two men; he said he was sure, if I looked at him, I should say it was not him.</p>

               <p>Q.But when you came up to him, there were a great many? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said, if you looked at him, he was sure you would say it was not him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so dark, it was impossible for you to swear to the person? - A. Yes.</p>

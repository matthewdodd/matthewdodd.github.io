            . On the 5th of March, in the evening, I saw the prisoner take this scale from the front of my shop - he stood outside, and took it; I knew him before - he ran towards his own house; I ran after him, calling Stop thief! and asked a man to stop him - he then threw it at me, and asked me to forgive him; he looked at me when he took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not tell Mrs. Higgs that you did not see me take it? A. No - she saw you with it, and called Stop thief!</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THWAITES. I heard the prosecutrix crying Stop thief! saw the prisoner running, and collared him with the scale - he threw it down, and made great resistance; I held him till the Policeman came - he then said he had picked it up, and asked the prosecutrix to forgive him- she said, "I am sorry for you, but you are in the hands of the Police."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you the man had run round the corner? A. When he got to the station he said a man ran round the corner, and he had picked up the scale.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live opposite the prosecutrix - I went out for some candles, and as I crossed the road I saw a man take the scale, and run off - he threw it down, I took it up, and was going to take it to her.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH ROWDEN. I never lost sight of him.</p>

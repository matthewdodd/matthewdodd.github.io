                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Lovett, a hair-dresser, at Ratcliff. On the 6th of Feb. the prisoner came into my shop—she asked if her man had come to be shaved—I said I had no one there—I did not know who she meant—she went away, and came again to know if my husband was at home—I said no—she said she wanted him to go and shave a man—I said he would not be home till the afternoon—she said, "Let him come by six o'clock; that is the time the wake will begin"—when she was gone I mined two pairs of scissors, a cutting-cloth from the chair, and two towels—I went over the road, and found her at the bar of Mr. Brown's public-house—I said if she would give me the things I would do nothing to her—she began swearing and laughing at me—I went to the station, and she was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother in Dunstan-place. I produce two pairs of scissors which I bought of the prisoner on the 6th of Feb.—I asked if they belonged to her—she said they did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>, I told her that, because the prosecutrix told me to say so; it was right opposite the prosecutrix's door. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, I do not live exactly opposite—the policeman came in about an hour—the scissors were rolled up in a piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>, On the 5th of Feb. I was in company with the prosecutrix; we were both drinking; as I was passing next morning she called me, and sent me out several times; a man she called Smith came, and she gave me the scissors and cloth, and told me to get 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on them—I went to Mr. Sutton's, and could only get 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the man met me at the door, and told me to give the money to him, which I did; we went to the White Hart, and had a quartern of gin; the prosecutrix told the man to keep the change; soon afterwards she saw me, and told me to try to get the money to get the things back, as she was afraid of her husband; I said I had not the means.</p>

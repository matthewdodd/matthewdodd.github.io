On Friday morning, the 20th of July, a little after six o'clock, I found my back kitchen window had been forced open, and a pane, composed of strong brown paper, between the passage and the shop, had been completely separated from the frame; a person could then get into the shop; on entering the shop I found the desk had been forced open by a screw-driver, which laid near it; I found on the counter two drawers, which had been taken out of the desk, turned upside down - and at eight o'clock, when the shopman came, I learned what he had left in the desk the evening before - no money was left in the desk. I do not sleep in the house, but my two servants, whose names are Lockyer and Adams, slept there; one is nineteen, and the other fifteen years old. I had left the house about three or four o'clock the afternoon before - I got there a little before six in the morning, and found them both up, as they should have been, as the workmen come at six o'clock- nobody had been into the shop; as the shop-door was secured.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Jones. I left the shop at eight o'clock in the evening of the 19th of July; I locked the desk, in which I left a 10l. and 5l. note, 3l. in gold, and 18s. in silver. I deposited the key in the shop where I knew where to find it again. I left Lockyer and Adams in care of the house - I locked up the shop, and put the key of it into a room up stairs - the key of that room is left with the prosecutor's son - I put it into his room; he had the key of that room. I went next morning at eight o'clock, and was informed the shop had been robbed. I noticed a window, which before was covered with brown paper, had been forced open, and somebody appeared to have got in; I got the key of Mr. Jones' room, and found the shop key still there; I found the desk broken open, and two drawers, which I had locked in it the night before, were taken out, and the money taken out; also about 1s. worth of copper was taken out of the till, which had not been locked, and an old black coat of mine was gone - I could identify the 10l. note; I did not notice the back window as I passed it, but afterwards found it was drawn back. I found Lockyer and Adams still in the house.</p>

            . I am a clothes salesman, and live<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130009"></xptr>at No. 9, Monmouth-street. On the 20th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was passing the shop of Mr. Isaacs', clothes-salesman, of No. 29, Monmouth-street - I cannot exactly say the day of the month- it was on a Friday. I heard of this robbery on the Monday afterwards; Isaacs called me in; I saw the prisoner and Bodnum there: Isaacs asked if I had a handkerchief to sell - I said Yes, and produced one - I sold it to the prisoner and Bodnum, for 4s.; they presented a 10l. note in payment; I cannot swear which of them produced it - I told them they had not come honestly by it, and I would give charge of them; Mrs. Isaacs would not let me give charge of them in her house - she said I should take them to my own house, and give charge of them there; I took them to my house, and sent my shopman for an officer - in the mean time they both said it was their father's note, and they would bring their father down; I agreed for them to fetch him; the shopman came back, and said he did not see the street-keeper at the corner; I cannot say whether they heard that; when I agreed for them to go to their father, they asked me to give them a sovereign, which I refused at first; but they begged hard of me, and said they would bring their father down: I at last gave them a sovereign, with a card of my shop, and told them to call next morning with their father, and I would give him the rest of the change; I kept the note; they went away, and never came back again, nor did their father - I only gave them a handkerchief and a sovereign. I let them go because they persisted in its being their father's.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on a Friday, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I cannot exactly tell the date; he came alone at first, and I sold him a suit of clothes for 24s. - he paid me a sovereign and 4s.: he said, "Now you have dealt so fair with me, I will bring my brother down, and he wants a suit;" in an hour or two he brought the witness, Bodnum, and another boy less than him; I sold Bodnum a suit of clothes for 30s. - he gave me a 5l. note; I gave him 3l. 10s. in change: he asked if I had a handkerchief to sell; I said No. Simmonds came by; I asked if he had a handkerchief to sell; he said Yes, and while he was talking to them, a countryman came in; I was engaged with him, but heard Simmonds say, "How did you come by this note? I shall give charge of you." My wife, who was present, said, "Take them down to your own place, and give them in charge," for she herself was very poorly with the fright: he took them to his own shop.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old in February, and live in Gray's Inn-lane. I ran away from my father and mother about the latter end of June, and have supported myself by holding gentlemens' horses; I ran away from them three weeks before this happened. On a Friday, about the 21st of July, I went with the prisoner to Isaacs'; he gave me the 5l. note in the shop; he was with me on the Thursday evening, between five and six o'clock, and said he would have about 20l. in the morning - this was in Cumberland-street, opposite Hyde-park: we had been holding horses all day: I went down into Regent-street with him; he left me in Regent-street, a little way down on the right hand, about nine o'clock in the evening, and told me to stop there till he came back; I did not see him again till between eleven and twelve o'clock, when he was in Regent-street; I asked where he had been so long; he said he had been to Lambeth; he then pulled out a lot of halfpence and showed me, and then he pulled out a 10l. and a 5l. note, two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 18s. in silver. We went out of Regent-street into Oxford-street; he told me next morning that he had got the money from somewhere down by Lambeth, in a court; he said he got into the back window, through a pane; that he left his shoes and stockings down in the kitchen, and went up stairs - that he had worked at the house before, and was turned away through some silver spoons: he said that when he went up stairs, he broke the lock of the desk open, and took this money out of the desk; that there was only one young man slept there, a little bigger than himself; we had been to a brick-field to sleep, and were down in the Bayswater-road all the morning, and in the afternoon he went to Isaacs', and bought a suit of clothes and a handkerchief; he bought a hat in Oxford-street: I went to Isaacs' with him a second time, and bought a suit of clothes for 30s. - I paid a 5l. note, which he gave me in the shop. Simmonds came in, and the prisoner wanted change for a 10l. note; we were taken up about nine o'clock the same night by the watchman - some gentleman gave charge of us; we had gone to the Bayswater-road again. My clothes are at my father's house now; they were on my back when I was taken up. My father works in stables; we had both ran away from our parents at this time.</p>

            . I am keeper of Paddington watch-house. The prisoner and Bodnum were brought to the watch-house, on suspicion, on Friday evening, the 20th of July, by one of our watchmen; there was no direct charge against them: I searched them, and found they had every thing on new from top to bottom - I found on Martin a new purse, with a sovereign, and 17s. 6d., a new comb and knife; Bodnum had a new purse, with 15s. 6d., two new combs, and a knife. I asked where they came from: they both said they came from Bristol; I asked how they came by the money, and what they came to London for; Martin said his mother had given him the money to come to town to buy clothes with. I detained them all night, and took them before the Magistrate next morning; they were remanded till Tuesday, and in the meantime I heard Mr. Jones had been robbed. I produce the 10l. note which Simmonds gave me - I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES re-examined. I had dismissed the prisoner, as he was accused of stealing some silver money from a cook-shop; a silver spoon was missing from my premises about a week before I discharged him, and he was charged with it.</p>

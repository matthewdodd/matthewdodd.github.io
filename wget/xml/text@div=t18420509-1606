                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-street, Tottenham-court-road, and am an oil and colour man. The prisoner was in my service for about six months. On the 23rd of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw a customer come into the shop, and pay the prisoner a shilling, a penny, and two halfpence—(I was in a situation where I could see it)—the pri<lb></lb>soner put the money between the scales at the end of the counter, and when the customer was gone, he threw the shilling into the till, and put the penny and two halfpence into his pocket.</p>

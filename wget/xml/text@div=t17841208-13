               <p>On the 10th of November in the morning between four and five my house was broke open, I had not been long asleep, I did not come home till late, and I heard a noise as if some panes were broke, I listened a little while before I went down, my wife went down directly, she thought it was the china broke, I heard her go to the maid, and say, you nasty toad you have not shut the outer door; no madam, says she, I did not, there are two doors, one was upon the latch, and the other was open, she came up stairs again and came to bed; in a little while the maid came up to me, and called Master, Master, I am robbed, I dressed myself, and went down directly, and in the little breakfast room towards the garden, I found every thing was taken away, and the small silver that was left behind, and the china were moved on the floor; then we went to the fore parlour, there was broke one clothes press, and one corner cupboard, the glass broke, but nothing taken out from there, they took out a mahogany drawer full of clothes, and they were every hit taken away, and after that we began to search about the house, and we found in the back part, which was a little open, about seven feet deep under a gateway, an old sash about seven foot high, which gave light, that was cut across with a knife, and the wall in the middle was broke through, so that a man could get through by all means; then I searched about the house, and I found an old black coat, the thief had cloathed himself in my clothes, and left all his old clothes behind, and in this coat I found a letter which a man in Clerkenwell wrote to his wife in Hatton Garden; I sent my son and another down to the workhouse, to make an enquiry in consequence of this letter, whether there was such a woman in the workhouse, and I went to Justice Green, and he gave an order for two of his officers to go and fetch the man from Clerkenwell; I knew the man when he was brought to my house, he lodged in my house nine months before, I believe for seven or eight weeks.</p>

             of Bridewell, I did expect he would have been here, but being sessions time I fancy he is not come down yet; I had information to apprehend this prisoner, accordingly I did apprehend him on the 12th of November, I took him to my house, and there I searched him, and found this spectacle case, and in his shoes he had a pair of silver buckles, and silver knee buckles, I asked him how he came by them, he said he bought them at a silversmith's in the Minories, I asked him whereabouts it was in the Minories, he told me near the bottom, I went and enquired out the shop, I carried the buckles and shewed them to Mr. Dean, at Dean's I found nothing, these are the buckles I took from the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am son to Mr. Dean, silversmith.</p>
               <p>Look at these buckles? - As to knowing the buckles I do not, I did not sell them; on the 10th of November, to the best of my knowledge, the prisoner came to our house in the morning with a pair of silver salts gilt inside, an old fashion milk pot, a pepper box, and three odd tea spoons, the whole amounted to two pounds fifteen shillings, I was behind the counter, and reckoned them up; we estimated the value by the weight; the salts being foreign made, was four and ten pence, and the rest of the plate being hall marked, was five shillings; I did not know him before, we asked him how he came by them, and he was very much affronted at it, he said they were his own property, he brought them from Gibralter, he said he should hardly bring them for sale, if they were not his property, he bought a pair of shoe and knee buckles, to the best of my remembrance it was the prisoner at the bar, and a gold breast buckle.</p>
               <p>Can you upon your oath positively swear that the prisoner was the person? - No Sir, I think it is, but I cannot swear to him, I did not take particular notice of him, I was reckoning up, I do really think it is the same man, I cannot positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>THEODATUS DEAN sworn.</p>
               <p>Confirmed his son's account, but could not swear to the buckles nor the prisoner.</p>

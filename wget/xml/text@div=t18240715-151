               <p>"Carlile" is over the door: I do not know if there is any other name. I went there on Monday, the 31st of last May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner in the shop - I went there again between twelve and one: the prisoner was there then; he was alone, behind the counter each time; I asked if he had got</p>
               <p>"Palmer's principles of Nature;" he said he had, and the price was a sovereign - I said that was more than I was authorized to give: I understood it was 4 s.: he said the regular price was 2 s., but they would not sell it to any person but Mr. Carlile's friends, or some person belonging to the concern for less than a sovereign, for they had so many Bow-street officers, and what they call patroles coming in different characters, that they scarcely knew who was who: I said I hoped he did not think I was coming to lay an information - he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I don't suppose you are." I told him it was a commission I had from the country; he asked what part of the country I came from; I said, Lincolnshire - he said he had only come from Spalding a few days before - I said I knew little about Spalding:</p>
               <p>"I never was there" he said,</p>
               <p>"what part might you come from?" I told him a village near Market Raisin - he said he knew very little of Market Raisin; I said it was a village named Claxon - he said he knew Claxon very well, and had been there several times: he then said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose I must let you have it, and risk it" - he reached down the book from a shelf behind him, and gave it to me; I put it into my pocket, and put him down 2 s.: this is the book (producing it) - I marked it before it went out of my possession. He said,</p>
               <p>"If there is an information, we will immediately raise them to 5 l." I am positive the prisoner is the man who sold it to me. I wrote on it</p>

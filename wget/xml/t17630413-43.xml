               <p>Each indictment charged them, that in order to induce the Jury to believe the charge against Capt. Bolton, they swore, that the said Bolton did lick and beat the said Morgan (who told the captain, he was lame of his arm, and could not do as ordered) and forced him up upon the mizzen top-sail-yard, from whence he fell upon the main brace, and received such hurt by the beating and fall he never did a day's duty afterwards. There were other averments in the indictment, but this the Jury more particularly went upon.</p>
               <p>After the copy of the record of the trial and acquital of Capt. Bolton was read, T. Gurney, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130027"></xptr> short-hand writer, deposed as follows: That he attended the sessions as usual; that Luthwait on that trial deposed, that Capt. Bolton drove the deceased Morgan up upon the mizen-top-sail-yard by licking, which he explained to be beating him up the shrouds, with a rattan made of cane woulded round with tar-twine; that Morgan made application to the captain, that he had lost the use of his hand, and was not able to go up; that he fell down upon the main brace, by which means he got a hurt on his loins, that he saw a scar there afterwards, and that he never did any duty after that, being quite incapable from that fall and the other usage that he had had.</p>
               <p>And on the trial of Simpson, he, the short-hand writer, deposed: That Simpson, on the trial of Capt. Bolton, swore, that Capt. Bolton did lick Morgan with a rattan, because he was not able to do his duty; that he wanted him to go upon the top of the mizen-top-sail-yard; that the deceased said he was not able, and if he chose to beat him he must, so he did lick him up, from whence he fell against a rope; that he complained afterwards of some bruises he had received, and never did a day's duty afterwards; and that Morgan had spoke of his arm being lame, and the captain knew of his being lame of it, notwithstanding which he forced him up.</p>

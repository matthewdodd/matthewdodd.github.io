I went home and came back again, and then I saw the man who is dead; this other good woman. and her husband, went away; I took my loaf off the table, and wished them a good night; and he said, are you a going already, Peg? and I said, yes, Jem; with that, he said, Peg, I have got a job or two for you to do; with that, I turned back again to do the job.</p>

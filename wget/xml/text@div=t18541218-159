On the night of 27th Nov., the last witness broke a half crown, and gave me the pieces—the prisoner was standing at the bar, and the witness said he had paid it him—finding that was bad I went to the till; I found only one half crown there—I showed it to the barman, and then broke it in two pieces—I had got one piece of the second half crown that was taken, and the prisoner took the larger piece of it, and he ran out with it while I was breaking the one that I took from the till—he was secured, and given into custody—I gave the three pieces that were left to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to the Magistrates at Rochester-row Police-court, Westminster—on 14th August the prisoner summoned the prosecutor, Richard Bowden, to the police-court—I produce the original summons calling on him to appear on Wednesday next (after 7th August) to answer a charge of assaulting Ann Ewins—that was granted on a statement made by the prisoner to the Magistrate—on 14th August I was acting as clerk to the Magistrate sitting in Westminster police-court—the summons came to be heard on that day—the prisoner was the complaining party—she was sworn—I took down in writing the evidence that she gave (<hi rend="italic">Reading</hi>: "Ann Ewins. I am the wife of Edward Ewins; he is a labourer; I live at 3, Gillingham-street; on the 6th of this month, in the afternoon, I went to sit with the defendant's wife; the defendant came in and said to me, 'You b----y cow, if you do not go I will make you,' and he struck me on the forehead with his fist; I ran out and he followed me on to the landing and beat me about the head, and then I ran out into the street, and he followed me there and kicked me in the side.")</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Wilton-row, Pimlico, and am a coach painter—I was summoned to the Westminster Police-court on 14th August last, for an assault on the defendant—I saw the oath administered to her—the case was dismissed—I have heard the evidence, that she stated that on 6th August I assaulted her in the street, and kicked her on the side—I swear that that is false—I remained in my house at that time—I did not strike her outside the house at all—I have no vindictive feeling whatever—the prisoner complained to me the next day in the street, of the assault.</p>

                  </hi>. On 31st August I was a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, in quarters at Woolwich—the prisoner Anderson was my military servant, and Brown was the servant of Lieutenant Augustus Lavie, an officer in the same service as myself, and having quarters at the same barracks—on 31st August I went away from my quarters, and returned on 12th September—I did not find my place in charge of my servant as I had left it, he had gone—I had to gain admission through the window, and on getting in I found some of my property gone—I missed a tunic, two jackets, a pair of overalls, a gold-lace pouch belt, and sword belt, several spoons and forks, and a tea-pot, a regimental frock coat, a suit of clothes, a coat and waistcoat, several shirts and collars, two pairs of boots, a pair of shoes, a finger ring, and several other articles, with a large uniform tin case, value together about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen a few shirts and a coat since—Lieutenant Lavie is on his way to India—I did not see him sail, but I know he must have gone, he was under orders to go—he is no longer in Woolwich or in London—my name was on my tin case, on a brass plate—I am not sure about my Christian name, but my surname was on in full—the suit of clothes mentioned were used by Anderson as my servant, but they were my property.</p>

I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery, and one of the military police, stationed at Woolwich—at 7 o'clock on Tuesday evening, 8th September, I went on duty at the dockyard railway Station—about half-past 9 I saw the prisoners there in Company—they had two tin boxes with them, a large one and a small one—I might know the large one again if I saw it—they spoke to me—Brown told me they were going to meet their masters in London—he said that in the hearing of Anderson—I knew Anderson as Lieutenant Douglas's servant—I saw the porter, Thomas Angell, carry the boxes down the platform—the large box was a square one, brown, and the smaller one was the same colour, I think.</p>

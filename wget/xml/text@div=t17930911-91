               <p>On the 27th of May last, I paid a bank note of the value of a hundred pounds, No. 8,594 to Mr. Chapman, in his counting house; the transaction took up some time, as I had considerable change to take, and when he had done I left the counting-house, and he left the bank note on the bridge of his desk and went out; the desk stands in the counting house, the counting house is a slip taken out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the desk stand so as any body might see the note in the street? - I should think so; it was about a yard and a half from the street; Mr. Chapman had taken down a tin box to give me the change, but whether he put the note there again I am not sure, he put it under a weight on the desk; I then left the desk, and he followed me out of the counting house, but I do not recollect whether he went with me to the street or not; I was returning home from the house of commons about four o'clock that same afternoon, and Mr. Chapman asked me if I could furnish him with the number of the note? I told him I could, and gave it him, No. 8,594.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110157"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. Did you do that from a memorandum? - I did. As I paid the notes away I wrote down on the original memorandum that I made of the notes when I received them, the parties to whom I paid the bank note, and I can swear to the bank notes from the memorandum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. I understand it is this, on paying the bank note, you made that memorandum you have now about you? - No, I have only a copy of it.</p>

               <p>Q Did you receive a bank note of Mr. Fludyer on the 27th of May? - I did; as soon as I received the note I put it into a tin box, among a number of other notes, while I was giving Mr. Fludyer change I put this tin box with the notes on the ridge of the desk; when I had given him the change he went out and then the men came in, I don't know whether they were five or six, they engaged my attention by asking for many things which we did not deal in, and particularly engaged my attention, and stood close by the counter, and I believe it might take up about ten minutes when these men went out; and then I returned to the counting house, and looked at the tin box on the desk, and found it was empty of its contents, not the whole of its contents, but part of its contents, about seventeen hundred and twenty pounds; there was a bank note of a hundred pounds; there were bills and notes to the amount of seventeen hundred and twenty pounds; I sent some of my men out a little while, but I found that was of no consequence; I took my bill book down, and took the number of them all, and went away immediately to Bow-street, I have not traced the bank note as yet; I heard of it on the King's birth day; I then went to Bow-street, and I had no knowledge of the prisoner's person; this was between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose dwelling house is this? - I live in the dwelling house; it is the partnership account.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose dwelling house is it? - Mine only. Mr. Rutten lives in Parliament-street.</p>

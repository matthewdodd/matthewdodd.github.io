                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Searle, who keeps the George public-house in Crown-street, Soho. On Saturday, 11th June, the prisoner came into the house about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—she asked for a pennyworth of gin—I served her—she paid me with a shilling—I gave her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the shilling in the till with other money—the prisoner left the house—she returned in about half an hour and asked for a pennyworth of gin, and paid me with another shilling, and I gave her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put that second shilling in the same till as the other—after the prisoner had left the house the second time I cleared the till and found I had in it two bad shillings—I placed them apart from the good money—the prisoner came in again in about half an hour afterwards, and asked for a pennyworth of gin—she drank it, and paid me again with a shilling—I gave her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and put that third shilling in the till—I had then five single shillings in the till; they were what I had kept, after having given change for a sovereign to a customer—I am positive they were good—I had no other shilling in the till except those five good ones—after the prisoner was gone the third time my husband opened the till and called my attention to a shilling—I examined it and found it to be bad—I bent it in the detector and put it by itself—the prisoner came in a fourth time, about 6 o'clock, for a pennyworth of gin—I drew the gin but did not give it her—I asked her for her money—she tendered me a shilling—I took it in my hand and looked at it, and told her it was bad; and I said, "I waited to see if you would come again; this is the fourth bad shilling you have given me to-day"—I said to my husband, "This is the old woman that gave me the bad money to-day, and she has brought another"—the prisoner said she did not know it was bad, and asked me to give it her back—I said, "No."—my husband asked her where she-lived, and she said, "Where I stand"—I sent for a constable and gave him the four bad shillings—I had pre<lb></lb>viously marked the last two.</p>

I took the prisoner, and received from the last witness these four counterfeit shillings—the prisoner said it was the first time she had been there that day—I asked her her address, and she made no reply—I have not been able to ascertain where she lives—she said she did not know the money was bad.</p>

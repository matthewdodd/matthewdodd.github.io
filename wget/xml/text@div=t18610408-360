                  </hi>. I am turned 14 years old—I am in the employment of Mr. Cook, and drove a van for him—he carries on business in Cumberland-street, Hackney-road—on 15th February, about 10 minutes to 6, I was with the van in Church-row, Bethnal-green—it contained six sacks of flour belonging to Mr. Pratt, of Hackney-road—my master had charge of it—I had been at the railway-station and saw the prisoner in Church-row—he asked me whether I came from the pastern Counties Railway—I said, "Yes"—he told me to go back to Mr. Casey and get the right order; that I had got the wrong order—I had seen Mr. Casey at the station—the prisoner told me he would mind the van while I went back, and I left him with it and went back to the railway to Mr. Casey, but he was not there—I then went to the policeman at the gate, who sent me to the station—I then vent to where the van had been, and it was gone—I then went to Spital-square station; I did not find it there, but by the time I had gone back and told Mr. Cook it was at Spital-square—I found it there just upon 7 o'clock—two sacks were gone out of it and four were left—I had had six—this was on Friday, and I saw the prisoner in custody at Spital-square on the next Friday—I picked him out—he was with two more men—I am positive he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ladies' shoemaker, and live in Matilda-street, Commercial-road. On the evening of the 2nd of March, I was in a public-house in Osborne-street, Whitechapel, about eleven o'clock—while I was there, the prisoner came in with another man—he and I got into conversation about the county of Kent, for about twenty mi<lb></lb>nutes, or it might be half-an-hour—we left the house together—I went away with both of them, walking one on each side of me—we went to the Bell, opposite to Whitechapel church, and had a quartern or a quartern and a half of rum—we had a glass each—I had not taken any spirits till I was in Osborne-street—I was rather the worse for liquor when I left the Bell, but knew perfectly what I was about—I walked arm-in-arm with them into Cannon-street-road, and there the one not in custody tried my fob, for my watch—my trowsers being tight he could not get it—I tried to get from them, but the prisoner held me tight, by my right arm—we went on about half a dozen yards, and then I was knocked down by the other man—the blow stunned me—when I recovered, I found my watch gone, and the prisoner standing by me declaring his innocence—I called out, "Watch" and "Police"—mine was a silver watch with a double case—it cost seven guineas when new—it was jewelled—I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken up last Tuesday week, I think—it was about ten days after the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Tovee, a carpenter, in Gould-street, Spitalfields. On this Sunday night, I went into the public-house—I saw the prosecutor standing at the bar—while he was there the prisoner came in, and another man with him—I heard them begin talking about Kent, and I observed them for some reason—I had seen the prisoner and the other man together about a week before—I saw them leave the house, and followed, to watch them—I saw them go to the Bell, opposite White<lb></lb>chapel church—I saw them come out and walk up Mile-end-road, into Cannon-street-road, arm-in-arm, the prosecutor was in the middle—I saw the man who is at large, strike the prosecutor at the side of the head—he fell—and directly he struck him, the man ran across the road—I saw him putting something in his pocket, and I directly hallooed, "Stop thief,"—he ran down towards the back of the London Hospital—I could not catch him—I went on Monday, and saw Gardener talking to two girls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, after you could not catch the prisoner, did you come back to the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was then gone—I saw the prisoner next day—I went to the station-house directly, and gave information—I took two policemen to a house where I thought he was gone, but could not find him—on Fri<lb></lb>day week, I saw Gardener standing outside the Horns, and the prisoner was there with him, in the Horns, at Shoreditch—I ran to a policeman, who came, and Gardener was then gone—I went in search of the prisoner, who had gone out the back way—we found him in the back court of the public-house, and he was taken into custody.</p>

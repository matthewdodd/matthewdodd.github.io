On the 7th of December, about ten minutes to three o'clock in the afternoon, I left the house, leaving nobody in it; I locked the door, took the key in my pocket, and left all safe - I came back at half-past three, and found the lock had been hampered; I went up stairs, and the drawer this property was in was broken open, and placed on the table - seven sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, four crowns, and some sixpences were in a blue bag, and the rest was in a drawer - I missed all the property stated; every drawer was opened, and all my clothes about the room, but none of them taken - Lea, the officer, showed me next day some silver, and I could identify one shilling which was cut, as when I took it I doubted its being a good one; and there was another dark shilling which I believe to be mine, but cannot swear to that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen the shilling before the prisoners were examined? A. They were examined between two and three o'clock, and in the evening I saw the shilling.</p>

            . I live next door to Mrs. Wasem. On the 7th of December, after she went out, I heard a noise at her door - I opened my own door, looked out, and seeing nobody near I went in and shut the door, and a few minutes afterwards I heard it again; I then went and tried her door, and it was fast - I went in again, and thought I heard it pulled too; I got up, looked out, and saw two men in the court, going different ways, one towards Whitechapel-road, and the other to Montague-street - I then went and found her door open, and gave an alarm; I believe the male prisoner to be one of the men - I will not positively swear to him; it was soon after three o'clock, and rather a darkish day; the lamps were not lighted - one was a tall man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Your court is rather narrow? A.

            . I live in Green Dragon-yard. I was cleaning our windows, and saw a man come down as far as No. 7. so that he could see the prosecutor's house; he returned, and leaned against a post, until a man exactly like the male prisoner came up to him - he was exactly his stature, but I did not see his face; he appeared to have something heavy in his pockets, and it seemed as if there was white paper at the top of his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not rather a foggy afternoon? A. Yes, rather - his pockets were outside; I did not take particular notice of the other man - the men spoke to each other, and both went away together.</p>

            . I live seven doors from the prosecutor. About a quarter of an hour before I heard of this robbery. I went through the court, and saw two persons standing in the court - and as I returned, I saw one about twenty yards from Mrs. Wasem's house, and one at the end; the one up the court made a sign to the one at the end - the male prisoner resembles the one who stood about twenty yards from the house, but I cannot swear to him; I never saw a man more like him - I did not see his face, for when I came up the court, he put his hand to his face; I did not take particular notice, but he resembles the prisoner exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was either of them leaning against a post? A. No, the prisoner who was nearest to the house leaned against the wall - it was rather foggy, but light enough for me to see if I had had suspicion, but I had none.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Donovan in Albion-street, at a house of ill-fame, on the next morning; I believe the house was kept by the prisoner Davis; he was in bed, and she was in the room - she took a woman's pocket off the bed he was lying on, and wrapped it up; I took it from her, and found in it four half-crowns, fourteen shillings, and five sixpences - there was a particular shilling among it; I found in Donovan's trousers pocket twenty shillings, ten sixpences, two half-crowns, and half a sovereign, and in his waistcoat pocket a piece of wax candle - there was one shilling in the trousers pocket, with a mark on it, which the prosecutrix spoke to - he said he got part of the money at a collection which had been made for some man; he afterwards said he got it at gambling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you inquired if he had made a collection? A. Yes - I found a collection had been made for a poor man; the shilling the prosecutrix swears to by a mark was in Donovan's pocket - two other men were taken up on this charge; one is under examination now; he is a tallish man; the third was discharged - I know Donovan lives with Davis.</p>
               <p>MRS. WASEM (looking at the shilling.) This shilling is the dark shilling - it looks like mine; I am sure it had been among my money; I can swear to this other shilling, the cut one - I will not swear to the one found in the man's trousers pocket - the other is as much like the dark one as can be - I had had the marked shilling about eight days before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The shilling found in the man's trousers you have no mark on? A. No; but you might see one hundred, and none like it - it is dirt, which I tried to rub off, but could not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What is there remarkable in the dark shilling? A. I do not think this is the shilling.</p>
               <p>Donovan's Defence. A poor man in the hospital was going to have his leg taken off; the money was gathered for him - I was to take it him the day I was taken up.</p>

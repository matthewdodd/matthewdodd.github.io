On Sunday, the 19th of September, as the clock was striking eleven, I saw the prisoner with a companion - he was two or three minutes in my sight; I saw two gentlemen walking arm-in-arm, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from the gentleman who was nearest the wall - both the gentlemen turned round, and felt in their pockets; I told the gentleman he was robbed - I attempted to seize both the men, but they made their escape; the prisoner ran across Farringdon-street, round the obelisk, and up Holborn-bridge - I sprung my rattle, and called Stop thief! the gentleman was robbed near the Angel Inn - I had never seen either of those gentlemen before; I lost sight of them in consequence of pursuing the prisoners - this prisoner was stopped by a baker, and was never out of my sight - he was given up to me with the handkerchief; he said nothing to me - I gave him to another watchman, and went to look for the gentlemen, but they were gone; I have never seen them since - the prisoner was searched at the watch-house, but nothing found on him.</p>

            . I am a baker. I did not see the pocket picked - I stood at my master's door, on Holborn-bridge; I heard the watchman's rattle, and a cry of Stop thief! - I saw the prisoner running from Farringdon-street towards Field-lane, and opposite my master's shop window, he threw this handkerchief from his right-hand under the window; there was a cry of Stop theif! after him, but no one then accused him of stealing the handkerchief - I laid hold of him, and held him till the watchman came up; I saw the handkerchief picked up by a person, and given to the watchman - I am sure it was the same that he threw away; he said nothing - I did not see the gentleman who belonged to it.</p>

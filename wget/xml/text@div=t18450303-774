                  </hi>. I am assistant to my brother Edward, who lives in High-street, Southwark. I saw this piece of calico outside his door, with this ticket on it, about five o'clock on the 6th of Feb.—we did not miss it till the officer sent for us about seven.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live at No. 9, Maze-pond. 1 was walking in the Borough about seven o'clock that evening, and saw Barnard have hold of this piece of calico, looking at it, which caused me to watch him—then he let it go, and Winch took hold of it—they walked from the shop-door two or three times, till the door-way was clear, and then Winch took it—I followed them through Red-cross-alley, and on to Castle-street, where 1 found an officer, and gave them in charge—Winch asked me what for—I said, "I want that piece of calico you have"—she took it from under her shawl and gave it me—Barnard had been in conversation with her all the time.</p>

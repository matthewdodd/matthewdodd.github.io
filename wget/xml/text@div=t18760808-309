I live at Manor House, Harlsden, Willesden—about 11 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 5th July, I went into a field about 40 yards from the prisoner's house, and saw the body of a woman in a pond, I ran and got a rake and called assistance and pulled the body out, she was quite dead—the grass had been cut, but it was long round the edges of the pond—I could not see any footmarks, I looked where I thought the woman might go in, but could not see any marks of a struggle or any marks where a person could have gone in.</p>

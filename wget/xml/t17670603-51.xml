               <p>T. Hand. She keeps a private house, a winehouse; she and I went down to Newmarket races together;

             having mentioned Mr. Swinner's name, Mrs. Harrison was offended at her: Mr Swinner came down stairs and said, what have you mentioned my name for, and hit her a slap on the face, she fell down; I went and got some brandy to dress her head, and put a bit of lint into it; I thought she was in a fit; we laid her on the bed, and the last time I went to look at her, I found her dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pott. I was sent for to examine the body of

            ; being informed she had received a blow on the head, I inspected it, and found a small wound, the scalp was just divided; I removed the scalp in order to see if the skull had received any injury, that had received none at all, not in the smallest degree: I then removed the skull and examined the membrane that covered the brain, which was unhurt, there was no apparent appearance of any external violence; I removed the membrane and examined the brain, there was no appearance there of any external violence. The next morning I received a letter from the Coroner, signifying the Jury were not satisfied with the examination of the head only, but desired I would examine the whole body, imagining she might receive some injury on some other part; I examined the body very carefully, both belly and breast, and indeed her whole frame; in the cavity of the thorax was a very large quantity of water; there was such an appearance, as implied a very irregular intemperate course of life.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the fall was the occasion of her death?</p>
               <p>Pott. There was no apparent reason why she should die of the fall. I have great reason to think she had lived a very intemperate life, and that a disease was brought on herself by intemperance, which was the cause of her death.</p>

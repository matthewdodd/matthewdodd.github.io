On the 8th of September 1814, there was 40l. standing, in the names of Mary Maquire and Bridget Mulhern. There appears to have been an alteration in the name of Maquire to M'Quire. There was an affidavit made, in consequence of which, it was altered.</p>

            . I am a stock-broker.(holding the stock receipt). I purchased the stock to which this refers. There is the name of Maquire in it. The prisoner brought me this stock receipt; she told me, that previous to her bringing it to me, she had been to the Bank with it, and had presented it to some of the Bank Gentlemen, and that they sent her to the office, her name being wrong; she said, her name was wrong, and that she wished to have her money (which she told me she had paid) immediately, for she was fearful of losing it. The prisoner was a long time at my office, and was extremely clamarous, which made me notice her. She requested me to alter her name from Maquire to M'Quire, in consequence of which, I directed my clerk to draw out an affidavit. I had a great deal of difficulty to satisfy her, that the money was safe. This is the affidavit, (looking at it.). I had a great deal of difficulty to get her to leave the receipt, in order that I might draw up the affidavit - She was unwilling to leave it. She did leave it, and about four days after, she came, and brought a person with her, to sell 12l. out of the 40l. stock. I should not know the other person again. I am sure, that the prisoner is the person that came to me, and the person for when I get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190028"></xptr>the alteration made. I had bought the stock originally.

I went to the Bank with them, for the purpose of transfering 12l. stock, it was done. I saw her again in October 1815; there was another woman with her - I do not know whether it was the same, or not. I went to the Bank with them then, they both went with me for the purpose of transfering 28l. stock, which was done; then, as witness, I saw the name and the mark made-one of them wrote M'Guire, and the other made a mark. The money for the stock was paid at our office. I do not know whether I saw it paid, or not. They went back with me to the office after they made the transfer. I am sure, the prisoner is the person - I have not the smallest doubt of it.</p>

            , Owen Mulhern, and Bridget Mulhern, his wife-(producing it).</p>
               <p>MARY MAQUIRE. I am a widow, and live in Kent-street, Borough. I know Bridget Mulhern. In September 1814, I went with her to the Bank. We went to Mr. Rumford's office, and saw him; we gave him 40l. and he gave us 2l. out of it. He went out. We waited there till he came back. He gave us a paper, (looking at the stock receipt), I believe that is it, he gave it into Mulhern's hand - We went home immediately. When we got home, we sewed the receipt up in a green gown lining by the consent of each-it was Mulhern's gown. We sewed it up immediately, and in about six months after, we put it into a trunk, and pledged the trunk with Mr. Barber on the 18th of March 1815 - He is a pawnbroker, and lives opposite St. George's Church, in the Borough. The next day I went to Scotland, and got in trouble there, and got into the county gaol at Sterling. When I was there, I desired somebody to write a letter for Bridget Mulhern, and ordered it to be directed to Swain. He passed as the prisoner's husband. I had lodged with the prisoner a few days before I went to Scotland. I returned to London about the 9th of March, and went to Mr. Barber's. I went first to look for the prisoner, and found she was gone away. I afterwards went to Barber, the pawnbroker, and found Bridget Mulhern's box was not there, nor my own either, (my own trunk had been pledged there also). I did not go to the Bank after the time that I bought the stock in with Mulhern. I never sold out any of the stock. I did not see the prisoner from the time that I went Scotland till she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not write to me to go to the Bank and sell the money - A. Never. I did not give her any authority to sell the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you write to me, to send a letter to Mulhern, when you know she was in Middlewich gaol - A. I did not know it then. I went into goal to her, about two years ago. Before I went to Scotland, I sent to the prisoner to tell Mulhern, that I was in custody, and wanted some money and clothes. I desired the person who wrote the letter for me, to tell her to go to my sister, meaning

             - She is not my sister, but I call her so. He wrote to her, that as soon as she received the letter, to go to Barber's and get the trunk and clothes, as the money was enclosed in the trunk. I enclosed the duplicate of her trunk in the letter. She knew that the receipt of my money was in the trunk. The duplicate of my trunk, and three 1l. notes were also in her trunk; she was to take the receipt out, and go to the stock-broker's to see if he would give her the interest of my part of the money that was in the Bank-there was one year's interest due. She was to send it to me, with three pounds, which the prisoner owed me. I had lent it to her in the presence of Mulhern; she was to send them to me with some clothes. After I had left Mulhern in custody, I had not seen or heard of her; she was taken into custody for passing as a soldier's wife, and taking their travelling charge. They would not take bail for her. This was five months after I had wrote to her. I had wrote to the prisoner to tell her of the trouble that I had got into; and she wrote to me, to say, that she thought Mulhern would be in town soon. I was in gaol for being in company with women, who called themselves soldier's widows, and drew money under false pretences. I was in custody eight months. I had been there four months, before I wrote the letter. I came to town when I was liccrated; I was acquitted of the charge. I walked to town, except occasionally geting a lift. I had no money sent me from England after I wrote the letter for the money. I was obliged to be relieved by the different parishes that I came through.</p>

            . I joined with the last witness in putting some money into the Bank. I am a soldier's wife. I am the person who applied to Mr. Rumford, to have the money put into the Bank. I never went to transfer it, nor did I make a mark, or sign my name, to have it transferred. I was not at the Bank in October, 1815. I went to the stock-broker's in 1815, to enquire for my money, if it was drawn out, it was after I had been to the pawnbroker's. I went to Mr. Barber's, in October, 1815, where the receipt had been pledged in my trunk, it was stitched up in the lining of my gown, and put in my box. I kept the key of my box myself. I went to him to enquire for my box; he told me, that Swain had been and released it. I went to Swain's house with Mary Matthews; it was in Kent-street, Borough-the prisoner met me at the door. I asked her, if she had got my trunk; she said, she had got it. The other witness had not a key of it. I desired her to let me see it; she took me up stairs, and shewed it to me. It was shut down, but the lock was broke open, there was nothing in it. I asked her where my property and clothes were; she said, she was in distress and had taken the liberty of pawning my clothes, but would immediately get them for me. I asked her, if she had seen the receipt of the bank, or the duplicate of Maquire's trunk, or if she had taken it out of the green gown; she said, she had. I asked her to give it to me; she said, she would not; for she had had a letter from Mary Maquire to secure her property, and that she would produce nothing until Maquire came forward. I told her, I would go to the Bank, and that she would be made to produce it. She saw I was determined to go to the Bank, and she then confessed, that she had drawn the money out, she said, "I unfortunately signed Maquire's name-do not go to the Bank, I 
               <persName id="t18170219-58-person529">drew</persName>
             the money," she said, she might as well confess the truth to me. I said nothing to her about telling me, she confessed of her own accord. I asked her, how she could do that, when nobody could take the money out but us two; who went to the Bank together. She said, the stock-broker saw no more in her face than he did in Maquire's, and that he did not know the difference. I had received no letter from Maquire containing the duplicate; I asked her, to let me see the letter; but she would not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not lodge with me till February, at different times - A. I did live with her sometimes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you lodge with her before you knew that she had sold the stock, or after - A.Before and after.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lodge in her house after you knew she had sold the stock - A. I had no where else to live; she told me, I might live with her until she could make up the money, and until her husband's quarterly pension came due; she said, she would pay me 10l. in hand, and the rest the next pension day; I told her as she had taken it out of the Bank, she must put it in again, and Maquire would come forward; I told her I would not consent to taking it back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Have you not received 4l. 14s. 9d. of the first payment - A. Not a farthing - I told her I could not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not leave your son at my house, while you went to Hastings - A. Yes, and agreed to pay 5s. per week for him. I returned before the week expired. I never was in Carlise gaol.</p>
               <p>MARY MATTHEWS. I know Bridget Mulhern, and the prisoner. I went with Mulhern to the prisoner's, in October, 1815, we saw her; she told Mulhern, that she had unfortunately signed Maquire's name, and drawn the money out. Mulhern had asked her, where the check was belonging to the money, and she made that answer. Mulhern also asked her about her clothes and trunk; she said, that she had

             the money out, but that she would pay 10l. in hand at pension time.; Mulhern said, that she could not take the money, but she must pay it to the Bank till Maquire came forward; that was all that passed in my presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell Mulhern in your presence, that Maquire had wrote to me, that there was 3l. in her trunk, but Mr. Barber had seen that there was only 2l. - A. I believe she did; the prisoner said, that Maquire had wrote to her, to secure her property.</p>

The prisoner applied for it several times, she brought a letter; we would not give it up to her, until she brought the duplicate. She brought a letter in her hand; I did not take any notice of it, but told her it would not be delivered without the duplicate was produced. She applied four or five times, and at last produced the duplicate, and the box was delivered. I saw it opened, there was some money in it; I cannot say how much. I think the trunk was broken open-there was 2l. in it, and perhaps more.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Old Belton-street, Long-Acre. Some time after the 22d of December, 1815,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190030"></xptr>the prisoner sent for me. I know it was December, because my husband came home that month, it was after he came home. The prisoner's husband fetched me; I went to her - She put on her things, and we went out together. I asked her, where she was going; as we were walking along, she said, she had received a letter with a Bank paper in it, authorizing her to draw part of the money from the Bank and send it to them, as they were in great distress, and that they were in gaol; she said, they were acquaintances of her's, she neither mentioned their names nor shewed me the letter. We went to the stock-broker's; she said, if they should ask for my name, I was to say, it was Bridget Mulhern. We went to the Bank with the stock-broker's clerk; she said, that she had been to obtain it, but could not get it without a second person being present - We went to the Bank. A gentleman took down a book, and asked me if I could write; I told him that I could not - He then wrote in the book, and desired me to make a mark; I did so, and drew back from the counter. I do not know what passed afterwards. I was afraid that some other questions might be asked, that I could not answer. The prisoner introduced me to the stock-broker as Bridget Mulhern. The gentleman did not ask me any questions. Some months before that, I had lent the prisoner 7l. - she paid me 3l. of it on that day. I have had nothing for this business. She told me it was out of kindness to the poor woman in gaol, and would be of no consequence to me, because what she had said was a fact. In October I went again; she said, she was going to draw the remainder of the money out, and when she saw the women she would give it to them; we went every way as before. She said, she would give the money to the women with as much advantage as if it had been in the Bank. She introduced me again as Mulhern, and we went to the Bank and signed the book as before, (looking at the Transfer Ledger) it was a large book like this. I always make a mark like this, when I take my husband's money. I will not swear that it is my mark. I saw the money paid to the prisoner each time, but do not know how much it was.</p>
               <p>(Transfer, and Stock receipt, put in and read).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Maquire wrote me a letter and stiled me her sister, desiring me to take her trunk out of pawn, to take care of the Bank receipt, and to go to the Bank and draw her dividend, and send her 5l. to employ a counsellor, which I did. The duplicate was enclosed in the letter. Mulhern came to me, and asked me, if Maquire had not sent me the duplicate of her trunk; I told her, yes. She had received 4l. 14s. 9d. towards her share, and was satisfied that I should pay it off so.</p>

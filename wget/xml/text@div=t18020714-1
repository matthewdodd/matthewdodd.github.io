I came to the chambers very soon after nine in the morning, and about half-past nine, I 
               <persName id="t18020714-1-person53">drew</persName>
             a draft upon Messrs. Gosling, for 209l. 11s. to pay the draft; I put the draft upon the desk before the prisoner, desiring him to go at four o'clock, and not before, to Messrs. Gosling and Sharpe's, to take the money and carry it to Esdailes' to take up the draft that had been presented at my chambers; I then went to the House of Commons, and returned between five and six in the afternoon; the prisoner was not at the chambers, nor ever returned after.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the draft you drew upon Goslings and Sharpe's? -

            Had you sent the prisoner with drafts to your banker's before this? - A. Yes, to a small amount. I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at Bow-street, on the 3d of June, in custody; his dress was then totally changed, and his hair cut off, which made a very material difference in his appearance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You have said, you intrusted me with drafts for small sums - did you not send me into the city to receive a bill for 250l.? - A. The question put to me was, as to sending him to my bankers; I certainly did send him into the city, with a draft of 250l. which he brought me back, and another time with 160 or 170l. that I think was two days before this happened.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, that you could not swear to my person? - A. I said, he was so disguised, that I was not certain.</p>

            (To Davis.) Was that one of the numbers that was given him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Atkins. He told me the next morning where his lodgings were; I went there, and found thirteen guineas, twenty half-guineas and sixteen seven-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140004"></xptr>shilling pieces; he told me he had got the guineas, half-guineas, and seven-shilling pieces in change for the notes he had received from the bankers, or Bank, I am not sure which; he said, he was always afraid of carrying them about him, except of an evening when he employed girls of the town to get them changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from him any directions respecting any box in London? - A. I did, at Bow-street; in consequence of which, I went to Southampton, and got the box; I found in it two 10l. Bank-notes, No. 8632, and 8633, and also two 5l. Bank-notes, No. 8720, and 8725.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not detained from me my box, and a gold watch? - A.

               <p>Prisoner. Before I make my defence, I submit to your Lordship, that the prosecutor being an attorney, my case comes within the description of a breach of trust; the act expresses merchants, bankers and tradesmen, and Mr. Benbow cannot be considered either as a tradesman, a banker, or a merchant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The act says, bankers, merchants, and others.</p>

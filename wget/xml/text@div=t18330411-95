            , and Mr. Evans was one of the executors; I had authority to receive money on account of that estate; the prisoner received some as my clerk, and it was his business to account to me for it; he from time to time furnished me with accounts of what he received; about January, 1832, I was called to give an account of my receipts, and the prisoner made out this account of 143l. 7s. 5d.; I believe I had received but two of these sums, which are here included; he drew out these other sums as being due, stating that Mr. Parry owed the estate 2l. 12s. 8d. and 3l. 3s. 2d.; he said Mr. Parry had a set-off against these sums, and they could not be paid; in January, 1832 Mrs. Berridge called on me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. I believe the prisoner had received a great deal of money for you? A.Not a great deal - he is married, and has three or four children.</p>
               <p>MR. PARRY. I paid the prisoner on the 22nd of October, 1831, 3l. 3s. 2d. on account of Mr. Holborn - he gave me this receipt for it; it was for the estate of Berridge and Evans.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLBORN. This receipt is in the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I expected Mr. Holborn would have called Mrs. Berridge, the widow, as he is aware from her own statement, that within a fortnight after I received these sums of money, she knew I had received them; and I told her I would pay her them when she called for them - she said very well, and I believe she waited on Mr. Holborn, as I told her when she wanted, to come to me; Mr. Holborn knows that I found three or four blank receipts in the name of Thomas Norman, which I could have received and defied the conviction - he says that I have received some money, but not much; he did not tell you that I had to collect 2000l. in one account, and he knows it was all collected right - he sent me out repeatedly with blank receipts, which I might have filled up; I had a wife and six children depending on the guinea a week I received from him - I was always at his office from nine o'clock in the morning till eight, nine, ten, or eleven o'clock at night; the reason I said there was a set-off against these sums was, because I had told Mrs. Berridge that I had received them.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLBORN. These receipts are in the prisoner's hand-writing - I shall have to make the money good.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

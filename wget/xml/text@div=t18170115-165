            . I am a cork merchant. On the 17th of January, I sold the prosecutor thirteen bundles of cork, it was put in my warehouse, some of it being stolen, I sent for the prisoner, Robinson, I afterwards saw him burning cork behind the London Hospital, another man was with him; I told him, it was the cork that I had lost, and asked him where he got it, and who he bought it from; he said he bought it of me; and after some hesitation, he said, it was the cork of the Francis ship; I said, it was the Eliza cork, it was a different sort from the Francis, and that he only bought two bundles of the Francis; he said, he had three bundles of the Francis, and this was the best of it; I told him, I could not believe but it was my cork, and I found a piece, and told him, it could not be the Francis's cork; they still persisted in burning it, and the other man said, it was a piece which he had cut a fortnight ago; I said, it was the Eliza cork, and that it was fresh cut. Robinson advised me to let the matter rest for a few days, and I should be more likely to find it out. I described the cork to my son, and told him to go and search all round to the cork-cutters; they were burning it near Prettie's house. I went to Prettie's house with the last witness about half an hour afterwards, and we found about four hundred weight of cork, laying in a shed there. I saw Pettie coming from his own house with a bag full of the cork, which he put into the shed; I asked him where he got it, and told him that it was taken out of my warehouse; he said, if I would come down into the kitchen, he would shew me the remainder, and tell me all about it; I went with him, he shewed me the cork, and told me, that Robinson had brought it to him about seven o'clock in the morning; he said, he brought seven bundles in a cart, about seven o'clock in the morning; he said, he did not know that it was stolen, I asked him, why he was getting it out of his house; he said, because Robinson had been back within the last half hour, and told him it was stolen, and to get it away; he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Cork is a difficult article to indentify in general. I bought the whole cargo of the Eliza; I have sold cork to Robinson; I did not sell him any of the Eliza cork.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALPOLE. Prettie said, he had it from Robinson; the shed was a great way from his house.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner two years; he lodged in Cloth-fair, in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great; he has since taken a house by Clerkenwell Green. I never knew what business he was of; we were concerned together in the diminishing way.</p>
               <p>Q. What connections had you with him?</p>
               <p>Bacchus. Only a little in the diminishing way; the first I believe was the beginning of last February: we used to diminish guineas; we cut them round with scissars, then filed them round, and then milled them; sometimes I did ten or a dozen, sometimes more.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was this done?</p>
               <p>Bacchus. Five or six times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this house his own?</p>
               <p>Bacchus. He had only a lodging; two little rooms up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlady see you and him together?</p>

               <p>Hansell. On the 26th of March I think; they were unfurnished; there was him and his wife; it was one room forward upon the ground floor, and another room forward on the one pair of stairs; he came in on the Friday following; he was some time down in the country. He was taken at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no furniture in the room?</p>
               <p>Hansell. There were some images there three days before they brought their goods.</p>

            . On the 22d of April, after Bacchus had made his information, I went to Bennet's, knocked at his room door, in Aylesbury-street; I believe they call it Red-Bull-yard; that woman can tell; it was next door to a public house, the Noah's Ark.</p>
               <p>Hansell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Clarke. Searching the room I saw upon the mantle-piece three images; the middle was what they call an angel; I believe I found a paper there; I shewed it the prisoner; I asked him what it was; he said he did not know; I shewed it him and told him it was gold; he said if it was he did not know who put it there; I searched his pocket and found 23 guineas and two half guineas, a 30 l. bank note, and a 10 or 20, I am not certain which, was found in his pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think of searching these images?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Bacchus said the gold was concealed in an image upon the mantle-piece. I have preserved two of the guineas. Then he was carried before a magistrate; he was asked whether the furniture belonged to him; he said the furniture of the room was all his own; after he found it would injure him, he denied the images, and said they were there before he came there. Here is the gold dust and clippings, with the millings upon the edge of it (he produced a paper with gold dust); some of what was in the paper I delivered to Mr. Chamberlayne.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this the original paper?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; I have put it in another because the paper broke; this is an original paper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Stainsby Alcorne. I am assay-master in the Mint: I received some clippings and millings of Mr. Chamberlayne last Saturday; I examined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177306260047"></xptr> them carefully, and upon examination with my eye, they appeared to be clippings of coin, and upon trial with a fire, I found both clippings and millings to be of the standard of the current gold coin of this realm.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they clippings of English or foreign coin?</p>
               <p>Alcorne. I believe them to be English; I believe these to be clippings of guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe so?</p>
               <p>Alcorne. By the milling on the edging; all the milling is preserved. (Clarke produces the two guineas).</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two guineas, have they been diminished?</p>
               <p>Alcorne. Both have been diminished by cutting or filing the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. Done by fraud or wear?</p>
               <p>Alcorne. By fraud; there is an artificial edging put on.</p>
               <p>Q. to Clarke. What did you do with the other 21 guineas?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Delivered them to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two now produced selected from the other as being the smallest and most diminished, or the first that came to hand?</p>
               <p>Clarke. That new guinea was selected particularly.</p>

            's; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>Bates. A publican, and keep an eating house; the prisoner has dined at my house ten or twelve times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had he occasion to take change; five or six times out of the times?</p>
               <p>Bates. May be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever change him a guinea?</p>
               <p>Bates. Yes, and once or twice half a guinea perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh your guinea?</p>
               <p>Bates. I often do when I doubt them; I send them over to a neighbour and have them weighed; once or twice I had his weighed, and when weighed found no deficiency.</p>
               <p>Edward Taft. I have known him three years; when he came to our house he dealt in horses; he used it three years; the Bell in Smithfield: I am an ostler; he has had four or five at our house at a time; I sold one or two for him.</p>

               <p>Taft. He has dealt in horses ever since I knew him; I have had some pounds of his money, and got banks for him when he went into the country for 60 or 80 guineas at a time.</p>

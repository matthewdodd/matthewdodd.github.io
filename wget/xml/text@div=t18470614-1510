                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Board of Guardians of the Holborn Union, and vestry-clerk of the liberty of Saffron-hill, which is part of the Holborn Union—the prisoner was a collector of the poors' rates—he was appointed on the 1st of June, 1836.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that appointment in writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was not an appointment in writing under the hand and seal of the Poor Law Commissioners—it is according t practice that the collector is appointed by order of the Poor Law Commissioners—that is a printed order—there was a printed order in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not appointing the collector? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is an order to the Guardians to appoint, which is done at a meeting of the Board—he is appointed verbally—a minute of his appointment is afterwards made in the minute-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got the rate-book here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—the rate to which the amounts in question refer was made on the 13th of Aug., 1846—I know the handwriting of the gentlemen whose names appear in the book—I have seen them write—it was the prisoner's duty to collect that rate, and when collected to pay it into the bankers to the account of the Overseers—I know that the Overseers have an account at the bankers—the audit up to Lady-day, 1847, commenced on the 4th of May—Mr. James Hales Mitchener is the auditor—about the 6th of May the prisoner was sent for by the auditor to bring his receipt check-books—he did not bring them—they were brought or sent some days after, but I was not present—the prisoner was present when the accounts were audited—the auditor expressed an opinion that ex<lb></lb>planations were necessary and requested him to produce certain books—no amount of defalcation was then stated to him—it was not correctly ascertained at that time what the amount was—he was sent to get his receipt check-books, and was told to return immediately—I did not see him for several days afterwards—I produce the check-books, and also a return that was made by the prisoner to the auditor on the 6th of May—there are two accounts; one form Lady-day to Midsummer, 1846, and the other from Midsummer to Michaelmas, 1846—the greater part of this is in the prisoner's handwriting—he produced it, and that which is not his handwriting are some obser<lb></lb>vations of the auditor's—the result of the account from Michaelmas to Christmas is, that there was a balance in his hand of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the amount that was uncollected was 446<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the deficiency—this is only an aggregate account—I have no detailed account of pri<lb></lb>soner's of the particular sums paid to him, and not accounted for by him—the auditor has a detailed account, made out by the prisoner and himself, going through the book, and putting down the sums—the prisoner was paid by a poundage of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cent. on the receipt of rates—he was paid by the Overseers—that has continued since his appointment—I have the Over<lb></lb>seers' account book.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140178"></xptr>
               <p>afterwards entered in the book—information was given to the Poor Law Com<lb></lb>missioners of his appointment—that was in writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there then a ratification of his appointment sent by the Poor-law Commissioners, prescribing what his duties were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, merely approving his appointment—his duties are prescribed in the order—the Guardians are bound by that prescription of the duties—the order directing the election, also prescribes the duties—the prisoner was appointed by the Guardians—he has since been dismissed by the Poor-law Commissioners, not by the Guardians, they have no power of dismissal—the prisoner gave a bond to the Guardians on being appointed—I have got that bond—every Wednesday morning he was expected to show to the Guardians how the rates stood—he did not go before the Guardians, he rendered an account every Wednesday morning to me, as clerk to the Guardians, of the money he had received on the different rates that were then due—it can hardly be called a weekly account—it was the result of the monies collected—the Guardians are the Guardians of the Union—they direct a certain sum of money to be paid by the Overseers to them, as their share of the expenses of the Union—the money is collected for the Overseers, and paid to the account of the Overseers, at the banker's—they have to pay a great many small local expenses, Police-rates, and so on, and then they pay the amount ordered by the Guardians over to the Guardians.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that he is paid out of the rate of the parish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, paid by the Overseers, by the hand of the Overseers—there is no deduction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Thomas Truman"—he is paid by a poundage—the money collected is paid in to the bankers, to the account of the Overseers, the Overseers have to pay the Police-rate, the County-rate, &amp;c., that is without any connection with the Guardians, quite independent of them—the Guardians know nothing of it, in fact all that they know is with regard to their own receipt for the main<lb></lb>tainance and support of the poor—the Overseers pay a certain amount to the treasurer of the Union, for the Guardians for the relief of the poor, and the surplus, after that amount is so paid, is retained by the Overseers for the next year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is no accounting, as I understand, by the Overseers to the Guardians at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is the result of every Wednesday—the collector is expected to show the balance of each rate as it stands at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To whom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To me, as the clerk to the Guar<lb></lb>dians, the balance of the different rates that are then in collection, so that if there is any laxity on the part of the collector, the Guardians might com<lb></lb>municate with the Overseers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The Guardians meet every Wednesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do, twice, at ten in the morning and seven in the evening—the Overseers have no regular time of meeting—if it was necessary to show the account to the Overseers, it would be requisite to call a special meeting if them for the purpose, or to communicate in writing—that is the mode generally adopted——he</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you ever see him account to the Overseers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That book is rendered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any other account rendered than that book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The weekly account—I am not aware that there is any account rendered to the Overseers, except that which is rendered to the auditor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is the auditor's book, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is the Overseer' book—it is the book which the auditor refers to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he accounts to the Overseers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—he pays the money into the banker's, and he produces the banker's book as the Overseers' book, to show the payments made by him on account of the Overseer, to the banker's—he accounts to the Overseers quarterly, at all events the accounts are made up for the purposes of the auditor—this is the quarterly-book—it is made up quarterly for the purpose of the auditor making up the accounts—I have got the Guardians weekly returns—these entries are made by the prisoner—I do not know anything of their being made, except that the book is in his custody, and is produced by the prisoner at the time of the audit.</p>

               <p>over the book, there were some circumstances which excited my suspicion, and I sent the prisoner home for his check-books—these are receipt check-books—he takes these out with him—when he receives money he tears out a receipt, gives it to the person paying the money, and enters in the margin the per<lb></lb>son's name from whom he receives it, and the amount and date—when I sent him for his check-books, I expected him back immediately—he did not re<lb></lb>turn—I did not see him again until Saturday morning, the 8th of May, when he came to me in consequence of some communication I had had with his friends—I then went into a detailed examination in his presence of the check-books with the rate-books—in the first place I took an account of those rates which appeared by the check-books to be unpaid—the receipt-books were produced—there are receipts in them for the money of Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Baker, and Mr. Simpson, and he stated at the time that they were unpaid by them—I asked him the question upon each particular item—the fact of the receipts being here, would purport that they were not paid, but not in all cases, because in some cases he gives stamp receipts—that was why I asked him upon each particular item—the three receipts which have been produced, are not stamp-receipts, but similar to those in the book—he denied having re<lb></lb>ceived these—as far as I know, this book is in the same condition as it was when I received it, except the writing that is across the receipts.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many hundred receipts did you go through at a time with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went through the whole of them—there are some hundreds—they laid before me, and I compared the items with the rate-book as I went on—as I came to each case in which the receipt appeared, I read out the name, and to each he said, "That is not paid," with two or three exceptions, where he stated he had given stamp-receipts, there being two or three assessments to one man—he was sitting by my side, looking over the books—I do not know that it often happens that the collector has a rate paid when he has not his rate-book in his pocket, and that he gives a receipt from some other rate-book—it is a very improper mode if he does so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look over the receipt-book, and tell me the amount which he said had not been received, but which you have since found he has in fact received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is not in this book only—the receipt that should have been given to Mr. Hamilton is still in this book—I presume he must have given one of the same kind to Mr. Hamilton, when he received the money—he ought to have the receipts written out before he goes out to collect.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, on one occasion, of his returning about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as paid, which turned out afterwards to be unpaid to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No;—a certain sum was declared as the amount of the prisoner's deficiency—I have heard that his goods were sold, but I have no personal knowledge of it—it has not come officially before me—I heard him say that the reason of his</p>

               <p>being deficient was, that a bill in Chancery had been preferred against him for some duties that he had performed as an executor.</p>

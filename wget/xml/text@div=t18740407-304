               <p>this answer on 23rd July, 1873. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir, I regret that through illness, I have been unable to see you as yet, but I will do so to-day without fail. Apologising for apparent rudeness, I am, Dear sir, your obedient servant, W. Vann." That was the only letter received in answer to my colleague's letter—my colleague is not here—he said that there was a large amount due to the firm which had not been claimed, and he wrote a letter—we got no reply for about a fortnight, and then went to the firm but only saw Vann—I think he said that it was not convenient for us to see the firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it the custom for the customers to draw out the cigars? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When the duty was paid—it was necessary to pay the duty every day—as far as we are concerned it would be quite possible for the clerk not to pay in all the warrants, but to keep some back—if he chose to be dishonest and had five warrants on Monday he could pay in four and keep one back till Tuesday, and the Customs would know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>L. J. H. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILKINS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The prisoner never made me aware of any irregularities at the Customs—he was not authorized to open or accept any letter directed to me—I received no letter from the Custom House—if received it should have been properly endorsed and placed before myself or my partner—the irregularities were to our credit—if an amount was short paid some warrants must have been kept back because they do not give credit, and therefore the last warrant would be kept back because there was not money to meet it, and when a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent down next day that would cover it, and the warrant might be in the prisoner's pocket, so that day by day there might be a small" balance in our favour, but when the small amounts of credit reached a large amount, it got beyond the transfer and then the difficulty occurred—our customers complained most seriously, but they complained to the prisoner, and he might say "I am very sorry, but don't say anything to the governor about it"—I did not say anything to the prisoner about it because I have only heard it since, and I found in the prisoner's drawer a letter complaining of goods not being sent.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) I pleaded guilty here yesterday to a similar charge to this—I have been about eight years in Mr. Wilkins's employ—Vann was my fellow clerk—I have been in the habit of going to the Custom House with cheques, and getting cash from the bank for the open cheques—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070102"></xptr>
               <p>I was at Rarnsgate for a week, and was there during the hank holiday—I remember Vann coming there—I saw him on the Sunday morning—I went with him to Pegvvell Bay—I changed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note there with Vann's name on it—he gave me some money, nearly 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay in on Tuesday morning—he told me he had it on Saturday—I did not pay the rest of the money at the Custom House though I brought it up with me—Vann had not the slightest idea what I was doing when I changed the money—I cannot swear whether I got 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for another cheque, but I frequently had money from Vann to take to the Custom House, and had no time to take it—I cannot remember taking a cheque for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd on October 13th—it was Vann's habit to pay me over the money—I was supposed generally to go down to the Custom House to settle, and I have on those occasions kept warrants back and appropriated the money, and Vann did not know it—he is entirely innocent of those transactions with which he is charged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mean of those in the indictment—I do not know particularly what they are, excepting the three—I cannot tell you how much money I have stolen—I have no idea, it might be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell whether there are thirty or forty cases on which I might be convicted—my memory is bad—I cannot tell you when first I began to be a thief, it is not so long ago as early in 1871—I remember last being at Ramsgate on 2nd August; I stayed at the top of the Fort—I took 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me, and I had about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left on 2nd August—I had about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday when I went to Pegwell Bay to Mr. Hills's—Vann and I bought some bouquets for Mr. Hills's daughters, they cost something like 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I cannot tell whether the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was changed to pay for them—Vann gave me the notes on the Monday—I did not intend to steal them then, but it occurred to me to steal them when I changed the note—Vann is a great friend of mine—I did not think that I was throwing suspicion upon him—I went up to London on the Monday, on the Bank Holiday—I didn't know when Vann went up, but he came to business on the Tuesday evening—he did not ask me whether I had paid the money in—I believe I took a cheque on 13th October, but I can't remember what it was—I was not keeping a cigar shop, but I had an office in John Street, in the name of Adams &amp; Co.—I had 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cigars there on the Tuesday—I knew of complaints made to Vann by Mr. Bramble's customers, and also by the Custom House; by Mr. Guy—I also knew that my principals knew nothing about it, Vann told me so—I knew that the irregularities suggested from The Custom House were an apparent credit to Messrs. Bramble day by day—the complaints were made to Vann himself and communicated by him to me.</p>

               <p>Q. In what pocket had you your money?</p>
               <p>Strowley. I had it in my breeches pocket, and I took it out, and put it in my side pocket, in my jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you together?</p>
               <p>Strowley. Not more than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body else in the room with you?</p>
               <p>Strowley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you not lose it in pulling your jacket off?</p>
               <p>Strowley. I did not pull it off at all, I only lay down upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not get out, and fall on the bed?</p>
               <p>Strowley. I don't know, I lost it some how; I searched the bed, but I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room when you missed it?</p>
               <p>Strowley. No, she was gone out for a quartern of gin; then I put my hand in my pocket, and could not find any money at all. She did not come up, so I went down after her, and went to the Swan, but she was not there when I came in; yet she came in about half an hour after. I said, you have taken my money a little while ago, you ought to have given me half of it: she said, she never saw me since she was born.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Strowley. I was sober as I am now: (He was not sober:) I came to the house the next morning, and said, give me half the money, and keep the rest: she denied ever seeing me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take her up that afternoon?</p>
               <p>Strowley. I was told I could not. I cannot swear she took my money.</p>

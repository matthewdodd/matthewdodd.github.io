                  </hi>. I keep the Bevington Arms, Paddington Road, Notting Hill—I have known the deceased Sidney Smith, two years, as a customer—on Saturday, 27th April, he came in about 5.30—I left the house, leaving him there—my wife was attending to the bar—I returned between 7 o'clock and half-past, and found him in the private bar—the prisoner was in the parlour with Caroline Jenner, and her sister, Mrs. Judge, and three or four young men—Smith appeared the worse for drink, but I should not call him drunk—he could stand well—he was in that state when he came in—he only had one glass of beer in the house—I advised him to go out, because I was told something which he had done—the prisoner and his friends were about to leave the house; as they went out Smith followed—the sister of Caroline Jenner was standing at the door as he went out, and he pushed rudely against her—I Raw a little scuffle—I could not see exactly who it was between, because there are folding doors with embossed glass—the doors swung open as they went out—I went outside immediately and saw a scuffle, and saw the deceased fall on the flags—his head was towards the doorway as I went out—I could not Bay what caused him to fall—I picked him up—he appeared to he stunned; he could not speak to me—I dragged him into the parlour and bathed his face with water, and he came round a bit, and sat on a seat and said that would do, and took the cloth out of my hand—he laid his face on the parlour table—he sat there about half an hour while I was attending to my business—he then removed himself to the far end and laid down on the seat—he slid off on to the floor and I picked him up—he was then awake—the seat was about two feet high—I don't think he hurt himself—it was not a direct fall, he slid off—I carried him into the tap-room with another witness, to let him sleep off the effect of the drink, as I thought, as he was then snoring and appeared to be fast asleep—I carried him chair and all into the taproom, and shortly afterwards I heard him fall a second time out of one of the Windsor chairs—he was taken away by a man named Plum, about 12.30—I did not notice whether he had a black eye—I bathed his face after 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know the prisoner to be a respectable, quiet, well con<lb></lb>ducted young man—I had seen the deceased before that day, but not on that day—he had drank pretty freely for some time—he had been pretty generally intoxicated since the Thanksgiving Day—I have seen him several days—when I saw him this afternoon at 5.30 he appeared stupid as men usually are when they have had a little drink—I could see that he was very strange, and there was a sort of vacancy about him—nothing took place in the parlour or bar that I saw—the table where he fell the second time has projecting iron feet, with iron curls and flowers, and a person who fell off the chair might possibly strike against them—he was lying in that direction—it was a very heavy fall, because I was in the bar and heard it—I picked him up and laid him on the floor, and he still appeared to be asleep—I saw no marks or bruises on his face, but I bathed his face several times and tried to wake him up—I went for his wife who came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We carried him into the tap-room, chair and all, and placed him at the table, and to make it more secure I placed his coat at the back of his chair—we put him towards the table.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on 27th April the deceased came in with Plum, about 5 or 5.30—I noticed his voice—it was different to what it used to be when I had seen him before—it seemed very thick—my husband served him—Smith was not in the house when the prisoner came in, but he returned—he remained after Plum a little while alone, and then went away and returned in half an hour—the prisoner had come in the meantime, and four men and three females with him—I did not see Smith go into the public parlour, or I should have tried to prevent him—I saw him in front of the bar once, and again in the public bar—he went into the parlour to the prisoner, and I heard words and went in to see what it was—I saw nothing take place between them, but only heard a few words—they were in the house together about a quarter of an hour—I advised Smith to come out of the parlour and go home, and he came out and returned back into the parlour again—I went in again and asked him to come out, and told him he had no business there—he came out with a man named Adams and stood in front of the bar, and about five minutes afterwards the whole party came out of the parlour and stood in front of the bar, in the same compartment with Smith, who behaved very rudely to the females, pushing against them in a rude manner—Smith told him to keep his own company, as he did not know him—the prisoner called the prisoner a boy for interfering, and put himself in a fighting attitude, but they did not fight—Smith talked about fighting, but the prisoner did not want to fight—they had a few words, and then they became very quiet—they did not remain in that compartment five minutes—the prisoner and his friends and the deceased rushed through the doors, and the deceased pushed up against a female, and half a minute afterwards I heard a fall—I did not go outside—Smith was brought back into the house by my husband—he seemed stunned—I saw him placed on a seat in the public parlour—I saw him while he remained in that room—my husband undid his tie and collar, and bathed his face—he moved to the other end by himself and remained in the house till 11.30, when he was taken away by his friend.</p>

I live at 7, Blagrove Place, Notting Hill, and am a widow—my house is opposite the Bevington Arms—I can see everything that goes on there—on 27th April I was at home—I saw the prisoner come out of the house and stand on the pavement, and three females came out and rushed on him—the deceased then came out and stood outside, and the three females flew at his face and struck him—as soon as the prisoner came out he struck the deceased in the face and knocked him down and kicked him; he struck him twice, and kicked him when he was down twice on the lower part of his body—the deceased got up and stood against the wall, and the pri<lb></lb>soner knocked him down the second time—he had not then recovered, he was quite helpless—it was not two minutes afterwards that the prisoner struck him again—I can't Bay whether the deceased spoke to the prisoner, because his back</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think it would be impossible for a fall on the back of the head to produce those injuries—I have known cases in the hospital where a fall on the back of the head has produced black eyes—it might have been done from the man falling from his chair against the iron supports of a table, if he fell heavily—drunken men very often snore heavily, it is often difficult to distinguish the symptoms between drunkenness and injury to the brain—healthy people often snore, it is very often a symptom of sound sleep—the only indication of blows was a out on the upper lip—if there had been a heavy blow on the eye I should expect to find it bloodshot, and the echymosis to have come on much more rapidly—he must have been struck behind the right ear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Some hard body must have struck him behind the right ear—falling on the kerb-stone or pavement might do it—some skulls are more brittle than others—I know one case where a person slipping off a chair caused such a fracture—portions of three bones were fractured—it was not a fracture which in itself Would cause death—whether a man falling on the pavement would be likely to produce such an injury would depend upon what part of his head he struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and live at No. 1, China Walk, Lambeth—I am engaged to the prisoner—I was with him and Frances Richards, and Rosetta Judge, Charles Cottle, and Enoch Adams, in the parlour of the Bevington Arms—we had not had any refreshment when Smith, the deceased, came in—as soon as we had got in, we had scarcely taken our seats, he came straight across to me and sat beside me, as I was sitting by the side of my sister, Mrs. Richards—he put his hand at the back of me; I did not take any notice of that, I felt rather frightened of him when he came in, he had such a peculiar look—I went on talking to my sister, and I found that he was insulting me again, he put his hand up my clothes, on my legs—I turned round and said "You wretch, if you do that again I will give you in charge"—I asked my sister to let me pass, and I passed by her to stand by the side of the prisoner—he asked me what was the matter—I said "Nothing"—he said he knew better, for he had seen the insult—I said "Take no notice of him"—he then spoke to the deceased and told him to keep his own company, that he was not wanted—there were rather high words in conse<lb></lb>quence of this, and Mrs. Evans came in and asked him what he wanted there, and told him to go home and leave our party by themselves—after a time he went out of the room, but came back again—we went to the bar to get so me cakes—I stood in the corner of the bar and Smith followed me in, and pushed rudely against me again, pressing his hand upon me in a most indecent manner, and the prisoner again cautioned him not to insult me—he said "I don't know you, don't insult me, you have no right to interfere"—he did not touch me again, I did not see him touch my sister—he called the prisoner a boy; he said it was not for a boy to interfere, and threatened to give him a punch in the mouth, and he squared his fist in his face—we then all left the house, and Smith followed me and my sister, and he put his hand in front of her in a most indecent manner, she spoke very sharply to him and said if there was a policeman about she would give him in charge—he repeated the offence and she gave him a slap in the face, and with that the fight commenced—the prisoner said to Smith, "You are no man to insult females in that way"—Smith put himself in a fighting attitude and called him a boy again, and I saw him on the ground, I saw no blow given.</p>

On Saturday 27th April, I was with my sister, the last witness, the prisoner, and other friends, in the parlour at this public-house—the deceased came in and sat down at the side of my sister—I saw him put his hand at the back of her, she took no notice at first, then I saw him place his hand right down under the table, but I could not see what he did; my sister got up sharply and asked me to let her pass—I asked her</p>

               <p>what for—she said "Nothing"—she went over to Scantlebury, and he asked her what was the matter—she said "Nothing"—he said "Yes, I saw the insult," and he warned the deceased—Mrs. Evans, hearing high words, came in and told him to leave—he went out and came back in a few minutes, and went up to my sister in a very insulting way, and he was then very severely cautioned by one and all, and Mrs. Evans came in again, with Mrs. Adams—he went out again, but was not out long before he came in again—we then left the parlour and went to the bar and asked for some cakes, and stood there eating them; I saw Smith go and push against my sister in a very indecent manner; she went over to Scantlebury again, and he again warned him, he asked him to leave the young ladies alone, and to leave the com<lb></lb>pany—we then went outside to go Borne, the deceased followed me, and while I was talking to Cottle, grossly insulted me by placing his hand in front of me and catching hold of me in a very indecent manner—I asked him to be careful who he was insulting, or I would give him in charge—he deliberately did it again, and I slapped his face and told him I would teach him better than to insult a respectable married woman—Scantlebury came forward and said he would prove that I was a respectable woman—the deceased told him not to interfere, and called him a boy, and said "I will give you a punch in the mouth"—I saw him put his fists in Scanttebury's face, and I saw no more, for I felt very faint and went back; I saw no blows struck, but I went to the door just in time to see the fall.</p>

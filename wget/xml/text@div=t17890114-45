As I was going up Piccadilly, to go to Dover-street, I felt something come behind me, and feel the leather; the ends of it hung down. The people often feel my leather as I go along. This was as I first entered Piccadilly, next the Haymarket. I did not turn back at that; they felt it again several different times. When I came almost to St. James's Church, there was a man behind me pulled the leather very hard. I turned round, and saw a man, whom I find to be

            ; but when I came in Dover-street, the prisoner at the bar met me, and ran against me, and sent me staggering backwards. I did not fall at that; but he then knocked me down, with the expression, d - n, or b - st, your eyes! I had a dreadful fall. While I was on the ground,

             took my property, and ran away with it. I attempted to get up, and the prisoner knocked me down a second time. I got up a second time, and laid hold of him by his arm; he struggled, swore, and either d - n your eyes, or b - st your eyes, you b - h, let go! and he got from me; I saw no more of him. This was just by the cabinet-maker's window, in Dover-street. I was much alarmed. I am sure the prisoner is the man; I could swear to him above all men; I never saw him before. It was not very dark, and the lamps gave a very good light. He was apprehended the next day, (Sunday) by the particular description I gave of him. I first saw him as they were taking him to the Justices; the constable asked me if I I knew him, and I picked out the prisoner directly, from among a parcel of men. I don't think the whole transaction took up above five minutes.

I am sure the prisoner is the man that the woman had hold of; and I heard him say, B - st your eyes you b - h, loose me; and I saw him again on the Monday. I am certain he is the man.

               <p>On the 15th of July last, about eleven at night, I was coming over Little Tower-hill; the woman prisoner spoke to me, and made such applications as she chose; I made her little answer; I was going to Rosemary-lane, to speak to an acquaintance; she followed me, and I went to Cable-street, and I found that the house was secured, and I could not see the person I wanted; says she, will you ask me to drink any thing; says I, why should I, but you shall be welcome to a draught of porter; we went in, and we had a pot of porter; she complained she was very hungry; I gave her half a crown to go and buy what she liked; she went and bought a plate of pork, I believe it was, as much as I remember; she brought it so far, and she said, I shall carry it to my lodgings; I said, why did you not bring it here? says she, if you like to go to my lodgings, we are very private, and very clever, and very sober, and I went there; we eat a part of it, and drank a pot of beer; she had the candle in her hand, and I sent her for another pot; then directly I heard a most horrible noise, and running up stairs, just as if all the devils in hell had been loose; I am come to speak the truth; says I, what is the cause of this? this is as if all the thieves and pickpockets were here; I made an attempt to come out, and should have been glad to have been out; oh, says she, it is only the landlord, with some people that are quarrelling with him; the landlord of the house, he tells me his name is Howard; I was frightened out of my wits; the noise was ceased; then, in a trifle of time, she says, have you got any money about you? I said, money! why, I gave you half a crown to get the beer and the pork, and you have not given me any change; no, blast you, says she, I insist on having all your money before you go; and, says she, if you do not give it me kindly, I will send them that shall make you do it; why, says I, I behaved very civil to you, I asked you both to eat and drink, according to your request; b - st your old eyes says she, d - n your old eyes says she, I will send them that shall make you; with that she wrapped, and this prisoner Johnson burst in at the door; there is a staple lock; he flew directly up to the chimney-piece where the candle stood and was going off with the candle; says I, what are you after; G - d d - n and b - st your old b - g - g soul, d - n you, says he, we will murder you if you do not be peaceable; says I, for God's sake do not murder me, we are not come upon that footing; I clapped hold of his collar, he took hold of mine; says he, I insist upon it you shall hand the money directly; the woman had a case knife in her hand; says she, d - n his old eyes why don't you rip him up; I should have first told you before this came about, that I realy was sleepy like; I pulled off my coat and waistcoat but did not attempt to go to bed, I laid down on the bed.</p>
               <p>What did you pull off your coat and waistcoat for? - Why, to lay down with the lady, but I could have been very glad to have had the opportunity of putting that coat and waistcoat on again, but they would not let me; and so, do you mind, what money, b - st you, says she, have you got, and he backed her, and said d - n you, you old b - g - r, why do not you give us your money, and do not let us have any delays; they went on in such a wicked manner, so at last to save my life, as I thought, I put my hand in my pocket and took out three shillings and sixpence, and she received it; I was going down stairs, she caught hold of me, and flew to the bed and got my coat and waistcoat; says I, for God's sake, what my money and my cloaths too! what a pretty figure I must cut in the morning, says I, do not do that; then they robbed me of my coat and waistcoat; I took hold of it, says I, do not strip me of my money and cloaths;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100092"></xptr>they took my coat, though it is not mentioned in the indictment; they took my waistcoat and three and sixpence in money, a tobacco-box, which will be produced in court, and a pair of spectacles and the case, they were in a handkerchief, and another handkerchief I lost; I kept there in fear, and got under the bed, for I dare say there was not less than twenty of those d - n'd villains.</p>
               <p>Did any more come up into the room after? - No, I went down stairs and walked about the streets without a coat or waistcoat; there is but very little night, this was between one and two, and by two o'clock it was light; I called as soon as possible I could for assistance; then I directly sent to the constable for assistance; I told the constable my case; he saw me in the situation I was in; I said to him, I have been robbed to night; we took the two prisoners on Saltpetre-bank, at a house, I cannot tell the sign, but the constable can; there they were both of them as drunk as the devil could make them.</p>
               <p>Court. Where have you been this afternoon? - I have been waiting here in the Old-bailey; those are the same people.</p>

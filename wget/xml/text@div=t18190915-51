               <p>MICHAEL EDINGTON. I am a <rs id="t18190915-51-viclabel267" type="occupation">law-writer</rs>

On Tuesday, the 27th of July, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, I was coming out of West-End fair, and saw a number of apparently boys jump over a hedge. Several people were before me - I thought I would get up to them for protection. The prisoner came up to me, and knocked my hat off - I turned about, and struck him. I believe him to be one of those who came over the hedge. I knocked him down - he cried out,</p>
               <p>"Stall here - stall him! cut his throat!" In about a minute, near fifty of them came up, and held me up. I was beat about in every part of my body with bludgeons and other things. I was so severely beaten, that I laid at Mr. Bannister's, a surgeon, at Hampstead, for two days and three nights, and was senseless a day and a night. While they held me, I lost a silver snuff-box, 16 s. in money, a pair of gloves, and a silk handkerchief from my person. My coat was torn all to pieces. When they had got all I had they left me. I fell down with the loss of blood, and crawled into one of the booths. A friend happened to see me afterwards, and conveyed me in a coach to the surgeon's. I became insensible before I was put into the coach, and remained so. I missed my property before I was insensible.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were beating you, did you observe them robbing you - A. No, my Lord, they were beating me on all sides. My property was safe before they attacked me. I heard the prisoner call out several times,</p>
               <p>"Murder him!" till they began beating me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is the person who knocked off your hat, and called out - A. I am; I took particular notice of him, and struck him. They all belonged to the same party. I have never recovered my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Were you sober - A. Yes; I had only drank part of a bottle of cyder; I could distinguish the prisoner well. I saw him at Bow-street on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that you cut the prisoner's head - A. No; I said I thought I might. I can swear to another of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner struck off your hat, which called your attention to him - A. Yes, and I struck him on the head. He came in a direction from the hedge, at the same time as the others.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HUNT. I am a constable of Hampstead. On the 27th of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I apprehended the prisoner, with twelve others, in a booth at Hampstead. I found nothing on him. I went with a strong party.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN HARRISON. I am headborough of Hampstead. On the 27th of July, I apprehended the prisoner and twelve more, in the booth, that belonged to Smith, of Bayswater. Next day, before I went to Bow-street, I heard that the prosecutor laid at Mr. Bannister's, and went to him; he described the person of the prisoner before he saw him in custody, and on Saturday he pointed him out from the rest of the prisoners, and identified him as the person. I produce the prosecutor's coat, which is torn and cut to pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Mill-lane, Deptford—the prisoner is my wife. On Sunday, the 24th of March, about twelve o'clock, I went home to my lodging—I had been drinking at a public-house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080225"></xptr>
               <p>in Broadway, Deptford, and was very much intoxicated—my wife was not at home when I got there—when she came in, I began to quarrel with her, through a little jealousy—I accused her of having been drinking with a young man—we came to high words and blows—I struck her and she struck me—we both had a fight together—I was striking a light, and it went out—the candlestick was on the floor, and the candle smashed—I do not know whether the wind blew it out, or whether I and my wife knocked it out—I have given an account of this before—it fell, and went out—I do not know whether I put it out or my wife, for I was very much in liquor—we both had a quarrel together and blows—something struck me on my left arm—I found my face was cut, and ran up stairs for assistance—there were people in the house—I do not know what my arm was cut by—there was no one in the room but our two selves—I must have struck her first, for I am very bad when I am in liquor—I am sure I struck her first, coming in at the door—I think I called her bad names—I did not perceive my hand scratched in the dark—I did not feel the blood before the people told me up stairs that my hand was bleeding.</p>

I was on duty in Broad-way, Deptford, between twelve and one o'clock on Sunday night, or Mon<lb></lb>day morning, the 24th, and heard cries of as Police," in Mill-lane—I went down the lane, and met the prosecutor, led by a young man—he appeared to be severely wounded—his face was cut—he was holding his hand to his face—it was bleeding profusely—I directed he should be taken to the station-house, and got surgical assistance—I went with another policeman in search of the prisoner, and found her concealed among some timber and bricks, on the premises of Mr. Mackey, the engineer, adjoining the house where this happened—there is a fence separating the two premises, but that was broken down—it was at the back of the house—she said she had done it, and was quite willing to die, provided she could see him die before her—she did not mention any thing about the gallows—this is my hand-writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—I believe it was read over to me before I signed it—we searched the room where they were, and my sergeant found this knife, concealed on a shelf in the cupboard—as soon as it was produced she said that was the knife she did it with.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant R</hi> 20.) On Monday morning, about twenty minutes before one o'clock, I was on duty in Mill-ane—I heard a wrangling from a house up a turning in the lane where the prosecutor and his wile lodged—I saw the prosecutor take a light from the policeman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080226"></xptr>
               <p>at the gate—that was directly after I heard the wrangling—he then went in-doors—I remained at the end of the alley—Hearn came out again and asked for a light, as he said Nancy had put it out—I went back with him, and heard the prisoner say, "You b I should like to cut your b throat"—the door was shut—I said "Open the door; are you not ashamed of making use of such language on Sunday night?" Hearn was outside with me—she let him in—I begged of Hearn not to quarrel, and to have no more words—I shut the window-shutter to, being outside, and Hearn fastened it within—about ten minutes afterwards I was in the Fountain yard, about five hundred yards off, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what Marshall told me, I went with him to apprehend the prisoner—I found her in Mr. Mackey's yard, about one hundred and fifty yards from the house—Marshall found her at the furthest corner of the yard—there was a quantity of fellies and pieces of timber, to conceal her, and a cart likewise—she had hid herself—she could not be seen without going up to the timber, and looking among it—I afterwards found the knife on a shelf in the cupboard—I think it was the top-shelf—di<lb></lb>rectly I produced it I said, "Is this the knife?"—she said "Yes"—I did not hear distinctly what she said when Marshall took her, not so at to state any particular word.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Deptford. Sergeant Croxon brought Hearn to my house, between one and two o'clock on Monday morning—I examined him—he was bleeding very profusely—he had a wound on his left cheek, about five inches and a half in length, in a half circle, going from the ear to the mouth—one part of it at the middle was to the bone—it was not generally deep—I applied pressure to stop the hemorrhage—being early in the morning I was very much fatigued, having been up the whole night before, and with great difficulty I stopped it—about seven o'clock the same morning the prosecutor called me up again, and I was then obliged to make use of ligatures, as it was bleeding afresh—he was faint—I was obliged to give him a stimulant while I was dressing it—it was certainly a dangerous wound, and if it had been a little lower, I think it would have been fatal—it appeared to be inflicted by a sharp in<lb></lb>strument—the knife produced was likely to have done it—I consider it dangerous, if it had not been attended to immediately—he is convalescent, and there is not any fear now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 20.) On the 27th of November, I was on duty in Goswell-street, in plain clothes. About half-past six o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner and another coming along, and their hands met as if something passed between them—I saw the prisoner put his left hand into his outside coat-pocket—I seized him—he forced his hand from his pocket, and threw something across which glittered and sounded on the stones like money—he resisted very much, and Cole, who was with me, was forced to come to my assistance—I got him to a public-house—I then went back and searched where I heard the money fall—I found nothing, but I saw Cole with two shillings in his hand, and is the act of picking up a third—I found on the prisoner 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and some cheese, and tobacco in little parcels.</p>

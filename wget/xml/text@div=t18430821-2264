                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. James Stedman, linen and woollen draper, No. 44, Bedford-street, Strand. On Friday morning, the 28th of July, about a quarter after nine, the prisoners, Williams and Young, came to the shop and asked to look at some calico to make a wrapper—I showed them some—they complained of it not being stout enough—I showed them canvass which is made for wrappers—they purchased a yard and a half—while I was serving Young, Williams took five pieces, containing about twelve yards of woollen cloth, from the shelf—he carried it out of the shop under his coat or cloak which was hanging on his arm—he handed it over to Morris, who remained outside—he had not been in at all—Williams afterwards returned into the shop, and put the things straight on the shelf, which he had disturbed—the two afterwards left the shop together—I immediately pursued them, stopping to put nothing away—I called for the police, but they had received information from some stranger, and were following them—they went down Maiden-lane, which is about three doors from the shop—they were walking—Morris was seized in the lane—he threw the cloth down in the road—he was taken to the station—the other two ran away, but were pursued by a policeman—Williams was taken at the end of Maiden-lane—Young ran down the Strand and was secured—Young bought half a yard of</p>

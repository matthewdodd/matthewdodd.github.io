                  </hi>. I am a printer and publisher, of Fleet-street—the prisoner was in my service—no one resides on the premises—the prisoner had a key to let himself into the warehouse, which is the first-floor—you can get there without going to the publishing-office, where the till is—he had no business in that office—there was a hole in the till, through which a person's hand could be put—the prisoner ought to come between six and seven o'clock in the morning—he had no business there at five—in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing that happened I gave Ventrum directions to watch.</p>

On Saturday morning, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner come to the street door, let himself in, and go up-stairs to the warehouse—he then came down again, unlocked the publishing-office door and went in—I heard</p>

               <p>a noise, and heard him go from the door round to the till—it was dark, he could not see me—I went into the office, heard money rattle, and when he came towards me I put my hand round him and took this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his hand, and this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is the key of the outer door—he said, "This is the first time I have done it; I hope you will forgive me; I work here; I belong here"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and two shillings—the shilling I took from his hand was a marked one, and one which Mr. Clarke had shown me before—I saw him put it into the till in a small box.</p>

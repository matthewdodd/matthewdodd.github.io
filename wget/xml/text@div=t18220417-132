On 18th March, I went to bed between ten and eleven; and at four o'clock in the morning, I heard a kind of crack. I got up and found an outside shutter open, which was fastened when I went to bed. Three squares of glass were taken out, and a flower-pot which stood inside, was taken out into the yard. They had put their arms through the window, and undone the fastening of the casement, and opened it. I went into the yard, to an out-house which is used by me and my partner,

            . I am watchman at the London Institution, Moorfields. I was calling five o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing at the back of the Riding School, and lifting up something heavy. I went towards him; he saw me, and went away, leaving it there. It was a leaden sink. He turned round about thirty yards off to see if I was coming. I went to the watch-house for assistance, and when I came out, he had got very near it again, and on seeing me, went away. He came round towards it again, and we took him. Mr. Amess claimed it.</p>

               <p>The case was opened by Mr. Silvester, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. This is an indictment against Nicholas Ready Ledwich, whom you see there, and the indictment charges him with wilful and corrupt perjury. Gentlemen, I must claim your attention to the case which I am going to open, because in opening that case, I shall discover such a scene of iniquity as men of your description are not acquainted with; and you will see from thence on what tenure it is, that you keep either your lives or your properties lafe, if a man of this description can be let loose on the country after being guilty of the facts, which I trust I shall be able to prove before you in evidence: But it will be necessary for me to begin the transaction a little further back, that you may understand the whole of the case, see the force of it, and observe the purpose for which it was done, and the iniquity which was intended to be perpetrated in the hands of this man, who is an attorney. Gentlemen, when I say an attorney, it is to call your attention more particularly to the case; because men of his description are not to exercise their power to the ruin of their fellow subjects, and to the disgrace<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250109"></xptr>of the honourable profession to which they belong; therefore, I say it behoves you and the court to watch more attentively to their conduct. Gentlemen, in the end of the year, 1786, a Mr. Gale, who is the prosecutor of this indictment, who then lived in the Hay-market, and was a leather trunk-maker, and was acquainted with a person of the name of Sweatman (Sweatman was a coach harness-maker) he applied to him, and told him he had an opportunity, if he would but lend him a few pounds, to make a very advantageous bargain; that a person of his acquaintance had a pair of coach-harness to sell, which he offered him five guineas for, and that he should have three guineas profit: at first Gill was unwilling to lend him the money, but the profit being so great, and this man being at the same time in necessitous circumstances, and he telling him I will put in your hands the security of two guineas due to me from a Mr. Davis who lives in Long-acre, and the moment I have sold the harness, I will pay you: A short time afterwards he paid him the three guineas, but on application being made to Davis for the two guineas on the note, Davis either unable or unwilling to pay it, did not chuse to pay it, upon which Gill returned the note to Sweatman, and told him it was of no use; Sweatman received the note, went away and he heard no more of him for sometime: at that time Gill was perfectly unacquainted that there was such a man in existence as Mr. Ledwich, he had never heard his name, or seen his person, and was surprized one day being applied to by Mr. Ledwich, who asked him if he had settled Sweatman's affairs, he said no, he knew nothing of it, he owed him two guineas; because says he, he has brought an action against Davis, and the moment I recover it, I am to pay you. Sometime after Ledwich sent to Gill, and got him to the coffee-house; unfortunately, gentlemen, there is a coffee-house where men of Mr. Ledwich's description meet, and where I do not think it safe for any other man to go, because the company he meets with there are of that description as always to be ready to watch to take advantage of what is said. Gentlemen, at this coffee-house Mr. Ledwich told Mr. Gill, that unless he paid him a sum of money down, the action which he had brought in his name on this note of hand would be nonprossed; Mr. Gill was astonished! alarmed! he had returned the bill to Sweatman, he had never seen Ledwich, nor ever gave him authority to sue at all, and was much surprised to hear from him that he had with at any authority whatever made use of his name to bring an action against Davis; he did not take any notice of it, or pay him the money; some time after that, this poor man for the good-natured action of having lent three guineas to Sweatman, was arrested and obliged to pay 10 l. for not going on with an action which he knew nothing of; he applied to Mr. Ledwich immediately, who informed him Mr. Sweatman was at Kentish-Town; and at last after frequent enquiries he found that Sweatman and the defendant Ledwich were intimate friends, countrymen, and cronies, that they had been together at the house of one Addison, that they were often together, and that Sweatman acted sometimes as attorney for Ledwich; when he found that, this poor man, by the advice of his attorney, paid the money, and he then arrested Mr. Gill for 14 l. 8 s. 10 d. for costs for going on with that action; as soon as he was arrested, he put in bail, but not wishing to try the cause, he got an assignment from the sheriff, and that brought the parties before the Court of Common Pleas; when they came before the court, Mr. Gill opened the whole transaction, stated every fact, that he had lent the money, and had only taken this note as a security which he returned as invalid; that he never directly, or indirectly gave Ledwich orders to prosecute on the note, or bring an action on the note, and was perfectly ignorant of Ledwich, and that he shrewdly suspected it was a contrivance between Ledwich and Sweatman to rob him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250110"></xptr>of his money; this was the affidavit made by Mr. Gill in the Court of Common Pleas. In answer to that, Mr. Ledwich did not as is usual, produce an authority in writing from Mr. Gill, but he made his affidavit, and said he had been employed, and that as to this person of the name of Sweatman he did not know him nor bad any connection with him; he said that Sweatman was then an entire stranger to him; these are his words;</p>
               <p>"And this deponent further</p>
               <p>"denies that he ever was in company with</p>
               <p>"the said Sweatman, at the house of one</p>
               <p>"Addison, in Hanover-street, Long-acre,</p>
               <p>"and absolutely denies, that he</p>
               <p>"ever had any intimacy, connection, or</p>
               <p>"familiarity whatsoever, either directly</p>
               <p>"or indirectly with the said Sweatman,</p>
               <p>"nor had any knowledge of him before he</p>
               <p>"called on him at his chambers, for the</p>
               <p>"purpose mentioned in his affidavit." - Yet he would have the court believe that a man whom he was entirely ignorant of, had come to his chambers and picked him out from all the rest of mankind to bring an action, not in his own name but in the name of Gill; why did he swear this? because he was charged by Gill, that it was a contrivance, a trick of his, planned by him and his countryman Sweatman, for the purpose of robbing Gill. Gentlemen, the action was brought on this note, which he must know at the time he could not recover, for it was invalid in point of law, but he knew at the same time he was playing a safe game, and if once he could get the costs from Gill, it was perfectly immaterial to him whether he recovered or not; if he recovered against Davis, he was sure of recovering his costs from him; if he failed, he had nothing to do but to institute a suit against this gentleman Mr. Gill, stating himself to be employed by him, and by an affidavit rob him of that money which he was not intitled to. Gentlemen, this is the iniquity which this man has been guilty of; you see the deep laid plan which every one of you as well as myself who speak to you are liable to at this moment; if men of this description who have art enough, are wicked enough to put that art in force. The transaction between Sweatman and himself (which Mr. Gill says, was a contrivance;) Mr. Ledwich denies, and swears positively to the employment, and thinks he is safe, because one witness cannot convict a man of perjury; but there are fortunately for the country, and fortunately for all honest men not only one, but many witnesses who will contradict that fact which Mr. Ledwich has sworn, and which he himself knew was false. Gentlemen, I will prove to you that Mr. Ledwich in company with this man, went to the sheriff's-office, with a person of the name of Hargrave, whom we have not here at present, that Sweatman and he dined together every day in the week, that he was the go-between that man who was in goal and the plaintiff; that they belonged, I believe to a club, and were in the strictest habits of intimacy; and notwithstanding Mr. Ledwich has sworn that he was not on a certain day at Addison's house, Mr. and Mrs. Addison will tell you that he was there, and that they saw him. It is lucky for the public that men of this description have not always their senses about them, therefore they give an opportunity to bring them to justice, which otherwise in this case we should not have had. Gentlemen, I shall produce his affidavit, in which he states, his perfect ignorance of Sweatman, and his not having been at this place; that I shall contradict by several witnesses; and I must make one other observation which is, that not one of the witnesses I shall call to you are or will be interested by the event of this cause; they are neither to get nor lose by your verdict, therefore they come before you unimpeached and disinterested: I have no objection, gentlemen, that Mr. Ledwich should sit there, if it can avail him to sit in any part of the court; because I do not wish for your verdict, unless it is founded on the evidence I have to offer, I do not wish that any thing I have said should influence your judgements against Mr. Ledwich, all I wish is to direct your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250111"></xptr>understandings to the point in issue, and when I have proved my facts, I call upon you as honest men for your verdict of guilty: If on the other hand he can make a defence which will avail him, and convince you that he is innocent of this charge, I shall rejoice in his acquittal; but if I convince you that what he has sworn is absolutely false, the justice of your country requires you to do your duty (although it is a painful one) and pronounce him guilty.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ledwich. My Lord, I do not want any thing unfair, I will acknowledge it, I will look at it, and see that there is no interlineation in that part that affects me; (looks at it) this is my hand-writing, and I believe this to be Mr. Justice Gould's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear Sweatman say any thing in the presence of Ledwich? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did Mr. Ledwich come at any time in consequence of a message sent to him? - I do not know, I cannot enter into his heart.</p>
               <p>Did you ever send for Mr. Ledwich to your house and he came directly? - Yes, I did, I sent Sweatman for him, and he came.</p>
               <p>How soon after you sent for him? - I cannot exactly say, I do not recollect the circumstances, he did not come at the time I sent for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ball. Do you know of any intimacy, familiarity, or friendship between Mr. Ledwich and Sweatman? - I do not, they were strangers to me.</p>

               <p>And who else? - There were other people but I do not know their names, I never took any particular notice of them, we kept no man, but a person at the King's Arms, in Roll's Buildings, used to go of Mr. Hargrave's messages, I saw nobody else but Mr. Ledwich and Mr. Sweatman, I have seen them there about three or four times; I am not quite sure how many times.</p>
               <p>Did they come together? - Yes Sir, they came together, and drank together; I gave them liquor, and took the money of them.</p>
               <p>Were they acquainted? - I fancy they were, I am sure they were together.</p>
               <p>Are you perfectly acquainted with Mr. Ledwich's face, so as to be able to know him again for a certainty? - No Sir, I am not sure, but I dare say I should, I never took any particular notice of him, any further, I am pretty sure that gentleman in black is him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Blades. He was called, and I saw him come out of the gallery, and I would not let him come in.</p>
               <p>Have you been in court? - I was up in the gallery.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear that all the witnesses were turned out? - I was there not thinking any harm.</p>
               <p>Court. He was in court contrary to order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have you heard any of the witnesses examined? - Not one, I was the first called, and I went out of the gallery.</p>
               <p>Who was it took you up into the gallery? - An acquaintance of mine, he would persuade me, and we both went up.</p>
               <p>Who was he? - Davis.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me what passed between you and Davis, why did you go into the gallery? - Because we had been standing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250114"></xptr>so many hours here, and we wanted to hear the debates.</p>
               <p>Was not you in court when an order was made, that all the witnesses should withdraw? - I never was in court till I went into the gallery.</p>
               <p>When did you come into the gallery? - I believe it was directly when the order was given for going on with the trial, and I was immediately called and came out.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the jury was sworn? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Mr. Silvester spoke to the jury? - I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Was you in the gallery? - I was no where else; I might be about ten minutes, or a little better before I was called, the gentleman persuaded me to go up into the gallery, I denied it two or three times, but he persuaded me to go up into the gallery to hear the debates, whether the bill should be thrown out or not; I cannot recollect the words, that gentleman was talking to my Lord; I dare say Davis thought no more harm than I did.</p>
               <p>(Morgan Davis called.)</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take Addison up into the gallery? - Nothing but curiosity, we were not five minutes before Mr. Addison was called, I never heard the order.</p>
               <p>Court. Both parties have neglected to call the witnesses together, which they ought to have done, I think in point of justice I ought to hear what Addison has to say, he has in fact not heard any thing.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Hanover-street, Long-acre, No. 16, a private house; I have kept a house there above thirty years.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Ledwich? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - I cannot ascertain that, not thinking it of any consequence; it was near a twelvemonth ago, or thereabouts; I have a shop in the back buildings; I am a truss-maker; I was called down stairs; when I got into the back room, Mr. Ledwich and Mr. Sweatman were there.</p>
               <p>How came they there together? - Mr. Ledwich came because I had made a truss for him.</p>
               <p>How came Mr. Sweatman there? - I do not know, I know Mr. Sweatman before, I had seen him many times.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Ledwich and Mr. Sweatman were acquainted? - No more than what I tell you, I never saw them but that once together, I am sure of that, I never saw them any where else together.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with Ledwich about Sweatman? - No, none concerning Sweatman, not that I can recollect, there was no conversation passed then about the matter, and I believe that Sweatman did not speak a word while he was there.</p>
               <p>They came together? - They went away together, but I was called out of my shop, and they were in the parlour; I do not know how they came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ball. Do you know of any acquaintance, connexion, or familiarity between Mr. Ledwich and Mr. Sweatman? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You were called down out of your shop into your parlour, there you found two persons, one that had particular business, and the other came to ask you how you was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think that Mr. Ledwich had any knowledge of Sweatman at that time? - No further than that they were both together in the room, and went away together.</p>
               <p>Did they go out as if they were going to any place together? - I do not know that they were.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of their being acquainted with one another? - No more than going away together; Sweatman had no business with me that I know of; I immediately went back to my work.</p>
               <p>Was you subpoened on an action depending between Mr. Ledwich and Gill in the Court of Common Pleas? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did Mr. Ledwich<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250115"></xptr>and Sweatman stay with you? - Not many minutes.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between them two while you was there? - Not a word that I can remember.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear Mr. Ledwich call Sweatman by his name? - No, I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ball. Do you think if at any time within these six months, if Mr. Ledwich had spoke to you, and asked you how you did, you would have known him, or even since this indictment was found? - That is just as it happens; I am rather forgetful of people's faces, but I think I should.</p>
               <p>Court. He knows him now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ledwich. I spoke to him to day.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any other witnesses that have seen him at Addison's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Addison. Is your wife here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you have not got a step further, unless you had another witness; there is no evidence to go to the Jury; where is Hargrave?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He is down at Colchester.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury; this last witness carries the case no further, for his evidence is upon the distinct assignment of perjury, that Ledwich never was with Sweatman at the house of Addison: now, if what Addison has stated, was proved by two witnesses, I should certainly leave it to your consideration, whether you believed the assertion of Mr. Ledwich in his affidavit, to be knowingly and corruptly false, or not; but in the crime of perjury, the law requires two witnesses to convict, even on a distinct assignment of perjury; and the law does not leave it to the Jury to determine, whether they will believe one witness or the other, where there is but one each way; because the person indicted for perjury, has already sworn one way; and if there is but one witness that swears the other way, the law will not suffer the person indicted to be convicted: I am therefore not permitted by law to put the question to you, whether you believe Addison's evidence; upon the rest of the case, there is no evidence at all, for the evidence that at a public-house, where there were a number of people, and Mr. Ledwich was twice in company with Sweatman in the same room, without any proof that he spoke to him at all, or was acquainted with him, that is certainly much too slight to be taken notice: therefore, to be sure there is no evidence in support of this prosecution.</p>

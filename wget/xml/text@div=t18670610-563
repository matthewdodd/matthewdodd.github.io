                  </hi>. I am cashier to Dimsdale, Fowler, and Bar<lb></lb>nard, of 20, Cornhill, bankers—they were agents for Nash and Neale, bankers, of Reigate, under the name of the. Reigate and Croydon Bank—it was a bank of issue—it stopped payment on 24th June, 1850—this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, dated February, 1863, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, dated May, 1863, are on genuine forms—I do not know this signature, "Philip Brooks," or the counter sig<lb></lb>nature of "Harris"—they are both signed and countersigned in the same way, and the bank had stopped long before—there were no such persons connected with it.</p>

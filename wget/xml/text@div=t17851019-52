               <p>I lost a sow pig on the 20th of September last, I saw it the same day about eleven before my door, on the outside with another, I did not miss it till night, I found the pig in Wingfield-street at the prisoner's, in the house on the further end, on the side of the bed, it was alive; I described it as a white sow, I asked him if he had such a one, he said he lost one but it was a black and white one, and had found it again, I asked him to let me look at that pig which he had, he said he would give me his word that was not the pig, I asked him to let me look at it, it was penned up in a little close place, he opened the door about half way, he said, you see the pig is not yours, immediately my white sow rushed out from behind the black and white one; it was a place parted off with some kind of laths, I did not take particular notice, it was closed off from the rest of the room, I called him a d - nd rascal, he then said it was a woman's sow, and soon after that, he said it was his own, he said he bought it of a man in a green coat, I said it was mine, and to convince him she would run home to my house, he said that was no proof, for a strange sow would run into any body's house, there was a mark in the side as if it was intended for Smithfield, he lived from me above half a mile, or three quarters; he desired me to let it rest a few days while he got the dealer he bought it of, I immediately went to the Rotation-office in Whitechapel, and brought back an officer to his house, I then offered to let it loose, and he said I should have it without that, on Monday he brought several people out of Petticoat-lane to swear to the sow, that they sold it him, strangers that I never saw in my life, I let them all look at it, and none of them would have any thing at all to do with it, but left him; I am perfectly convinced it is my sow, I have no mark, but I know it by the ring, I knew it immediately as I saw it, the sow is now at my house.</p>
               <p>By what marks do you know it? - It is all over white, except a little black over the eye, I cut the string loose, it was home five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190088"></xptr> minutes before me, I am sure the prisoner said he had but one pig at home, and that was black and white.</p>

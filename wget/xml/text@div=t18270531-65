On Saturday, the 5th of May, about five o'clock, my mare was put into a field adjoining my farm-yard - the gate was fastened as usual. I missed it myself, on Sunday morning, about four, and found it next morning, at Islington watch-house, in custody of the officer. It is worth 5l.; the prisoner is a labourer, and lived in the neighbourhood - he worked for me eighteen months ago, and knew my premises.</p>

            . I am Mr. Heath's plough-boy. I put the mare into the field, by the farm-yard, at five o'clock, on Saturday, and fastened the gate in the usual way, with a peg; she was very good-natured - at nine next morning, I found the gate open and she was gone; she always laid in that field at night. I informed my master. I have seen her since - it is the same.</p>

            . I am supervisor of the watch, at Islington. On Sunday morning, the 6th of May, at a quarter-past four o'clock. I was in the Green-lanes, near Stoke Newington-turnpike, five or six miles from Mr. Heath's, and saw the prisoner riding this mare towards the turnpike - he got off, opened the toll-gate, and let himself through, and put it too again - I went up to him and asked where he was going with the horse, he said to Islington - I asked where he got it from - he said from Southgate. I took hold of him and said I suspected he had stolen it - he resisted and tried to get from me - our noise awoke the tollman, who opened the door and I forced him into the toll-house, handcuffed him and took him to the watch-house. I found a phosphorous box, matches, a piece of candle, and a piece of brown paper, two skeleton keys, and some money, in his pockets, and in his hat I found a pair of cassimere leggings for riding - a halter was round the mans's neck, also a bridle - it is the sort of halter which horses are generally caught with, and is a shew halter, with red tape to it, to make it appear as if the horse was for sale - he had spurs on. I secured the mare till Heath claimed it - Arnold also saw it.</p>
               <p>W. HEATH. Neither the halter nor bridle are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man in the road who gave me half-a-crown to take the mare to Islington.</p>

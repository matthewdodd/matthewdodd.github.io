                  </hi>. I was a footman out of place—I live at Elam Street Rotherhithe; previous to 28th Feb. I became acquainted with the prisoner—he came to lodge with me at my sister's, at Rotherhithe—he represented himself to me as having some money, and he and I were about to enter into business—on 28th Feb. I went to the West End, to meet the landlord, and I was to meet the prisoner at the Antelope Tavern—before I met him he had showed me a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I read the cheque; this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said he was too late to get it cashed at the Bank; he asked me if I thought I could get it cashed; I said, "Yes;" and I said, "We will first go to George Austin and see him"—I asked the prisoner where he got the cheque; he said from Mr. Miller, in Copthall Court—we went to Mr. Austin,—the prisoner took the cheque from his pocket and gave it to me, and I gave it to Mr. Austin, and he took it to Mr. Haydon—the prisoner went with us—I took the cheque myself to a person I had known, Mr. Newman—I then went from there to Mr. Haydon, the butcher; I could not get it cashed there on account of their not having the cash in the house—at last, Mr. Austin went to a Mr. Mann, and he advanced 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the cheque, and the prisoner paid 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a harness and cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the London police. On Monday, 15th Feb., I went with Foulger to where the men were at work, at the new Clothworker's Hall—I went to a spot were I could see the men at work—I saw the four prisoners there; certainly three of them—I will not swear whether Field was the other man or not—Ginger and Shore were bringing lead from different parts of the roof of the building, and taking it to Jones, who was beating it up into a smaller bulk on a kind of scaffold—a portion of it he put into his own trousers, and part he put down to some one underneath, who I believe to be Field—about ten or twelve pieces were brought to him—I saw Shore unbutton his trousers, and put some lead in, I believe, from the distance I was at—that was all I saw that day—I went there between 4 and 5 o'clock, and left about twenty minutes after 5 o'clock—I went again on Tuesday, to the same place, about ten minutes before 5 o'clock—I saw the same three that I had seen before, and I believe the fourth man—I saw the lead brought by Ginger and Shore, and Jones beating it up, and putting a portion in his pockets, and putting some down to some person below—I left where I was and went into the street, and at half past 5 o'clock the gate was thrown open—I met Jones coming out of the building—I felt that he had something very bulky and heavy—I saw a portion of lead in his pockets—I asked him how he accounted for having his master's pro<lb></lb>perty—he said he took it to get some beer—I took him to the station, and found on him various pieces of lead, altogether 72lbs.—about 50lbs. was in the fall of his trousers, and the other in various pockets—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 91/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Jones gave a false address, No. 12, Robert Street, City Road—Ginger gave the address, No. 14, Windsor Street, Islington—I went there, and found a number of copper nails in a box, and a number in a jacket in the room.</p>

I went, on the Monday, with the last witness and Mr. Taylor, to a place where I could com<lb></lb>mand a view of the roof and dome of Clothworker's Hall—I saw Jones, Ginger, and Shore, and I think Field, but I cannot swear to him—Jones brought a box of lead from one part of the roof which we could not see—Shore came and got on a lower part of the scaffold—Jones beat these pieces up and put in his pocket—Ginger kept throwing pieces of lead to where these</p>

               <p>men were—I should say Jones put a dozen pieces into his pockets—I left, and went again on Tuesday evening, about 5 o'clock—I saw almost precisely what I had seen on the preceding night—Jones beating up lead and putting it in his pocket—Ginger took some lead round to another part of the building—I saw him carry one piece, which, I believe, was afterwards taken to the shop—I saw them throwing pieces of lead down to Jones, and he took it and put it about his person—I went round to the building about ten minutes or quarter past 5 o'clock—I took Field into custody, and, on returning to the building, I saw the men come out—there were about one hundred men—the plumbers and labourers were called on one side, but they made a rush to get back—I took Ginger and Shore—I found on Ginger 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a few copper nails; and on Shore 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a few copper nails—I saw Field coming out, and he went into a doorway, when he saw the police—he remained there about a minute, or perhaps a little longer—he had the top of his waistband unbuttoned—I had some communication, and took him—I found nothing on him—I took him to the station with the others—the next morning, I went to the doorway where Field had gone in, and found a piece of lead weigh<lb></lb>ing 53lbs. dropped between the joists—there was no way of getting out of the building by going in that doorway.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a plumber in Clements Lane. I am engaged in doing the plumber work at Clothworker's Hall—the four prisoners were in my employ as labourers—they all receive the same wages—in consequence of information, I went with two police officers, on Monday, 15th Feb., to the building—I went about 3 o'clock, and put myself in an office which overlooked the building—the men were at their work—about 4 o'clock, I saw Jones take his position on a part of a scaffolding at the back part of the building, and, a few minutes afterwards, Shore came forward with a quantity of lead, and handed it to Jones—about a minute afterwards, Field came forwards and he got underneath where Jones was sitting—he brought some lead, and put it on the scaffold where Jones was sitting—Ginger then came and brought some lead, and threw it on to the scaffold—Jones had a brick in his hand, and he was knocking up the lead that was brought to him—the men who brought the lead could see what he was doing; they were standing within a yard of him—he handed several pieces, nine or ten, underneath to Field—I could see Field distinctly, and could see what he did with the lead; he lapped it round his body—the lead that Jones did not give to Field, he put some into his pocket, and fastened a portion under<lb></lb>neath his stomach—I have seen the lead that was found—I have not any doubt that it is my lead—the prisoners had not any right to take it.</p>

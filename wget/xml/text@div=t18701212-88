                  </hi>. I live at Manor Cottage, Queen's Road, Peckham; in October last I was living with a person named Annie Augusta, as my wife—I was not married to her—I had been living with her three or four years—I believed that she had a child in November, 1868; the prisoner attended her as nurse in her confinement; it was a girl—I maintained the child until its death, in April, this year—Dr. Fair attended Annie Augusta, as well as the prisoner—I buried the child in my own vault—I registered its birth, and I have the register here. (<hi rend="italic">This was a copy register, from the General Registry Office, of the birth of Mary Laura Loe, on 13th November</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">the name of the father, "George James Loe Harper" and the mother, "Annie Augusta Harper, formerly Bennett" registered November</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 1868).—I did not know the surname of Annie Augusta; not positively—about two months after the death of the first child, she led me to believe she was with child; that would be some time in June—I saw the prisoner at my house about two months after she had attended the first child, and I paid her according to what I was told to pay her for attending as nurse—I saw her again on 5th October, this year, about 5.30 or 5.45 in the evening, when I went home to dinner; as I hung my coat up in the hall, and passed through into the dining-room, Annie called out to me, "George, here is Nurse Hall, ain't you going to speak to her?"—I said, "What, that wretch in my house! get out immediately, or I will kick you out!"—I used those words in consequence of something I had heard—I was very much annoyed to see her there, and I put my hat on, and walked out to the road—I altered my mind, and turned back, and went to the house, and Annie pulled me almost to pieces, and pulled my coat off my back pretty nearly; the prisoner was there, and I ordered her out of the house—she came into the dining-room, and I accused her of bringing the previous child to my house, and she got hold of my whiskers—Annie went up stairs, and the prisoner and she had some conversation—the prisoner returned, and she took hold of me with one hand, and shoved her fist in my face, and making use of very bad language, and said what she would do to me if I dared to say such a thing—she certainly frightened me for the time, till I recovered myself—she said she would smash me, and made use of very bad language—I saw Annie Augusta on the Sunday, 9th, for a few minutes; she com<lb></lb>plained she was very bad indeed, and went up stairs again—I have not seen her since the 9th—on Saturday, the 22nd, I went to Brighton by the "first train" in the morning—I was supposed to have gone for three or four days, on business—in consequence of something I received, I returned to the house on the same day, about 7 o'clock—something was told to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187012120050"></xptr>
               <p>—Collins, the nurse, spoke to me—Hall was not in the house when I got there—I saw her on the following morning, Sunday—I was waiting for the doctor to come, and I saw her come up the garden, some distance from the road—I went and opened the door, and confronted her—I said "You wretch, you brought a child to my house yesterday"—she turned round immediately, and, as she did so, she said "Oh, did I," and got out of the garden gate, and went back again towards Camberwell, as fast as she could—I called to one of my servants to follow me—I got up to the prisoner, and the said "What are you following me for?"—I said "To give you in custody"—she said "You dare not"—I said "I shall"—she turned down one street, and when she found I followed her, she turned round and came back into the road again—we turned into several streets, and she went to the Queen's Road Station, I went up, and said she should not have a ticket, and she left; as she came out from the station she stopped an omnibus that was passing, and got in—I got on the top of it—I could not find a policeman—she went in the omnibus about three-quarters of a mile, quite the reverse way of her own home, and when the omnibus stopped, she got out and called a cab—when she got in the cab, I dared the cabman to take her—he said he must take the fare—I called another cab, and drove after her towards Peckham; as she got to the Peckham Station, we got in front, and stopped her cab, and I called a policeman, and gave her in custody—I then went home, and found the child in the house—that was between 8 and 9 o'clock—Annie Augusta left the house the same night, and I have not seen her since—Collins, the nurse, had charge of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mean really to say I have not seen her since the 9th October—I have not the slightest idea where she is—I have heard from her since; about a week or ten days ago—I have not got the letter—I believe I destroyed it—there was no date, and no name to it—it was left at my office about a week ago—it had an envelope—it did not come through the post—I did not say anything to the police about it—I considered Annie a very beautiful woman, and I was very fond of her; I was also very fond of the little girl that died, believing it to be mine—when I was home I always slept with her—my business took me away at times—sometimes I was away for a week or ten days—I was very sorry when the child died, till I knew it was not my own child—I should have been very pleased if Annie had had Another child, if It had been mine—the first time I knew Annie she went by the name of Bennett; but it was only an assumed name, Mrs. Bennett—on my oath I did not know her surname—my name is not Harper, and never was—I made the register—I gave my name, address, profession, and every<lb></lb>thing—I put "Harper," because I was asked to do it by the supposed mother, because I believe there was some property it was entitled to, and she asked me to do it—I did not want to make the Registrar and the public believe I was married to her—I don't know the reason—I went and got a copy of the register, and produce it here—I did not wish them to believe she was my wife—I registered it myself—I believe it was put down en a piece of paper why I should do it—I had never registered a child before—I was to register it because it was necessary—my name "George James Loe," is on the register—I don't know why I registered it as Harper—my name is not Harper—my name is there "George James Loe Harper"—I never lived as George James Loe Bennett—I never assumed the name of Bennett—Annie assumed the name of Bennett; I went by my own name—I never knew her name was Harper—I mean what I say that I registered that, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187012120051"></xptr>
               <p>I believe it is perfectly right, with the exception of the name of Harper—she told me to sign it as Harper—when we went to live at Queen's Road, Annie assumed the name of Mrs. Loe; I never told anyone she was my wife—she had money when she wanted it—she might have paid some debts for me—I used to give her a cheque when she wanted money, and made it payable to the grocer or butcher—I never made them payable to order—I think I can swear I never did—I slept with her during the time I believed her to be in the family-way—she did not sleep with her clothes on; certainly not—I engaged a medical man for her, and I believed her to be in the family-way within a month of her alleged confinement—I should imagine Annie was in a bad tamper on the evening when she was tearing me to pieces—I have got some clerks—Annie did not throw an inkstand at one of the clerks; it would be me that was out of temper, not Annie—I was very much out of temper—I did not throw an inkstand; I should not forget myself as much as that—there was no inkstand thrown; there is not the slightest foundation for saying so—I may say Annie had never been to my office; I don't think she had ever seen one of my clerks, therefore I don't know what you mean; it was at my house where Mrs. Hall was, where they tore me to pieces—no inkstand was thrown at my house, that I recollect—the day Mrs. Hall was there I said "I would rather put my head under the railway-train than that woman should be in my house"—there was a beefsteak in the house that day; Mrs. Hall had some of it in the dining-room—I did not drink wine with her—she might have had some; I believe she did—they had some sherry before I got there; it was never locked up—I did not tell her on the 5th October that Annie was in a passion, and would be better after a bit—I was in a passion—I think it might have been that Annie told Mrs. Hall I was in a passion, and would be better after a bit—I did get better—I don't think I got so much better as to go down to the kitchen and tell the servant to keep the beefsteak hot for Mrs. Hall—I can't say whether I went into the kitchen or not; I think it was most likely to keep my own dinner warm—I had not had my dinner; the prisoner had some in the dining-room—you don't suppose I should sit down, too—I was walking about—I swear that I did not have some at the same time—I don't believe I told the servant to keep the beefsteak warm for Mrs. Hall—it is very possible that I had some wine at the same time she did—if there was any wine on the table I daresay I took some—I did not tell Mrs. Hall, when she went out of the room, that if I required her I would write to her—I did write to her the next day, and dared her to set her foot in my house again—I enclosed a directed envelope to her—when I ordered her out that night I challenged her with regard to the first child—I put this piece of newspaper in the letter, and requested her to return it; it is a report of the Skeplehorn's case—in that letter I dared her to put her foot in my place, and said if she was an honest woman, when she found that it made it unpleasant, she would never attempt to do such a thing—I received the piece of newspaper back from her—I received a telegram when I was at Brighton; not from one of the servants—they did not know about the child coming to the house—the nurse Collins is here—when I came up, on the 22nd October, I went into the dining-room—it was about 7.30—Collins came into the room, and said "This is a bad job, Mr. Loe"—I said "What, Collins?"—she said "There is a baby in the house, but Mrs. Loe has never been confined; and the doctor is of the same opinion"—I believe those were her words—they told me the doctor was coming that night, and I waited for him, and I was waiting for him</p>

               <p>the next morning, when the prisoner came to the gate; no one went up to Annie from 9 o'clock in the evening till 8 o'clock the next morning, and she never asked for anything—Mrs. Hall was arrested a little before 1 o'clock, as the people were coming out of church—I never saw Annie go—I saw her last on Sunday, 9th October—I don't know what time she left the house—I did not dine with her on the day the prisoner was given into custody; certainly not—from what the servants said, she must have gone about 4 or 5 o'clock—Mrs. Hall was supposed to have nursed Annie with the first child; she was there as nurse, and I paid her as nurse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went to Manor Cottage in February, 1869—I had lived there before for eight or nine years—I have a long lease of it—I have never passed by any other name than George James Loe—I have a son twenty-four years of age—he passes by the name of Loe—I lost my wife in the summer of 1868, and after that Annie Augusta came to live with me—I had not lived with her before that—I had visited her—she was under my protection—I bought a house for her in Font Street, Kennington—the prisoner went by the name of Mrs. Jones when she nursed Annie, in 1868—she was in the house three or four days—she came in and out, not like a regular nurse—I paid her for waiting on Annie Augusta, and I paid the doctor for his attendance—Dr. Farr was the doctor on that occasion, the same gentleman who attended her on the second occasion—until I received the paper of which I have spoken, I had the fullest belief that I was the father of the child that came to my house in November, 1868, and died in April—I was in no way a party to this child being brought to the house in October this year—I did not suggest or connive at the bringing of that child by Mrs. Hall—I believe when I went home on 5th October, Mrs. Hall did have some beefsteak and wine—that was before she pulled me by the beard—Annie Augusta had struck me before that, because I ordered the woman out of the house—I said I would go for a policeman, and she got hold of my coat to prevent my going—my coat was torn completely up the back—I gave Mrs. Hall something in the dining-room, and then I charged her with having brought the first child, and it was then that she took hold of me.</p>

               <p>generally twice a week—on Saturday, 22nd October, I was sent for between 12 and 1 o'clock—I went to Manor Cottage, and saw Annie Augusta in the dining-room—to all appearance she was in pain—I went up stairs, and I did several things necessary for such an occasion—she then told me she was getting better, and I could go home, and she would send for me again when she wanted me—I was sent for between 3 and 4 o'clock—I went directly to the house—the housemaid met me at the door, and told me Mrs. Hall was there—I went up stairs, and rapped at Mrs. Loe's bedroom door, and then opened it—I went in, and Mrs. Loe was sitting at the side of the bed, undressing—Mrs. Hall said I was not wanted yet; when she wanted me she would call me—I had never seen Mrs. Hall before that—I went out of the room, and she locked the door, and I went down stairs—about half-an-hour afterwards Mrs. Hall called for a jug of hot water—I took it up into the room, and Mrs. Hall said the baby was born—I went out of the room—she called me back a few minutes after, and produced what generally is produced after stich an occasion, what is called the after-birth—Mrs. Loe was lying on the bed at that time—the prisoner told me to get some water to wash the child—I got the water in the next room, and she brought the baby in—she said she would wash it—I told her I would wash it if I should have to do with the child after—she handed me the child, and as soon as I sat down to wash it, I knew that it had been washed, and had not been born then—it did not present the appearance of a newly-born, unwashed child—I washed the child—I did not say anything to the prisoner about it—I saw Mr. Loe soon after he arrived home, but I saw Dr. Farr first, and I made a communication to him—I spoke to Mr. Loe afterwards—I stayed in the house till 12 o'clock on the Saturday night, and had the care of the child the greater part of that time—after I had washed it, it was taken in the bedroom and put in bed with Mrs. Loe—I had it again afterwards, during the evening—it was in a state of stupor; it was insensible, it never cried—I was there all day on Sunday, and it did not cry till Monday morning—if a child an hour or two old was taken from the mother out into the air it would not affect it in such a wayas that—I stayed there very late on Sunday night, and was back early on Monday morning—there were no other appear<lb></lb>ances which led me to believe that the child had not been born in the house, except that it was washed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine and Licentiate of the College of Surgeons, practising at 20, West Square, Southwark—I have known Mr. Loe, and the person who lived with him as Mrs. Loe, for about three years—I attended her in her confinement in November, 1868—I saw a child on that occasion—I did not deliver her—she had been confined before I arrived, and I did not see her till the next day—the prisoner was the nurse on that occasion—I did not know her name—that child died in April in the present year—soon after that I had a conversation with Mrs. Loe as to her condition—she spoke to me about the death of the child, and she said "What makes it more unfortunate for me just now is, I am about three months gone again"—I saw her about six times between then and October—I was engaged to attend her—on Saturday, 22nd October, I was sent for to Manor Cottage, about 4.30—I got there about 5.30—I went up to the bedroom; the door was locked and was opened by the prisoner—</p>

               <p>Mrs. Loe was in bed—the prisoner said "It is all over, doctor; it is a little girl," and she immediately brought me the after-birth, and said, "See here is the after-birth," almost immediately I entered the room—nothing was being done to Mrs. Loe at that time; I went to her and said "This is very quick, Mrs. Loe, how are you?"—she seemed too ill to speak for a little time—I took hold of her hand and felt her pulse, and she was not what one would expect to find immediately after giving birth to a child; and in a minute or two she turned her head and said "Oh, is it my doctort"—I said "Yes, how are you"—she said "I am dreadfully bad, I have been very bad indeed"—she said she had so much pain in the stomach—I said "Let me feel where the pain is"—she said "No, don't touch me, I am in too much pain now"—the prisoner was in the room all the time—I then went down stairs, and went up again in about an hour—the process of bandaging was then going on—at that time I had made up my mind that it was not her child—I stood with my back to the fire, rather amused at the operation—she screamed out very much—the prisoner said "It must be done; after this is put nicely on, and the doctor has prescribed some medicine for you, you will be all right"—Hall then collected the soiled linen about the room and went out—I locked the door and said to Mrs. Loe "The presence of that woman has given me a strong suspicion that matters are not all right, and I wish to have a little serious conversation with you"—she said "Good God, doctor, what do you meant"—I said "I mean to say that you have never given birth to this child"—she said "Good God, do you mean to drive me mad with the very idea of the thing"—I said I did not wish to give her any pain, but they were my suspicions, and before I left the house I must convince myself of it—I said "Do you intend to nurse this child," and she said "Yes"—I said "Well, then, let me see your breasts"—I ex<lb></lb>amined them and said "Now I must make a further examination"—she said "I can't allow you to do it to-day, in the state that I am in, but you shall to-morrow"—I said "Well, now you know what I think about this matter, and I am afraid it is a very serious matter"—I opened the door and Hall came in—I said to her "Where do you live?"—she said "Where I always have lived"—I said "That is no answer to my question; I want to know where you live"—Mrs. Loe then said "No. 6, Cold Harbour Lane"—I said "I take you to be a very good-for-nothing woman, and if Mr. Loe was at home he would kick you out of the house"—I left the room and went down stairs, and almost immediately after the prisoner left the home—I went into the nursery, the room adjoining Mrs. Loe's bedroom, and there I saw the baby—it was a fine, well-developed child, but seemed very pale, and the extremities were very cold—I opened the eyelids and looked at the eye—it seemed to me in such a state of stupor, that I was under the impression something had been given to it—the ball of the eye was very much contracted, and the child really seemed to have very little life in it—I was under the impression some narcotic had been given to it—I told Collins to warm it by the fire, and rub its hands and feet, and then I left the house—from what I saw I should say that Mrs. Loe had not given birth to a child; certainly not—I should say she never had—I examined her breasts, that was all—there was no milk in them—I tried to put my hand on the stomach, but she would not allow me to—I saw the child again on the Sunday, between 2 and 3 o'clock—I was told it had not cried or taken any food, and it still seemed to be under the influence of some narcotic—it was wanner than when I saw it on Saturday—I heard that the prisoner had</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Craven-street. Churchill was my house-maid, and Willis my cook—I went out at half-past twelve o'clock on the 11th of Oct.—a lady who was boarding at my house asked for the keys of my cellar—I gave them to her—I went out, and was absent for half an hour—when I returned the lady gave me the keys, and I immediately locked them in my escrutoire—I went out to visit some friends—I returned and knocked for several minutes, and then Willis opened the door—I asked her where Churchill was—she said she was up stairs—I went up, but could not find her—I went out again to order some oil, and when I returned I had the same trouble to get in—Willis at last opened the door to me—I could not find Churchill—at half-past six o'clock Willis told me that Churchill was ill in bed—I went into her room, and found Churchill there—she was so tipsy that she could not hold up her head—I sent for a surgeon, and he said it was a case which required no medical treatment, it was drunkenness—the room was strewed with broken bottles and wine-Willis was drunk, too, but she was able to walk about—I have no doubt that the wine was mine—I went down, and attempted to turn the key of the wine-cellar, and it would not turn—I then pulled the door, and it was open, and not locked—I missed three or four dozen of wine, which I had seen safe the day before—while we were eating cold meat, W'illis went out and returned with a drunken man in a cook's dress, and called him her brother—she was very impudent, and wanted me to pay her her wages—I said I should not that night—she went away with the man, and stayed all night—she came the next morning and demanded her wages—I went down to the coal-cellar, and under the coals I found this one bottle of wine.</p>

                  </hi>. At half-past twelve o'clock I was at this house. I had the keys, and went into the cellar for some soda water, and when I came out I had a bottle of wine in each hand, which I was going to put down, and Willis said, "Shall I lock the door for you?"—I said, "Yes," and I suppose she did not—she gave me the keys—I saw the prisoners in the course of the evening—Willis was very violent, and Churchill appeared as if she had been up the chimney.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of it to know whether it was your pig or not? - A. Yes; I am sure it was my pig; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p> - HARDY sworn. - I keep a potato-shop: The prisoner brought a pig into the market for sale, I bought it of him; Mr. Alcock came to me about twelve o'clock; the prisoner asked twelve shillings for it, I gave him eleven shillings; then Mr. Alcock came and claimed it; the next morning the prisoner was found, and I went before Alderman Perchard, and identified the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Alcock). When did you see the pig after you had lost it? - A. The Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. The pig might have been taken astray for any thing you know? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from Billingsgate with some oysters, and in Fenchurch-street this pig was running along, and several people running to catch it; several people owned it; I said, nobody should have the pig, I would take care of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010916-24-verdict118" type="verdictDescription">

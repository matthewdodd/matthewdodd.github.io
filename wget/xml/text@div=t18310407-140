             - we live in Andrew cottage, Hornsey-road. On the 19th of February I put this property into the basket - it was put into a cart to go to Ely-place, Holborn; the boy who drove the cart is not here - it was a square cart, without a tilt, but about three feet deep; I was in the cart, and saw the basket safe about five minutes before it was taken - it could not have fallen out; the tail-board was up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live with my father, who keeps the Five Inkhorns public-house, in Shoreditch; I was returning home, and saw this in the road; I took it up; when the officer took me I said I did not know what I had got; I deny that I whistled, and who dropped it I do not know.</p>

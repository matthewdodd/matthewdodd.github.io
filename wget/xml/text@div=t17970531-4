               <p>Q. Did you know it to be the same when it came back from Yarmouth? - A. Yes; by its being a good deal torn, and I took particular notice of the names and number.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about his person? - A. Not the least; as soon as the prisoner had got out, I felt a something, I cannot tell what, that led me to follow the prisoner at the bar; I immediately took my hat, and followed him through Norton falgate, up the Curtain-road, and I saw him go down a small passage; he knocked at the door, or rung the bell, I do not know which; as soon as the door was shut, I took particular notice of the house; my master carried the note to Messrs.

               <p>Q. Consequently you took no particular notice of it, but that it was a country Bank note? - A. I took particular notice that it was torn, and I took particular notice of the writing; all the names I took very particular notice of.</p>

               <p>Q. Though you had never seen the hand-writing but once, you undertake to swear positively to it? - A. I mean to swear that that is the same bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Your name was not upon it till after it came from the banker's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you take such particular notice of the writing? - A. No farther than I had looked at it, and I knew the writing again.</p>
               <p>Q. To howmany places of the name of Yarmouth did you send? - A. Only one, in the county of Norfolk.</p>

             sworn. - On Saturday evening the 11th of March, when I came home, the circumstance of a note having been taken, goods sold, and change given, was made known to me, and the note presented to me by Thomas Hall; I had a strong suspicion that it was forged, I took particular notice of the note, and kept it until Tuesday, when I delivered it to Messrs. Harcourt and Co. bankers, Lombard-street; it was brought back to me by one of their clerks, and put into my hand; I can swear positively to its being the same note; I shewed it to the Magistrates in Worship-street, and gave it to Thomas Hall again; I did not mark it till Friday last.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mark it then? - A. Because it was going to Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. They were your goods? - A. Yes; the goods are in Court now, I can swear to the goods, they have my private mark upon them, they were found at Harriman's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have undertaken to tell us, that the cloth was found there, when you were not there to know any thing about it; now, I take it for granted, that you had no suspicion of this note when you sent it to your bankers? - A. I had a very strong suspicion on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you sent it to your banker's as a good bill? - A. I sent it in as I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you told the bankers you had any suspicion of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was natural enough, if a man had a suspicion, that he should tell that suspicion? - A. No, it does not follow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you undertake to swear to that handwriting? - A. Yes; and that is the identical bill I received from my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been mixed with a good many other bills, after you had sent it to your bankers? - A. Yes; but the bankers enter every bill separately in their books, it was only twenty-four hours out of my hands, and I will swear positively, that it is the identical bill given to me by my servant, on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some linen found at this man's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what shape did that appear? - A. Cut up, with a private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you sell all your pieces with your private mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that that piece of linen, which you did not sell yourself, but was sold by your shopman, was found at the prisoner's house? - A. No; but I mean to swear that that was my piece of linen.</p>

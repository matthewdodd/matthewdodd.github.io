               <p>was standing at the corner of Princes Street, about 10 o'clock—there were several people there, and I saw the prisoner amongst them—he was watch<lb></lb>ing ladies as they were passing by—there was a great crush to get round the corner to look at the illuminations in front of the Mansion House—the prisoner followed Mrs. Cooksey behind, and put his arm underneath her's, and felt where ladies carry their watches—he fell back, and placed himself by her side, and put his hand between the folds of her dress, he instantly withdrew it, and passed something from the left hand to the right, and put it into his right hand coat pocket—I spoke to Mrs. Cooksey, and from what she said to me, I communicated with Kenniston, another officer—I then took hold of the prisoner, dragged him out of the crowd, and put my hand in his right hand coat pocket, and took out this knife, which was afterwards identified by Mrs. Cooksey, and I took him to the station, and I found on him two other knives and a latch key.</p>

I am the wife of John Cooksey, and live at 68, Balls Pond Road—on the night of the 29th of April I was in Princes Street, near the Mansion House, about 10 o'clock—I was looking at the illuminations—I did not feel anyone's hand <hi rend="italic">in my</hi> pocket—I felt <hi rend="italic">someone</hi> put their hands round my waist, but I could not say that it was the prisoner—I requested them to remove their hands—I could not see who it was, the crowd was too great—the constable spoke to me afterwards, and I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my knife—I had seen it safe at 6 o'clock in the evening—this is my knife—I did not see it taken from the prisoner.</p>

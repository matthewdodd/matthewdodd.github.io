                  </hi>. I reside in Hooper-street, Red Lion-square. I have some property in the neighbourhood of Romford, in Essex—I was living at Brixton in 1842—I had occasion to build some houses at Romford and Brentwood—Mr. Edwards introduced me to the prisoner, and he entered into a contract with me for taking some land, and building houses upon it—I adv<lb></lb>anced him money weekly to pay his men, and on other occasions—in March and April, 1843, he borrowed money of me—he borrowed 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; for a parti<lb></lb>cular purpose—he said there was an innkeeper to whom be owed some money, and I think he had a bill due for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and begged I would let him have 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to pay it—I gave him a check for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he said Mr. Pain had disappointed him in a loan or payment of money to him, and on the following Wednesday he would bring me the 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he never returned that money to me—he con<lb></lb>tinued working for me for about three months—his advances from time to time became much greater than the work he had done, and I found him in great difficulties, so that he could not keep on the spot to look after his men—when I applied to him about the 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, he said he would get me a bill of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; of Mr. Pain's, at two months' date—I had never seen Mr. Pain—I had heard of him by name, and believed him to be a respectable man, a surveyor—no particular time was named for the bill—it went on from week to week, I be<lb></lb>came alarmed, and pressed him to bring me Mr. Pain's bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—on the 17th of May he brought me this bill at two months for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, stating that Mr. Pain refused to give a bill for more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and for a less period than three months—this is the bill—(<hi rend="italic">bill read</hi>)—he told me previously where Mr. Pain lived—when the bill became due, it was presented through my bankers—I never got the money.</p>

               <p>North Brixton—the acceptance to this bill it not in my handwriting—I have no recollection of authorising the prisoner to accept this bill, and sign my name to it—I know the prisoner—he has done several jobs for me, and others I have recommended him to.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you think you may have used such language as may have justified him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my meaning—he might certainly think he was justified in using my name—in his own idea he might think so.</p>

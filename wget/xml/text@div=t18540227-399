                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 3, Union-court, Tooley-street. On a Saturday night, in the early part of last month, I went into the Red Lion, Princes-street, Westminster, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I was there before 10 o'clock—the persons there were all strangers to me—the prisoner came in some time after me—I had never seen him before—he produced four oranges, and said he would lay them against 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he produced a teetotum, and said that any number exceeding four I was to win, and any number under four I was to lose—I spun for three or six times on those terms, but did not win—I lost 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the oranges—the prisoner then told the company he would spin for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I put a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down against his upon the same terms as before—the prisoner spun, but I might have done it if I liked—I lost, and I then played again, and lost—I then played again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270067"></xptr>
               <p>—I won once, but I lost 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I stopped in the taproom, and I think a man named Hibbard played on the cards next; he had been there part of the time I had been playing—he then played with the teetotum—I bet 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and he bet 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down—I lost, and then I bet with the same party, and won—I do not know whether Hibbard won or lost—I had worked with him previously—I did not go into the house with him that night—I did not play with the cards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 62). I received instructions from Barritt and Hibbard to take the prisoner, I found him in the taproom of the Red Lion—I found in his pocket this teetotum, and these cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave them to the inspector.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, B</hi>). I produce the teetotum and cards—I have examined the teetotum, it has numbers on it from one to eight; the high and low numbers appear alternately—it is a perfect simple cheat, on one end of it on the low numbers the edges are bevelled, and nineteen times out of twenty it will not throw more than four, if it is spun on that end; then when you turn it the other way the handle moves, and it will never throw lower than five if you spin it on the high—I believe that the peg is generally stationary, but the effect would be the same whether you move the pivot or not—if you want to spin high of course you will spin on the high part, and then it will not throw less than five—I have tried it repeatedly, and found that result.</p>

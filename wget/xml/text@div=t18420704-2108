                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the Twopenny Post-office. On Tuesday morning 21st of June, I was on duty in the letter-carrier's office, about half-past eight or twenty minutes before nine o'clock—I was engaged in sorting letters, and in the course of my sorting, the letter now produced, came into my hand, addressed to Mr. Uranus—it was sorted to me by Merritt, who said it contained cash—in consequence of what Merritt told me, I gave the letter to Gauntlett, my assistant, and told him it was a cash-letter—the prisoner was sitting by me, on my right, and Gauntlett was sitting opposite me—the prisoner was sorting on my right hand-side, as near as the seats could stand—soon after Gauntlett called me aside, and laid, "I have lost the money-letter"—in consequence of that all the let<lb></lb>ter-carriers of our division were ordered into the inspector's room—there were thirteen or fourteen of them, and the prisoner was one—to go into the inspector's room, you have to pass through the supernumeraries-room—there is a partition between the supernumeraries'-room and the in<lb></lb>spector's room, and on entering the inspector's room, there are two steps—I went up them, and when I got on the top step my face was turned to<lb></lb>wards the supernumeraries' room, and I observed the prisoner on my right side—he was on the floor below me, and close by a table on which there stood a box, about seven inches from a partition—I observed the prisoner take this letter from some letters which he had in his left hand—he pushed it along the table, and hid it behind the box—I got down from the steps, and said, "There is the letter, I saw Hunt put it there"—I looked behind the box, and found this letter—it is the one I had before given to Gauntlett—the prisoner was too confused to say anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the Twopenny-post-office; I have been employed there nearly eight years. On the 21st of June, I was on duty at the office—Mr. Hewitt was there, and the prisoner—I remember Mr. Hewitt giving me a letter containing cash, addressed to Mr. Uranius, No. #, Crane-court, Fleet-street"—I put it on one side</p>

               <p>of me—it remained there about twenty minutes—I then left to get some letters from another office—I gave some of them to Hewitt, some to another man, and the remainder to the prisoner; and I believe this letter was in the packet of letters which I gave to the prisoner, for when I received it, I put it down on the desk with another letter, and when I brought the packet of letters from the other office, I laid them down on these two letters, I then gave two parcels to two other persons, and the last parcel I gate to the prisoner—if he had received this letter with the parcel which I gave him, he ought to have sorted this into the Farringdon-walk letter boxes—there are six of them, and one of them is for the division which I deliver, and be ought to have put it into that box—I took the letters out of that box in about a minute after I had given the parcel of letters to the prisoner, and this letter was not there, but the other letter that I had pot down with this one was—I then asked Mr. Hewitt if he had this letter, as I had lost it—I went round the division to see if it had made its way into any of the other Farringdon boxes—I could not find it, and I made a report to Mr. Payne that I had lost it—he ordered all the letter-carriers into the inspector's room—that order was given loud enough for all to hear—they all went but the prisoner, he remained behind, he did not go imme<lb></lb>diately—I said to him, "Come, you must come with your letters as well as the rest; you know you must come"—he then took up his letters, and came from the division where he had been sitting towards the inspector's room—he followed me—Hewitt was half a dozen paces before—I went on, and passed Hewitt just as he got to the door, and I had not been in a second before Hewitt cried out, "There is Hunt putting a letter behind that box"—I turned as soon as I could, and saw Hewitt get down the steps, and take away a letter from the box—it was handed to Mr. Payne, the inspector, and he handed it to the President—he asked me if that was the letter I bad lost—I told him it was—at the time Mr. Hewitt took the letter, I saw the prisoner—he appeared very much confused for the moment, and after a short pause, he said, "I did not put it there"—Hewitt and I have been on the same beat very near four yean—the pri<lb></lb>soner's beat joins ours—I do not recollect that he, and Hewitt, and I have been in company except as letter-carriers—I have requested the prisoner to deliver my letters on one or two occasions, when be has been pawing a house which I have got a letter for—I have not heard Hewitt ask him to do so, but I have asked him in the presence of Hewitt—I think he has refined to take a letter for me—perhaps he has not had a letter near the house, and he has said, "I can't take it for you this time"—I have never heard him refuse Hewitt.</p>

            . I know the poor-house. On the 16th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw Elizabeth Charles, Stokes, and Purdy, on the top of the premises - Hill was at the bottom, throwing up the bundles to Purdy; the matron was out of the way at the time; the prisoners left the house the same evening.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>CORDWELL's Defence. We were washing on Monday afternoon; after tea, Stokes asked us to go away, and said she would get us work, and keep us till we got it; Charles then went into the yard, and got the linen - they were put in bundles, and at night we got over the wall: we went to Putney, and there they pawned two sheets; we then went to Wandsworth - we slept at the King's Arms; on the Monday morning they pawned one sheet at Mr. Butcher's, and two flannel petticoats, one shirt, and three hankerchiefs; Charles pawned the handkerchiefs in her own name, and Stokes the rest: we went to Chelsea next day, and then Stokes took two old sheets, and sold them, but I do not know to whom: on the Tuesday they ran away, and I never saw them till Thursday, when I saw Stokes, and asked what she had done with the duplicates; she he had said, burnt them; I was away a fortnight, and then I thought I had better give myself up, and suffer a little, and give up the company I was in.</p>
               <p>PURDY's Defence. Stokes asked if I would run away? I said, I had such a bad jacket; she said, "I will buy you a jacket in Chelsea;" Stokes tied up the bundles; I saw them take three pieces of soap, which they sold in Jew's-row; they then went to the Rose and Crown public-house, and took the shirts - I was going away, but they would not let me.</p>
               <p>HILL's Defence. I was down in the garden while the other prisoners were getting over; I asked where they were going? they did not answer; I never went away.</p>

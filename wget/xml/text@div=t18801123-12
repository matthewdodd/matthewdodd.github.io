                  </hi>. I live at 139, East India Road, Poplar—I am the manager of the Richard Green Permanent Building Society, and have been since its formation—the society carries on business at 95 and 96, Fenchurch Street—I produce the certificate of incorporation; it was estab<lb></lb>lished in July, 1866; it receives money on deposit at interest and advances money on mortgage—the prisoner was originally a clerk in the society, and has been there about 11 years; during the last two years he has been chief clerk and cashier—the usual custom is when money is paid in to enter it in the deposit book, and the person who receives it signs for it—those entries are made and signed by the prisoner—it was the custom for the person paying in money to sign the counter book, which was kept at the office—I produce the counter books for July, September, and May—I have looked through them, and there is no entry of the receipt of these sums—there was a till book, which it was the prisoner's duty to keep; that ought to contain an entry of the aggregate amount received during the day—I have examined the till book for these three days, and there is no entry of the receipt of either of these sums—it would be the prisoner's duty to enter in the deposit journal the money received from a customer—these three sums of Mr. Delves's are not entered there—it would be the prisoner's duty to post or cause to be posted from the deposit journal into the depositor's ledger, so as to credit each particular customer with the amount paid—I find in the ledger an entry on 1st July of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the heading of "Mr. Delves's account" in the prisoner's writing, with a re<lb></lb>ference to folio 356 in the deposit journal, from which it purports to be posted—there is no such entry in the deposit journal—I find 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered on 30th August; there is no entry of it on 2nd September, that is the only 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered about that date; it is in the handwriting of Lucas, who was a clerk under the prisoner at that time—there is a reference to folio 357—there is no such entry in the deposit journal—on 4th July, 1879, I find an entry of 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoner, with a reference to folio 388; I have referred to that, and find no such entry—the till book, the deposit journal, and the counter book would be the books in which the prisoner would be called upon to account to the society—if a customer came and wanted money, I should turn to the depositors' ledger to see what was standing to his credit.</p>

               <p>to enter the sums received in the counter book, then they would be carried into the deposit journal, and from there posted into the ledger—the till book would show the amount that was supposed to be in the counter book—the prisoner would make the entry in the counter book, to save the depositor the trouble, but the party would sign it; it was supposed to be filled up by the person who paid the money; it would not be initialled by any person; it is simply the entry of the customer himself, nothing else—it was the prisoner's duty to keep that book—the till book would be made up from the total which had been signed for by the persons who had paid during the day—there would not be an entry of each sum; it would show the aggregate of the day's takings—the deposit journal would be the next book, the prisoner kept that; that ought to contain an entry corresponding with the entry in the counter book; then there is the ledger, the prisoner kept that—those are all the books relating to mem<lb></lb>bers' accounts—in these two cases there is no entry till you come to the deposit journal—there would be the entry in the depositors own book—the depositor's book would come to the society from time to time to be looked at and made up—if that had been compared with the counter book the fraud would be at once discovered—the entries in the journal would not always be in Lucas's writing, nearly always—the entries in the deposit ledger would be principally by the prisoner, sometimes by Lucas—the manager's duties, according to rule, are "to attend punctually all meetings of the society, and assist in receiving subscriptions and all other moneys due to the society, and shall keep all books and papers belonging to the society, and shall at such meetings enter into a minute-book an account of the business transacted, and the names of the persons forming such meeting; he shall also keep the account-books, in a proper manner, and shall have the entire management of the society's affairs, under the control of the board of directors"—I had the entire management—the society had a right to lend me money in my private capacity if they thought proper, and they did, 19,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—each loan I had from the society was duly proposed at a meeting of the board of directors; they were quite aware of it—the proposals were generally put before the board in writing—the board consisted of eight directors—the minute-book would show my pro<lb></lb>posals to borrow—it is here—it was kept by the manager, myself—the entries would be in my writing, confirmed by the board—the 19,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was borrowed for a building speculation of mine at Bromley-by-Bow—I did not put 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the society's money in the prisoner's father's busi<lb></lb>ness; none of it, that I swear; the 19,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all for the building speculation—this is the entry of 28th December, 1876: "Mr. Mayes having submitted a proposal to borrow 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per house on 24 houses to be erected in Blair Street, Bromley, etc., it was moved by Mr. Jones, seconded by Mr. Meredith, and carried, that the sum of 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per house be advanced at the rate of six per cent., repayable in three years, the interest to be payable quarterly, subject to the sample house being approved of by the surveying committee"—there may be a subsequent entry to that—the next entry is of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the manager's salary—I should suppose my salary would be about 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was not fixed, I was paid by a commission of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per share on every share existing and subscribed for during the year—I was only a shareholder as a borrower; I was a shareholder—I don't think I held any scrip at that time—the directors present at that meeting are not directors now;</p>

               <p>they retried in August I think, not when this advance was made to me, nothing connected with me; a loss of money had been sustained, and the question was as to the best way of meeting the difficulty, whether to wind up the society, or to adopt some other plan; there was no question about the directors retiring at that moment; the directors recommended the winding up, and I protested against it, believing it would be a most in<lb></lb>judicious thing to do; the shareholders were not disposed to wind up, and the directors consequently retired, because their management was not satisfactory, in consequence of the loss that had been sustained while I was manager—there was an inquiry as to my conduct in the matter after" the new directors had been appointed—that appears in the minute book (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the detectives employed had called attention to the fact that cer<lb></lb>tain Bank of England notes given in cashing some of the society cheques had been paid in to Mr. Mayes's private banking account; that Mr. Mayes was called upon to give an explanation, which he immediately did, to the entire satisfaction of the committee.</hi>) That is in my handwriting—I did not word that minute, the original was written by Mr. Watts, the chairman—when depositors wanted to withdraw sums of money, they had to send in a notice of with<lb></lb>drawal—I believe the prisoner is charged with making fictitious notices of withdrawal, and keeping the money, all of which I was quite ignorant of—I knew nothing of the misappropriation of the deposits, or of the fictitious notices of withdrawal—I do not know that the sums alleged to be embezzled went to meet the withdrawal of sums which had been already embezzled; I was quite ignorant of it—the accounts were gone through by Cooper Brothers at the request of the directors—I believe it appears that on 18th September Mr. Watts lodged a notice of with drawal, and that a cheque was drawn avowedly for the payment of Mr. Watts, but that the proceeds of that cheque was never paid to him—it is quite possible that a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, the proceeds of that cheque, was paid in to my bank; I have heard so—I have no reason to doubt that a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, the proceeds of that cheque, was also paid in to my account on that same day—the finance sheets will show the sum that Mr. Watts was alleged to have withdrawn on that date—(<hi rend="italic">Referring</hi>) it is 204<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a cheque for that amount was drawn by the prisoner, and signed by two directors, and countersigned by myself—I presume it was an open cheque; this is it—cheques were never made to order unless there was some special request for it—on the same day a cheque was drawn for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in favour of four parties, Hawkins, Amor, Cave, and Newman, and another for 162<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is quite likely that 558<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of those three cheques found their way into my banking account, but I knew nothing of any fraud—on 17th October I find that a cheque for 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn—I believe Mr. Watts was paid that amount—there is also an entry of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that same day, also 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 196<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think that the greater portion of those are alleged to have been fraudulent withdrawals; some of them, I should think, were—it is quite likely that a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and two 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, notes, the proceeds of those cheques, found their way into my tanking account—on 10th July, 1879, I find a notice of withdrawal of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., alleged to be a fictitious withdrawal—I have no entry of 204<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have 257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I can't answer whether a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, the proceeds of those cheques, found their way into my banking account, but it is quite likely they did—I don't know whether those are</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not in the service of the society—I was not employed under the prisoner—Mr. Mayes was my master—I assume that the entry of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made from somebody's dictation—I would not say that Mr. Mayes did not tell me to make the entry; I may explain that these things are so long ago that I cannot remember now exactly—I generally used to attend to the counter work, you will find most of the entries in the counter book, in my handwriting—I should think there are close upon 2,000 open accounts in this society—each customer would have his deposit book—he would send it to be made up from time to time, or he would make the deposit, and bring his book at another time, to be compared with the society's books—Mr. Mayes was the manager of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of Cooper Brothers, accountants, 14, George Street, Mansion House—I was directed to make an investigation of the books of this society—I was first employed in January this year—I made out a list of certain entries, and afterwards went through it with the prisoner—I think the first time I met him was on 11th May, but I believe he met us again on the following day—I have the list here, it is a list of what appeared to be defalcations—we went through it at Messrs. Cooper's office—I went through item by item and asked the prisoner to explain each item—I had all the books that I considered necessary—I did not refer to them for every item, but when it was necessary to refer—among others I called his attention to Delves's account—this is my entry, I read it to the prisoner—he looked over my papers and was with me all the time; on 1st July, 1878, an amount is credited in the ledger, but it has not been entered in the journal, for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th August 1878, a similar entry of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 4th July, 1879, 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he could give no explanation of those items—I cannot say whether in these individual cases he admitted having taken the particular sums, but he could give no explanation—he admitted that the entries in the depositors' book, the pass book, were his own—I went through a large number of cases—I told him that the total was a little over 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he expressed great surprise, he denied having had so much—he gave certain information which he said would embrace the whole of the amount he had had, amounting altogether to between 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—among other items I called his attention to there was one of Mr. Watts, as to withdrawals—one item is on 10th July, 1879, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't say that he gave any definite explanation about that particular item—the other two items were 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 204<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave no explanation of those.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Bow Road, Bow, Middlesex—I am now the chairman of this society—I was appointed some day in October last, when the case against the prisoner was undergoing in<lb></lb>vestigation at the Mansion House—from something that occurred I saw Mr. Mayes, and I required an explanation from him in the Justice-room—I was afterwards assisted by a committee, some of the present directors—he produced his books immediately, and gave an explanation that I was thoroughly satisfied with, and after the inquiry I drew this report—he is still the manager of the society.</p>

A gentleman named Marsh was solicitor to the company—the cheques for the advances to me from the company were payable to my order—they were first handed to me, and I handed them to Mr. Marsh, and he invariably handed them back again—I had to endorse them all before I could get the money—it was the usage of the office to hand to Mr. Marsh first all cheques relating to mortgages—I presume the directors knew that my private account was mixed up with the general funds of the society.</p>

On Monday, the 18th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was called up, and found the prisoner in custody in the passage, and two gold watch-keys gone from the window. The shutter was loose, the pin stolen, the glass broken, and part of the shutter cut away, so as to enable a person to put a wire in. The prisoner was the last boy in the shop on Saturday night; this was Monday.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Ashton, who lives opposite to the prosecutors. On the 18th of August, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner working at the shutters; he had a pitcher stood by his side - a little girl came up, and he took it up and went away - I went over and took him as he was going into a wine-vaults, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you been doing at the shutters?" he said,</p>
               <p>"What shutters?" I found a wire in his hand, which was bloody. I gave him in charge, and found the shutter had been cut and the glass broken.</p>

I am a street-keeper, and took him in charge - I have the key and wire - I found a bent nail in his coat pocket; there was also a ticket attached to the key which was picked up under the window. The house appeared to have been broken open in the night, for there was the mark of a crow bar under the window.</p>

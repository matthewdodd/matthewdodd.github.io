                  </hi>. I am shopman at 165, Fenehurch-street—on 21st August I was in Gracechurch-street, a little after two in the afternoon—I had just stopped to look in at a shop window, when I felt a tug at my watch—there was a chain round my neck—the watch was out of my pocket when I felt the pull—I looked, and saw it in the prisoners hand at my right hand side—when he saw that I saw it in his hand he dropped it instantly—I picked it up, looked round to see if I could see a policeman, but could not—the prisoner began to walk off—I followed him a few steps, and then he turned up a passage into Leadenhall-market—I took hold of him, and a gentleman fetched a policeman—the prisoner had seen me following him, and said, "What do you want?"—I said, "You know; you have had my watch"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch—the chain was a common one—the watch was broken off at the bow, and the chain remained whole—I did not lose sight of him from the time when I saw it in his hand till I took him in. Leadenhall-market—I am quite sure I have got the right man.</p>

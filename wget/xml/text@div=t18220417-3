I missed a counterpane, a pair of sheets, two shirts, an apron, and a dark cotton gown, which I am sure were there when I left in the morning.</p>

            . (This witness being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath). I am ten years old, and lived at No. 6, Carpenter-street, near Tufton-street, at this time; I was going on an errand, about eight o'clock at night, and saw Mrs. Bishop's parlour window open; it was moon-light - I saw things thrown out of the window into the street, and then saw a tallish man jump out of the window. He took up some of the things, left the rest, and ran up the street. I saw a shorter man jump out - I was just crossing the road, and called out Stop thief! three times, nobody answered me. I saw Mr. Matthews knock at the door; the first man who jumped out, had a dark waistcoat on, and no coat - the shorter man had light round clothes on. I only saw two men, that (pointing to Donahow) is the tall one, I am quite sure of it. I cannot speak to the other by his features, but by his clothes, his coat and trowsers were light.</p>

            . I am a cordwainer, and live five doors from Tufton-street. On this evening, between seven and eight o'clock, I was at my own house, three men went by, I was eight or nine feet from them in height, looking from my window, I can speak positive to both the prisoners; a third person was with them. When they came between my shop and the next, one of them turned round, and said.</p>
               <p>"This is the shop," pointing to the next door; this drew my attention. They went on to the corner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170004"></xptr>of Tufton-street. Soon after, in consequence of what somebody said, I went to the house, and alarmed the people; a great crowd collected in a short time, and in the crowd, I saw the two prisoners; there were sixty or seventy people - I am sure they are two of the three I saw go by my house. I told a boy to go for a constable - they stood near me, and might have heard me; they ran off directly I had spoken.</p>

            . I work in Marsham-street, and am an apprentice. I was going along Tufton-street, on the night in question, and passed this house, about eight o'clock, and saw three young men standing there; two of them were lifting the other one up to the window, but directly they saw me, they dropped him down - I went on three or four doors, and told a lady who stood at a door. I was afraid they would ill-treat me if I alarmed the people. I can swear to Yates, being the one who was lifted up to the window.</p>

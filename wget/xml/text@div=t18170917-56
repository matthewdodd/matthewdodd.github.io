            . The prisoner has been our clerk about a year and a quarter. On the 5th of August, I had occasion to give him directions to write a letter to Messrs. Williams's house, which he did, and brought the letter to me for my signature (looks at it) The words also, "Lieut. R. Mace, on his application for the same, 400l." was not there when I signed it-it is in the prisoner's hand-writing. Our house had no correspondence with Lieut. R. Mace. Messrs. Williams and Co. are our town correspondents. I had not given the prisoner authority todirect them to pay Lieutenant R. Mace 400l. When I went to the office on the 8th of August the prisoner was absent - We had not sent him any where; he never returned, until he was in custody.</p>

            . I am clerk in the country department of Messrs. Robert Williams, William Moffatt, jun. William Hugh Burgess, and William Williams (looks at the letter). This letter came from Brenchley's house to our's, on the 8th of 
               <persName id="t18170917-56-person411">August.</persName>
             I believe a person came to our office in Birchin-lane on that day, and inquired of me whether we had an order from the Gravesend Bank to pay Lieut. R. Mace 400l.? - I believe the prisoner was the man - I will not positively swear to him; the order being quite fresh in my recollection, I said, yes, there was. I accordingly found the letter, and asked him if his name was Mace? he said, yes; I then filled up the body of a blank check, and gave it to him to put his signature to it, which he did (looks at it)-this is it. I took it back to compare it with the signature in the letter, found that they corresponded, and put my initials to it for it to pass to the cashier, or he would not pay it; I gave it back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I gave it to him, supposing him to be Lieut. R. Mace. It would not have been paid, if I had not put my initials to it-it is an order for the cashier to pay it-(letter read).</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information which I received, I pursued the prisoner to Abbeville, in France, and apprehended him there. I told him he was charged with receiving 400l. from Messrs. Williams and Co. of Birchin-lane, on account of Messrs. Brenchley and Co., of Gravesend. He said he had received the 400l., and that they paid him a 300l. bank note,(I neither threatened nor persuaded him). I asked him where the notes were? he said he had changed the 300l. note at the Bank of England for small notes, and the 100l. note he had then in his possession, which he produced from his pocket-book. I searched his trunk, and found 200l. in 1l. and 2l. notes, and a gold watch, chain, and seals, which he said he purchased with part of the money (looks at the note). This is the 100l. note, No. 11,282; the rest of the money he said he had paid in post<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170019"></xptr>chaise hire from London to Dover, and from Calais to Abbeville.</p>

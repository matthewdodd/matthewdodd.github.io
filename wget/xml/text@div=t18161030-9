In getting up, I got it by the chain. One said to another,"b-gg-r your bl-dy eyes an't you got the thimble." I went to get hold of Career, and I still kept the watch in my possession. He got away, and then they all dismissed; they all ran away, I knew Carter before; I kept possession of the watch it was got, out of my fob, and I caught it as it was passing. I could not catch hold of him. I called the watch; I knew no others of the party; I never lost sight of Church hardly. I lost sight of him just for a moment, going round the corner; but that was all. I followed him up directly; it was just at the corner of Oxford-street where I lost sight of him; I kept running after him; I am sure he was the same I had seen before. I lost sight of him; but not for half a minute. He had run altogether about two hundred yards. He could not run above ten yards while out of my sight. He was running alone. They all separated themselves different ways. He was going alone. He stopped at a pump, and knocked the crown of his hat in, to drink, and then I and the watchman took him. Carter was also taken that night.</p>

I came up directly, and took Church into custody. He was standing by the pump, and Marsh gave me charge of him. Marsh said he was one the persons.

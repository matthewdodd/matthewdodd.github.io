                  </hi>. I live at 1, Thoresby-place, Battersea-fields, and keep a grocer's shop there—I have known the prisoner nearly two years—he is married and so am I—we were living in the same house up to the Saturday night previous to the Monday that he shot me—he left Thoresby-place on the Saturday night, 6th September—we had had an altercation on the night previous, the Friday—from something my wife had said to me, I asked him the reason he had told my wife that he heard me kiss his wife in my shop—he stated that he was sitting in the back parlour and that he was under the impression that he had heard me kiss her—I told him it was untrue, that there was no possible ground or reason why he should have made that accusation, and that he would have to leave my house—we had an altercation through this—I can't exactly state what passed—the result of it was that he ordered his wife to bed in a very peremptory manner—she declined to do so until the question was finally settled—he then seized her by the neck and assaulted her, and she appealed to me for protection—I parted them, and pushed him into the passage—I said, "We have been good friends so long, we will not have any bother, go to bed, and to-morrow leave the house"—he, his wife, and family left the next evening—I saw no more of him till the Monday night at 10 o'clock—I came home within a few</p>

I am a coppersmith at 3, Chapel-place, North-street, Battersea—on the night this transaction happened, from half-past 9 to 10 o'clock, I was sitting outside the Prince of Wales public-house, next door to Mr. Cooke's—whilst sitting there I saw the prisoner, his brother, and his brother's wife, walking to and fro for about half an hour—about 10 o'clock I saw Mr. Cooke come up—he was in the act of putting up his shutters, and I saw the prisoner deliberately pull a pistol from his breast, and fire it at Mr. Cooke's side—I was not near enough to hear anything that was said—I saw Mr. Cooke walk a little way, and he became exhausted—the prisoner went into the Prince of Wales.</p>

I am a surgeon—I was called in on this night to see Mr. Cooke—I found him lying on a bed, faint, and exhausted—on removing the clothes I found a bloody patch—I ripped up his shirt, and found his flannel-shirt saturated, and found ten holes on the right side—I probed each of them, but could discover nothing at the bottom, owing to the fact that he would probably be in a different position at the time he received the wound to what he was at the time I examined him, and the holes would not correspond, the parts are so moveable under the intercostal muscles—I did not find any shot—that is quite consistent with the fact that he might have received the wounds from a pistol loaded with shot—the shot were evidently internal from the symptoms that occurred—they are there still—I have not been able to extract them—he has recovered for the present, but the lower part of the lung is permanently destroyed, con<lb></lb>solidated—I do not hope to be able to extricate the shot—for the present, probably he may not be likely to suffer much; many cases have been known in which foreign bodies have been in the lungs, and the patient has recovered at the time, and then traumatic phthisis has come on.</p>

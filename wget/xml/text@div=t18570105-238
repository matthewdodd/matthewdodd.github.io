                  </hi>., I keep a boot and shoe shop in Meadow—row, New Kent—road. On Friday evening last, I left my shop about 10 o'clock—I went next morning a little after 5 o'clock—as I went to turn the handle, to open the door, there seemed to be a pressure inside, as if somebody was pushing against me; and as I pushed, the glass of the door broke all to pieces, it is a sash door—I then heard a noise as if persons were running across the shop into a shed adjoining—I called for the police, who came—he went round a street adjoining the shed, I followed him, and when I came up he had the prisoner in his custody—I then returned and examined my shop—I found that two pairs of shoes which I had left the previous evening suspended on the gas pipe, were lying on the floor, five or six yards from the window—I found some lucifer matches by the outside of the door, and likewise inside the shop—they were of a different sort to those I had—I had locked my shop—nobody sleeps there.</p>

I heard a cry of "Police!" last Saturday morning, ran to the spot, and heard some one on the tiles of the roof; I ran round into Thomas-street, the adjoining street, and there I saw the prisoner drop from a wall, without a hat—I asked him what he had been doing there—he said he had just been knocked down by some man—I took him into custody, and took him back to the prosecutors shop, where</p>

               <p>the prosecutor gave me these shoes—after taking the prisoner to the station I took a pair of boots from him—I compared them with some marks in the gardens. and they corresponded—I traced the footmarks across several gardens from the prosecutor's shed to the wall I saw the prisoner drop from.</p>

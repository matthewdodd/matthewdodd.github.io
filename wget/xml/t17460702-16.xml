               <p>Q. Was she a Servant in your House?</p>
               <p>Corbut. No, it was in her own House. She and I came up from a Ship together; and she persuaded me to lie with her that Night.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took the One and twenty shillings away?</p>
               <p>Corbut. Because I had this Money in a green Purse in my Pocket, that laid by the Bedside.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Corbut. In the Morning, when I got up, I miss'd my Money out of my Pocket, my Necklace, and a Pair of Silver Buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your Necklace made of?</p>
               <p>Corbut. Gold Beads , two Rows.</p>

               <p>Corbut . She laid with me, and no body else laid in the House.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? you was not awake in the Night.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she up before you?</p>
               <p>Corbut. Yes. I had 39 s. when I went to bed, and she left me but 18 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long she had been gone out of the Room before you?</p>
               <p>Corbut . No; I did not hear her rife.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been acquainted with her long?</p>
               <p>Corbut. No; I never knew her before I came up with her from the Ship.</p>

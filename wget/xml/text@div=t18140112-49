On the 30th of May, 1811, I went out about a quarter after eight at night; I think I locked the door after me; I returned about eleven o'clock; when I returned, the box of the lock was wrenched off. I went in the room, and found the case gone containing the articles in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse the prisoner of it - A. I suspected him; he worked for me. He left me on the Saturday, said he should come to work on the Tuesday. I never saw any thing of him from that time until he was taken on another charge. I heard nothing of my things I had lost until the 30th of March following, as I was going up Holborn, I saw five of the broaches and the locket exposed to sale in Mr. Lane's shop window. He is a silversmith and pawnbroker. I went to Mr. Lane's with Stenton the officer. Stenton told me to take the things out of the window until he should be able to find the prisoner. We tried to find the prisoner, we could not.</p>

            . I am a jeweller. Near two years ago Wells brought some duplicates to me; at that time I lived with Mr. Lane. I sent for the articles, and we agreed for the price. I know nothing further. I have brought three broaches from Mr. Lane's; I do not live with Mr. Lane now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Lane here - A. No. I cannot say these are the articles; Mr. Lane is not in business, he has now a young man to manage the business; that young man knows nothing of the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know is, the prisoner brought you some duplicates of broaches, and what else - A. There was a seal or two, how many broaches I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what do you produce to-day -

            Three broaches, that is all; whether they are the produce of what the prisoner brought I cannot say. The prisoner then was a working jeweller.</p>

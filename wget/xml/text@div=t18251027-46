I had missed some saws and planes, and a great many locks, but did not think they were lost. On the 11th of September, when the prisoner had left me about two months, I made it known on the wharf that I had lost this property, and on the following Monday I missed some more locks from a shelf, and some planes. The prisoner had no business on my premises at that time. I have seen some of my property in the pawnbroker's hands.</p>

            . I am a carter. On Sunday, the 11th of September, I saw the prisoner come into the yard of No. 10, at the basin at Paddington - he went up the ladder into Mr. Watt's premises, and brought out a basket; I saw him there again the following Sunday, when he again went up the ladder, unlocked the door, and staid about ten minutes - he then came out with something in a sack, which he hung by his side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you at the time? A. I was in my own house or the yard. I have known him by working there.</p>

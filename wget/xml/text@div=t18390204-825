                  </hi>. I live at Ilford, in Essex. A man named Hawkes lodged in my house, but I do not know that it was the prisoner—I never saw him myself till he was at Worship-street—on the 19th of January, between five and six o'clock, I lost the articles stated, and saw them at Spitalfields station-house on the 21st.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 125.) On the 19th of January, about four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Lamb-street, Spitalfields, with a bag—I asked what he had got—he said some linen and other articles—I asked where he brought them from—he said from Ilford, in Essex, and was going to sell them; that he was out of work and wanted victuals—I asked if the linen was marked—he said, "No"—I looked at the linen, and found it was marked "M. S." <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD STROUD</hi>

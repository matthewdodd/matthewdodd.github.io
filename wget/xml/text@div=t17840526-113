             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to the Earl of Fife; on the 5th of May, at half past nine, I saw the prisoner standing behind the farm of the green-house plants, it was an inclosed garden, I went to shut up the frame. I asked who was there three times, he made no answer, and attempted to go over the wall by the water, he threw himself over the wall, and run very fast, I caught him by Whitehall stairs: three of the pots were stripped, and there were missing two jurinams and one sweet-briar, I saw them three hours before that.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not it common for the family to cut them? - No.</p>
               <p>Were the pots full before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the pots gone with the things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming from my work, and I came by the centry, and this gentleman's servant saw me, and he hallooed to the centry to stop me, and they took me to the watch-house, I had nothing with me, I never was in the garden in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the value of the plants? - Six shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. In this case the value is material, for the act under which this indictment is framed is, for the cultivation and better preservation of trees, roots, and plants, and that enacts, that if any person shall dig up, cut up, &amp;c. to the value of five shillings, they shall be guilty of felony; so that there is no felony at all if the value is less than five shillings.</p>

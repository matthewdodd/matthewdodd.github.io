                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">by an interpreter</hi>). I am a merchant, at 8, Duke-street, Aldgate. On 18th Aug., between ten and eleven in the morning—I met the prisoner, in Bishopsgate-street—he led me to Bury-street—he said "There are two policemen waiting for you, and there is a reward of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. offered for you, you may escape if you give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said, "I have nothing to give you, you have no claim on me"—he led me from there down a dark passage, and said, "You have nothing to do with me! I will show you"—he laid hold of me and took my watch, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was wrapped up in paper—he seized me by the collar and dragged me along towards Bury-street—I made a noise and cried, and the Rev. Mr. Asher came and said we should both go to Mr. Levine's close by, to settle the matter amicably—the prisoner said to Mr. Levine, "I have the watch, but I won't let him escape"—Mr. Levine went to get an officer, and the prisoner went away also.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Rabbi of the Synagogue. Last Friday, between ten and eleven in the morning I was in Bury-street, and saw the prisoner, he had hold of Goldberg—there was an altercation—I asked what was the matter—Goldberg was greatly excited—after a few minutes deliberation he said, "This man wishes to have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me"—he appeared almost moved to tears—I said, "Surely it must be for some cause?"—he said, "He has already my watch"—I said I would not allow anything to be done to him in the street, but either to go before the Chief Rabbi, or the Lord Mayor—I suggested to go to Mr. Levine's—Mr. Levine went for a policeman—the prisoner said, "That is my wish, I will go for a policeman myself"—he went away and never returned—I went to his lodging and he was not there.</p>

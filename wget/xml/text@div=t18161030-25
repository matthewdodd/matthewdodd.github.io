            . On the 18th of October last this man watched me in the Strand. He was looking at a play-bill. Two of them together went a-head of me, and followed me into <placeName id="t18161030-25-crimeloc130">Castle-court</placeName>

When I got into the court this man, seizing me by the collar, took the watch out of my pocket. The other man tried to pacify me, and put his hand on my shoulder; but I pursued this man, and cried stop thief, and halloed murder, and ran after the prisoner, and never lost sight of him. He was taken before a quarter of an hour had elapsed. I am sure I never lost sight of him, and I have not the least doubt but the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. This was about nine o'clock. I saw this man and another looking at a play-bill at a small butter shop, the other side Bedford-street. They might be able to see the seal and key hanging below my waistcoat. This was a very little way from Castle-street. The prisoner went up the court before me, and waited to see if I came up the court. As I passed him I thought his attention was fixed on me. I thought he was eying me, and I tucked my ribbon up. No one spoke to me when he robbed me. I turned the corner of the court nearly at the same time that he did, and did not lose sight of him. He dodged about the coaches in Bedford-street. I had sight of him all the time, and he ran into St. Paul's churchyard, where he was secured.</p>
               <p>- On the night in question I heard the cry, and I pursued round and saw the prisoner running up Bedford-street. He was going along Chandos-street, and I immediately stood before him, and then he turned back and went up Bedford-street, and I followed him. He dodged about among the coaches, and he knocked me down. I got up again and pursued him, and he ran into the church-yard. There I followed him. There he struck me and knocked me down again, but I secured him.</p>

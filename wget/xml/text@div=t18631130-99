I am the wife of James Murray, of the India House public-house, Rotherhithe—on Saturday evening, 1st November, just before 6 o'clock, a man, who I believe to be the prisoner, came for two-pennyworth of rum—he gave me a half-crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—there was only small money there—he pushed out hastily against persons, upon which I went to the till, tried the half-crown, and found it was bad—I gave it to my husband—on the following Monday morning, 23d November, before 10 o'clock the prisoner came in for a glass of ale and a pennyworth of tobacco, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad half-crown—I said, "This is another bad half-crown"—his face was quite familiar to me when I served him, but I did not think about the bad half-crown at the time—to the best of my belief he is the man—he said that he did not know it was bad—I gave it to my husband, and the prisoner was given in custody—Bidwell came in, and said, "I saw the man yesterday that gave you the bad half-crown on Saturday night"—the prisoner turned round, and said, "It was not me, was it?"—he said, "Yes, you are the very man."</p>

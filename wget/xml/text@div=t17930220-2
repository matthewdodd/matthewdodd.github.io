               <p>Court. What day was this? - On Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after this? - I naturally put them out of my house for safety; they told me that they got them so and so, and desired me to put them out of the house; I put them in a bag up a chimney in another house where no person lived in; then Wednesday morning I was taken up, and I took the things to Shadwell office, I was taken up for some other things, and I was admitted an evidence, and I told all as I knew; I had known this boy about two months, I did not know the other.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you had known this boy some months, in what way of life was he in? - Sometimes he was at work and sometimes he lived with girls; but I never knew him guilty of housebreaking.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have no doubt that these things were stolen? - I did not doubt they were stolen, but I did not think that they had broke a house open for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then being taken up for some other robbery you was admitted a witness on this robbery? - Yes.</p>

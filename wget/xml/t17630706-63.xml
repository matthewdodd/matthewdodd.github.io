            . On the 27th of May, a little after 12 at night, I was met by 6 or 7 men, one of them a little forward than the rest, came up and struck me, I desired them not to use me ill, I said I had but little they should have it, they took my hat, cane, and 3 s. 6 d. they had not got above twenty yards before the watchman came up, I called to him to stop them, and in less than three minutes the prisoner was brought to me, I can't particularly swear to him, but he was like the man that first struck me; he was not searched, I never found my hat or cane again, when the prisoner was examined before Justice Fielding he said he was not in company with any body</p>

            . I am a watchman, I heard the cry, stop thief! several people were running some one way some another, I was at the upper end of Cranbourn-ally. I perceived the prisoner ran against another man, he catched him in his arms, I took and brought him to the prosecutor, I asked him why he ran? he said there was a quarrel in the street, and he did not care to be in it.</p>

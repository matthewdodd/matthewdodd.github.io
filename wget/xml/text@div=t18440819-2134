                  </hi>. I am a journeyman cooper, in the employ of Mr. George Blackman. I know the prisoner by sight—he lives in Gower-walk—about half-past six o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of July, I was piling staves in the yard—I saw the prisoner go across, and stoop down by the side of a beer-cooler that was in the road—he put his arm under and drew out three saws, placed them under his coat, and walked sharply away—I and Phillips followed—he got to Leman-street—I hailed him, and he came back—I asked him whose saws they were—he said his own—I asked where he was going to take them to—he said home, and that he had found them—I said, "They belong to some of Mr. Collier's men, I believe"—I said "I saw you take them from under the cooler"—I called a policeman, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I was coming out of Mr. Black<lb></lb>man's yard—I saw the prisoner stoop down, put his arm under the cooler, draw out these three saws, and walk away with them—I went after him with Bock—I called him, and he came back—my mate asked him what he was going to do with them; but whether he said he was going to take them or not, I cannot say—my mate said he thought they belonged to some of Mr. Collier's men—he said, "If you think so, take them there and see"—he said he was going by and saw the handles of the saws sticking out, and picked them up.</p>

About half-past six o'clock I saw the prisoner and the two witnesses in Leman-street—Bock told me he saw the prisoner take up the three saws from under the cooler in Rupert-street—the prisoner said he found them, that he saw some chickens picking about there, which made him look under, and he was going to take them to Mr. Collier, perhaps they might belong to them—he gave his name Henry Jacobs, No. 2, Gower-walk—that is his name and address.</p>

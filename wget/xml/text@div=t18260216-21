            . I had the care of Mr. Palmer's house, in Berkeley-square. On Sunday, the 8th of January, I went into the back drawing-room, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and found the window thrown up, the shutter open, and the bar down - the door was fastened as I had left it; I had not been there since Friday morning, the 6th - the window was then down, and the shutters barred; I missed a hearth rug from the front drawing room, also ten books, a clock, and hearth rug from the back drawing-room, and a carpet, belonging to a closet between the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160023"></xptr>>rooms; a person could get from one room to the other - I also missed two cloths which covered the furniture; there is a garden behind the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot tell when the things were taken? A. I had seen them all safe on the 6th; I must have missed them if they had been gone, as I dust the place round; a dozen books could not have gone without my missing them. I am sure the window was down.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 16th of January, about twelve o'clock in the day, I went with a search-warrant to No. 40, Clipstone-street, and searched the second floor front room; Cutler, who was with me, found ten volumes of Shakespeare's works in that room, and among the dirty linen this cloth; I drew the staple of the cellar door, which was locked, and found two hearth rugs, a small carpet, and a cloth, in a sack; I waited till half-past ten o'clock at night, when the prisoner came home, with his wife; I followed him up stairs, and walked in after him - I told him I wanted him, and to put up his hands that I might secure him; his wife begged to know why I took him; I said he knew - he said he did not; I told him it was on suspicion of having robbed Mr. Palmer, and did he know such a person - he said he did not; I told him I meant Mr. Palmer, of Berkeley-square - he again said he did not know him; I took him to the watch-house, searched him, and found two clock keys in his coat pocket; I asked him where the clock belonging to them was - he said he knew nothing about it. When I took him to the office next day, I asked where the clock was - he said he did not know; I said he might do as he pleased about telling me, but his wife was in custody, and though I thought her innocent, I feared I should not be able to persuade the Magistrate so, and she might be committed, but if the clock was found in all probability she would be discharged, but if it was not she would not, and he might do as he pleased about telling me; I said, "I don't wish you to tell me," and was about to lock the door to leave him; he said something in answer, and in consequence of what he said I went to Wren's, in Great Titchfield-street, on Tuesday morning, the 17th, and there found the clock, which I produce; I knew nothing of Wren before. I found the small key opens the clock case, and the larger one winds it up- the keys are numbered 430, the same as the clock. He said to me, "Stop, I will tell you where the clock is - it is at Mr. Wren's, a cabinet-maker, in Titchfield-street, where I took it to be repaired." I found a boot in his bed-room, which I took to Mr. Palmer's garden, which the back drawing room looks into, and compared it with a vast number of footsteps; the boot exactly tallied with the marks - some of them had left an exact impression - it fitted them. I found a ladder in a small yard between the garden and stables; there is a coach-house between the garden and mews; there were marks of dirt by the coach-house door, as if a person had been over there; I could get in that way, by getting on the coach-house gates into a small yard, over the top of the stable, on to a shed, and that is the way the footsteps went; there was mortar broken down by the shed wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found a ladder and marks too? A. Yes - he must get over the wall to the ladder. - The boot is a common size, but the heel is flat like a shoe. I searched his lodgings for a clock, but found none.</p>

            . I can swear to these ten volumes of Shakespeare; I have brought the seventh volume. I also know the clock and rug - the keys were kept under the clock.</p>
               <p>MR. PALMER. I believe the clock to be mine - it was bought by a relation, and, I understand, cost twenty guineas; it is certainly worth 5l. Shakespeare's works are worth five or six guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought these things in the way of trade on Thursday, the 12th, at the door of Machin and Debenham's sale rooms, King-street, Covent-garden, of a person appearing to be a porter; he told me he had bought them there, and had frequently seen me buying things there, but I did not recollect him - I gave him a 5l. note, two sovereigns, and five shillings - 5l. for the clock, 1l. for Shakespeare, and 25s. shillings for the rugs and carpet. I put the rugs and carpet into the cellar, which I frequently use for that purpose.</p>

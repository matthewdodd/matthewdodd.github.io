On the 24th of April the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to me about four o'clock - he gave me this note, in consequence of which I gave him my husband's coat, apron, and trousers; I had no conversation with him - I was all in a tremble; I gave him them for the use of my husband - I have never seen the things since - I did not take such particular notice of him; a porter came to ask if my husband was at home - I looked more at him than I did at the other man; I saw the prisoner the same night at ten o'clock - I said, "Did you come to my house?" he said No at first, and then said Yes; I thought I had some slight knowledge of him - this is the note - (read.)</p>

               <p>Dear Hannah, - Please to send me by the bearer, my other coat and trousers, as I have had the misfortune to get into a row and got my coat and trousers all torn and dirtied, so that I cannot come through the street in them. Yours, CHARLES.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cattle dealer, and live in South Wales. On 11th Dec. I was near the Great Western Railway Hotel—the prisoner came to me, and said, "How are you, my dear?"—I said, "Be off, I want nothing to do with you"—she then came on my right side, another woman came on my left, and a man came at my back, and caught hold of my clothes and the back of my neck—the prisoner opened my waistcoat, and took out my purse from the inside pocket—there was in it 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were three sovereigns—I saw the money safe in my pocket about an hour before—this is the purse or bag in which my money was—it has two pockets in it—when this had taken place the prisoner ran away, and the others ran another way—I ran after the prisoner, and called, "I have lost my money"—the constable brought her back to me—I recognized her, and said that she was the woman that robbed me—I was as sober as I am now—it had been raining, but was not at that time.</p>

I was on duty in Hyde-park<lb></lb>gardens about 20 minutes past 10 o'clock—I saw the prosecutor—he was sober, and was calling out that he had been robbed—I had seen the prisoner come past me about a minute before, she was running, and had got this handkerchief round her bonnet—I followed her, and brought her back to the prosecutor—he said that she was the person who robbed him—the prisoner said nothing—she was quite out of breath—I went back to the place where I took her; it was about 12 o'clock then, and I found this purse within about two yards of the spot where I apprehended her.</p>

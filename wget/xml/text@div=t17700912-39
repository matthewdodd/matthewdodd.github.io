            . I live at Hampstead; as I was returning to Hampstead, in the Hampstead stage, on the 1st of September, about 8 o'clock at night, the coach was stopped in the road near <placeName id="t17700912-39-crimeloc200">Pancrass</placeName>

Macdonald came within four or five yards of the coach; he presented a pistol at the coachman which flash'd in the pan, but did not go off; immediately upon that another man called out, Stop, or I'll blow your brains out. Macdonald came up to the coach down; his hat was let down to flap over his face, but it had turn'd up; he pulled it over his face, but it turn'd up a second time; they demanded my watch and money, or they said they would shoot me dead; Macdonald got into the coach at one door, and the man that was with him at the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What, do you mean the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tomlin. I can't swear to the other man, he was on the dark side of the coach, Macdonald was on the light side. When they got into the coach, they put a pistol to each side of my head; which they search'd me; they took my watch out of my fob; the silver they took out of my right, and the half-pence out of my left hand pocket; they felt my breast and all over me, where they thought I might have any thing conceal'd; Macdonald then took my bundle containing the things in the indictment ( mentioning them;) they then made off, and Macdonald carried away my watch and bundle in his hand, laughing; I went to get out of the coach to pursue them, and I tumbled out of the coach over my stick, which retarded my pursuit, on I believe I should have taken them: I got my journeyman and a corporal, and came down the road, in search of them; I search'd all the nighthouses in St. Giles's, Monmouth-street, and Thieving-Lane; I could not meet with them, so I went and gave the information to one of Sir

               <p>Tomlin. The road where I was robbed, is near 30 yards broad; there is no hedge, only three little low bushes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in the coach with you?</p>
               <p>Tomlin. The best part of a minute. I was some time before. I would deliver my things, and if the other man had not come into the coach I should not have delivered them, for I could have taken Macdonald; I was not afraid of his pistol; I knew after it had flash'd, it could do no harm.</p>

I found the prosecutor's handkerchief wrapped round Millson's head for a night cap; these three skins lay by Millson's bedside; we found a dozen knives and forks in the next room; some had been used; we found the spurs in a drawer, ( producing the different articles.) Millson told us this suit of cloaths were his (producing a brown suit ) As the prosecutor had said they were both in dark coloured clothes, I brought them away that he might see them.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in High-street, Shadwell. On the evening of the 16th of August, between eight and nine o'clock, I missed a cap from my door—it had been tied to a string—the policeman came—I went to the station-house and found the cap—this now produced is it.</p>

On the 16th of August I saw Carr coming along with two others—Carr had something tied in a handkerchief—I asked what he had got—he said a cap, which was his own, and he had bought it of Mercer, who was with him—Mercer said, "What a story, I am sure you did not"—I took them to the station—Carr then said, "Now I will tell the truth about howl came by this cap; James Clark and Mercer brought it down Twine-court and offered it to me and my uncle for sale for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I went to get money on it to pay for it"—I went and took Clark—at the Thames-police Mercer said he did it for hunger—Clark said he had got a bad leg, and his father said if it did not get better he must go and do as Mercer did for his living.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of No. 5, Church-row, Hounds<lb></lb>ditch. On the night of 27th April I was at a public house in Houndsditch, and put my great coat on a seat in the taproom—the prisoner and his wife were there—the prisoner went and sat by my coat—I missed it ten minutes afterwards—he and his wife were then gone—I saw no more of him till the following Thursday, when he came to the public house, and the waiter accused him, and told him that he saw him take the coat, and give it to his wife—he at first said that he knew nothing about it—afterwards he said that he knew the man who did take it, that it was pawned over in the Borough, and that he took part of the drink from the money, which it was pawned for; and if I would give him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pot of porter, and a halfpenny to pay for the ticket, he would return me the coat—I let him go, and on the Friday evening he came in again, and desired me to give him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he would fetch the coat—I said, "If you do not give me up the coat I shall give you in charge, as you know where it is," and fetched a policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you leave your coat in charge of any one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there were several people in the taproom—the landlord came into the tap-room and told all the people to go out, as it was shutting up time—you were the first person that left, and you pushed your wife out of doors—I saw you on the Thursday, and we may have drunk out of the same pewter—I have known you for years, and never heard anybody say that you have done wrong before—you have been in that taproom many times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Pearce, a licensed victualler, of Houndsditch. On this Friday night I saw the prisoner take the coat off the seat, and give it to his wife, saying, "If this is your coat, take it"—I did not see what she did with it—they went out in ten minutes or a quarter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185505070016"></xptr>
               <p>of an hour—they were the only parties that went out before the coat was missed—I did not see what his wife did with the coat after she received it—the prisoner sat on one side of the fireplace, and the prosecutor on the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Mr. Smith keeps a common house; were not there some of his people there, several women? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His wife was there, and another woman, Mrs. Lyons, I believe—there was was no other female except your wife—your wife said to Mr. Pearce, "Give me a glass of gin, and I will go"—he gave her a glass, and said, "I am glad to get rid of you," and then you pushed her out of the house—Mr. Jones and his wife, and Mr. Lyons and his wife remained in the taproom after you left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you there on the next Thursday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I heard the prisoner say that he would bring back the coat for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a pot of porter—he said it to the company—I do not think Smith was there then, but he was on Friday—I had refused to serve the prisoner and his wife from 3 o'clock until they went out, which was a quarter or twenty minutes past 12.</p>

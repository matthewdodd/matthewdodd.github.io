            ; the prisoner is my mother-in-law, she does not live with my father, they are parted; I live with my father and my brother. On Friday morning I missed the shirt, I went to her and asked her for it, she said she had pawned it; she told me to take the things out and stop it out of her money. On Saturday morning I looked for my brother's flannel waistcoat, I could not find them; I looked for his best breeches, I could not find them. The prisoner was with us all day on Christmas day; she came on purpose to have the child baptized, and on the next day she packed up all her things, and these things along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why does not your mother live with your father - A. She has stripped four furnished lodgings.</p>
               <p>- BANKES. I produce a waistcoat pawned for nine pence; I cannot swear to the person of the prisoner, but she confirmed it by her own confession.</p>
               <p>JAMES ABSALOM. The prisoner pawned a pair of breeches with me on the 27th of December for one shilling.</p>
               <p>- WALTERS. I produce a shirt pawned for two shillings on the 27th of December by the prisoner</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am away from my husband, his son and daughter; I have not been used very well by them, they did not use my child very well; the prosecutor advised me to come and have the child baptized on Christmas day; I was short of money; I asked my husband for money, he would not give me any; I thought I might make free with these things, I took them; I said Mary, take them out on Saturday night, that is three shillings and nine pence, and bring me one shilling and three halfpence; I told her to take the three shillings and ninepence out of my money; I bought herrings and potatoes with the money. I hope you will pardon me this time for my baby's sake; I thought it was no harm.</p>

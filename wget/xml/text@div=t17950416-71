               <p>I am a potatoe merchant. On the 27th of March last, about eight o'clock in the morning, I see the prisoner at the bar, go into the house of Mr. Dignum. I stood at my own door, which is opposite, he had not been in above two or three minutes, before I heard the report of a piece, a pistol or gun. I see the flash, I immediately ran over, as soon as I got over, the prisoner had got hold of Caffery, dragging him by the collar, and the hair of his head, I said, what have you been about? he directly charged me to aid and assist, I said I think you want no assistance; what have you been doing? Mr. Caffery's eyes were as if so much foot had been thrown in, he was rubbing his eyes. The prisoner was dragging Caffery towards the door, he was then off the board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner assign to you any or what reason for his conduct? - No further, than he said he was a deserter, and charged me to aid and assist.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say more, than I charged him in his Majesty's name to aid and assist, as I could not get the prisoner to the door.</p>

               <p>I keep a stick shop in Mary-le-bone-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at Dignum's house on the 27th of March last? - Yes. I was up stairs at breakfast about eight o'clock in the morning, and my little boy called me down, and said there was something the matter at Mr. Dignum's. I went in and the prisoner at the bar had got hold of Caffery, and I said, what are you making a disturbance at this time of the morning? and he said this man is a deserter, and I will blow the brains out of any man that comes in my way, and he put the pistol up close to my face, it was so very nigh my nose I did not like it, and with that I laid hold of the muzzle of it, and drawed it out of his hand, with that he attempted to draw his sword. This is the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any ramrod in at the time you took it from him? - No, there was none. I wrenched the pistol out of his hand, and he attempted to draw his sword; he dragged it about a quarter of an inch out of the scabbard.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him dragging Caffery? - Yes; and Caffery cried out, as soon as he heard my voice, says he, Mr. Rankin, I am shot; when the prisoner attempted to draw his sword, I said, if you draw that, I will blow your brains out, and I sent the boy out for a constable, and the watch-house beadle was coming by at the time, and I gave charge of him to the constable. While I was gone out, Mr. Dignum sent for the surgeon, and when I came back he was dressing his eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see the bullets found that came out of this pistol? - No, I did not, I was gone down to the watch-house.</p>

I went into the house, and was told that a soldier had shot a man; when I went into the house, I see the soldier behind the counter, and Caffery by him with his head down, Mr. Dignum and Mr. Rankin were then in the shop, behind the counter; Mr. Rankin had a pistol in his hands, and he told me that he wrenched it out of the soldier's hand, he told me to take care of the prisoner; says the prisoner, are you an officer? says I, I am; says he, then I will surrender myself to you, if you will take care of my deserter; I told him that I would take care of him, and I took him to the watch-house, and Mr. Rankin and Mr. Dignum came and charged him with attempting to shoot the pistol at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him why he shot the man? - I did not till we were going to the watch-house, he said he would shoot any that attempted to desert from him or to rescue, he told me that the prosecutor resisted and took the shears.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon, in King-street, Hanover-square, I was called in to the assistance of Caffery, on the 27th of March, I found him with his eyes much inflamed in very great pain, in the lower part of the forehead there was some inflammation had already taken place, and it appeared to me to be a little singed, I extracted what powder I could, washed and syrenged the eyes, and left him in a much easier state than I found him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any of the wadding? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor's eye get better, or has he been blind? - It got better, and afterwards grew worse again.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the fight hurted at all? - I think very little, I hope he will perfectly recover it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been deprived of fight since the accident? - For a while he has not been able to open his eyes on account of the inflammation, there appeared danger of his losing his fight from the inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no wound of any sort? - Not any, but it seemed as if the skin had been blistered. I should not have known that the pistol was loaded with ball.</p>
               <p>Q. How near would you suppose it to be? - I should suppose about half a yard, I should certainly think that the distance was not great, because there was a considerable swelling, and a very great degree of inflammation on the lower part of the forehead, and it appeared in some degree to be circumscribed, there appeared not space for the powder to expand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

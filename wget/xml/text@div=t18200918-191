There was a vast crowd of persons. I was holding my head down, not wishing to see the flames. I felt a something at my side, and saw a person's hand having hold of my chain; the watch was immediately snatched from my fob - I immediately collared the person who took it. He held up his hands, but had not got it then, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got it." He was taken from me by a constable before I could observe him. I do not think the prisoner is the person. Immediately as he said he had not got it a person picked it off the pavement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you able to say the man you seized took your watch - A. Most posively. That man's face I thought totally different from the prisoner's, but his coat was the same. He had a brown coat and a black handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the fire; a boy ran to me, and said a man had taken a gentleman's watch. I went into the mob, and collared the prisoner, who was pointed out as the thief - some gentleman had hold of him at the time, but I do not know who, I believe it was the prosecutor.

            . I am labourer to Mr. Parker, of Argyle-street. I was getting the things out of Mr. Thompson's house during the fire; my master had hold of Mr. Wakeley's arm, and told me to take hold of the other, as seemed much distressed. When I came to the door Mr. Wakeley said he had lost his watch, and I picked it off the pavement. My master's door was about five or six yards from the prosecutor's. I did not see him lay hold of any one. Some person kicked my arm to prevent my picking it up.</p>

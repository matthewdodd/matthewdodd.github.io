            , the prosecutor; Mrs. Breedon lived by Bedford-square; she is a lady of fortune; to the best of my remembrance, about last September twelvemonth, on a Tuesday evening, a chariot was brought and left at Mr. Cropper's shop, and Mrs. Breedon said, she would call the next day, or the day after; I believe it was two days after, Mrs. Breedon was talking with Mr. Cropper, to know what he would give her for it, he said, he could not fix a price upon other people's goods; and she said, she was told seven years ago it was worth thirty pounds; Mr. Cropper told her, it was not worth one third of that, and Mrs. Breedon said, she should like to change it for a phaeton, and Mr. Cropper shewed her a phaeton, and they agreed for a phaeton, and to have the chariot in exchange.</p>
               <p>Tell us particularly what the agreement was? - Mrs. Breedon was to give Mr. Cropper twelve guineas and her old chariot, and he was to have one guinea for painting her arms; it was a second hand phaeton, and was to be fitted up for Mrs. Breedon.</p>
               <p>Did she see the phaeton at the time? - Yes, and the phaeton was fitted up according to Mrs. Breedon's agreement; she gave order for a fresh lining; and made in a thorough repair, fit for use; when the phaeton was ready, Mrs. Breedon sent about six weeks after, to the best of my remembrance, and said, she would not have the phaeton, and when Mr. Cropper read the note, he said, it was children's play, and he would not do any such thing, he would have his bargain, and he went on and had it done against the time; he sent to Mrs. Breedon; and she said, she would not have any thing to do with it at all; then there was a trial came on about it; Mrs. Breedon arrested Mr. Cropper for thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>What did they together value it at? - Mr. Cropper said, it was not worth one third of thirty pounds; she was to give twelve guineas and the chariot for the phaeton, and one guinea down for putting in the arms.</p>
               <p>Court. Which brought the action first, do you know? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not Cropper arrest her for thirteen guineas? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What is this phaeton worth? - To the best of my judgement it is worth twenty or three or four and twenty pounds; that I take to be the value of it; I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Have you a mind to buy a bargain this morning, I will sell you one cheap, will you give me three pounds for it? - I do not want to buy any such thing.</p>
               <p>What is become of the chariot? - I do not know; I have not lived with Mr. Cropper for some time.</p>
               <p>You was a witness upon the trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know that there was some one question that the Counsel did not ask you, that if they had asked you, it would have turned the verdict, and she would have the verdict instead of Mr. Cropper? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you never said, if the Counsel had asked you one question that he did not ask, Mrs. Breedon would have had a verdict instead of Mr. Cropper? - To the best of my knowledge, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, after the trial, did not you say, that if Mrs. Breedon's Counsel had asked you one question, it would have turned the verdict? - I do not remember that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you remember what you write, better than what you say; did you ever write a letter to Mrs. Breedon after the trial? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Recollect what you did write, and I will refresh your memory presently? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did not you write her thus, that if she would give you ten guineas, you would inform her how she might set aside all the proceedings against her, and put one hundred<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250226"></xptr> guineas in her pocket? - Yes, I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Was you in Cropper's service then? - Yes, I believe I was.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by that, how was you to put a hundred guineas into her pocket? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not Cropper see that letter before it was sent? - No, Sir, I do not believe he did.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear he did not? - Yes, Sir; he did not know of it.</p>
               <p>Did not he desire you to write such a letter, upon your oath? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon was this after Cropper came from the hulks? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What was you to do for her, suppose she had given you the ten guineas, what was you to have done. (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Why it was to tell the whole truth, was not it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Let us know what this whole truth and this half truth is? - I told every thing I was asked.</p>
               <p>What did you mean to do or say for her? - That she always insisted that she never would have the phaeton; and it was six weeks after that she sent countermand</p>
               <p>You did not swear that on the former trial? - I was not asked it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What conversation had you with Cropper, before the trial in the King's-bench? - No more than he told me to tell the truth; he never at no time, to the best of my knowledge, told me to conceal the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you sworn on the trial in the Court of King's-bench? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What kind of oath did you take? - To speak the truth to what was asked me to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Can you repeat the oath? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Should you know it if repeated again? did you take oath,</p>
               <p>"The evidence you</p>
               <p>"shall give before the Court and Jury</p>
               <p>"sworn, shall be the truth, the whole</p>
               <p>"truth, and nothing but the truth, so help</p>
               <p>"you God?" - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then why did not you tell the whole truth without being asked? - I told all that I was asked.</p>
               <p>But that was not the oath you took.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where do you live now? - In Charlton-street, Mary-le-bone; I lodge at Mr. Eaton's.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was servant to Mrs. Breedon; I took a note to Cropper for her.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the note? - I was present in the drawing-room with Mrs. Breedon, when the tradesman and she were together; it was after I took the note, I brought the candlestick to take the impression of the arms; and it was a clear exchange; and the tradesman was to have twelve guineas, and a guinea to put in the arms; I heard the lady say, let her friends say what they would, the phaeton she would have; nobody was present but us three; I fetched a silver waiter out that had the arms on at the time; he was to go the Herald's-office, to see that the arms were right; I recollect nothing else; I fetched down the servant's livery, that the inside of the phaeton might match with the livery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When was this, my girl? - It was about a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Was that before any action was brought? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke, another of the Defendant's Counsel. Will you tell my Lord and the Jury, where you got that pretty word, clear exchange? - I heard it a great many times more than once between the tradesman and the lady.</p>
               <p>Did they use the word clear exchange? - Certainly they did.</p>
               <p>What does it mean? - Why clear exchange is not goods sold and delivered.</p>
               <p>I do not well understand what clear exchange is? - Why clear exchange is clear exchange.</p>
               <p>Have you been in the service of an attorney? - No; she was to give twelve guineas more besides the chariot.</p>
               <p>Did you hear that lady with whom you lived, say that it was a clear exchange?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250227"></xptr> - Upon my oath I did, and I will swear it before a Bench of Justices.</p>
               <p>Did you likewise hear her say, that a clear exchange was not goods sold and delived? - No, I did not; I heard her express that it would not be so much expence to have an exchange as to buy it.</p>
               <p>You did not hear the lady say it was for goods sold and delivered? - Clear exchange is not goods sold and delivered.</p>
               <p>How do you know that, who first gave you that information; you was not born with it? - My imagination tells me so.</p>
               <p>Do you know a Mr. Brown? - Yes, I know him by going to the King's-bench with him upon the first trial.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with Mr. Brown on this subject? - No more than if he asked me any questions, I answered him; I never saw him before I went to the Court of King's-bench.</p>
               <p>Was not your name called by the cryer of the Court? - I was subpoened; Mr. Brown's clerk served me; I did not talk to him or his clerk; neither Mr. Brown nor his clerk knew what I could say.</p>
               <p>Since the trial in the King's-bench, have you ever had any conversation with any person about this business? - I never repeated what I said there; I had nobody to speak to.</p>
               <p>Where do you live now? - I live with one Mr. Elms, a stationer, near the Jew's-harp-tavern, Mary-bone; I never spoke to any person about this cause; I did not live with the lady; she was a lodger, and boarded with my mistress; I left the house where I lived, I was in view of a better place.</p>
               <p>Have you never declared since the trial, that you was to do for the defendant at all events? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Did you never say any thing at all about this trial? - I never heard any thing about it, till I was subpoened; it is a very disagreeable circumstance to me.</p>

               <p>Have you been a coach-maker for the last twenty years without interruption? - No, Sir, I have not.</p>
               <p>There was a little interruption of your trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I do not call him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He is sworn; he is the Court's witness now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then I will go on with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We have heard that it was a year's interruption to your trade? - A year! you make a mistake; it was only three months or thereabouts; I received the King's pardon.</p>
               <p>Have you got it? - I have not got it, Mr. Garrow; I did not know it was necessary, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Very well, Mr. Cropper.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow waved his objection to the competency of this witness.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then Mr. Cropper give us the account of this transaction between Mrs. Breedon and you? - In September, 1785, the lady came to me, and asked me if I dealt in carriages; she said, she had a carriage in the country, and had no place to put it up in town; I told her if the lady chose to send for it from the country, she might put it in my place for a few weeks, till such time she had a coach-house, or some other place to put it in; a few days after the carriage came to my shop; I was not at home; word was left for me to wait upon the lady the next day at eleven o'clock; she was busy; she came in a coach to my shop; she asked me what I would give her for the carriage; I told her it was not the business of a tradesman to put a price on another person's property; the lady then said, that about seven years ago the chariot was worth about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250228"></xptr> thirty pounds, as she was told by her coach-maker who made it; but twenty years before, it cost her sixty pounds; it was her wedding carriage; I told her that a carriage that was worth a hundred pounds seven years ago, would not be worth that now, as fashions alter; it was not worth one third of the money now; the lady observed she should like to make an exchange of her chariot for a phaeton, and asked me what she should give me with her chariot, for a phaeton and plated harness; I told her fifteen guineas; she told me, she thought it too much, she would give me twelve; I told her she should have it at twelve guineas and her chariot; she would have her arms; and I told her I would only charge her what the painter charged me, which was a guinea; she told me then, there was a matter she did not mention to me, which was, she could not pay me till Christmas; I told her that was not material, and she did not want it till that time; a few weeks after a gentleman came with her, of the name of Martin; the lady sent me a letter by

               <p>Have you got that letter? - No, I went to the lady, and she told me she was sorry to inform me that she could not have the phaeton, for she had information by her friends, that none but ladies of easy virtue rode in phaetons; I told the lady I had served a number of ladies of family and character with phaetons; the lady told me she would call, and bring a gentleman with her in the course of that day, or the next; I believe it was the same day she called with Mr. Martin; he asked me where the chariot was; I told him it was at the painter's; he asked me if he could see it; I told him yes; I went with him to the painter's to see it; Mrs. Breedon then said, I had made a great alteration in it, and asked me at the same time what would be the expences, if she was to take her chariot again, with the money I had laid out upon it; I told her, I thought it would be about twenty, or twenty-four pounds, the way I meant to finish it; she then said, she should have an objection to riding in the chariot, as it was her wedding chariot, and she should be affected with the thoughts of her husband; she asked if I could not get her another chariot; I told her at some expence I could, I knew a lady at Bath, that was going to throw up her carriage; but she came to town, and kept her carriage on; she said, in the course of time you may meet with one; I said I would endeavour to meet with one; I received another letter from her by this

            , and I waited on the lady; and she said, I have considered of it, and let my friends say what they will, I insist on having the phaeton; this was about a fortnight after Mr. Martin had been with her to my house; then Mrs. Breedon ordered a servant to fetch a silver-waiter, for there was some difference she thought in her arms or crest, and a candlestick was brought to examine it; I told her I could not find out any, without I was to examine at the Herald's-office; she then desired a candle, and she would give me the impression of her arms and crest in wax, and the name of her husband she gave me in writing, to examine the family arms; and sent the servant to fetch the livery, to see if some lace she had seen in my shop was near the livery; she then told me to go on with it as I thought proper, till just before Christmas, which I did; and a few weeks before Christmas, I received of her a note to wait on her, and she told me, she had put by all thoughts of having a phaeton, and I must give her thirty pounds for her chariot; I told the lady I was not indebted to her thirty pounds, nor no such sum, but when the phaeton was finished and delivered, she was indebted to me fifteen guineas; she said, that if I did not pay her the thirty pounds, she should put it into the hands of her attorney; then I received a letter from one Mr. Allen, that if I did not pay her thirty pounds, I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250229"></xptr> he sued; I then went to Mrs. Breedon, I could not see her; I left my name; the servant came again at five o'clock; I went there, and I saw a gentleman, which was Mr. Allen, sitting by the fire, apparently asleep; the lady then asked me some questions about her carriage, and when I thought to pay her; I told her the agreement was an exchange, and I never thought of paying her any money; she said, she would sue me if I did not pay her; Mr. Allen at last starts up, pray Sir, says he, what have you done with the phaeton; says I, I have done nothing to it; then says he, oh, you have done nothing to it, that is what I want, now I will ruin you; I told Mrs. Breedon, I did not any way stand indebted to her in any money, neither should I pay her any money whatever; Mr. Allen said, he would ruin me, he would arrest me, and if there was a possibility of ruining me, he would; I then left the place, and went to my attorney Mr. Brown, of Rathbone-place, and told him my business; I arrested the lady for thirteen guineas; I went with the officer, and she kept me in the room till Mr. Allen was sent for, then I came away; I was arrested a few days afterwards for thirty pounds; and I was at Mr. Parsons the officer's, from between seven and eight in the morning till twelve.</p>
               <p>Had you at any time agreed for the purchase of this chariot or not? - Never, I never thought of agreeing, as I always thought it to be an exchange; she told me, that seven years ago it was worth thirty pounds; she said it had been built twenty years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have stated all that you know? - All that is material to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The last thing that you said was, that you never did agree to purchase the chariot, and that you never had such an idea in your life? - I will not say I never had such an idea, I thought of purchasing it when she first mentioned it, but afterwards, no otherwise than by exchange.</p>

               <p>And you told her if she chose to have that back again, she must pay you twenty or twenty-four pounds for the additions that were made; now, what is become of the chariot? - I sold it to a gentleman in Princes-street; I believe I sold it about two months before.</p>
               <p>Did you sell it before you was arrested? - Yes, about a month before.</p>
               <p>How much might this old wedding chariot fetch you? - I think thirty-six pounds or guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you ever the phaeton? - I sent the phaeton home to the door; they could not take it in, they had no coach house.</p>
               <p>When? - After the lady said, she would insist on my paying her; it was before I arrested her I sent the phaeton home.</p>

               <p>And before you made your affidavit to hold her to bail perhaps? - Yes, it was; because I was advised by my attorney not to appear against her till I sent the carriage and harness home.</p>

               <p>How long did you keep it? - Not many days.</p>
               <p>What became of it then? - The lady sent for it in a few days after she was arrested.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not it continue with you till after the trial of the civil action? - No, I do not think it; I am of opinion that she sent for it again in a few days after she was arrested, and then I believe it was not in my possession at the trial of the civil action, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was sent for before the action? - No, I will not.</p>
               <p>How much is this phaeton worth? - About three or four and twenty pounds, harness and all.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I gave fifteen pounds for the phaeton before ever I lined it or painted it, or any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Was it worth fifteen guineas when you sent it home? - Yes, that I swear; and the harness was worth very near half the money.</p>
               <p>You have told us that after the lady had countermanded this phaeton when she came herself with Mr. Martin, she sent for you again, and then she told you in spight of all her friends, she was determined to have it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told us all that passed between you and the lady in the presence of Mr. Allen? - As near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>And you have told it truly? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he said that which you have stated him to have said, or any thing like it? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>I will repeat it. (Repeats it.) - It was that, or to that effect; that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Did you say, in the presence of Allen, that you did not care whether she took the phaeton or not, for you could get more money for it after Christmas? - Upon my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>That you swear positive? - I do positively.</p>
               <p>Nor any thing to that effect? - No, nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>Master Cropper, let us have one word more, now you scratch your ears it is symptomatic of the pillory, it locks like a presentiment; did you, or did you not say to Mrs. Breedon, that you could have more money in the spring for the phaeton? - At that time I did say I could have made more money of it in the spring of the year; says I, I could have sold it to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250231"></xptr> number of customers; that was in September.</p>
               <p>You know at the time Mr. Martin came, you could not say that, because it was before you had lost any time; upon your oath, when Mr. Allen was present, did not you say it was immaterial to you whether she took it again or not, for that you could get more money for it after Christmas? - Never; that I do swear positively.</p>
               <p>Did you never acknowledge in the presence of Allen that you was to pay or allow her thirty pounds for the chariot? - Never upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Are you the prosecutor of this indictment? - Yes, I should imagine so; I understood myself that I prosecute Mrs. Breedon for perjury.</p>
               <p>You pay the expences of the prosecution? - I have paid too much of it already; I did employ my attorney till I saw such villainous proceedings going on, I was obliged to put it into the hands of another; I pay the expences and nobody pays them else.</p>
               <p>Court. Mind, and attend to my question, and be careful of the answer, what did you do with the chariot after Mrs. Breedon left it with you before you sold it? - I bordered, run braids round the roof and door; the perch was cracked, and the wheels entirely ran down; I took off the moulding round the roof, and down the hind pillar; I put plated bits and gores; and one hundred and forty, or one hundred and fifty foot of plated work round the chariot; I then put plated joints to it, which are about three guineas a pair; I put six head-plates, at twenty-four shillings a-piece, that amounts to the aditional sum that I sold it for afterwards more, than I valued it at, when I took it in exchange; I laid out upon it about three or four and twenty pounds, that I am sure I did not clear myself when I sold it, by allowing ten pounds for the carriage; I sold it for thity-six guineas or pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time of the day was it when you saw Mr. Allen at Mrs. Breedon's, you said, between five and six? - It was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was not it between twelve and one? - I do not think it was; I think it was in the evening between five and six; I will not be too positive.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. Have you any evidence to the value of the chariot? - No, I have not; it has been so altered.</p>
               <p>Cropper. I would not give more than nine or ten pounds for it, if it was brought to my shop tomorrow; that is the extent of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have many witnesses on the part of the lady, but I rest it here.</p>

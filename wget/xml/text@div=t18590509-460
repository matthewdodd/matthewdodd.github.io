                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Charles Nicholson—the prisoner was employed by Mrs. McLean to carry the goods to and from our warehouse for the work-people—I remember her coming on 27th April—I saw her in the warehouse within two or three yards of the place where I was sitting—she remained two or three hours. I know this silk—it is the property of Mr. Charles Nicholson—I know it was safe during the time that the prisoner was in the warehouse—I had it in my hand while she was there, and took three yards off—I missed it about half-an-hour after she had left—I did not see it again till I saw it in Mr. Coley's shop—I am sure it is the same silk—it is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—had it been a plain silk I could not have so easily identified it—I bought it myself recently in Paris.</p>

I am forewoman to Mrs. McLean, a mantle-maker—on 27th April, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I went to the warehouse of Mr. Nicholson—the prisoner was with me—she had been in the habit of taking things backwards and forwards—she went with me that day—I remained there while she was there—we left together—she had a basket with her which was large enough to have held this parcel—the basket was covered—there was something in it when she brought it into the warehouse—there was room in the basket for the things I entrusted her to take beside this parcel, and a great deal more—I did not put the things that I purchased into the basket; I gave them to her to put in.</p>

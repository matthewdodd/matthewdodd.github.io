                  </hi>. I live at 2, St. Matthew's Place, Brixton—on the evening of 19th July about 9.10, I fastened my parlour window with a common catch, and went to bed soon afterwards—I came down in the morning about. 5.30, and found some plants which had been in the window, removed to the front garden—the window was shut, but unfastened—I missed things belonging to my son, and my wife's cape.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 231). On 20th July about 4.20, am., Mr. Monk met me in Cold Harbour Lane, and made a complaint—about ten minutes afterwards I saw 'the prisoner and two others coming in a direction from Mr. Monk's house—I asked them what they were doing at that early hour in the morning—they refused to give me a satisfactory answer, and I told them that I should take them on suspicion of being concerned in breaking into Mr. Monk's house—they all separated and called out "Escape"—I followed the prisoner and took him, and found this boy's jacket in the middle of his back between his coat and the lining—he said that he picked it up coming from Croydon—this stick which is cut like a chisel corresponds with marks on Mr. Monk's house—the prisoner was carrying it in his hand.</p>

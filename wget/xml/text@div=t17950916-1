               <p>Q. Was it quite light at that time? - Yes; I picked up one of these young girls, I forget her name, I believe it is Deane; I went with her to Mrs. English's house, and there I was robbed of this money.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were you robbed? - I cannot say, I was so much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man or single? - A married man.</p>
               <p>Q. You see the danger of getting into liquor? - Yes, I was very much in liquor, and I cannot say how I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that is the woman that you went home with? - Yes, I was sober enough to know that is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober enough to know that English was there, that kept the house? - Yes, she kept the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you undressed? - Yes, I lost seven guineas in the house, but I cannot tell how I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed as soon as you went into that house; you went in at six o'clock you say? - Yes, but I cannot tell what time I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to know at the time you went into the house, that you had this silk handkerchief, and this money about you? - Yes, I was sober enough to know that, because I pulled it out; the money was in my breeches pocket, all loose.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last, before you picked up this young woman? - I see it at the public house in <placeName id="t17950916-1-crimeloc3">Winfield-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever recover any of your money? - Yes, two guineas, which I tied up in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you, that made you discover that the property was missing? - I recollect myself being in a strange room when I awaked.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160004"></xptr>Q. Were either of these women in the room? - No, neither of them at all; when I awaked I got up and dressed myself and went out, I don't know what time, I was in liquor then almost.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you describe them? - Yes, I took the man to shew him them, I could not give him much description of them; I found two at the house, Mrs. English and Mrs. Hog.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - I am not certain whether the officer searched them or no, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recover any property at that time? - No, the first money that I recovered was before; they did not rob me of all at first, I had some left after the first time they robbed me, I had two guineas, and I tied it up in my handkerchief for safety, and then afterwards the handkerchief and money and all were gone, but how I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you ever recover any of this money? - I recovered none that I lost first, but I recovered the two guineas of Deane afterwards, I kept that and spent it.</p>

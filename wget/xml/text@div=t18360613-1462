                  </hi>. I live in Gee-street, St. Lukes, and am a clock case-maker. About eight o'clock on the evening of the 16th of May, the prisoner came to purchase a pair of shoes—my wife keeps a shoe shop there—the prisoner tried three or four shoes and said none suited her, and she asked me to look out a larger pair against she came back—about half an hour after she was gone the policeman came with this lace and these shoes—this lace I can swear was taken from my shop window, where I had several cards of lace—these shoes resemble mine, and I believe are mine.</p>

A few minutes past eight o'clock on the night of the 16th of May, I was at the end of Gee-street—I saw the prisoner there and part of this lace hanging down her clothes—I went up and asked "how came this"—she said, "It is a bit of lace"—she said she bought it in a shop in Goswell-street—I asked her what shop—she said she did not know—I asked if she would go with me, whether she could make out the shop—she said no—I felt round her and felt the card—I made further search and found the shoes under her arm.</p>
               <p>(Mary Ann Newton, of Union-court, gave the prisoner a good character and promised to take her into her service.)</p>

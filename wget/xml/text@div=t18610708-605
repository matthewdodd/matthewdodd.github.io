                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I reside at Clapham, and am a merchant's clerk. About 11 o'clock, on 2d July, I was walking near the Bank—the prisoner came very close to me, and asked me where I was going—I replied that I wished to go home—she then asked me if she could go with me—I replied, "I do not believe they will allow a young lady in the hotel I am stopping at—she then asked me if I would not go with her—I said, "No; I am going home"—she then asked me if I would give her something to drink—I replied, "I have had sufficient to drink to-day"—during that time she managed to get me up a small turning—she made some other observation' to me which I do not like to express—she then asked me how much. I would give her: I did not make any reply—she wished me to take liberties with her, which I refused—I then felt some<lb></lb>thing at my waistcoat pocket—I immediately felt, and missed my watch—I had seen it there a couple of minutes previously, I bad it in my hand to see what time it was—as soon as I missed it I caught the prisoner by the arm, and accused her of robbing me of my watch—she said, "Silly man, I have not got your watch"—I said, "You have"—a young man then came towards us, and begged of me to let go of her—he wanted to push himself between us—he said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "This girl has robbed me of my watch"—he said, "That cannot be possible"—I said that it was the case—the man said, "If that is true I will go and fetch a policeman"—I then distinctly saw the prisoner hand over something to him, and he ran off—the prisoner then begged of me and tried all her exertions to get out of my grasp—I dragged her into the open street, and gave her in charge.</p>

               <p>this turning, because I did not know the time—that was after I had spoken to those other two—I was up the entry with this woman between five and ten minutes, but part of that time I had hold of her—I will swear I was not up there twenty minutes.</p>

About a quarter before 11 o'clock, on 2d July, I was on duty in Moorgate-street—I was turning into Telegraph-street when I was called—I found the prisoner in the prosecutor'scustody—he delivered her over to me—she was searched, and one penny found on her—she gave me an address, which I went to.</p>

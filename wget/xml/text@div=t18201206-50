On the 7th of November, a woman came, and bought a piece of bacon, which came to 9 1/2 d. and she gave me a 1 l. note; I suspected it - I went out, and saw the prisoner waiting at the corner, about twenty yards off. I went to Leather-lane for an officer, but did not find him. I returned in about three or four minutes, and saw the prisoner again, walking up and down the street. I found the woman still in my house, and took her myself. I saw the prisoner in custody at my door, before I carried the woman away. Hudson, an officer, first came, and Norris brought the prisoner to the door. The third woman said, in the prisoner's hearing at the office, that she was servant to both of them, at No. 19, West-street, Smithfield. While the woman was in my shop, I saw the prisoner pass the door once after I returned from the officers; (looks at a note,) this is what Roach offered me.</p>

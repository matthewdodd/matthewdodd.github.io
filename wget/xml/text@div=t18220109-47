On the morning of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090028"></xptr>the 20th of November, I was awoke about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, by my errand boy, the prisoner, H. Brown, coming to my bed-room door, and crying out,</p>
               <p>"Master, Master, get up, you have been robbed, and every thing is stripped and turned topsy turvy." He had lived six months with me; I immediately got up, went into the shop, and found the pins of my cabinet punched out; they contained the best part of my property; the pins of the hinges were out; the shop is in the back attic; the cabinet was secured by two bolts and a patent lock, (Braman's.) I had left it perfectly secure at ten o'clock the night before, as I imagined; but on the morning of the 19th, about seven o'clock, I had heard a knocking.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the pins punched out, in what state was the lock. - A. There had been an attempt to break open the lock, but they could not; the cabinet contained three hundred rings, lockets, watches, pins, seals, brooches, ear-rings, snuff-boxes, scent boxes, snaps, pearls, emeralds, &amp;c. The whole of the property in the cabinet amounted to about one thousand seven hundred pounds; the whole of it was gone; I found all the drawers of the workshop scattered about, and about 500 l. worth of unfinished work gone, which had been in the drawers; I examined the drawers, they were all unlocked but one, and that one appeared to have been wrenched open by a crow bar; it was the foreman's drawer; Brown was with me when I examined, and found a metal gilt watch; he said,</p>
               <p>"Master, here is one of the watches," and cried bitterly; and said, what should he do, for I was ruined; I found three keys laying together in the workshop which did not belong to me, and two or three days after, we found a part of a dark lantern in a cistern, where the men used to wash themselves; my workman, Shepperd, found the other part of the lantern; the parts corresponded together; I found a lamp which I use, in the front parlour, which was not the place for it; I sent Brown to my father, and got assistance from Bow-street; a man who worked for me and had been recommended by Brown to me, stated something about his friends being bad, and we took Brown to Bow-street; he made application there to see me; I saw him, and held out no expectations whatever to him; Davis was present.</p>

             re-examined. I went in with Davis, who said to him,</p>
               <p>"I understand you have something to say to your master." Brown then said, that on the 19th of November, he let in Thomas and Brown. I am sure he mentioned those two, and I believe he mentioned Newman; but I cannot be sure; he said he let him in about seven o'clock; and after showing them round the shop where the property lay, and where they would find it, that they went up in the loft over the workshop, and concealed themselves there all day; and that we should find Thomas and Brown at a man named Allen, at Eagle-court, Catharine-street, and that one of the boys lived with Big Eyed Sook, and the other with Poll Lamb; and we should find one on the first floor back, and the other on the second floor front. He stated that he let them in on the day of the robbery; he said nothing more at that time. I asked him who punched the pins out of the cabinet; and he said he did; but did not say how. I have not recovered one article.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BROWN. Q. I never said I punched out the pins - A. He did, in Davis's presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he sleep in the house - A. No. He came about seven o'clock in the morning. He told me of the robbery about twenty minutes before eight.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What time he came to the premises you cannot say - A. No. One of the servants would let him in. I know Stokes carried on the business of a steel pipe watch key maker; a furnace is not necessary in his business. I have been to his premises, and find he has one which will melt fifty ounces of gold at once.</p>

             came out after his master had paid him, which was between eight and nine o'clock, and said the robbery could not be done that night, as his master was in the workshop, doing up his books - we all parted, and agreed to meet on Monday, and asked if he would let us in; he said he would. On Monday morning, between five and six o'clock, Thomas, Newman, and I, went to the White Hart, public-house, Swan-yard. Brooks had not come. We went without him, as Brown said we must come directly, and he could not stop.

             went in first to his master's house, and after he had been in some little time, he came and opened the door, we three went in, and took our shoes off, and went up stairs. Brooks did not join us at all. We got up to the workshop at the top of the house. Brown said he would file the edge of the cabinet, which he did, as it should not make a noise when we came to open it. He then shewed us the cock-loft over the shop, where we were to hide - we went in there - we had three keys, and a dark lanthern.

             came up with some victuals to us; I told him to go to Mr. Allen's, and fetch me the crow-bar. Allen lives at No. 1, Eagle-court; he went and brought it to me - I told him to ask Allen for the victuals, and I suppose he brought the victuals from there. We continued in the loft all day, till between twelve and one one o'clock on Monday night, then got down and got into the workshop - we had a phosphorous box and dark lanthern. We opened all the workmen's drawers that we could; they were not fastened - one drawer on the left hand was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090029"></xptr>broken open with a crow-bar. Some unfinished rings, a pair of gold watch cases, two gold snuff boxes, lined, and several other unfinished articles, and bits of gold, were taken from the drawers. We then took the cabinet hinges off, as Brown had directed us - they had been filed - we took from there eight gold watches, a few diamonds, a great quantity of rings, ear-rings, rubies, bracelets, and pearls. We left the drawers all scattered about the place, and tied the property up; we put some in our pockets, and some I carried in my hat - each took what he could - when we had got the property, we could not take the dark lantern or the keys; we threw the lantern in the cistern, and put the keys on the work bench - we took the crowbar away with us, and then came down stairs - it was between three and four o'clock. We could not get out, as the street door was double locked, and the key taken out. We opened the parlour window shutters, threw up the sash, and got out that way - we first went into the kitchen, - we went into the Strand, and took a coach, and went to Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, to

             was in bed there - she got up, opened the door, and let us in, and we all went in. Newman called her up. The street door is always open. We had the property with us. Newman said she must get up, because he wanted her. She lit the fire, put the kettle on, and then prepared some tea; and while the kettle was getting ready, we took out the property, and put it on the tea-board, and then put it on the bed. She was in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by either of you - A. She said she should like a pair of pearl ear-rings, and a locket, which would do for the child, to put hair in, and she should like one of the watches, which was done with pearls. We told her where the property came from; we asked her what the things would fetch. She said it would be about eighty pounds a piece. Newman said he must get up, for he wished her to carry these things to a place. We sorted the finished from the unfinished things. Newman put them into a bag. They were to be taken to the prisoner Williams, who called himself Stokes. Newman said they were to be carried there. Eates carried the bag - we all went with her to Stokes's house in a court in Goswell Street; we got there about six o'clock in the morning, and saw him; Newman called him on one side of the room. Stokes, Eates, and him, went out of the house to have something to drink, leaving me and Thomas in Stokes's workshop (he makes, steel pipes for watch keys). He returned in about ten minutes - Eates went away. Stokes's wife was then getting up; she came into the room, and he told her to go down, which she did. Newman then called Stokes aside, and told him he wanted his crucible; Stokes went and cleaned it out to melt the gold. Stokes made a fire and put it on, and we put the unfinished work in, such as watch cases and chains, and all the unfinished work, and melted it. The snuff boxes were given to Stokes, as he said he thought he could sell them, and one he said he would keep; they were made a present of to him, as he said he might sell them, and make a little money of them. Newman gave him two sovereigns for the use of the place to melt the gold, and gave him the two snuff boxes, and two old gold seals. There were only two snuff-boxes; the rest of the property was left at Stokes's. Mrs. Stokes came in, and we gave her a pair of ear-rings, and two finger rings, which she said she should like; we then wanted to know where we should sell the property. Newman called Stokes aside, and left me and Thomas by the fire; this was about two or three o'clock in the afternoon. We had been there all the morning, melting the gold - there was very little fire, and the heat was not sufficient. Newman came to us, and said he would take a coach, and fetch a man to buy the property. We took a coach, and went to Solomon's, Petticoat-lane - I, Newman, and Thomas went. Newman went in at the door, and we waited outside. In about five minutes he came out with Solomon, whom we took back to Stokes's with us in the coach. Stokes came into the room - he, Solomon, and Newman, went aside, and had some conversation together. Solomon said he would not look at the things there; but told us to go to the Rose and Crown, public-house, and he would take them there. We went to the Rose and Crown, public-house, Bunhill-row. Newman told us to go in the parlour, which we did. In about ten minutes Newman and Solomon came, with the property in two bags, as we had left it. Solomon brought it into the room - Newman had some private conversation with Solomon, and told me and Thomas to go into the yard; which we did. There was a window there, so that we could see all over the parlour; and saw the property on the table. Solomon was sorting it; we saw him put it in two bags, and twist it up; and then they called us on. Newman said he had agreed with Solomon about the property. We asked Solomon what he was to give for it. He said 200 l. for the whole - that he had only 100 l. with him, which he paid. He said he would fetch his partner,

Newman called us into the parlour - we had something to drink. Nathan said he had paid the 100 l. to Newman, which made up the 200 l. Yates came in, and we had something to drink at the bar - Nathan was gone then. The 100 l. was left in the care of Newman. Solomon came with Nathan, and was present when the 100 l. was paid - he brought

             then gave me 15 l.; I had more afterwards, in all 30 l. After I received the 15 l., Solomon and Yates were drinking at the bar. Solomon said, the best thing I and Thomas could do, was to go into the country - we said we would - Nathan was gone then. Newman then told us to go to the Cobourg Theatre, and wait there till he came. I saw Brooks on the Friday - he said he heard the robbery had been done, and he expected his regulars, meaning the share of the money. We three gave him five sovereigns each, which made up 15 l. I directed Dawes to Solomon's and Nathan's houses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. At what time did you and the others meet in Swan-yard - A. On Monday morning between five and six o'clock; we got to the house about half six; Brown let us in, we saw him about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090030"></xptr>breakfast time; I sent him for the iron between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and did not see him after dinner time, which was one o'clock, till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled that there was no proof of Brown being a principal in the robbery, and as such, the indictment could not be sustained.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what was the difficulty, how came you to get into Newgate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a suit in Chancery which annoyed me for nearly nine years, and was advised to get rid of it by becoming a bankrupt, which I did—I knew my property would pay my debts before I went to Newgate—I made no proposition to pay, knowing the Court had an account which would pay it.</p>

               <p>the original sum—I had no security on the property in the Grange-road—I had nothing whatever to do with them—he owed me money as a new debt, a debt contracted subsequent to those due to me on the mortgage deeds—I was not a party, directly or indirectly, in erecting those premises—I have no interest in the premises in Grange-road—I lent him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, towards the insurance—I understand part of the money he had from me paid the insurance—those premises were burnt down—there have been a good many bill transactions between me and Reuben Hunt, jun.—an action has been brought against me by the prisoner on the three bills produced—I got an order to inspect them—I took a man named Nethercliff to inspect them, and Messrs. Adlard, the engravers—I did not inspect the I O U s, but the bills, and denied their being my hand<lb></lb>writing—the order did not permit us to inspect the I O U s—I do not recollect whether this was after I had pleaded to the action—there was hardly a month elapsed between the pretended claim being made and the matter coming on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After taking Adlard and Nethercliff to inspect the bills, did not you instruct your attorney to apply for leave to add a plea that the bills were given for the accommodation of William Hunt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him no in<lb></lb>structions whatever beyond defending the action—I swear I did not so instruct him—I did not know that the plea was made till I heard it in Court—I did not know of the application—I did not know what was done in the action—I first heard of it at Kingston, at the trial—these bills are accepted by Scammell and Davney, and drawn by Reuben Hunt, jun., on him—they are the bills I saw in the hands of Reuben Hunt, about two years after they were overdue, about two years ago—he applied to me several times to lend him money on them—my name was not on them then—my name appears on them as in<lb></lb>dorser, after Reuben Hunt, jun., as drawer—nobody was present when I saw them in his possession—he came to my house to borrow money—I refused—he offered these bills as security, and I refused them, saying I was a holder of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of bills on the same party—I had many bills of Scammell and Davney's, and every bill I had bears a number in my bill-book, which is now in Court, and have passed through my books, kept by my clerk—I have a great many of Scammell and Davney's bills now—I had no connection with them whatever—Reuben Hunt originally built this new paper-mill in Berners-street at my expense, especially as he said for Scammell and Davney at a rent of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and they gave their acceptences to Reuben Hunt—he brought them to me, and I ad<lb></lb>vanced cash, and subsequently obtained a mortgage.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you were never indebted to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my life, not a single farthing—he was indebted to me consider<lb></lb>ably—I never lent him my name to endeavour to raise money, or give him credit in the world—he was not entitled to it—he was not in business—I did not put my name, or authorize him to put it, to the I O U, or to have any instrument of this sort, to show that money was apparently coming to him—I never authorized him or anybody to put my name to an I O U, or any other document.</p>

               <p>of the prisoner—I received this order from the prisoner to repay Mr. Rogers five guineas out of some money that he expected to receive from an action that we were about to bring—it is dated "June 22nd, 1843," and states the money to have been borrowed on the 4th of July, 1842.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever heard the defendant say anything at all about any debt he owed to Mr. Rogers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he gave me this, he referred to particular money, borrowed on a particular day—I was to pay it out of that, and he also gave me instructions to bring an action against the assignees of his brother Reuben, and I was to hand over to Mr. Rogers half the money recovered by that action, in payment of the money that he owed him—that was sometime in 1842—we declined to bring the action—I do not recollect his coming to me for a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and telling me anything about Mr. Rogers—I was not concerned for him—he wished me to bring the action—he was talking to me then as his attorney—he had an action brought against him in Oct. 1840, by a person named Davney, for trespass—judgment had been allowed to go by default—I declined to appear in court for him at first—he said, "Well, if you will lend me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will give Mr. Chadwick Jones a brief to appear for me"—I declined to lend him the money, or to give a brief to counsel without the money—I was not then acting as his attorney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMFREY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not come to you as his attorney, to ask you to deliver a brief for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was in the course of the same conversation that he stated what I was about to mention.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you speak from the character of the handwriting, or from any circumstances which have come to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the character of the handwriting simply—I try to keep the circumstances away—there is one thing in particular, there is an upstroke to the T in "Thomas" which Mr. Rogers never makes—there is a similitude, but still a stiffness—it is not like a genuine signature, it is too fine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw these documents at the trial at Kingston, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw some of them—I saw the bills of exchange, and the I O U for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the other I O U there—I cannot tell whether it was produced at Kingston—to the best of my belief it was not—several witnesses were called at Kingston, a dozen, I think, to speak to Mr. Rogers's handwriting on the bills of exchange—clerks to solicitors—I do not think there were any banker's clerks—they were persons quite independent of the case—a Mr. George, clerk to Mr. Alder<lb></lb>man Wood, was called, and several others—they stated they believed these to be Mr. Rogers's handwriting—there were also witnesses called at the trial at Guildhall—I believe some of the same that were at Kingston—defence at Kingston was that they were forgeries.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And on the evidence having been given for the plaintiff, Lord Denman said this matter ought to be inquired into by an arbitrator, where both the parties could be examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not at that stage of the proceedings—it was after Mr. Sergeant Channell had addressed the jury for some time, and was reading the letters, borrowing small sums</p>

               <p>of money, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and so on, Lord Denman said, "There is something more in this case than I can try; it ought to go before an arbitrator, who can examine both the parties"—there were two or three meetings before the arbitrator—I am not positive which—I do not know whether it was after the last meeting that Mr. Rogers gave the prisoner into custody—it was not done by my'advice—I heard of his having been given into custody a day or two after—I do not think that was before the indictment for perjury was preferred against Mr. Rogers—there are some figures on the back of this I O U for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not present at any settlement between the pri<lb></lb>soner and Mr. Rogers at any time—there was no bill at any time given at my office by Mr. Rogers to the prisoner—I am positive of that—not to any of the Mr. Hunts—I was present at Mr. Hewitt's office when the Hunts and Mr. Rogers were there—I think there was then a bill given by Mr. Rogers to the prisoner—I cannot tell the date—the date of the release will tell—I dare say it was about the 7th of Nov., 1840.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you meet at Mr. Hewitt's office for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an action brought against Mr. Rogers by Scammell and Davney for some trespass he had committed on their premises in Berners-street, which were in the occupation of Hunt—Mr. Rogers agreed to advance money to settle the thing, and a bill was drawn by Hunt, which Mr. Rogers accepted—it was paid to Mr. Lewis to settle the action—the Hunts and Mr. Rogers were connected in some way with it—releases were signed on both sides, and all bills drawn on Scammell and Davney, who are the acceptors of the new bills, were professed to be given up to Mr. Rogers—the Hunts were parties to those releases—at the time of those releases there were in the hands of Mr. Rogers several bills of exchange, drawn by Reuben Hunt, jun., the drawer of these bills, on Scammell and Davney, the acceptors, and Mr. Rogers at that time returned all those bills to Scammell and Davney—there was a general settlement of the account, as far as Scammell and Davney were concerned, and they were to give up the premises—after the action of Hunt against Rogers had been going on, two engravers were taken to see these bills—there was one from the Bank, and one from the Post-office—I do not know their names—they were taken to Mr. Lewis's office to inspect the documents on which the action was brought—they went as men of skill, accustomed to forged handwriting—they went into Mr. Lewis's room to see them, but he de<lb></lb>clined to allow anybody else to go in but these two gentlemen—they were taken by me, under the Judge's order—after they had been taken to inspect the documents, I applied to the Judge to allow me, in addition to the plea that Mr. Rogers did not endorse, to plead a plea that the bills were given by Mr. Rogers for the accommodation of Hunt, but not in consequence of anything that they said, nor with the knowledge of Mr. Rogers—it was done under the advice of counsel, on the production of these letters, and I do not think it was the same day that Mr. Netherdiff and Mr. Adlard were examined—it was soon after, within two or three days after—I have no papers which will help me—neither Mr. Nethercliff nor Mr. Adlard were called as our witnesses at the trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They were called in as men of science, that was your object in calling them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not as persons acquainted with the handwriting of any of the parties—I had them to see whether the bills had been traced, for the purpose of ascertaining by what means the forgery had been committed—I have seen this letter before—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I see</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030012"></xptr>
               <p>the word "pay" in it—I think that word was not originally in the letter—in my judgment, the words "pay you soon" are not in the handwriting of Mr. Rogers—I can see an erasure by holding it up—during my ac<lb></lb>quaintance with the prisoner I never heard any suggestion that Mr. Rogers was in his debt; the other way—he asked me to bring the action for the purpose of paying Mr. Rogers—I was not his attorney at that time.</p>

I have had opportunities of seeing Mr. Rogers write, but not re<lb></lb>cently—I should think six or seven years ago—his account has been closed with us between seven and eight years—I think I have seen him write once since—I have not acted on his signature for seven years—he kept an account at Barclay's—I have paid a great many checks of his—more than hundreds—the account ran over many years—my belief is that the signature to this I O U for 1739<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not Mr. Rogers's—it is not to free as the checks I used to pay—there is a great similarity in this signature to this for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the impression on my mind is that Mr. Rogers's is a larger signature—I do not think I should have paid a check with such a signature—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the indorsement on the</hi> 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bill</hi>)—there is still the same similarity here, but there is not that freedom—if a check was presented with such a signature I should probably refer it—it is certainly similar—the indorsement on this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, I think, is more like, only it is not thick enough—it certainly is like his writing, but it does not seem thick enough.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Independent of anything you have heard about this case, and addressing your mind to the character of the handwriting alone, should you have pronounced it to be his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I think it is probable I might have passed that signature—it might have been so with the others—I think I should have had my doubts about it—there is a great</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030015"></xptr>
               <p>similarity in the writing of the indorsement on this other 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, but I really do not think it is his, though very like it—if I had heard nothing about this case, I think it is very probable I should have passed that signature.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer at Lower Shadwell, I have known Mr. Rogers about twelve years—I am acquainted with his handwriting—I believe the signature "Thomas Rogers," to this I O U for 1739<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not Mr. Rogers's writing, nor this to the one for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen it before—I do not believe the endorsements on these three bills to be his writing—it is not like it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, and live in Gloucester-street. I have known Mr. Rogers twelve years, and have been well acquainted with bis handwriting and his signature—I believe the signature to this 10 U for 1739<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not his hand writing—it is nothing at all like his handwriting whatever—I am positive the signature to this I O U for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not his handwriting—the endorsement on this bill for 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believe not to be bold enough for his handwriting, it is nothing like it whatever; nor these to the two for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is nothing at all like his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant and arbitrator. I know the prisoner, and have seen his writing on many occasions—I know, Mr. Rogers's writing in a general way—the signature to this I O U for 1739<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not the signature of Mr. Rogers; nor this to the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I O U—it is a different handwriting—there is a great variation in the general character—it is an imitation, but a bad one—it is written better than Mr. Rogers generally writes—the flourish is also different—the endorsement on this bill of exchange appears to be the same handwriting as the other—I should say it was not Mr. Rogers's writing, from what I have seen of it—there is a great formality and stiffness about it which is not the character of Mr. Rogers's writing—I should say the endorsement on this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill is not Mr. Rogers's writing; it is larger than his general character, and here is the same stiffness about it which I have described in reference to the other—the signature on this other 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill is not Mr. Rogers's hand<lb></lb>writing.</p>

            . I am a tea-dealer, and live in Philpot-lane. On the 14th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came, and asked for an ounce of tea, at 4s. 8d.; my wife served him - I was present; he offered a shilling - I immediately perceived it was bad I desired him to walk into the room, to stand in the middle, and to strip - he took off his hat, coat, and waistcoat; 4d. we found in his waistcoat pocket, and a good sixpence, also a child's book, in the leaves of which I found a counterfeit shilling, similar to the one he tendered; perceiving me lame he ran out, leaving his coat and waistcoat behind - I had asked how he came by the first shilling: he said he took it from Mr. Allen, of Rood-lane - I said it was false, for there was no such person in the lane; he said he did not know the shilling was in the book - he wanted me to let him go to Mr. Allen, who he said was his master; I marked the two shillings, and gave them to the officer.</p>

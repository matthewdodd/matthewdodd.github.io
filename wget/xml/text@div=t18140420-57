               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you know his person - A. Quite well. On the 14th of April, between seven and eight, he came into my master's shop; he asked for two ounces of Spanish juice; he paid me for it; he then asked me for a quarter of a pound of soap. When I was cutting the soap he took the tea and ran into the street. The tea was in a bag, ready to be sent off; six pounds; forty-three shillings was the value of it; that is what it cost my master. I have the liberty of looking at the bills. The tea was sold for forty-five shillings. After the prisoner took the tea, he ran sharp out of the shop; I followed him, crying, stop thief. He throwed the tea down. I kept running after him. He crossed the street; I took him before he reached over the street; by running, I trod on his heel; we both fell down together. I secured him, and took him back to the shop, and gave him into custody. A gentleman took the tea into the shop. When I got up I saw him with the tea; and when the gentleman brought the tea into the shop I could tell it was the same tea, by the fold of the tea. There was a bill of the tea in it. I put the tea up myself. I gave the parcel of tea to Thomas Hudson, the constable.</p>

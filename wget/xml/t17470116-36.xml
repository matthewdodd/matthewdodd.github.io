This Man was to go down in a pressed Man's Room for so much Money; so I ordered my Wife or Servants to make a Bed in a proper Place for him, and I believe,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160033"></xptr> if I had not been at Home, he would have stripped my House from the Top to the Bottom.</p>

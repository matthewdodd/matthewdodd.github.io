                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to the Registrar of the Southwark County Court—I produce a copy of the entries in the plaint book of the Court referring to the case of Joseph Murray <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Thomas Richard Robert Marshall Martin—the plaint was heard before Mr. Whitmore, on 10th December—I have seen him acting as County Court Judge for many years—this is under the seal of the Court—(<hi rend="italic">the plaint was</hi> "Work done by plaintiffs wife 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")—I was present—the prisoner came to support the claim, and no one else—she was sworn in my presence by George Barnes, one of the ushers of the Court—she claimed 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for taking care of a house at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for three weeks—in answer to her claim the Rev. Mr. Martin was examined, after which the Judge said to the prisoner, "Did you receive a letter?"—she said that she had never received it—I took notes by Mr. Whitmore's directions—he asked the prisoner whether she intended to persist in swearing that she had never received the letter; she</p>

               <p>still persisted that she had never received it—Mrs. Martin was mentioned as the writer of the letter, and the contents of it had been discussed in the prisoner's hearing—the time was referred to; I think it was some time in August—having heard the evidence given by Mr. Martin, the Judge turned to the prisoner and said, "Once more I ask you have you received a letter? I caution you, that if these witnesses are produced before me, and they depose to these facts, I shall feel it my duty to commit you for wilful perjury; therefore, I again caution you, and in the event of your being indicted and convicted, your punishment will be severe; now do you persist in swearing that you never received a letter?"—she said, "I do persist"—his Honour ordered her to sit down, and directed Mr. Martin to fetch Miss Martin and Miss Adams—he left, and returned with them, and Miss Adams was placed in the box and examined as a witness—the prisoner was then in the plaintiff's box—Miss Martin was also examined but previous to going into the examination of those witnesses, the Judge said to the prisoner, "Before I proceed to examine these witnesses, do you persist in saying that you never received a letter?"—she said, "I never received a letter"—a particular letter was spoken to by the witnesses, and the Judge said to the prisoner, "Do you still persist?"—she said, "Yes, I never received a letter"—and while Miss Adams was giving her evidence, the prisoner burst out, "I never received the letter"—after they had been examined, she again declared that she had never received the letter, and his Honour then directed a prosecution.</p>

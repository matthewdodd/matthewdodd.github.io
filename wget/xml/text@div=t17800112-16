               <p>I am servant to Mr. Smith in Lombard-street. On the 11th of December my mistress sent to me to pack up her things; I packed up the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) to go from the town house to the country house. She was in the country at this time. I packed them up in a packing cloth, and put them in the errand cart to go to my mistress's at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>Whose cart did you put them into? - One Richardson's; he comes from Tottenham. The cart was in Nicolas-lane. I put them into the cart myself.</p>
               <p>Whose care did you deliver them to? - Into the care of

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I took these things (producing them) out of the prisoner's left hand, in Houndsditch. I saw the errand cart coming towards Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose cart it was? - I do not; I saw the prisoner behind the cart undoing the tilt. There were four or five of them, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120031"></xptr>Are you sure the prisoner was one? - Yes; after he had undone the tilt, he went out of the highway into the pathway. After the cart had gone about twenty yards he went to the cart again; he put his hand upon the tail of the cart, and with his left hand pulled out this bundle; he turned his back to the cart, and was coming from it; I said to my brother get on the left hand side of the pathway, for that man has robbed the cart; the prisoner ran from behind the cart with that bundle before him.</p>
               <p>Did you or your brother stop him? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Is that the bundle you saw him take out of the cart? - This is the bundle, I delivered it to Ponsonby the constable. When I took hold of him, he asked me what I wanted with him? I said he had robbed the cart; he attempted to drop it, and it fell between him and me. I took hold of him by the collar, he began to be outrageous; having him in one hand and the bundle in the other, he was almost too much for me, till my brother came up and I got assistance. I delivered the bundle to Mr. Perke.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Between six and seven o'clock on the 11th of December, on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>It must be very dark at that time? - It was dark.</p>
               <p>How far was you from the cart when the bundle was taken out? - About ten yards off; it was almost opposite Mr. Perke's shop.</p>
               <p>Could you see distinctly what was doing at the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell the carter of it? - The prisoner ran from the cart, and the cart kept going on. He desired me to let him go but I would not.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with taking the bundle? - Yes; he said he found it in the street. It was a sloppy night, but the parcel was not dirty.</p>
               <p>LAZARUS PERKE sworn.</p>
               <p>At the time of the bustle did that young man deliver that bundle to you? - Yes, he brought it into my shop. Wilcox crying out, I went out to their assistance, and we brought in the bundle and the prisoner. I opened the bundle and looked at it and sent Wilcox after the cart; it was not to be found. I looked over the things and said they would bear advertising. I sent for a constable and delivered it to him; it was only left in my custody while he took the prisoner to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You cannot say that this is the bundle which was left in your shop? - It is the same bundle; I examined it before the constable took the prisoner to the Compter and after he came back.</p>

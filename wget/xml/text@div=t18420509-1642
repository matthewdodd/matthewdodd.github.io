On the evening of the 8th of April I met the prosecutrix, Jane Hemmings, opposite Harcourt-street—her arm was cut, and was all in a gore of blood—the blood was running from it—it seemed cut across about two inches and a half or three inches long, and was laid open—her mouth was covered with blood—I took her to the dispensary, and had the wound dressed—I afterwards went to No. 15, Providence-place, and found the prisoner there—she said, "That is the man who cut me"—I said to him, "You are my prisoner"—there was a white-handled knife lying on the table—he said, "I don't care a d—n, it is not the first time I have been locked up"—the woman said in his presence, "That is not the knife he cut me with," and went to the cupboard and brought a knife from under several others, and said, "This is the knife he cut me with"—the prisoner said, "It is not, that is the knife I cut her with," meaning the one on the table—there was no blood on either knife—on the way to the station he said, "She pawned a shirt for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she had no business to do it"—I did not consider the prisoner to be in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-apothecary to the Western Dispensary, New-road—the woman was brought in—I found a wound on her right arm, such as a knife would produce—it was about three inches long, and her lip had a small wound—the arm was cut inside as if she had been holding it up to protect her face, and received it.</p>

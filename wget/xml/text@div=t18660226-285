                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Royal Artillery, stationed at Aldershot—about half-past 9 on the night of 13th February, I was going down to the boat at Billingsgate—Simpson came behind me, took me by the shoulders, and asked me if I was going by the boat—I said, I was going that way—he said, "I think you are a countryman of mine"—I said, "perhaps I am"—he asked me if I belonged to Edinburgh—I said, "No"—he said you belong to Dalkeith—I told him I had been there—he asked</p>

               <p>me if I had been to Glasgow before by this route—I said I had not—he gave me information as to which of the boats would be the best—after that he asked several questions, and through his kindness I asked him into a public-house, and called for some spirits for him—while we were there, he said, "Stop a little, there is a friend of mine passing that I want to see"—he went out, and brought in Kelly, and introduced him as a friend who had been an old soldier, who knew the service well—after that we proceeded to a coffee-house, where I left my baggage—it was early in the evening and we went to a place called the Mahogany Bar—when there, I called for a pint of stout, and was about to get change for a sovereign, when Simpson said, "Do not expose your money, there are plenty of people here who will pick you up"—I paid for the stout, and then went into the hall—we stayed there a short time—I made an excuse that I wanted to go outside for a necessary purpose—the prisoners followed, and I went to the bar and called for two glasses of rum for them—I laid a sovereign upon the counter, Simpson took it up, and said, "Have you got no change? do not change that"—I said, "You know I have got no change I want change"—he said to Kelly, "you pay for that, you have got small change"—Kelly put his hands in his pockets, and returned me this Hanoverian medal, saying that he had no change—I de<lb></lb>tected it at once, and said, "That is not the sovereign I laid upon the counter, I want my own sovereign"—he said, "Whisht, Whisht, it is all right"—I caught hold of him by the coat, two Coldstream Guards came to my assistance, and then Kelly gave me back my sovereign—when I put the sovereign down, Simpson took it up, and handed it to Kelly—I am not quite certain whether Kelly put it in his pocket—he felt in his pocket, and returned me the medal—I remonstrated with him, and told him it was not my sovereign—they were taken to the station, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on Simpson.</p>

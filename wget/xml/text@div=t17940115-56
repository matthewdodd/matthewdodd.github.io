               <p>I know the prisoner, she came to lodge with me on the 16th of December; I don't know the day of the week; she stayed three nights. On the 19th I went up and found the door on a jar; I believe it was Thursday, I missed the things off the bed, it was early in the morning; one pair of sheets were missing, a wollen rug, and a boster, and a tin boiler; I found the boiler when I took her up, she said the rest of the things were sold to a jew; I took her up in the course of a week; I found her at an acquaintance of her's in Newtoner's lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you told her it would be better for her to confess, or something of that kind? - I asked her for the duplicates, she said they were sold to a jew, I told her if she would tell me where the property was I would not prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I cannot hear nothing about it; as to this tin boiler where did you find that? - Where I took her up at the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find the tin boiler in her hands, or in the possession of any other?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150146"></xptr> - No, it was in the room, it stood on the floor, we took it from that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pats about that tin boiler in conversation? - Not to my knowledge, this apartment was an acquaintance's, not her's; I know it by a mark on it; I punched a hole in the handle when I bought it.</p>

               <p>I live in the house of Mr. Wingfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what property was delivered to the prisoner when she took the lodgings? was there a tin boiler delivered to her? - Yes, and a pair of sheets and woollen rug and a bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the boiler misssing when she went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it on that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to her house at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Wingfild. Did you know any of her accquaintance in that house? - No, I did not, I don't know how it came there, I went to a magistrate, but he would not give me an order.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sold things in the street, and I happened to be out that night with half a bushel of sprats, and I was out about two hours and a half, and when I came home I found the door wide open, and nothing on the beadstead but the bed; the guilt and blanket I never laid with on the bed while I was there, nothing but the bare sheets, and the padlock laid in the midst of the room; when I went down stairs, and fell down stairs, and there was another young woman with me, and she got me away to sleep with her, I came the next day to look after the things, and I found he was about looking after me, and he took me up to the justice's, and searched me and found nothing, I lost every rag of my own in the room, but what I had on.</p>
               <p>Court to Wingfield. Did she use to look the door with the Padlock when she went out? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether that padlock was ever broke? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the padlock when the door room was left a jar? - It was left a jar, and she had the key in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The staple was drawn when he let me the room; there were two old women in it; and I catched my landlord on the stairs, with a bunch of keys in his hand once or twice, it was the very next day that I came to my landlord, I never broke my fast before I went to him after this happened.</p>

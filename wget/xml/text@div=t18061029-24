               <p>Q. Had she any thing else. - A. She had a parcel of women's apparel in the apron; I asked her what she wanted to sell the box for, seeing that she had got apparel in her apron; she said that she wanted to buy a pair of shoes, I told her I would not buy the box till she fetched her mother; she went away, I then perceived the box had been broken open; I went after her and brought her back, and she put the things out of her apron into the box; I detained her and the box. I went down to Worship street, and there I asked the magistrate leave to publish some hand bills.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your publishing these hand bills somebody came forward. - A. Yes, I afterwards saw

                  </hi>. I am single and live with my mother, Frances Marshall, at 176, Central Street, St Luke's—on the morning of 23rd October, about 4 o'clock, I was awoke by hearing a noise in the area, the slight shaking of the window; it was dark, there is a gas lamp a little way off, I immediately got up and opened the window, which looks into the area, and saw a man getting out over the railings, I saw his face, the prisoner is the man—I called out "Police!"—he walked away as quick as he could, a policeman came up and I sent him after him—about half an hour afterwards I went to the station and there saw the prisoner, I picked him out</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The window is the kitchen window in the area—there was no catch to it—it was not a windy boisterous night; it was the upper sash that was moved, I don't think it could have fallen down by its own weight; the lower sash could not have been moved so easily, the glass is so close to the wood.</p>

I am a widow and live at 176, Central Street, St Luke's—on the night of 22nd October I went to bed about 12.30—I closed the kitchen window the last thing, I closed it tight and put out the gas—I occupy the house and a married son occupies the upper part—I sleep in the back room, my daughter roused me about 4 o'clock, I went down, opened the street door, and called "Police!"—I afterwards found the upper sash lowered more than the depth of my hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the girl who took the stocking with the pocket book, and money out of the knapsack - A. Yes, I am sure of it; I gave the description of her to the officer, who took her at the girl's room; the other girl had two letters on her arm; this girl gave her name of Suckey and the other Ann.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know what manner of a house this was - A. No. The pocket book was found afterwards with my discharge in it, and nothing else in it; the money was all gone; when I lost it a five pound bank note, four one pound bank notes, and the change of half a guinea was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see this girl - A. I did not see her till I went to Woolwich to get a copy of my discharge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I have no doubt that you lost your money. I am very sorry for it; you employed a boy to get a lodging for you, it turned out not to be what you thought it was; it was late at night when you cast anchor in this place - A. About half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems you liked to have something to drink among you - A. I never had a drop.</p>


               <p>Q. That was very unsocial indeed - A. I cannot drink liquor, it does not agree with me.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you mean by that, a little liquor soon makes you drunk - A. I cannot drink liquor since I have been hurt; I was quite sober that night, I was advised not to get drunk for fear I should lose my money; they advised me for my good.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding that you came to town, you attempted to drink a glass more than you ought - A. No, I did not take a drop.</p>
               <p>Q. At half after ten we all know it is is very dark - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This boy took you to a lodging were there were two women - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there turned out to be two men there also - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave a description of the person having T. H. on her arm - A. No, I did not; I told them the girl that took my pocket book was a smallish girl; I told them the girl marked T. H. on her arm was united with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You were tired after your journey, when you went to bed you soon fell asleep, did not you - A. No, they did not give me time to go to sleep; it was done in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was done in a moment, you had not much opportunity of knowing the person again - A. Yes I had, by her being in the room before; and I wanted the key of the door, they told me there was no key to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you will not take upon you to say that poor girl was one that you were in company with that night - A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260022"></xptr>Q. It is a very hard thing for you to swear to that poor girl whom you never saw before - A. Sir, you must think it is a very hard thing for me to lose every farthing I had in the world.</p>
               <p>COURT. You described the other girl that had the letters on her arm to have remained in the room - A. Yes, but she was not the girl that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remain there all night - A. No, a person for safety took me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to sleep before you went to the watchhouse - A. I went to bed, but I never closed my eyes.</p>

Tokins had committed several Robberies, and his Mother to prevent his being hang'd had provided a Master to send him to Sea. I understood one Night that the Prisoner was with him in the Room where he lay, and fearing that he would wheedle Pokins to discover who this Captain was, and so prevent his being sent away. I pull'd off my Shoes, and went softly up Stairs, in Expectation of hearing some Discourse about it, but I was surpriz'd to hear something of a very different Nature. Then the Witness gave an Account of several Expressions, not to be repeated, which strongly implied, that they were committing Sodomy together. A Constable was call'd, and when we came in the Prisoner trembled, and Jack pretended to be asleep.</p>

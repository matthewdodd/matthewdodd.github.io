               <p>Q. He only comes in the house for the purpose of business. - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Q Did you at any time lose a truss containing three hundred dozen of printed cotton handkerchiefs. - A. Yes, on Friday the 5th of February, between six and seven in the evening, from the house in Walbrook; they were enclosed in a canvas wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know from what circumstance they were lost. - A. Yes; this truss was delivered at my house, after the warehouse was closed; our warehouse is at this time of the year closed at dusk; this truss was deivered about six o'clock; it was delivered into my dwelling house, but not in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in your dwelling house before it was taken away. - A. I did not. About twenty minutes or half after six o'clock, my servant was called to the house door in consequence of a knock; the prisoner at the bar said, I hear that your master wants a porter; in consequence of this my servant came up into the dining room to me and said a man wanted me; he said he heard I wanted a porter; I said it is a mistake, I do not want any porter. When she had got half way down stairs she screamed out, observing the man absent and the truss missing; that moment I run out of the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch sight of the prisoner. - A. No; the moment I got out of the street door, I called out stop thief; I ran to the corner of Cannon-street, but did not see any thing particular; finding things quiet, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170013"></xptr>returned and found a terrible scuffle at that end of Walbrook that comes into Bucklersbury, and as I came gently up I found a man a running very fast indeed, coming towards me, with several others following of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that man any bundle with him. - A. No. In Walbrook, opposite the end of a court, I secured the prisoner at the bar; he said what do you want with me; I replied you have stolen a truss of mine; and I requested some one or two who were near me to assist me to take him up to my own door; they assisted me in taking him up.</p>
               <p>Q. By that means you secured him in your house. - A. Yes. When I got within three yards of my own door, I met my servant whom he asked the question of; she said I will swear that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in his hearing. - A. Yes. The prisoner made no reply; when I got him into the passage of my house, he acknowledged that he was the person that came to enquire about a porter's place. The moment he was in the passage I desired they would be kind enough to secure the prisoner; I went and found a man coming with the truss at the corner of Buckler'sbury, he said he found the truss on a post; I said where are you going with that truss; he replied, sir, I am going to bring it to you. He delivered it to me. I requested they would keep the prisoner in custody till I got a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the truss before. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any truss delivered. - A. On the 5th of February, a little after seven, there came a rap at the door, and the truss was delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man here that delivered the truss. - A. No; the truss was delivered to me; it was left in the passage, and the man went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you see any other person. A. About a quarter of an hour afterwards there came another knock at the door; the prisoner came in and asked for Mr. Hartwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he is the man. - A. I am quite sure, my lord, he is the man; he asked for Mr. Hartwell by name, he said he was informed he wanted a porter; I told him I did not know, but if he would come in I would enquire of my master, he was in the sitting room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master's sitting room. - A. Above stairs. I went up to my master, and delivered the message that the man sent me with.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you left the prisoner with the street door in his hand, whereabouts was this truss. - A. It was very near the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a large truss. - A. Yes, I delivered the prisoner's message to my master, and returned down stairs almost immediately, I was not a minute with my master; my master said, he did not want one, he must be misinformed; as I went down I saw the prisoner was gone and the truss, I saw that before I got down stairs by the light of the candle, and the door was left open; I called out for my master before I got to the bottom; I ran into the street calling out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get sight of the prisoner. - A. I did not at that moment, a man in the street told me he had gone down the street; another man told me he had told me wrong, he had gone up the street; I returned again towards the Mansion house; I met the prisoner by the church going down the street; he had got rid of the truss and was running down the street; I called out that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of him. - A. No, I catched at him but I could not hold him, I followed him; I did not lose sight of him till my master stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the truss of goods again. - A. I did, they came into the house again, a strange man brought it in from the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man give you any account how he came by it. - A. No; I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be the same truss as was there when you went up stairs. - A. I did: my master's name was on it in large letters.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that is all you know of it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he is the man. - A. I am confident that he is the man that came and asked for the porter's place.</p>

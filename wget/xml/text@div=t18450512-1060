                  </hi>. I live in Blue Anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane. The deceased Jane Thrussell lodged with me—on Friday morning, the 11th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in bed with her—we were lying alongside each other—she lay inside me—the prisoner came into the room, drunk, with a man named Scott—the prisoner said to me, "Are you there, old woman?"—I said, "I am"—he asked would I have some money—I said I would rather see it than hear it—there was a counterpane at the foot of the bed, to serve as a curtain—I got up in the bed to look for my clothes, to put on—he took up a chair, and threw it out of his hand towards the bed—the counterpane fell, and a piece of the chair came inside the bed—whether it hit the deceased I cannot say, as I was confused—the deceased turned towards the wall, and began to cry—I sent for a policeman—the deceased got up, and was putting her clothes on, when the policeman came—the prisoner was then sitting at the table to have his breakfast—he lodged in the house—I told the deceased if he bad hurt her to give him in charge—she said, "No, I will not"—she put on her things, and sat by the fire—she had been sick from the time she came to the house, which was five weeks before—she was always ill and ailing—she vomited five or six minutes after the man threw the chair—I had often seen her vomit before—the policeman went away—she sat by the fire for about three hours, and went into the yard—she stopped a long time there—the prisoner brought her back from the privy in six or ten minutes, leading her by the hand—she then laid on the bed—I saw she was very ill, and went for the parish doctor—his man came and saw her—when the parish doctor came he said she was dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could he see who was in bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not—the counterpane hid her—Mrs. Bailey had cut the deceased's hair off a month before, as she was very dirty—I heard of her fainting once.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner came into the room on this morning to breakfast—Sheen and the deceased were both in bed—Sheen asked him for the money—he said he had none to give her—she said he could find money to pay her as well as to drink—they began to jaw one another—she aggravated the man—he was very much in liquor—he took off his coat to tear it—the young man with him took the coat away—they then turned round to go out—Sheen said something to aggravate him—he took up the chair and flung it against the bedstead—the counterpane came down—the deceased sat up, put her hand to her head, and said, "Oh, Simon, you have hurt me"—Mrs. Sheen sent fora policeman, who came—she told the deceased to give him in charge—she shook her head, but did not speak—she got up and dressed,</p>

               <p>and then the policeman went out—the deceased began to retch, and sat by the fire—I went out about eleven o'clock, returned at half-past three, and she was then dead—I did not see Sheen take up a poker.</p>

                  </hi>. I went into this room about a quarter to nine o'clock—Mrs. Sheen was sitting up in bed—the prisoner came in—she asked him for rent—he said, "D----it, am I going to give you rent every hour I come to the place?"—they grossly abused each other, and in about a quarter of an hour a chair stood by the prisoner—he laid hold of it, and as he was lifting the chair it fell from him—he did not throw it from him—I think it was pure accident—he took it up by the back—I cannot tell what he lifted it up for—the leg of it came directly on the side of deceased's head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. My assistant went to see the deceased, but she was dead then—I examined the body, by the Coroner's sanction—the death was caused by extravasated blood, to the amount of four ounces, on the dura mater, on the left side of the head—there was no external mark, but I found extravasated blood on the temporal muscle, between the skin and bone—I attribute the extravasated blood to a blow—I think a chair might occasion the injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in liquor; I had been to a meeting the night before; I come home about nine o'clock; Mrs. Sheen said, "Will you give me any money?" I said, "I gave you some yesterday, and will give you none;" she blackguarded me, and I her; the chair stood in my way; I took it up; it fell out of my hand; I did not know deceased was in bed; they only came here for their own benefit, and have been wrangling among themselves who should come against me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of Dowgate Ward. On the 17th of February, a little before nine at night, the prisoner at the bar passed me in Thames-street, near by Mr. Calvert's brewhouse, between Mr. Rutt's warehouse, and London Bridge, with a bag; I asked him what he had got there? he rather hesitated, and said, it was not nine o'clock; I asked him what he had got there? he said he had some bark, or drugs, he did not give me a clear answer; I asked him where he had brought it from? he said he had brought it from Rutland-place; I asked him where Rutland-place was, and asked him where he was going to take it to? he said he was going to take it into the Borough; I asked him what weight it was? he said he did not know; I asked him if he had got a bill of parcels? he said he believed it was in the bag, along with the other goods; I desired him to put it down, he did; I untied the bag, and I did not find any bill of parcels at all; there was a bundle that had some bark in it, that I thought was very slovenly tied, that gave me more suspicion, it was tied up nearly the same as it is now; says I, I shall be glad if you will go with me back to where you have brought it from.</p>
               <p>Q. What else was there besides bark in that bag? - Nothing but elecampane roots and the bark; I told him I was afraid he did not come honesty by it; he said he had; he said he would rather I would go with him where he brought it from; I told him as it was very little way where he said he brought it from, he had better go back, I took him back, he went very quietly along with me; he walked along till we came to the Fortune of War, just by Paul's Wharf; says I, this is not the place where you said you brought it from.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the road there? - Yes, it is all the straight road; he said there was a man in there that saw a man give him a shilling in the morning, to carry it into the Borough; I told him that I did not choose to go with him into a public house; I brought him back till I came to our own ward, when I took him to the Compter; after I had been to the Fortune of War, I brought him back to London Bridge again, in order to carry him to the Compter. I asked him why he told me false? he told me that a man brought it in a boat to Paul's-stairs, in the morning, and left it at the public house all day, and he was there in the morning, and he gave him a shilling to carry it at night into the Borough; to the best of my knowledge, he said the man's name was Fox; I asked him what Fox was? he said he believed he was a smuggler, or a lumper, or something of that kind. I put him in the Compter, and he was up the next day before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to proceed on to the regular place? - He said that the Fortune of War was the place where he had it from.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not he tell you that he was going into the Borough, to carry it to a person of the name of Fox? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now he offered at the Fortune of War, as you was going by, to go in and shew you a person who had given him a shilling to carry it; why did not you go into the public house? - I did not choose to go into the public house amongst strangers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that he lived in Kutland-place? - He told me he lived somewhere near there; I asked him what? and he said he was a <rs id="t17940430-69-deflabel369" type="occupation">porter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17940430-69-defend718 t17940430-69-deflabel369"></join>, and carried greens from market.</p>
               <p>Q. You went along, my friend stated it that he told you there was a hill of parcels, but he only said he believed there was a bill of parcels; on searching it was found he was mistaken, there was none? - It was exactly so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300117"></xptr>Q. He offered to take it to this very place where the man was to be found of whom he received this parcel? - Yes, he wanted me to go there, but I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. So that in short you would give the man no opportunity to convince you whether he was taking it as he had told you or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Your being alone, you did not choose to venture yourself into a public house? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You have kept the things ever since? - I have.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time do you know whether there were any elecampane roots in the warehouse? - There was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any elecampane root at that time? - At the time that

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray when was the last weight of that cask taken? - The first or second of January, when we took stock, the prisoner assisted in weighing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what was the weight at any intermediate time, between the 1st of January and the 18th of January, you cannot say? - I cannot, the cask was opened about the beginning of February, to take a sample out of it, I did not see it opened, but I went up and took a sample out myself. A few days after that there was two hundred weight took out, and put into a drying stove; there was none of it sold; and on the 18th of February we weighed the cask, and what was taken out to put in the drying stove, and the deficiency was a hundred and a quarter, and if we allow for the drying of the two hundred, it makes about a hundred and four or five pounds short.</p>
               <p>Q. What does that weigh now produced? - I was told half a hundred and sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think there is there? - About half a hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not the whole quantity lost, nor is it to be identified by any of your master's marks, and it is a very common root? - This elecampane is much smaller than ever I saw any before.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you learn that the prisoner was taken up? - Not till the next morning, the evening before that I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this parcel of goods, or how he came by them? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing passed about those goods, in the morning, or that evening? - In the morning I heard say he was taken up, and I went to see him in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this transaction? - He was called out to carry a load about half after eight at night, the night before I visited him in the morning; a man called out, and said, he wanted a porter; the prisoner went out of doors to the man, and came in again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man ask for a porter for? - For to carry a load, I did not go out to see.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner answered the call? - He did; when he came in again, he asked me if I would go to his club with him? I told him I would; he went out again to the man that asked for a porter, and they both went together, then I went on to the club afterwards, and I did not see him any more till the morning; I never see the parcel at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When the prisoner came in again, he asked if you would go home to the club, and you told him yes; why did not you go with him? - Because he told me to go on, and he would come after me, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray how came it you did not tell this story before the Lord Mayor, when the prisoner was there? - I never was called.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you the wife? - Yes. On the 9th of October when I shut the street door, the clock had just struck six; I went to market as usual (I keep a green stall) and when I came home, about twenty minutes after seven, my place had been broke open; I found my door open, and going into my room I found my drawers all open; when I went out I double locked the door, and locked my room; there was only a child of mine in the room a bed, four years old the 4th of last month. When I went in I see my back door open, and I immediately went up to the place where I had laid a parcel of money to pay my rent and taxes, it was six guineas and a half tied up in an old shawl, and I missed it all, and I had a brother come out of the country, who boarded with me, he left a box with me; and all the clothes were pulled out of his box, and his money was all taken away. The six guineas and a half of mine was in a bureau, tied up in an old shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bureau broke open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose of your brother's out of the room? - There were nine guineas and three half guineas, gold, two crown pieces, a half crown, and a shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Directors of the City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company. The prisoner had been our secretary about seven years; his salary was 1001. a year, a house, and two per cent on the gross receipts—he was the general manager—it was his duty to keep the cash book, the ledger, and the general accounts—it was his duty to receive money on account of the Directors—it was his duty half yearly to make out a balance sheet of the affairs of the Company—at a meeting held on 31st July, this balance sheet, made up to 30th June by the prisoner, was produced and read by the prisoner—it appears there is due to the Company 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the prisoner was directed to make out the items making up that amount—this is the paper he delivered to show the amount; amongst these, items here is 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from Stepney Union, and 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from St. Margaret, Westminster—at that meeting a resolution was come to by the Board, it was drawn up by the prisoner, that from thence<lb></lb>forth</p>

               <p>the various parochial accounts should be made out and forwarded within one week from the termination of each quarter—that was in conse<lb></lb>quence of there being so large a sum due to the Company—we had a meet<lb></lb>ing of the Directors on 30th Aug.—it was one of the usual fortnightly meetings of the Directors—on that occasion this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent in from the prisoner—it is his writing—it was read, and after it was read the prisoner was called in, and he was asked to explain what this letter meant, and he stated that he had received money, on account of the Company and not accounted for it; that he had been several times in a state of in<lb></lb>toxication, and that had been the occasion of it—he said that he had received between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had not accounted for—he was asked for the keys and the cash box, and that he delivered up—he was ulti<lb></lb>mately discharged—the Directors had no power to discharge him—that was done at a subsequent meeting—these receipts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are signed by the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">These were for</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;

during that fortnight other business had been done, he had received 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the particulars constituting that sum are entered—they do not include this sum from St. Margaret, Westminster—it appeared that the prisoner had paid to the bankers 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;

               <p>except that he was careless—I cannot say whether the sums on 30th April were paid by cheques—the receipts are the prisoner's writing—I have, the banker's book here—I see that on that day 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid in—when he received money it was his duty to account as soon as the Board day occurred, and there was a Board day every fortnight; on the second Thurs<lb></lb>day in the month, and on the last Thursday—if he received moneys on the Friday he would pay them into the bank, and account for them the next Board day—he should from time to time enter in the cash book what he received before the Board day—I am afraid his habit was not to enter till he went to pass the account—what he received generally was contained in books of charges of fees—he does not go to collect money except in parishes where he might call—he should enter the money at once in the cash book—he lived at the office—at the meetings of the Directors he had to account for the money he received during the fortnight—I apprehend he himself, went to the banker's with the money; we are not present to witness it—if he paid in ten cheques amounting to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it would be entered short, no doubt—this minute book is his writing—it is copied from a sheet of foolscap paper—these entries are taken from the book of charges and fees—when he receives money he fills up a page of the book—one duplicate is given to the customer, and one is left with the Company—he is present when the Directors are examining it—he comes to the meeting with these details on a rough sheet, which he has prepared from the various books in the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he has ever debited himself with money that bag not been paid to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of it—there were some petty accounts which he said he had paid which he ought to have received a warrant from the Directors to pay—they were a number of small items, and there was a difference of opinion whether they were ours or not—it did not appear on the face of it—he stated that a sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was debited to him which had not been paid, and that there was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him; the date of it was 10th May; but inquiries were made, and it had not been paid to him—the disbursements that he said he had made were about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was subsequent to his sending this letter—since the delivery of this letter the books have been in my possession—he wrote this letter on 13th Aug.—we had not suspected him of any irregularities before that—he had appeared careless and inattentive—there was no person to receive money but the prisoner—he was the only clerk in the office—I am not aware that it hat frequently happened that be has received money, and not accounted and paid it in till the second Board meeting after he received it—I will swear that I do not know it—he stated that lately he has been given to take a little more drink than he should do—we had security with him.</p>

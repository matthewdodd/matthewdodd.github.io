I lost two books called the "Repository" on the 30th of June, off a board outside my win<lb></lb>dow, where they were exposed for sale—I was called out by a person and missed them—I found the prisoner in a public-house just across the street immediately afterwards with these two books—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live next door to the prosecutor, in Clare Market. On the afternoon of the 30th of June, I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner come up to the prosecutor's shop, take up a book, and look at it—he then replaced it and knocked two books down—he walked away about five yards—he then returned and was met by another man, and then he took up the books—they stood talking together for a few minutes, and walked across into the public-house—he did not appear to me to be intoxicated.</p>

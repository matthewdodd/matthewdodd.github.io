               <p>Q. It had not the effect of causing you to miscarry, I think? A. Yes; I am certain I did, though I did not think so at the time; but having since been delivered of a child, I am sure I did miscarry - consequences happened to me similar to when I was afterwards delivered - it brought on a discharge more than usual - I was very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not answer without recollecting yourself - is it true, as you told my friend, that on the day in question you had taken nothing except what the prisoner gave you? A. No, except my breakfast - I had not taken any pills, or any thing of the kind - I recollect this was on the 26th of June, because it was two days after quarter-day - I know it was so - I took particular notice what day it was - it made me so very ill, I could not help taking particular notice of it - that is the reason - the gentleman who sits there is not my mother's attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been acting as attorney for you in the course of this inquiry - for you and your parents? has he not attended before the magistrate, and examined you and your witnesses on half-a-dozen different charges, first at Great Bookham and Hanworth? A. No, not at Bookham- he was at Hanworth - I believe his name is Thomas Alley Jones - he came and represented himself as the nephew of Mr. Counsellor Alley - he was not always at my mother's public-house - he was there sometimes - he has been lodging there - I am not particularly intimate with him - I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were asked about your intimacy with the prisoner - you are asked have you had any intimacy of this sort with that attorney? A. Never in my life with no one but the prisoner - never in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Consider - do not answer rashly - do you mean to swear deliberately the prisoner is the only person with whom you have had any sexual intimacy? A. Yes - I have seen a person named Rawlins - I know him by seeing him with Childs - the prisoner told me I was pregnant before I thought I was - I was not aware that I was with child till he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear at another place that you had no notion there was any thing the matter with you till the prisoner told you you were with child? A. I was not sure I was until he told me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you not sworn you had no suspicion of being with child before he told you you were; that you knew nothing about it? A. I was not sure that I was - I thought I was.</p>

             - I do not know them - I remember a person named Mackerel, I think, attending with Jones before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mother state in your presence, before you got before the magistrate, to Mr. Mackerel, that you had been intimate and had connexion with all the men and servants in your father's house? A. Never; I never heard of such a thing before - I am sure no one can say that - I cannot tell how many magistrates I have been before on the subject of different charges against the prisoner- the prisoner came to live at my father's as under ostler - I think the latter part of January, 1833 - our intimacy first occurred either the latter part of March or the beginning of April - my father's is a night house; it is open all day and all night - we let out beds, but never at 5s. a night - my mother sometimes sits up till six o'clock in the morning - it depends on whether they are busy or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take in travellers at two and three o'clock in the morning? A. We take in respectable people; but I am never up at that time, I always go to bed at ten o'clock- we never take women in unless it is a man and his wife sometimes - our beds are generally all full about ten o'clock - my father was proprietor of the house up to the last licensing day, and the name of "Wolfe" was over the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150030"></xptr>door - "Wolfe" is not on the door now, another person has taken the house - the licence was not stopped by the magistrate; my father gave the house up; I never heard any thing of the license being stopped - Mr. Keen took the house - he was not an acquaintance of Mr. Alley Jones's - Mr. Jones used to come to our house the same as other customers - I left home on the 8th of September, but did not run away - I went with the prisoner - that I swear - I went away with him - I was going to church - I met a girl named Haines, and went with her - I met her - she came to our house - I saw her outside the door - I told my father and mother I was going to church - I went as far as the corner of the Broadway, near where the church is - I told Haines there was a person who wanted to see me - I did not tell her I would come back to her after church - the prisoner told me he would meet me, and I met him by appointment - it was more than a week after he had left my father's house - I do not know how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the course of sexual connexion with him from the time you took the stuff till he left? A. Yes- when I took the powder I thought I was still in the family way, but since I have been confined I am convinced I was not - I did not go to a doctor in October, to ascertain whether I was with child or not - that I swear - I did not ask any body to go with me in October - after we had met by agreement, I went with

             to Mitcham- that was on the 8th of September - I thought I was with child at that time - I did not think then that I had miscarried.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went away with him on the 8th of September, could any body see that you were with child? A. I do not think they could have seen it - Childs told me he thought they could see it; but I thought not - he said he was afraid my father and mother would find it out, and I had better go with him, and live with him until I was confined - that he had taken a house, and after that I could get a place as bar-maid, and then write home to my parents and tell them I had been in place all the while.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you were before the magistrate at any time, on your solemn oath did you tell a word of that, or have you got it from Thomas Alley Jones? A. No; I have not got it from him - I believe I told the justice this - I believe I told them every thing - I swear I did to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge him before the magistrate with stealing your clothes? A. He told me to throw my clothes out of the window, which I did, and he caught them - I was at Leatherhead, but did not see any body there except the person who took charge of Childs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on another occasion charge him with receiving your clothes, knowing them to be stolen, before the justice? A. He did receive my clothes - I did not go before a magistrate and charge him with committing a rape on me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you charge him with having connexion with you against your will? A. It was against my will - he took me by force, and threw me down.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you, after you had been twice before the justice, go a third time, with your father, mother, and Jones, and on that occasion charge him with committing a rape on you? A. No, Sir, I did not - he was not charged with a rape.</p>
               <p>Q. With having connexion with you against your will? A. Yes, he took me and threw me down, and by force effected his purpose - that was in April - the very first time - it was not twelve months after I was forced that I went before Mr. Scott, and charged the prisoner with having connexion with me against my will - it was after I had gone away to live with him - I was only at the Bell and Anchor twice - the grand jury threw out the bill for administering drugs the first time it was preferred, but that was through a witness we had.</p>
               <p>Q. After you went away on the 8th of September, how long did you remain at Mitcham? A. I was there one night - I slept at a public-house - I wanted to return home- I did not mention to the publican that I wanted to return home - I could not get to speak to any body - he would not allow me to speak to any body to tell them I wanted to go home - I slept with him at the public-house - I was to sleep there that night, and next day I was to go to the house - when I left that public-house, I think the first place I went to was Merstham - I had a ring on my finger the day before I came home, but never before - I will swear I had not this ring on until the last day before I came home, and then I had it on for about an hour that day - that was the day before my father found me.</p>
               <p>Q. As the prisoner confined you, and you could not speak to any body, did you go to the parish church at Merstham, and be married to him? A. He insisted on my having the banns put up - I told him I never would be married to him - he cursed and swore, and gave me a slap on the head, and said I should go - I went with his sister-in-law(I believe she was) - the banns were put up - I never did intend to be married to him - I intended to go to the clergyman, and claim his protection - I did not see the clergyman then - I went with the sister, and put up the banns, and another woman was there - we went to the clerk about the banns - this was in September - I remember going to buy the ring - I went with his sister the day I was to have gone to the church - I knew if I had not got the ring, I could not have got to the church to tell the clergyman - after I had got the ring, I went with the prisoner to be married - I never did intend to be married to him - I told him so, but never intended it - when we got to the church, the clergyman was going out, and refused to stay to marry us - I saw the clergyman on his horse - Childs called out to him - I could not get to speak to him - the marriage was postponed till the following Friday - I intended to have gone on the following Friday, but in the interim my father found me out - I lived with the prisoner after the 8th of September till, I believe, the 1st of October.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sleep with him under tents and hedges, and on the road and road-side, except when you slept in public-houses all that time? A. Yes - I believe he used to sleep at night, but I could not get away - he always went into some very dull place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear you were living all this time with him against your will and consent? A. Yes- I wanted to get away but could not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You wanted to get away from him all this time and could not, and that is the reason you did not? A. Yes - my father came for me at last - I believe he took the prisoner and his brother into custody - the prisoner was let out of custody again next morning - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150031"></xptr>went before a magistrate and said he would tell where I was, which he did, and sent his brother to tell where I was, and he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did he come to the Chaise and Horses? A. He never came into my father's house afterwards - he wanted to come into the house one night, and mother pushed him out - she did not take him before the magistrate that night - she could not, for there was nobody there but herself - he was not living at Hammersmith after that - if so, it was unknown to us - I never saw him - I was not more acquainted with Alley Jones than other people.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did Jones accompany you with your father and mother to a magistrate in Buckinghamshire? A. I was never there in my life - I do not know whether my father and mother went before Sir John Gibbon - I was never there - my mother does not tell me where she goes always - Alley Jones did not say he would settle the matter very soon - he never told me he thought about 55l. might be got for this job.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first mention to your father and mother about his giving you the drug to make you miscarry? A. A few days after I came home, in the beginning of October.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Has any action been brought against your father for false imprisonment of this man? A. Yes - I have been attending the courts at Westminster as a witness in an action for seduction - I cannot say whether my father has brought an action for seduction against this man- I was nearly seventeen years of age when my connexion with the prisoner began - I was seventeen last August - I lived at home with my mother all the time before this - I did not go with Mr. Jones fifteen miles from Hammersmith to get a warrant against the prisoner - I do not know that my mother did - I never knew them go out together - I believe Rawlins has slept at our house before now with 
               <persName id="t18340515-47-person511">Wm. Childs</persName>
            - he has not slept there without him - I never in my life went to his beside when he was in bed - Jones never came to my bedside while I was in bed - that I solemnly swear - I was delivered of a child on the 20th of March - I have reason to know from the doctor who attended me, that it was prematurely born - I did not state any thing about my miscarriage till after I was confined, because I did not know the pains, nor any thing else till after I was confined; but I thought then I had miscarried, because the pains were so much like it - I learnt nothing about this from Alley Jones.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you the only child of your parents? A. Yes - I left school before I was fourteen years of age - when the prisoner came into my father's employ I was about sixteen - I had never left my father's house to be thrown on the world in any way before this - I was quite a stranger to the part of the country the prisoner took me to- it was in September when my father discovered where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prefer any charge against the prisoner, or was what was done done by your father and friends? Q. It was my wish - I expressed that wish as soon as I came home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The charge of rape, and stealing the clothes, and receiving them, and seduction, was it your wish all these charges should be brought? A. I wished him to be punished for what he had done - I have heard the prisoner is twenty-five years old.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you admit to Miller that Jones said, "We will charge him with rape, and if that won't do, charge him with giving savin, for the girl will swear any thing what I tell her to say?" A. It is false - I do know

Did you never state to Richard Miller, on the 26th of November, after the bill was thrown out, that you should never be happy at home - that you should live a life like a dog at Clerkenwell - that you could not help it, and said,"Well, I did my best, I swore what they told me?" A. It is a falsity - I have seen that man (Miller) - I never told him that Jones told me they would charge the prisoner with a rape - if that would not do, they would charge him with giving savine to produce abortion? A. I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And that Miller asked Jones what proof he had, and Jones replied, "The girl will swear any thing I tell her, and her mother will do the same?" A. No; that is false - I was not with the prisoner when my father discovered him.</p>

            . I am the mother of the last witness. In June, last year, my husband kept the Chaise and Horses at Hammersmith - it is a day and night house, but a very respectable one - it is a house open day and night for market gardeners, wagoners, and people from all parts of the kingdom, who, we think, proper to take into the house, but no other persons - I am not ashamed of the house - I have from noblemen who keep their carriage down to persons who pay 4d. a night for their bed - I take them in if I like- the prisoner was in our service in June last - I remember on the 26th of June my daughter was taken very ill - I have a particular reason for recollecting the day - I believe on the 24th we say was six month's day (instead of quarter day), when I pay my rent - about twelve o'clock she was very poorly, and at one o'clock I wished her to have dinner- she said she could not eat any - she went to bed and laid there for three days - never got off her bed from Wednesday between one and two o'clock till the Sunday near four - she vomited - she was very sick and ill otherwise, she had a violent discharge - I took the basin in which she vomited, and rinced it, but by rincing it and rincing it again it did not come clean - there was something round the basin which stuck to the bottom of it - it appeared thick - something stuck to the bottom of the basin - it was like wet flour - she kept her bed till the Sunday about four o'clock- she left our house on the eighth of September, and on the Monday morning we took every step to find her, but could not - we heard of her at the latter end of September from a respectable gentleman who keeps a public-house at Leatherhead - she was brought back, and after her father had fetched her home she described that the prisoner had given her some medicine - not before; she told me the occasion of that illness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not accompany your husband to Leatherhead? A. No; I have every reason to believe the publican's name is Wildey who gave us an account of my daughter - I knew him when I lived there, and was quite a girl, many years ago - he told me in the letter which I had, which I have burnt, that my daughter was at Leatherhead; and, as a friend, he wrote to me if I wished for my child, to fetch her - he had had an opportunity of seeing her there - it was overheard by what the prisoner had communicated to the man who kept the public-house, saying he had got the girl, he had deluded her from her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150032"></xptr>home, and how pleased he was that he had got her away from home - this was the secret which the prisoner himself divulged to Mr. Wildey, at Leatherhead - Mr. Wildey told me that afterwards, when I saw him - he did not write that to me - Mr. Wildey is at Leatherhead now - I saw him four or five days since; indeed, I do not think it is so much - it was one day this week - I have not brought him here as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought any body besides yourself and daughter? A. There is a gentleman here who took steps to trace her - that is Mr. Jones - I first became acquainted with him about twelve months ago, or more - he did not say he was Mr. Counsellor Alley's nephew - that was nothing to me - if a gentleman calls for a glass of grog or ale, or dinner, I consider it my business to make it for him - I do not recollect that Mr. Jones introduced himself to me as the nephew of Counsellor Alley - he had a little business at Hammersmith, and he has some cottages there, and those kind of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent himself as the nephew of Counsellor Alley, and that he had come from Counsellor Alley's on this occasion? A. No; I will not swear that, one way or other - I was before the justice at Hammersmith - on my oath, I could not tell you whether he told the magistrate he came from the office of Counsellor Alley on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that person represent himself as the nephew of Counsellor Alley, until I put the question to you to-day? A. We have heard it mentioned by different people; but I do not know it - I do not recollect that I ever heard it from his own lips - I do not recollect that he represented himself as coming from that gentleman for the purpose of prosecuting this case for me - I will not swear one way or the other, because I should not like to be wrong on oath - it is a serious thing - I was almost as much acquainted with Jones at first as I am now; just the same - he has lived in my house, on and off, at different times, for more than twelve months, when he has wanted a bed - he slept there last night - he has certainly slept there some time lately, because he pays me for his lodging - he sleeps there when business calls him down - he has slept there more than twelve months; for the first night I came to the house, if he had come there, I would let him have a bed, or you either - he pays me 8s. a week for his room now, whether he sleeps there or not - sometimes he is there one night in a week, sometimes two, and sometimes not for a whole week - I never took a journey with him in my life, or any gentleman but my husband - my husband (and I think Mr. Jones) went before Sir

               <p>Q. Who is the attorney for this prosecution? A. I do not know whether it is Jones or Eden - it is one of them; either Eden of Buckingham-street, or Jones - I cannot see Eden here now - he is clerk to Mr. Withy - I know the gentleman, because I have lived with him - I should imagine Eden is the attorney - Mr. Jones went with me before the Grand Jury on the first occasion, and on the second - but then Mr. Withy was acquainting with the case- I never did any thing without acquainting him - the first bill was thrown out - I do not recollect saying that I would prefer another if it would cost 100l. - I think I can swear I did not - I do not think I did; but it is so long, I almost forget - I know a man named Rawlins - he has never slept at my house - when his parents turned him from home, being a friend of the prisoner's, I agreed to it more than once - he never slept there to my knowledge before the prisoner came there - he has not slept there before April twelve months that I recollect - I do not think that ever he did - I have fourteen beds in my house - it is a two-windowed house, two storey high; but one is a very large room, a club-room, and in that I can put twelve beds if I choose for poor people coming up the road, hay-makers and garden people, and working people - it is not now used as a club-room - there are seven beds in it for poor people - it is over the cellar in the back parlour - no women sleep there except men and their wives - I cannot answer that people do not sleep in my house, whose marriage I am not acquainted with - people might come from Bath and Bristol very respectable - I sit up, and let them sleep in the parlour - perhaps one or two sleep in the parlour - I will not swear there have not been fourteen or fifteen sleeping in the parlour when we have had soldiers billeted- I swear that I have not had twelve men and women sleeping in the parlour when soldiers have been billeted - I believe never more than four slept, and then they sit and sleep with their heads on the table, because there is no bedstead - Jones slept at the top of the house in a room by himself - there are two rooms on a floor - my father, and a little boy I have just taken as a nurse child, sleep in the other room - one room below I keep very nicely, to let to any body respectable - it is a single-bedded room - I have another bed-room over the bar which I let to people who I think genteel; but I am very particular who goes there - there is this large room that holds seven beds; but I can make up eight or nine occasionally - my husband and I never sleep together, it being a day and night house - we are in our business - when my husband does sleep, it is over the bar - he is never above three hours in bed - my daughter has often sat up all night with me - it is seldom she is in bed - if the house is full, and there is no room, she goes and sleeps with her grandfather - that is where she generally sleeps, with him and the little nurse child, if she goes to bed at all; but very often she does not go to bed till people get up and are gone off in the morning - she is not confined to one place - she never slept in the club-room - I was not before the magistrate last licensing day - my father Mr. Keel became the keeper of the house after licensing day - the magistrates did not refuse to grant my husband a license - what my husband asked was granted - the house is still in my care for me to conduct; but my husband has a very bad leg - he was before the Justices last licensing day - I have been in the house twelve months, and there is not one indictment against it - there was no complaint made against it - the license was not transferred in consequence of any complaint - I cannot say that I know

               <p>Q. Did you state in the presence of Mackerel that your daughter was intimate with, and had had connexion with all the men-servants about the house? A. Never in my life - I never said a thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, since the indictment for administering drugs was thrown out, had any conversation with Jones, and Mackerel? A. Never - I believe Mackerel did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150033"></xptr>some writing over at Clerkenwell once - he might be my attorney in this business - I have had no conversation with him and Jones, or with him alone, that I recollect particularly - I have seen Miller (looking at him) - I thought he was Mackerel - he is the only man I knew as Mackerel - I never asked their opinion as to the best means of getting rid of the prisoner - neither I nor Jones ever stated that the prisoner must be transported somewhere - Jones never said so in my presence - I never in my life told my daughter, in the presence of either of them, not to hesitate in swearing - I don't recollect any discussion amongst us as to what colour savin was, for these men are strangers to me, indeed they are not people I should consult with - I never agreed with Jones that white should be the colour - it is as false as God is true - I was before a magistrate on the 18th of November at the Bell and Anchor - I had no conversation with my daughter, in the presence of Jones, or between myself and Jones, as to what she was to say - I never told her what to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that man (Mackerel) before? A. Yes, but he is a stranger - that is the man I employed to write for me - I don't know him more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house before you went before the magistrate? A. He was down about Hammersmith a day or two before, I believe, but they are all strangers to me - he is one of the men who was writing at Clerkenwell - he was employed by me - he is what I call a petty lawyer - a poor fellow glad to get sixpence anywhere, I suppose - I know a person named Henman - he lived in my service at the time the prisoner did - I never told him it should be the worst day's work for him that ever happened if the bill was thrown out, and I would discharge him - he discharged himself, and so did the prisoner - I never told either of them that I would discharge them - the prisoner was charged before the magistrate with stealing my daughter's clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his afterwards being charged with receiving them? A. He received them when he took them away - I cannot tell whether he was charged with receiving them - he was charged with committing a rape on my daughter - the charge was made at the Bell and Anchor - my husband has brought an action against him for seduction at Westminster - I do not say he stole the clothes, but he received them afterwards, and they were found in possession of his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was a charge of stealing, receiving, rape, seduction, administering the savin, when the bill was thrown out, and this administering? A. Yes; it was all done by the direction of Mr. Withy, that part of it, or Mr. Eden, I should say - I have left it to Jones to do the business, and get who he liked, and I have paid him.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Was your husband coachman to Mr. Withy before he kept this house? A. Yes; he had been coachman with the late Lord Ellenborough five years and a half, and with Withy three years and nine months - he took this house in October twelve months.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you attend before the magistrate on the 18th of November? A. I did - I was born at Hammersmith, and that took me to the Chaise and Horses, which was once my father's property, and six or seven cottages there now are my property, and that is how I became acquainted with Miss Wolfe - Mrs. Wolfe asked me what she could do with the prisoner for taking away her daughter - she did not tell me about administering the poison - I said I did not know, but thought he might be punished for taking the things from the window, and her mother's gold ring - I attended before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend as attorney? A. I attended there - my uncle being out of town, or he would have been engaged in it - he was aware of the case - I know Pound - he is Mr. Bigg's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him that you were a nephew of Mr. Peter Alley's, and that you came from his chambers to prosecute this case? A. I swear before my Lord and all the gentlemen of the black robe - I never represented myself to Mr. Pound or the magistrate, as Mr. Peter Alley's nephew - the magistrate knew the difference - Mr. Scott knows me - I have not been turned out of the public office at Bow-street for representing myself as the nephew of Mr. Peter Alley - they sent to my uncle's chambers for him to go and prosecute a person for administering poison to a horse - Mr. Roe said, "I may be mistaken, I took you for the nephew of Mr. Peter Alley, instead of John Alley," and he said he did not know any Alley but Peter Alley - I was not told to leave the room - Mr. Roe said, "I cannot hear what you have to say," and I stayed in the room till the case was all over, and went out with Mr. Humphries - I was never paid one farthing by Mr. or Mrs. Wolfe for these proceedings - I received money from them to fee counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Humphries, the solicitor, sent for to see if he could identify you, and did not he state, on oath, that you had represented yourself as Peter Alley's nephew, and was not you on that turned out of the office?

Never - I solemnly swear I never said any thing of the kind - I never stated that the prosecutrix's father had plenty of money, and would give it - I might have said Mr. Wolfe was a man of property - I never said I thought I could get up a case by giving him in charge for stealing the girl's clothes - I never said, "D-n him, we must give him some imprisonment" - Miller did not say he could not attend to it- I believe Miller is a character who frequents Sergeant's-inn coffee-house - I saw him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to him that they had taken up the prisoner, and you could not support the charge, and must get up something else against him? A. Never, I solemnly swear; he did not ask me what I could get up - I did not say I would charge him with a rape - the rape was named before the magistrate - he was not held to bail for the rape, that I know of - I know I attended before the magistrate, who asked me in what way he became acquainted with Miss Wolfe - I said I believed it was by force in the first instance - he was not held to bail for the rape, that I know of - I cannot say what mistake the magistrate might have made - I said, I understood he had become acquainted with her at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150034"></xptr>first by force - the magistrate said, "Then the prisoner must have committed a rape; why was not that charge made?" - whether the magistrate took it down as a rape, I cannot say - the magistrate held him to bail - the charge preferred by me was for administering the poison - I never preferred a charge of rape against him - the magistrate asked how the first intimacy began - I said it was by committing a rape - I never told Miller that if a rape would not do, I would charge him with giving her savin to procure abortion; nor did he ask me what proof I had - no conversation of the sort took place - I never said, "The girl will swear any thing I tell her, and the mother will do the same," nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards call on Miller, at the Castle, in Portugal-street? A. No; I went there, but not to see Miller - about twelve months ago, I had to go to the Insolvent Court for a man who took the benefit of the Insolvent Act - I went in no character at all, as any private gentleman might go - I knew the man - I often saw Miller at the Castle, in Portugal-street - I might have said, in his hearing, that I was going to prefer another indictment - I believe I did - I did not say it should be found in a different manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miller say, "You are an infamous villain; and ought to be transported?" A. I never heard him say any thing of the kind - he never said if the prisoner was put on his trial he would come forward and state my infamous conduct - instead of that, Miller, in company with a person named Childs and Mackerel, said they would come here - I believe Childs was the one who spoke, and said, whenever he was tried, he would go and swear that which would get him off, if I did not give him money - Miller was in company with him - I know a man who calls himself Mr. Jackson - I saw him twice at Mr. Mackerel's, who represented himself to be his attorney, and who obtained money from me - and even Miller obtained money from me, being an attorney - I am not an attorney - I am a gentleman - I live by my property, which was left by my father - it is in houses and land - I have not practised as an attorney - I am not an attorney's clerk - after my father's death I went to a man named Fisher - I was to be articled to him, but I was not, and did not stop long.</p>
               <p>Q. When with Miller, did you ask the prosecutrix in his presence if she knew what she was to say? A. I never remember asking her any thing of the kind - to the best of my belief, I never did - I should not like to swear positively - I would almost swear positively I never did - I asked if she distinctly remembered the date the powder was given - I did not ask her if she knew on what day she was to state it was given - I said, "Do you know on what day it was the prisoner gave you the powder? because I dare say you will have to state it" - she did not say she did not; she always said she did know - no almanack was produced to assist her - an almanack was produced, because she said on what day it was, (the 26th of June,) and she got an almanack for the purpose of seeing on what day of the week it was - I cannot swear she got it - I did not - they went out of the room from me, and she brought the almanack in in her hand - there was no discussion as to fixing the day to correspond with her then pregnancy; nor any conversation about the colour of the powder - I believe Mrs. Wolfe was present - I cannot say that all this was in the presence of Jackson - I had Archbold's "Summary Proceedings" with me - I am in the habit of reading law books - it was not in my pocket; if it was any where, it was on the table - I have a book of that kind; but I do not know whether I had it that day - this was at the Chaise and Horses.</p>

               <p>Q. On the discussion about the colour of the powder, did you produce the book, refer to it, and then state afterwards that the colour of the powder did not signify? A. No; I never did - I do not know that I had the book there at the time - I have had conversation on this subject with

            . I am clerk to Mr. Biggs, of No. 35, Great James-street, Bedford-row. He is attorney for the prisoner. I was acting as clerk to Mr. Biggs, on the examination of the prisoner before the magistrate on a charge there, on the 18th of November - Thomas Alley Jones was there - I put some questions to him as to who he was - he said he came from Mr. Counsellor Alley - I asked, "What Alley?" and he said, "From Mr. Peter Alley;" and that he came from his chambers to conduct this case - a charge of rape had been preferred against the prisoner, on the previous Monday, which was immediately abandoned - I was not there - on the following Monday I was present, when the prisoner was held to bail for the rape - Mr. Alley Jones was present - it was in his presence and hearing.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Do you mean to say that he said he was the nephew of Mr. Peter Alley? A. I do; I did not see Mr. Humphries there - I do not think he was present at the time - there were several policemen there - it was a petty sessions - I never had a charge of horse stealing made against me, nor any other offence - I was never in custody on any charge.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been clerk to Mr. Biggs? A. Nearly four years; I keep a house, and reside myself in Great James's-street.</p>

            . I live at 32, Euston-street, Spafields. In November last, Thomas Alley Jones applied to me, and asked me to assist him in getting up a prosecu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150035"></xptr>tion against the prisoner - he said if I could get the prisoner sent out of the country, I should make 50l. by it, and that Wolfe, the father of the prosecutrix, had plenty of money, and he would give it - I asked him the nature of the charge - he said he thought I could get up the case, by giving him in charge for stealing the girl's clothes - he added,"D - n him, we must give him some imprisonment" - I said, I could not attend to it - about a week afterwards I saw him again - he then told me that he had taken up the prisoner, but could not support the charge, and so we must get up something else against him - I asked him what he was going to get up - he said, "I can get up a case of savin against him," but he mentioned nothing about a rape - I asked him what proof he had - he then stated, "The girl will swear any thing I tell her, and the mother also" - I afterwards saw him at the Castle in Portugal-street, after the bill for the savin had been thrown out - the bill was thrown out on the 26th of November - it was about a week or ten days afterwards - he then told me he was going to prepare another indictment before another grand jury, and the indictment should be framed in a different way - I told him he was an infamous villain, and ought to be transported, and perhaps a little more - and I added, that if the prisoner was put on his trial, I would come forward and state the villanous conduct of him and his party - I have heard Mrs. Wolfe, in the presence of the prosecutrix, state that the prosecutrix had had connexion with other men besides the prisoner - I remember being at the Chaise and Horses on the 16th of August last - I saw Mr. Jones and the prosecutrix come out of a privy there, not the Chaise and Horses, but the back part of it, which Mr. Jones calls his own premises - it was about four o'clock in the afternoon - I have heard Jones say, that he has had frequent connexion with the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What are you by trade? A. An appraiser and accountant - I work for any body who employs me as an accountant - I worked for Mr. Marner, a solicitor, in Clifford's-inn within the last three months - I have acted as his clerk sometimes, as an attorney's clerk, in making up accounts for insolvents, their schedules to pass the Insolvent Court - I have been so about two years - I was in the police in 1831 - I was discharged through giving my evidence in the Insolvent Court, and going to the opposite attorney for my expenses - the commissioners discharged me for that reason, and that only - I have before been asked questions in a court of justice, as to my discharge from the police by the gentleman on your left hand - I never stated that the cause was drinking with another police-officer - I remember the gentleman put the same question to me - I gave him the same answer as I have given you to-day - I have never been charged with any offence myself - I know Mr. Cope, the governor of the gaol - I was never charged with an offence of any sort - I was confined, during that very circumstance for which I was discharged, for going to ask for my expenses - I was confined in the Compter - Mr. Abrahams, the solicitor, sent me to the Compter - I was there one night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent there criminally or civilly? A. Why, perhaps I might have assaulted Mr. Abrahams - I was not committed on a charge of an assault, but on a charge of drunkenness, as Mr. Abrahams stated - that was the cause of my discharge from the police - that was the charge against me - I said I was discharged for going to ask for my expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you discharged for going for your expenses or being drunk? A. For both; I told the commissioners of the Insolvent Court the right cause of my discharge from the police - I did not then state that one cause of my discharge was drunkenness - the charges were coupled together - although it was sworn I was drunk, I can swear I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you first know any thing of Mr. Jones? A. Perhaps in June or July last; he found me in a public-house in the neighbourhood of the Insolvent Court - Mr. Mackerel was not there, nor Mr. Jackson - I cannot tell who was there, several were there - I am quite certain the two I have named were not there - Mr. Horncastle was there - I cannot say whether Mr. Jones asked for Horncastle at that time- he was talking to Horncastle at the time - I did not hear him ask for any body - neither I nor any of our party told him that we could do any thing in the law way cheaper than Horncastle, nor did any body in my hearing - the room was full when I told Jones he was a d - d villain, and ought to be transported - I think Mr. Ford, the landlord, was there - he can come forward to prove it - he is here - I believe Mr. Bruce, who is here, was by at the time - I believe Bruce gave Jones a rap in the mouth - this was before the second indictment was preferred - I think about December or January last - the observation Jones made to me about getting up the prosecution, made me believe he was the infamous villain and scoundrel I called him - those observations were addressed to me - he came to ask me to get up the fresh indictment - I assisted in copying the briefs in the former one at the time the first bill was thrown out - the charge was for administering savin.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it was the briefs we hold that you copied? A. I see some of my handwriting here - Mackerel also assisted in copying the briefs - he never told me whether he was paid by Jones for it - Mackerel was not to pay me my share - I never expected it - I told Jones what I had done in that thing I did not require him to pay me - I have not been paid by any body for it - I received no money from the beginning to the present moment for any thing in this affair - I know Mackerel's handwriting - I believe this to be his writing - four persons were concerned in writing the briefs - I was sent for specially - the four persons were

            . I am an attorney, living in Rahere-street, King-square, Goswell-road. I was admitted in 1807 - I have not latterly taken out my certificate - I continued to practise till within the last five years - I gave up the profession, having no occasion for it at that period. On the 18th of November I was at the Chaise and Horses at Hammersmith - I there saw Thomas Alley Jones - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there? A. Early in that morning Mr. Mackerel called on me - I went there to assist him, at his earnest request - the prosecutrix and her family<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150036"></xptr>were there - Jones asked the prosecutrix, before she went before the magistrate, if she recollected what she had to say, or something to that effect - he asked her on what day she was the state the powder was administered - she said she did not recollect, and an almanack was fetched to refresh her memory - there was a discussion as to fixing the day when Childs was at the house, as he had been absent, from illness or some other cause - there was a conversation as to what was the colour of savin - Jones had Archbold's Criminal Pleadings with him - he opened it and referred to it, and then said it did not matter as to the powder being savin - I should suppose every legal person was aware of it- I presumed him to have been a professional man at the time - he represented that he came as the nephew of Mr. Counsellor Alley - I considered he was the nephew of Mr. Peter Alley - I cannot say that he represented himself as a professional man; but, before the magistrate, being asked who he was, and in what capacity he attended, he said he attended from the chambers of Mr. Counsellor Alley - I cannot recollect whether Mr. Pound asked him which Mr. Alley - I was not aware at that time that there were two Mr. Alleys.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Jones appear angry that the girl was not perfect in her story? A. He certainly seemed displeased - he made use of some coarse expression - I think he called her a fool or something - I called the prosecutrix's mother aside from what I saw.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You were present at the magistrate's, and heard what passed? A. Yes; to the best of my recollection his words were, "the nephew of Counsellor Alley" - I, only knowing Mr. Peter Alley, supposed it was him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Can you say whether he was asked what Alley, and replied Mr. Peter Alley? A. I cannot say one way or the other.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live in Kirby-street, Hatton-garden. I have not for the last two or three years taken out my certificate - I have had some conversations with Mr. Alley Jones, the prosecutrix, and her mother, on the subject of this prosecution, in November last and since.</p>
               <p>Q. At any of those conversations, did Mrs. Wolfe ask the best means of getting rid of the prisoner? A. Not to my recollection - I ought to say that any conversation which took place between us, was in some measure confidential.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones at any time, and the prosecutrix's mother, state, in your presence, that the prisoner should be transported some way or other? A. I certainly think I ought not to answer that question, being their attorney at the time.</p>

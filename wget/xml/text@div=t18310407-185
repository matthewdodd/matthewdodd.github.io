             were attended by the prisoner, but I did not know of it for some time; I have my book here, from November to the present time - there is no entry of their names at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any entry of sundries? A. There is a small till account in which there would be sundries.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you engage him as? A.Assistant generally - I think he did say with respect to Reed, that she had not paid him, and if she had he should not have handed it to me, but that was in the heat of controversy; I discharged him on the 12th of February, and would not pay him his salary till he had handed me a list of his midwifery patients - he threatened to serve me with a writ; I believe the prisoner will not set up in business - I should have no objection to his signing a bond at this instant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You demanded of him a list of his patients? A. Yes - he certainly was not at liberty to attend patients on his own account; I offered through my friends, that if he would sign a bond and pay me, I would take no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070092"></xptr>further proceedings against him, but I found there had been a system of plundering going on for six months - I did not know Reed; I had never seen her as a patient myself, nor Howell either - I never had any dispute with him about his right to attend patients on his own account; he never claimed a right to attend patients - he is married, and that was one of my reasons for not wishing to prosecute him.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You had not seen Reed or Howell? A. No - I think I may have received money from him from persons whom I had not previously known.</p>

            . I am single, and used to live at Ealing. The prisoner attended me on the 8th of November last - I agreed with him to attend me, which he did, and I paid him on the 9th of November, 1l. 1s.; when I first spoke to the prisoner I did not wish Mr. Dickinson to know where I had lived, because if he knew where I had lived he would have known me by sight, as to my name I did not care - I employed the prisoner as Mr. Dickinson's assistant, and I expected the money would go into Mr. Dickinson's hands, but I did not wish him to know where I had lived; I went to Mr. Dickinson's surgery, and his errand-boy has brought me medicines, which were included in the sum of 1l. 1s., that I paid - I do not know what the medicines amounted to; there were two six-ounce bottles and a small phial.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Are we to understand that you did not wish Mr. Dickinson to know who the person was that the prisoner delivered? A. Yes - I should not have employed Mr. Dickinson himself; when I paid the prisoner the 1l. 1s. there was a person present - I told him I was very well satisfied with him, and as long as I was in Ealing I should think of employing no one else but him if I was ill; I had agreed with him for 1l. 1s., I think about six weeks before - I asked him what sum was required for attendance and medicine, and he said 1l. 1s.; there was one phial of medicine sent on the 8th of November, and to the best of my remembrance, one of the six-ounce bottles and I think one of the six-ounce bottles afterwards - when I spoke to the prisoner, I told him I had lived servant at a very respectable house, and as Mr. Dickinson used to go there as doctor, I did not wish him to know that I was the person who had lived there: I knew Mr. Dickinson did not know my name, and I told him he might tell that but not to say where I had lived - Mr. Dickinson knew me by sight, and I did not choose to see him; I desired the prisoner to take care that he was not aware I was that person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not give as a reason for not letting Mr. Dickinson know, that you could not bear the sight of him, he looked so much like a butcher? A. No - I found the prisoner very attentive and skilful.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON re-examined. Q. You have looked through your book, can you take upon yourself to say there are not payments to the amount of 1l. 1s. to which no name is attributed? A. I think there may be - there are entries of small till accounts for bleeding, tooth-drawing,&amp;c.; here are entries of ready money for medicines without a name - the price of small phial and two six-ounce bottles would be 7s. 6d.; I could not say that in that book there may not be entries to that amount, but this is the book in which he ought to have entered this.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HEED. I am married, and live at Ealing. The prisoner attended me in my confinement on the 8th of February, and on the 9th I paid him 10s.; when I asked him what the charge would be, he told me 18s.; the 3s. were for medicine, but he agreed to come to me for 15s.; I said it was a great deal of money, as I was a poor woman, and he agreed to send me a small draught- he said he was going to leave Mr. Dickinson, and then his own charge would he half a guinea.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you pay the money on Mr. Dickinson's account? A. I thought he would receive the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a nurse of the name of Rose? A. I live in a very bye place, and a poor woman came down for relief; I was in the greatest of trouble, and I sent her for the prisoner - she did attend to me; I did not pay her 5s. for her trouble; I do not know that the prisoner did - she has never been to me for money; I had not seen Mr. Dickinson myself; I had sent my aunt to him - I believe the prisoner's wife lives at Ealing; he was very attentive, kind, and skilful to me.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON re-examined. Q.Did you come to any settlement of accounts with the prisoner on the 12th of February? A. Not in the morning; I think I then owed him about 15l.; I should say we were on bad terms- I had given him notice to leave me, and the time had expired; I think he had made entries in the other book on the 11th, but this is the book in which this 10s. should have been entered - here is an entry of Mr. Tyrrell, "Paid a guinea," and my initials are against it, to show I have received it; he ought to enter money immediately on its being received - there was an unsettled account between us, in consequence of his refusing to give me up a list of patients he had been engaged to attend, and I refused to pay him his salary, but in the evening he sent his list, and I paid him his salary - this could not be an error in the book, because I asked him what became of the midwifery case which he had; he said, "It is not paid, and if it had been, I should not have handed it to you."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Reed's aunt engaged me to attend her on my own account - I said the fee was 15s.; she sent for me, but before I got there she had been delivered three-quarters of an hour, by Mrs. Rose - I was there about a quarter of an hour; she could not pay me then, but the next day she paid me 10s., and said as Mrs. Rose had had so much trouble, she hoped I would allow her the rest, which I did; she said she hoped I would send her a little medicine, which I also did: she said it was almost too much for her to pay, as she was a very poor woman - I said I was going into business myself, and I would attend her for half a guinea - when I left the prosecutor he sent a gentleman to me to say I was to leave Ealing, and he said I had been attending cases; I said there was one midwifery case, but it was not Mr. Dickinson's; he said if I would leave Ealing, and not set up within so many miles, he would not proceed against me. <rs id="t18310407-185-verdict1005" type="verdictDescription">

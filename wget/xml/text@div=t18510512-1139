                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 87). On Sunday morning, 28th April, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Brunswick-buildings with fourteen or fifteen of the most notorious thieves and prostitutes—a man named Smith was very riotous, and J took him into custody—I had a female in custody for assaulting me, and was taking her to the station with another constable—the prisoner, who I had never seen before, came behind me, and struck me a vio<lb></lb>lent</p>

               <p>blow on the hack of the neck with his fist—I let go of the female, and laid hold of the prisoner—he went very quietly for 200 yards, till he came to a dark place in Brunswick-street, where he resisted violently, and put his hand into his pocket and pulled out something with which he struck me two or three severe blows on the breast—he was in custody—he struck me a vio<lb></lb>lent blow on my left arm, and it immediately fell powerless by my side—he then struggled severely, but I retained my hold with my left-hand, and got him to the station, where I found my coat cut in six places, and blood flow<lb></lb>ing from a wound on my left arm—I went to University Hospital, and found I had other wounds—I have my coat here, to show the different cuts—I am suffering from the effects of it yet.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 155). Six other persons were brought to the station with the prisoner—I saw him pass something behind him to a woman named Smith, who dropped it into a bucket—I went to the bucket, and found this knife—the prisoner said that was not the knife he did it with, he threw that away at the corner of Coram-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, at University College Hospital. On 28th April, about two o'clock in the morning, Burton was brought there—there was a cut on his left arm, a little below the shoulder, which went through two coats, and his under clothing, to the depth of half an inch—it would produce the sensation of the arm being powerless—there was also a small superficial wound on his right breast—a sharp pointed knife would do it—this knife would not in its present state—it is rather too blunt—all the cuts were very clean.</p>

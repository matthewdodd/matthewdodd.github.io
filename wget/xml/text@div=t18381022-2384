                  </hi>. I am a printer. On Saturday, the 22nd of September, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in John-street, Adelphi, going towards my home, which is in Denzell-street, St. Clement's—I was alone, and perfectly sober—the prisoner accosted me—I never saw him before—I am confident he is the man—he overtook me, took me by the collar of my coat, put his foot in a certain position behind me, and said, "I want some money from you"—I said, "Certainly not"—he then gave me a violent blow in the face, knocked me down, knelt on my breast, and endeavoured to rifle my coat-pocket—but I was too powerful for him and resisted—he knelt very heavily on my breast, and gave me two more blows in the face, which stunned me—I called "Police," and he made his escape—he felt no other pocket but my coat-pocket—I ran after him, overtook him, and called "Police"—a constable came up and took him into custody—I was completely saturated with blood—he was never out of my sight from the time of my getting up—I had six or seven shil<lb></lb>lings in my trowsers' pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a policeman at the time of this transaction On the morning of the 22nd of September I heard a person call "Police," in Buckingham-street, Strand—I was close on the spot—I went up, and saw the prosecutor, whose face was very bloody—the prisoner had passed by me about a minute before—the prosecutor said, "Policeman, that man who passed you has knocked me down, and attempted to rob me"—I fol<lb></lb>lowed the prisoner, who was in company with two prostitutes, and took them all to the station-house—the prosecutor was about twenty yards from the prisoner when he gave me the information—the prisoner had turned the street, and got on while he was talking to me—he was out of sight about a minute, while he turned the corner—I am quite sure no one passed in that direction but the prisoner—the prosecutor was very bloody, and had got a cut on his nose and cheek—I saw his coat was torn at the pocket—when I took the prisoner, I asked him how he came to strike the man—he toned round and said, "I never saw the man in my life before."</p>

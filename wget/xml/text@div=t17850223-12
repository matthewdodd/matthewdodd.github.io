            ? - Yes, I was in company with him on the 31st of January, on Finchley-common, at Mr. Farling's, Brown's Wells; I took the prisoner within a hundred yards of Brown's Wells, I am servant to Madam Lucy, on Finchley-common, I had been at London, and was returning back at the time; I did not stop at this public house, but I met with the prosecutor on the road, at the side of the Common, about two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Did you enter into conversation with the prosecutor? - None while I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How came you and the prosecutor to meet that evening? - We met just as the accident happened, at the Swan and Two Necks; I made my home there that night, my mistress was in town, we had been with my mistress's goods that night to town; the prosecutor came in, and said, I am robbed of nine shillings, says I, I will go back with you, if you will go with me; I have known the prosecutor these good many years, I took the poker out of the fire, and went back with him, and within about two or three hundred yards of Brown's Wells, there were two persons standing, and I said halloo! and they made no answer, and I said, halloo! again, and they made no answer; and I made up to them, and the one run one way and the one the other, I pursued one and Birch the other, and the one I pursued turned round and fired his pistol at me, that was the prisoner, that I am sure of; the pistol flashed in the pan, but went no further, I tripped up his heels and threw him down, and took the pistol from him; here is the pistol, he run it into my side when I kicked his heels up; we took him into Brown's Wells, and went to seek for a constable; and then two others fired at me, we kept him in custody, and he was afterwards carried before a Magistrate, and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was before the Justice, he swore I fired at him three times! - I never said such a word, I said, he fired at me with his pistol, and the other two fired at me as I went along; I had two more pistols attempted to be fired at me, the one made a report, and the other did not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going down to Barnet to my uncle, and the other side of Brown's Wells, two men came up to me, and said, halloo! and I made no answer; and they immediately followed me, and said, life for life, and I immediately run off, and they followed me.</p>
               <p>How do you get your living? - I have been a gentleman's servant lately.</p>
               <p>Was you in service at this time? - I was out of service, I was going to my uncle who lives at Barnet, I have witnesses to my character.</p>

             the younger sworn.</p>
               <p>I am subpoened to this man's character; I have known him personally about three years, I am a clergyman, I live in Berkshire now, but at the time I knew him, he lived with me at South Mims, near Barnet; he was footman to me, for I believe more than a year and half, he was a very sober servant, and I believe, very well thought of by every body in the neighbourhood, as well as in our family; he has left my service about a year and four months, as near as I can recollect; I visited at the gentleman's house that he went to live with, which is this gentleman, Mr. Casamajor.</p>
               <p>- CASAMAJOR, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner about fourteen months, he lived as a servant with me about eight months; he quitted my service about the middle of last July, he had an exceeding good character while he lived with me, and was a very good servant; he gave me warning, he understood nothing of horses; I never heard of him till about a fortnight or three weeks ago, his uncle applied to me.</p>
               <p>Then from July you are a total stranger to the manner in which he conducted himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What way of life is his uncle in? - He is a barber, a very respectable honest man.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. I will examine any more witnesses you may think proper to call, but after two such respectable witnesses as these, it does not seem to me that you want any more witnesses to character.</p>

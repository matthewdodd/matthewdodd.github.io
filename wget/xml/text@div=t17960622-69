               <p>Q. Did any servants sleep there? - A. No; I left St. Clement's on Thursday the 25th of February, in the evening, between six and seven; and the next morning, when I went to open the shop between seven and eight, I unlocked the same as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock it up the night before? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220093"></xptr>Yes, I did; in the morning when I opened the door, I saw two glass-cases which I have, and which hang on the outside, were taken down off the books in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house broke at all? - A. Only up in the dining-room; I got into the shop as usual; I found the stays all gone from the shop window, and I immediately ran up into the dining-room, and found the dining-room door forced open, and all the stays gone out of the dining-room; then I came down stairs and went to Holborn bridge, and let my wife know of it, and then I directly sent her to Bow-street, to have some bills printed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of these things again? - A. Yes; one of the police officers came from Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, to inform me of a pair of stay, which I know to be mine; I saw them at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You had left this house in St. Clement's church-yard, by way of sleeping there in September? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed your property in February? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any idea from that time till the time of the robbery, of sleeping at St. Clement's? - A. No; I meant to sleep in the city, because the city making such improvements as they did, I could not so well sleep in St. Clement's church-yard.</p>

               <p>I am a married woman, I live in Harris-street, Blackman-street, in the Borough: One night, of a Wednesday or Thursday, I cannot say which, between nine and ten o'clock, I suppose, about two months ago, or ten weeks, I cannot rightly tell, my husband and I were going to bed, and I heard somebody lift up the latch of the door; my husband looked out at the window, and it was Mr. Hutchinson; Mr. Hutchinson came in, and another man was with him that is in custody now over the water, his name is Eastwick; not the other prisoner; Hutchinson said, I have brought a man here who has got some stays to sell, will you buy them; I told him it was too late; if he would stay till to-morrow we would go and look at them; he said, that gentleman was going away to-morrow; that he drove some coach, I cannot recollect what coach; he and Mr. Hutchinson said, if you like to leave them in my house, my house shall be at your service; and we went along with Hutchinson, and Eastwick went outside with the coachman, and drove the coach himself, and we went to Hutchinson's house, somewhere near the New Church in the Strand, but what street it was I do not know; we went up stairs, and Mrs.Hutchinson, and Mr. Brown, and another woman, were playing at cards; Mr. Eastwick went up and opened two glass doors where the stays were in a brown Holland bag; he brought the bag out and shewed me some stays, but nothing nigh the number that this gentleman says he lost; I asked him what he asked for them, I think he said 12 or 14 guineas, I cannot rightly say what sum it was; we agreed for 10, but I did not give 10 for them; we had but two guineas about us, and we gave him them, and begged of Hutchinson to pass his word for me for the remainder; he said, it was nothing to him; was it his property, if it was five times the money he should not be afraid to trust me, for be knew where I lived; we got away the stays the next day, they were tied up as we left them; Mrs. Hutchinson delivered them to us.</p>

               <p>Q. This was Mrs. Hutchinson's house, was not it? - A. Yes; it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair had you? - A. I suppose about 20 or 24, I cannot rightly say; I gave but seven guineas and an half for them altogether, for I found I had offered too much for them; I got but half a guinea by them after I had sold them; here is one pair of the stays in Court, that I kept for my own wear; the officer has got them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Hutchinson's house was full of lodgers? - A. Yes; she always did keep lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. And Eastwick lodged there too, did not he? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Brown, all that you know is, that he was playing at cards with a woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And as to Hutchinson, all that you know about it is, that he brought this man, Eastwick, to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you bargained with Eastwick for them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know whether Eastwick was a lodger there? - A. I don't think he was; I cannot rightly say whether he was or not.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 7th of May, I went in company with Griffiths, and the rest of my brother officers, to Hutchinson's house in Hollis-street, Clare-market; I apprehended Brown in the two pair of stairs, he was in bed with another young man; I told them I had an information against them for housebreaking, and desired them to get up; they got up, and while they were dressing themselves I found in a drawer in Brown's room these false keys,(producing them).</p>

               <p>Mrs. Benjamin. I believe these are stays I gave to Mr. Griffiths, I will not venture to swear they are the stays.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will you swear that the stays you gave to Griffiths, were bought at Hutchinson's? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know they are a part of the stays you lost? - A. In regard of the scoring of them, and the shape of them; they are cut out by my own hands; when I cut them out I mostly number them inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number? - A. I cannot say without undoing them; it is inside the lining, (cuts it open) this is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You make a great many stays in the course of a year? - A. 1700 pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always put the same mark, and make them in the same shape? - A. The marks are not regular.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear you have never parted with that pair of stays? - A. Yes; because I had but two pair of stays made in this manner, this is the first that ever was made with a bow in the front in this manner.</p>

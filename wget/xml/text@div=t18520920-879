                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 637). On 14th July I was on duty in Houndsditch. I saw the prisoner with this carpet on his shoulder—he went into a public house, and I followed him—I asked him what he had got—he said a carpet, which he had brought from the East India House, to have it beaten—I was not satisfied, and I took him into custody—he said the carpet had been given him by Mr. Collins, who was a messenger of the East India House—I took him to the station; I found nothing on him—he gave me his address, in James-street—I went there, and found a number of dupli<lb></lb>cates in a drawer in the room where he was lodging—two of them relate to those other carpets, which I produce.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Bishopsgate-street, and am an upholsterer. The prisoner has been in my employ—I cannot identify these carpets—I had a number of carpets belonging to the East India Company, under my care, but they were not on my premises, they were in a store in the East India House, in Leadenhall-street—I cannot say when I saw them last—they were locked up in the store, and it was the prisoner's duty to take them out of the store and lay them down when they were required, but not to take them of the premises—he was to take them to be beaten when he had express orders—whether these are some of those carpets that ought to have been in the store, I cannot tell—they were such carpets as these—I saw the one pro<lb></lb>duced by the officer, it was one of their pattern, and it had been recently beaten—it did not require to be beaten at the time he had it—it is an old carpet, it did not want anything to be done to it before it was laid down again—the prisoner could go to the store, but he had no liberty to pawn the carpets.</p>

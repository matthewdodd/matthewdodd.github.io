                  </hi>. I am constable of the Tower Liberty. On the 30th of April I saw the prisoner on Tower-hill—for a reason which I had I followed him to George-street—he stopped there, and said, "What do you follow me for?"—I said, "Have you got any bad money about you?"—he said, "No, you can search me if you like," and held out his arms—I searched his pockets, and found nothing—I saw something in his mouth, and said, "What have you got in your mouth?"—he made no more ado, but struck me on each side of the head with his fists, and pretty hard blows—he knew I was an officer—I then made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at him, and when I got hold of him he was trying to swallow some pieces, and he had, in my opinion, swallowed some—he then spat three half-crowns into his hand, and threw them over some railings into some waste land belonging to the Woods and Forests—he then threw me down with the back of my head on the curb-stone—it rather stunned me—he jumped upon me, and ran off—I pursued him as well as I could till the policeman stopped him—I went to where he threw the money over the fence, and found three half-crowns and one shilling, about six or seven yards from where he threw them—these are the coins.</p>

I heard the cry of "Stop thief!"—I stopped the prisoner—Child came up, and charged him with smashing and with assaulting him—he was taken to the station, and asked what trade he was—he said, "I don't know, a barber if you like"—he was asked where he lived—he said, "You know all about me, you can find that out"—on the way to the station he said, "Do you think I am a <hi rend="italic">smasher?</hi> I work hard for my living in the Docks, as you can see by my hands."</p>

                  </hi>. This money is all counterfeit, and two of the, half-crowns have been cast in the same mould.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never was concerned in anything of the kind; the officer had not the slightest ground for apprehending me; he searched my pockets, but found nothing; he laid hold of me by the collar, and tried to throw me down, and he fell as well as I did; a great many people came round, although not one of them could prove my throwing anything into the waste ground; when I had been at the station half an hour, the beadle brought three half-crowns and a shilling, which he said he found over the hoard in George-street; the only reason for this charge is that I was taken into custody three or four months since, being in a room taking refresh<lb></lb>ment with two persons who were passing bad money.</p>

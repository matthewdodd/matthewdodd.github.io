On the 11th of August I left home before six o'clock, and came to my father's, which is opposite, a little after six, but did not go home till nine o'clock; I remained at my father's. I had left my wife and sister in the house, besides Mrs. Mason. When I came home, in consequence of what my wife said, I found my bureau, in the front room first floor, broken open, and about one hundred watches, and the rest of the property stated in the indictment gone - their total value was about 150 l.. I saw them all safe about nine o'clock in the morning, and also at five in the afternoon. I do not know that I left my bureau locked, but the room door was. The screw which fastens the knob of the lock was lost, and on touching the knob the spindle comes entirely out. Mason's husband also lodged in the house, but was not there when I left. When I came home and discovered the robbery, it struck me that nobody but Mrs. Mason was in the house, and it must he her - she was then, I believe, in bed with her husband. I went up and accused her of the robbery, she denied it. I sent for an officer to search her place; nothing was found, except three or four knives of mine, which were not stolen then. While I was at my father's I saw

On the evening of the robbery I lost a gold chain with a miniature, a pair of ear-rings, a cream jug, a necklace, and several other articles - my drawers were forced open, and the things taken out. I had left the room locked, and had the key with me. I was terrified on hearing of the robbery, and cannot say whether I found the door locked or not when I returned. I saw the things safe that day, and had shewn the miniature to Mrs. Mason that day. My husband's name is Charles.

On the night of the robbery, about seven o'clock, I went over to his house from his father's by his desire, to see if my sister (his wife) wanted me. On putting my hand to the knocker the door went open. I heard somebody on the stairs, went up, and saw the prisoner, Mason, pulling my sister's front room door to on the first floor - she had pulled the spindle out of the lock. She had something in her hand, which she either dropped, or it fell out of her hand, and struck against the side of a box, it sounded like a stone or some hard substance. She said,</p>
               <p>"Mind how you tread." I asked if my sister was at home? she said No. I thought I heard a moving in the front or back room; it was a rustling noise, as if somebody was moving. She had the spindle of the door in her hand. I tried the back room door, it was shut - she then stood with her back against the back room door and her hand behind her. I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall go up stairs, and see if my sister is up in Mrs. Ellis's room." She put her hand against the stairs, and said,</p>

As I was walking with him, he said he knew of a good thing, and going down Drury-lane he pointed out Mr. Joseph's house, and said that his sister, Mrs. Mason told him, that in paying her rent to Joseph, she saw considerable property in watches in his bureau. He asked if I knew any person who would undertake the job; he said he knew one Schooley, who he was to see, or expected to see, and he was a very clever chap, and could open iron-chests. And there was a job at a watch and clock-makers in Holborn, and none but Schooley could do it, that several of them had attempted it, but that he could do it. And that there was a job at Coram's, where he lodged, and 14 l. was lost, and only 3 l. 10 s. brought to light. We walked over Waterloo-bridge and returned to Drury-lane, a boy ran up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Father, here is Mr. Schooley;" he came up, and said he could not come before, or something of that kind. We then walked round Russell-street, and looked about Joseph's back premises, then came to the corner of the court. Mr. and Mrs. Mason both came up at the same time to Joseph's street-door. Mason crossed the road, and Mrs. Mason stood with her back to the door. Robins and Schooley spoke to her as they passed. We then went up a court into Wild-street. Schooley pulled out a large bag with a good many keys, and said nothing would do. Robins said it was too late, and we walked into Wild-street, and at the corner of Holborn I parted with them. On the Monday following I had some business in Lee-street, and called at Robins's house, and saw Mrs. Mason and Mrs. Robins there, but not Mr. Robins. His wife said he was gone out with a man. I asked what man, she said she believed with the man her boy brought down to us in Drury-lane. I said what time did they come home last night. She said at half-past eleven o'clock. I said I left them at half-past nine. Mason said</p>
               <p>"Did Tom tell you any thing about that last night;" I said Yes. She said, I paid my rent to Mr. Joseph, and saw a great many watches and other property, in the bureau; that the lock was a common one, that the handle would come out, or it might be opened easily by a key. That they were out till past twelve o'clock last night. I went away, it was Monday morning. The same evening Robins called on me, and said he heard I had been there; he said he had been with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180061"></xptr>Charley, that he had a partner at Hatton-garden, and would breakfast with him. He left me, and called again on Wednesday evening, nothing was said about this robbery then. On the Saturday morning following, I went up to him, he opened the door, which was locked inside, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do not come here, for there is a fine piece of work." I said, About what? He said the robbery at Joseph's, which had been committed. I said</p>
               <p>"I suppose you know all about it, but you kept the affair very sly to yourselves." He said,</p>

               <p>"Do not stand baffling here, you had better go about your business, if you are caught here, it will give you a good deal of trouble, particularly as you keep a shop." I was surprised, and went home. In the afternoon he came to me, and said, there was a fine bother, that his wife had gone down to Mrs. Mason, and he supposed they had kept her. I said</p>
               <p>"I could see from the first of it you did not intend to let me be connected in it. You have not acted quite right, but I am better perhaps without it." He said,</p>
               <p>"You had nothing to do with it, and can expect nothing." I said,</p>
               <p>"No; but you acted so d - d sly;" a person came in and he left, but returned in two hours, and brought a fork with him, he threw it down in the window, and said it would fetch something. He said that Schooley was a d - d rascal, and he was about moving, and he did not know where to, and he would go after him. When he left I thought the fork was meant to do me an injury; it was a white-handled one. I told a person of it; he said it was a trap, and so that afternoon I wrote to Mr. Joseph, saying I would come forward, and give every information. Salmon came to me about three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROBINS. Q. You recollect coming to me, and saying you believed Schooley robbed the place - A. I mentioned it,</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 19th of August, I went to No. 20, North-street, Pentonville, and found Griffiths and Goodwin in the house. I think Goodwin opened the door to me. She told me they had taken the house and come in that morning. I heard afterwards that a man was there, but I did not see him. She said she expected her husband home every moment. I went into the parlour, and found a deal box, asked whose it was, Goodwin said she did not know, nor had she the key. I broke it open, and found a quantity of jewellery which the prosecutor claims. Griffiths also said she did not know how it came there. The furniture was in the house, all loose, as if just brought in.</p>

            . I was with Limbrick; and afterwards went and found more property.</p>
               <p>ROBERT EAST. I am a carpenter. On the 18th of August, a man came to me and said he had taken his house of my master, it was neither of the prisoners. He wanted to come in immediately. I said he could come at any time, he said he would come in early in the morning. I went to my master's in Tottenham-street, he followed me. I saw him knock at the door, I asked what he wanted, he said the key. I said he could not have possession till I saw my master. I gave the man possession on the morning of the 9th, and helped him to carry the box in, in which Limbrick found the property. Griffiths was there when they broke it open. I worked there all that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man called himself her husband - A. Yes; she sat on the things when I came to help him in with them. I do not know who brought them there.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MASON'S Defence. Miss Abrahams came and knocked twice at the door. I let her in, I told her not to run over my kettle, which was on the stairs, she kicked it over. I followed her up stairs, she asked if her sister was at home, I said I did not know, she went and tried Mrs. Ellis's door. I went into my room, and was not out of it again till Mr. Joseph came home.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Arthur Gurney, in Brewer-street, Somers-town; he is a publican. On the 6th of July, about five minutes before eight o'clock, I was in the bar, and a person asked me to give him change for a sovereign, which he put down. I took it up, and went and got the change, in four half-crowns and 105.—I then saw the prisoner, which was the first time I had seen him—I asked whose change it was, and the prisoner came to me and said it was his—I gave it him, and asked if there was any thing to pay—he said a pot of beer, and he gave me a shilling—I gave him the change and took for the beer—he went away, and when he was gone the other person came and asked for the change—I am sure the prisoner is the man that got it from me—I had not known him before.</p>

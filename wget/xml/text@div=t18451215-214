                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 137.) On Friday, the 12th of Dec, about three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in High-street, Shad<lb></lb>well. The prisoner was there quarrelling and fighting with a woman—I took hold of him, and desired him to go away—he immediately turned round and faced me—I took hold of him by the arm—he struck me two severe blows in the face, knocked me down, and then commenced uavagely beating and kicking me while on the ground—I struggled to get up, to use my staff or rattle, which were in my pocket—I received a blow on my forehead, which stunned me and blinded me with the blood—I received the blow either from the prisoner's foot or fist—I could not say which, in the struggle—a woman screamed out, "Murder!"—the prisoner then left me, my brother constable coming up at the same time—I saw the prisoner hide in a doorway—my brother constable went and took hold of him, and I assisted in securing him—I have been under medical treatment—I went off immediately to the hospital, but having a family I did not wish to stop there, and was sent home—the police-surgeon bus attended me ever since—the blow cut my forehead open, and it bled very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in High-street, Wapping. Blake was brought to me at eleven o'clock on Friday the 12th—he had a contused wound over the forehead—the skin was broken—that might have produced blood—I did not perceive any, it had stopped when I saw him—the skin was cut through.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant K</hi> 8.) On Friday, the 12th of Dec., I saw Blake about half-past three o'clock—he was perfectly sober, but had a cut over the eye, and his face was very much disfigured—if it had not been for his number on his coat I should not have known him—the cut over the eye was about half an inch long—blood flowed from it pro<lb></lb>fusely—it was a sharp cut, as if by a knife or kick, I should say, not from the hand—the sharp edge of a shoe might have done it—I should say a man's knuckles would not have done it—Blake was perfectly sober—I have known him four years, and never knew him otherwise than sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The policeman saw me half an hour after it happened; I was standing still when he took me; I asked him what it was for; I said I did not think there was any reason at all to take me—I never rose a hand up to strike him; as I was coming home from the Borough I went in to light my pipe at a public-house; the prosecutor was standing with both bands against the wall; I passed him, and as I came out he was standing against the wall; I went past him; he said to me, "Well, young fellow, are you going to stand anything?" I said, "I have no money; and if I had, it would do you no good to have more than you have;" he put up his hand and said, "The sooner you go the better," and struck me with his staff; he put me right before him, and made a violent blow at my bead with his staff; I stooped my head down, and he fell down on his hands and face on the road; I walked away to get clear of him; it is the first time I was ever before a Judge, and I hope it will be the last.</p>

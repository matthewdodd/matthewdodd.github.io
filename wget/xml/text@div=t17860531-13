               <p>I was at the Plough in Oxford-road, drinking; the prisoner came in, and sat down in the box where I was; she had a pint of twopenny, I had another, I treated her with a pint; there came in a coachman, and her and me got into the hackney-coach; I knew the coachman; this was the 8th of May, about eleven; I had this money in my pocket when I went into the coach with her, and when I got out, I had none; I told the hackney coachman I believed I had lost my money in hustling about the coach; we looked in the coach, and could not find it, and I accused the prisoner; followed her all the way to Dean-street, and charged the watch with her; she said, the man is only a joking with you; I said, I do give you charge of her; she was taken to the watch-house; the constable searched her, and found about eight shillings and some halfpence; I knew I had some silver, but I could not swear to that; the beadle said, he dare say he could find the two guineas; he went in, and told her to pull off her shoes; she directly said, if I would come in, she would beg my pardon, and tell me where the money was; she directly pulled off her shoes, and there were the two guineas and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>What did she say when the money was found? - I was not in the room when the money was found, I was in the next place to it; I heard her say, if I would come in, she would beg my pardon, and tell me where the money was, but they would not let me go in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in White Lion-street, Chelsea. On Tuesday evening, the 15th of September, I left my house about half-past five o'clock—I left no one in the house—the front door was fastened by a padlock—I returned about eleven o'clock, and en<lb></lb>tered at the back door, which was padlocked as I had left it—I found the back window had been opened by breaking one square of glass about four inches from the button which fastened it—a person could reach in and un<lb></lb>do the button, and open the window—I examined, but missed nothing then—on Thursday night I missed seven half-crowns and six shillings, which I had seen safe on the Monday night in the top room, in a pot in the mid<lb></lb>dle of the room—there are only two rooms to the house—I had not looked into the pot between the Monday and Thursday—I have never seen the money again, having no mark on any of it—I examined the window on the Thursday in consequence of missing the money, and found soot from the top of the window to the bottom, at the edge, and on the window-sill and sash—the mark on the sill was as if a foot or knee had been put on it—the prisoner is a sweep, and lived about five yards from my house, facing it.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 17th of September, I met the prisoner, and went with him to Broadway, Westminster—he left me there, and said he was going to borrow some money—I afterwards saw him buy a waistcoat and trowsers, and pay four half-crowns for them; he also got his coat out of pledge, which he paid half a-crown and one shilling for, and bought a cap, which he told me he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—he bought the duplicate of a shirt of me for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he never told me where he got the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of September, and told him he was charged with breaking and entering Fletcher's house—he denied it—a jacket and trowsers were given to me, which I afterwards showed to him—he said he gave 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for these braces in George-street, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this cap in Grosvenor-row, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the trowsers, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the waistcoat, and St. he gave to redeem the jacket—he said he had found a half-sovereign in Lower Sloane-street, and changed it at the Nag's Head public-house—I afterwards examined Fletcher's back parlour-window, and found a quantity of soot outside on the flower-pots, on the window-sill, and window-frame—there was the print of naked toes on the window-sill, apparently those of a small person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Barr. On 31st Aug., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I was going into the Pavilion Gardens, at North Woolwich, and saw the prisoner there—I had a gold watch with a chain to it, which was round my neck, and a bunch of coral trinkets—the prisoner snatched my watch from my side, and broke it from the chain—I caught hold of his arm, saw the watch in his hand, and said, "You little villain, you have got my watch"—he said, "Me, ma'am?" and while I held his arm he dropped the watch into the side pocket of a man who was standing before me, I took it out immediately—he then turned round again, and snatched my chain from my neck—it had been separated from the watch by his snatching the watch; the ring of the watch had broken—he got the chain and ran away with it in his hand, and a gentleman in the crowd ran after him, brought him back, and he was given to a policeman—he dropped the chain a few yards from where I was, and my daughter who was with me picked it up—this is the watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the Magistrate ordered them to be given to me.</p>

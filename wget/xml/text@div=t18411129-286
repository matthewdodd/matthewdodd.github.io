                  </hi>. I am warehouseman, in the employ of Mr. Saltmer, of Friday-street, Cheapside—the witness, M'Knight, was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody, and made a statement. On the 19th of November I went to the prisoner's shop, No. 2, Cumberland-row, Newington-butts, accompanied by M'Knight and Mr. M'Lean—it is a second-hand clothes' shop—I and Mr. Knight went into the shop together—I had a parcel—the prisoner was at home, and an elderly man sat by the fire-side with him, who immediately went out—he was lame, and walked with a stick—on M'Knight seeing the prisoner, he said, "That is the man I sold the goods to"—to the best of my belief those were his words—I called M'Lean in, who said to the prisoner, "I must have these goods"—the prisoner said, "Oh, what I bought of this young man?"—M'Lean said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "The twelve lengths"—he said he did not know the value of them when I told him, and said he had bought the twelve lengths for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he said he did not know what a velvet was, that he never had a silk velvet in his shop, and did not know the value of it at all—he began to cry—he said he had sold them to a stranger, and if the inspector</p>

               <p>would allow him to go, he might he able to find that stranger, but he could not without—the inspector said, no, he must go with him—he asked the inspector if he would go with him to his master's shop, and they went out together—the prisoner had no hat on—I stopped at the shop—they were gone about ten minutes—they came back to the shop—the prisoner was crying very much—he said he did not know the value of them—we came away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with him—his house was searched, but nothing was found—he was taken to the station, and there he said he only had six lengths—when M'Knight made the statement to me at my master's warehouse, he pointed to some patterns of velvets in our books—I have ascertained that velvets of that pattern are missing to a much larger extent than M'Knight acknowledges—a waistcoat-length is 7/8, where he says he has only cut 3/4, I miss three or four yards—the velvets he pointed out are of different patterns, some worth about 325. a yard, some less, none under 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I accompanied Evans and M'Knight to the prisoner's shop at Newington—Evans and M'Knight went in first—they afterwards called me in—I asked the prisoner where the twelve cuts were—Evans and him were talking—he said he had sold them to a stranger for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. profit—he also said he was a poor young man, and that was his shop—I searched the shop, but found nothing—I said he must go with me—he said he thought if I would let him go he could find out the person he had sold them to—he began crying two or three times, and said, "Will you go down with me to the other shop?"—I accompanied him there—it was about a hundred yards—he was crying almost all the way—when I got there I found it was Mr. Davis's shop, who it appeared was his employer—I asked Davis if he knew any thing about the sale of them—he said he did not know any thing about them—some conversation passed, but it was just at the Sabbath, and they begged me to let him go back to shut up the shop, which I did—I made no search at Davis's—I took the prisoner to the station, and there he said he had not bought more than six cuts—he acknowledged to the twelve at the shop—he said he gave 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them.</p>

I was in the prose<lb></lb>cutor's employ—I took twelve lengths of velvet from his premises—eleven were sufficient for a waistcoat, and the twelfth for two—I afterwards pointed out to Evans some of the patterns which I took—I first saw the prisoner one Saturday night, about three weeks ago, at his shop at Newington Causeway—I had nothing with me then—I asked him if he would buy some length of figured velvet for waistcoats—he said, "Yes"—I went again on the Mon<lb></lb>day, I believe, and took the twelve lengths which I have mentioned with me—I got there about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I found him there—there was a boy present in the shop—he was bringing in some waistcoats as they were going to shut up—he went out and came in again—I opened the parcel—the prisoner asked what I wanted for them—I did not mention any price, but he said he would give me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the lot—he said nothing more—I said, "Would he give more than that, it was not enough for them"—he said no, he was a man to his word—he said nothing else—I took the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he paid me.</p>

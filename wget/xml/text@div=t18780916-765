                  </hi>. I am acting assistant overseer at the Kilburn post-office—on 13th July I received the 8 o'clock bag, which came through the North-Western, and opened it—I found in it this list of three registered letters, amongst them one to Mrs. Young—I handed them to the prisoner with the registered list, and took his receipt for them; the three letters were all in his delivery—the letters are sorted before we open the registered bag—the prisoner should have delivered that letter about 9.50—he had other letters to deliver besides the registered letters—it would be his duty to bring back the receipts on Monday morning which he took from the persons to whom he delivered them—he was supplied with forms of receipt for the purpose; they came with the bag—it is not my duty to receive back the receipts, that was the duty of Wells the overseer—I sent out the letters by the prisoner at the 8 p.m. delivery on Monday the 15th—he had two registered letters for delivery that night—I gave him receipts with the registered slip—I took his signature as I did in the other case—the receipts which the prisoner brought back would be given to Wells on the Tuesday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant overseer at the Kilburn post-office—it is my duty each morning to examine the receipts brought back for the registered letters—I examined them on Monday morning, 15th July—I found that one was missing in the name of Young—I asked the prisoner for it—he said "I have given them up"—I then said "I want two in the name of Young, one at the 6 p.m. delivery and one at the 8 p.m. delivery; but I have only one"—I showed him that, and said "Is this the receipt you had?"—he said "Yes"; that was the one of the 6 o'clock delivery; but I did not notice the stamp at that time—Hill had delivered at 6 o'clock—I afterwards saw Hill, and in consequence of what he said I at once communicated with the Post-office authorities—the missing letter has not been found, only the four notes—the prisoner took out letters on the Monday on three deliveries—he had three registered letters to deliver that day, one at the 4 p.m. delivery and two at the 8 p.m. delivery—the receipts for the 8 p.m. delivery he should bring back on the following morning—one of those letters in the name of Cooper was mis delivered; that mistake was discovered, and I delivered the letter myself to the right person—the prisoner came on duty at his usual time on the Tuesday morning—I inquired for the three receipts for the letters he had taken out on Monday—he said he had not got them—I said "What have you done with them?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "It is a very strange thing if you have lost three registered letter receipts"—he said "Well, I don't know whether I have or not; I have not got them"—I said "You will have to explain what you have done with them"—he then said "I have not delivered my last night's letters which I took out on the 8 p.m. delivery"—I then asked him for his bag containing those letters—I at once turned out the bag and found 86 letters and 11 newspapers—I asked why he did not deliver them—he said "I took them out, but I did not intend to deliver them", and he refused to deliver any more—he fetched his receipts in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and then went away from the office altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

               <p>he seemed a little excited that morning—he was not a likely man for me to suspect—ordinary letters have been misdelivered at times, but I never knew of a registered letter being misdelivered—this letter to Cooper was delivered to a person of the same name within five or six doors of the right one—the servant girl gave a receipt for it in her master's name; it was given back to another letter-carrier, who brought it to me—I believe the prisoner was asked on the Monday night to do some other work, to which he objected, he said he had not got through his own work—he had been about five months in the service—he was a slow hand at sorting, not particularly clumsy—I told Mr. Hawkins the inspector that he was not a quick man—I can't say whether he was spoken to about it—I think on one occasion the</p>
               <p>prisoner brought me a letter containing some small coin, and I charged double registration for it—I did not know that the prisoner was about the neighbourhood for three or four days after the Tuesday—I have heard since that he has a mother at Reading—I can't say that she sent him money at times—I paid him his weekly wages, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the Saturday afternoon—he was supposed to work at some trade besides delivering letters—I have never known the letter-carriers sort their letters in the street after leaving the office.</p>

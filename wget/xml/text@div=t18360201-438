                  </hi>. I am a brewer, at Knightsbridge, in partnership with Thomas and Henry Goding.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messers. Goding, and have been for twenty-five years collecting clerk. I was at Mrs. Ingold's in North-road Park-lane, on Tuesday evening, the 12th of January—I disco<lb></lb>vered that Mrs. Ingold's account, and the book did not agree; and I met the prisoner there accidentally on the Wednesday morning—he began the conversation by saying, there was something wrong in the account, and and asked me to give him the book, which I had that moment placed in my pocket—I refused to do so—he then took me towards Mrs. Ingold, and begged she would pay the balance—shortly after that I left the house, and within half a minute, the prisoner came after me, running or walking very fast—he caught my arm, and said, "Brothers, save me"—I said, "You know my disposition, I do not wish to hurt any man, bet I have a duty to perform to Messrs. Goding, I cannot save you; but if I can point out any way in which you can save yourself, I will do it"—I stated a case which occurred twenty-two years ago, when a man had become a defaulter, who was in Mr. Goding's employ. and Mr. Goding had given him three days to state his deficiencies, but he had refused, and was given into custody; and I told the prisoner, that if he would give the account, I had no doubt but that Mr. Goding would not prosecute him—he took my arm, and we went to the brew-house—I said, "You are so agitated, you cannot write, I will do it, tell me all about it"—I asked him to what amount he had kept back money—he said, "Under 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said, "The sum is small, that perhaps is a your favour; how many customers are you deficient in?" he said five, he said five, but when we got to the counting-house I could only make out four—he said he thought there was five, but he could not recollect any more—since then it has been discovered that there is another, but the amount is certainly less than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "—I made out the list and handed it to Mr. Goding, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

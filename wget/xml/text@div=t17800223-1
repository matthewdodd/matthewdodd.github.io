The prisoner came into my shop on the 16th of December to enquire after a pair of shoes which she had before bespoke. I happened to step up stairs upon some business, and upon my return I perceived that a pair of leather pumps which hung upon some hooks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230003"></xptr>in my shop to dry were missing; I followed her out of the shop and asked her if she had not taken the pumps; she said, how could I think any such thing as that? and she wished God Almighty might strike her dead if she had any such thing. I took her back to the shop, and said I would send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time miss any thing besides these pumps? - Not at that time; I had missed a great number of shoes before that. When I threatened to send for a constable, the prisoner took the pumps out of her pocket and begged I would forgive her; I told her she had robbed me of a great quantity of goods, and I was determined to punish her. Then she confessed that she had pawned in Oxford-street, two pair of men's shoes which she had stolen from me. She likewise confessed selling two pair of shoes and two odd ones; the fellows to which odd shoes a woman purchased of me afterwards. The next morning the officer and I went and searched the prisoner's lodging; I found a shoe upon the foot of the prisoner's sister.</p>

               <p>I keep a clothes shop at Knightsbridge. The prisoner brought a pair of shoes and two odd shoes to my shop, and asked me to buy them; I scrupled buying them on account of two of the shoes being odd ones.</p>
               <p>Did not you enquire from that circumstance how she came by them? - Yes; she said her father was ill in the hospital, and starving for want of necessaries; that he had taken a shop at Kensington Gravel-pits, and that the two odd ones were fellows to two shoes her father had sold in mistake; and as soon as her father got better she said he should make two shoes to match them. I gave her 4 s. for the four shoes.</p>
               <p>What is the fair value of those shoes? - I cannot tell. I sell a great many shoes and odd kind of things old and new.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. What is the value of the shoes? - One pair seven shillings, and the other, to the best of my remembrance, seven shillings and sixpence; they were bespoke work. This woman has four small children, and therefore I did not prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Court to Reynolds. I hope you have not many such dealings as these? - I never bought any such before.</p>
               <p>Court. If there were not such people as you there would be fewer thieves.</p>
               <p>Have you the shoes here which you purchased of the prisoner? - There are the two odd shoes (producing them) I had of the prisoner; I sold the pair of shoes for four shillings.</p>

               <p>FRANCES SMITH. I live in Lower-street, Islington, and am single.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. I am told there was a croud of people looking for something? A. No such thing; they did not accuse me of having their money when they hustled me - they said nothing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the prisoners sober? A. They were both sober; after they had stolen the property, they complained of losing a small purse with 2l. in it.</p>

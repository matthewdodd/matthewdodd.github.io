            . I am an officer. On the 22d of December, about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner passed me in the Strand, behind the new church - I asked what he had got in his apron; he said lead, which he was going to take home to his employers, who lived in Cornwall-road, on the other side of the water - I took him to a public-house, and sent an officer to his master; he then said he must go into the yard - I suspected something, put my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100086"></xptr>hands on his side, and felt two more small pieces of lead were on each side; here is 52 lbs. altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Which way was he going? A. Towards Fleet-street; he should have gone over Waterloo-bridge, which would save a mile and a half; he said he came from St. James'-park.</p>

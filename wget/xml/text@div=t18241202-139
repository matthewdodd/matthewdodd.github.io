On the 16th of November, between eight and nine o'clock, I was standing behind the counter, and a woman came in with some meat in a cloth. I served her a pennyworth of twine - the prisoner came in and spoke to her, and then turned out immediately - shortly afterwards, the other two witnesses brought him back. I examined the hams, but cannot say whether there was one short or no. I cannot be positive as to this, as we have so many.</p>

I then went after him, and overtook him within about one hundred yards. I asked where the ham was - he said, he had not had one - he had none got it then. I had not lost sight of him.</p>

I saw him with a ham in his hand, before we came up to him - he took it from under his coat twice, and returned it - when we took him, I found it lying about a yard behind him - he might have dropped it without our seeing him.</p>

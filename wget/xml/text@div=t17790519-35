               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, by sight. The first time I ever saw her to my knowledge was last Tuesday night at eleven o'clock, I saw her in Carey-street, at the corner of Bell-yard. I was going home from Harley-street; crossing Carey-street, from Lincoln's-Inn to <placeName id="t17790519-35-crimeloc196">Bell-yard</placeName>

I followed her, and begged her to return my money.</p>
               <p>How far had she gone? - About thirty yards; I believe she returned me a guinea and eight shillings; I told her that was not all the money she had taken from me; she said it was. It was not light enough there to see; I said I will take you to some house to see; we went to a publick-house, which I think is the Punch-bowl, at the top of Ship-yard.</p>
               <p>Did she go willingly with you? - Yes; she desired I would go with her. I told her she had two guineas and a shilling, which was the money I missed. I said if she would return that I would let her go; else I would take her to the watch-house. She desired I would take her to the watch-house. I took her to Bell-yard, where the watchman was crying the hour of eleven. She called the watchman herself, and went to the watch-house with him; at the watch-house she was searched by the constable of the night but no money was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - Yes; I suppose I had not drank half a pint of wine after dinner.</p>
               <p>Had you drank any thing else? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know that you had exactly this money in your pocket? - I had three guineas and a half, the half guinea I had changed and paid eighteen pence out of it. I had paid away no more.</p>
               <p>When had you felt the three guineas and a half in your pocket? - About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was you with her? - About two minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you seen her before? - No; not to my knowledge never before.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a livery-servant to Mr. Hoare the banker? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>You describe yourself as not having drank above half a pint of wine that day, are you sure that is the extent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you drank other liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Which was it you or the prisoner that accosted one another first in the street? - The prisoner did me.</p>
               <p>You have told us you found her hand in your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which pocket? - My right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>What did you say to her when you found her hand in your pocket? - She was run away. I went after her. She was got about thirty yards from me. It was by Mr. Serjeant Davy's door. She was got into Carey street.</p>
               <p>She readily went with you to the Punch-bowl? - I think it was the sign of the Punch-bowl.</p>
               <p>Did you challenge her with having any more of your money? - Yes; two guineas and a shilling. She said she had none.</p>
               <p>Did she give you the money at the Punch-bowl? - No; I said if she did not give me the money I would take her to the watch-house, and then she called the watchman.</p>
               <p>When you brought her to the watch-house did you find your money? - No.</p>
               <p>You was in company with her from the moment you charged her with it till you got to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190048"></xptr>Was she fully searched? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not you in the watch-house? - Yes; but there are two rooms; she was taken into the inner room.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark upon any of the money by which you could swear to it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. When you overtook her, and she gave you the money, did she take it out of her pocket, or was it then in her hand? - I think it was in her hand.</p>
               <p>Did she say, when she returned you the money, that she had taken that money from you? - No; she said there it is.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Did she tell you that was all she had got? - I cannot recollect; she said afterwards she had no more money.</p>

He said that was two guineas and one shilling short. The beadle and I searched the prisoner. She had no money upon her. We searched her pockets, made her loose her stays, and shook her, and pulled her shoes and stockings off.</p>

               <p>Do you think she was so fully and fairly searched, that she could not have any money about her without its being found? - It was impossible she could have any money about her.</p>

               <p>I was coming across Carey-street; that gentleman accosted me in an abrupt manner, and wanted me to go with him. I would not. He then said I had picked his pocket. I told him he was mistaken. He insisted on my going to the watch-house. Finding they were going to keep me all night, I said I would give them all the money I had, and put a guinea and eight shillings down on the table; that was my own property. He said he wanted two guineas more. I never saw him before in my life. I said I was willing to go any where. I did not like to be used ill in the street, and went to the watch-house with him.</p>

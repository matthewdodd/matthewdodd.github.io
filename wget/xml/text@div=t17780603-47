The man paid two shilling and threepence per week for the lodging, which was one room, ready furnished; I went up stairs; I asked for the sheets; turning up the bed, I found there were no sheets upon it; the prisoner said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030026"></xptr> had given them to wash; I said, if so, you have a pair of clean sheets in lieu of them, for it is my custom for my washerwoman to give a clean pair in lieu of dirty ones; at the same time she owned she had pawned them; then I looked about, and missed the rest of the things; I did not make her any promise; she owned she had pawned them all. I have got none of my things again, but the copper pot.</p>

Hall and Beck's, Piccadilly, where I had been nearly fourteen years—I was under the care of Mr. Alexander, the oculist, and was obliged to part with every thing for my support—on the afternoon in question, Mr. Alexander informed me the sight of one eye was entirely lost, and nothing but the greatest care would restore the other—being in a state of destitution, and fearing I should never get my living, I adopted this course, to be in prison for the remainder of my life, in order to be supported—I have friends well off, but they are not in England—my real-name is Charles Budlow.</p>

On Saturday, the 13th of September, I was working for Mr. Thomson, a plumber and glazier. I went down the Edgware-road about eleven o'clock. I had been settling with my master, and had 13 s. 6 d. or 14 s. in an old pocket, which I used as a purse. I had been to a public-house, but drank nothing but a pint of ale; and when I was near the Hop-pole public-house, the prisoners met me, went by, and passed me again, then turned back. and met me again; I am certain of their persons. One of them hit me a violent blow with his fist, and knocked me down; the other knelt on my stomach, and held my hands down. I could not call for assistance, for they stopped my mouth. Elgar turned my pocket inside out, and took all my money, which was half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. Elgar said,</p>
               <p>"Now let us take the fellow by his heels, and drag him down to the Cut, and chuck him in, for then he cannot come to appear against us." The other said,</p>
               <p>"No; let him alone, he has had enough of it." Elgar said,</p>
               <p>"If you offer to cry out, or offer to make the least resistance, you b - r, we will kill you;" and then said he would drag me down to the Cut. Bardon then said,</p>
               <p>"No; let him lay where he is, he has had enough of it, we have got his money, that is all we want." They then left me. I was not able to get up immediately, but did as soon as I was able, then went home, went to bed, got up early on Sunday morning on purpose to look for them. I went to and fro in the Edgware road, where I met the watchman. I went by the King's Arms public-house, and there saw them both sitting drinking. Nobody pointed them out. I only saw them at the window, which was open, as I passed. I knew them directly, and told the watchman those were the people. They did not see me looking at them, they were busy talking and drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, recollect that they are on trial for their lives - are you quite certain of them - A. I am perfectly well satisfied that they are the men. I have not recovered my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time of night was this - A. About eleven o'clock, or rather later; there are watchman on the road. I told a watchman of it the same night, immediately I could see one. I swear that I was not in the least the worse for liquor. I never said I only lost 4 s. 6 d., or that the other man knocked me down. I had been drinking at the Union, public-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100050"></xptr>Oxford-street. I told the watchman I could not think of the name of the public-house that night, but next morning I recollected it. I live in Wood's-mews, Grosvenor-square, and work for gentlemen's coachmen, in the stables - I had been working that day for a plumber, named Thompson, in Dorset-street, Baker-street, and had worked three days for him - he paid me 2 s. 6 d. a day; he paid me at his own house about seven o'clock. I had been doing nothing particular afterwards, except getting refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in the Edgware-road - A. I was walking down there - it is not in my way home; it was rather a light night. I was taking a walk; I think it was moon-light, but cannot say. I did not know the prisoners before - I saw their faces by the light of the lamps; it was on the side of the road, and nearly under the lamp; it was an oil lamp, and a fine night. The watchman who I first told of it is here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What made you go down the Edgware-road - A. Merely for a walk. I was a quarter of a mile from home when at the public-house - Edgware-road is not above a quarter of a mile out of the way. The watchman I spoke to overnight is the same I spoke to in the morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the Edgware-road, and was so on the night of the robbery - I think the moon went down about twelve o'clock - it had been shining that night; this robbery was not on my beat. I did not see the prosecutor till a quarter past five o'clock in the morning; nobody complained to me of being robbed before that. There is a watch-box adjoining the Hop-pole; he complained to me about being robbed in the morning; his face was all over blood, which was dry, as if it had happened some time before, and his clothes spotted with blood, from top to bottom - he said he came to watch for them, and afterwards came and said he saw them. I got Carpenter's assistance - we all three went and took the prisoners in the house. He charged them with the robbery in their presence - they said nothing in the public-house, but on the road to the watch-house, before we got to Tyburn-gate, they both denied the charge. I cannot say whether there is a lamp where he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At eleven o'clock all the watchmen were on duty - A. Of course. I did not see the spot where he says he was robbed - he said it was near the Hop-pole.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been two persons scuffling and attacking another, and talking about murdering him, must it not be heard - A. He told me one clapped his hand over his mouth; he told me of their threatening to drag him to the Canal if he made any alarm. The road is very wide. One Brewer was the watchman of that beat, and is so still. I heard nothing from him of any robbery - no other watchman told me he had heard anything of it - he said he had lost his purse and money. I believe he mentioned 4 s. 6 d. at the watch-house, but it might be 14 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do the watchmen go their rounds, or are they always in their boxes - A. They go round; Edgware-road may be three quarters of a mile out of the prosecutor's way home.</p>
               <p>The prisoners denied the charge.</p>

Thorn's face was very bloody, he was cut over the eye very much, and his clothes were bloody - he charged the prisoners with the robbery. They made no reply, but went quietly away; but as they went down the road, they said they had not robbed the man, he was telling a very great falsity - they had not robbed him, or ill-treated him, and had not the money. They said they were at the Devonshire Arms, at eleven and at twelve o'clock, and could not be in the place he said; I did not ask where they had slept.

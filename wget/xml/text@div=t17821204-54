               <p>It is usual for us apprentices to go home every Saturday night; three or four Sundays before when I was shifting myself, I found some vermin, and I thought it must come from the bed, as we have not had a clean pair of sheets since last July; I was determined to look at the sheets and blankets, I did, and found some vermin on them; I was going to carry the blanket to the scowerers, because if I had asked my master, he would not have had it cleaned: my master stopped me at the bottom of the stairs, I was going into the privy to ease myself; I laid down the blanket, and they sent for an officer, and sent me to the Compter: my friends were here yesterday.</p>

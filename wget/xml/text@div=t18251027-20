The prisoner came to our auction room, and looked at some books; I said they were sold; he put them down, and went into the other room; in a few minutes a lad came and said he had got something in his umbrella; I said "What have you got that does not belong to you?" he said "Nothing." I found these two books in his umbrella - they had been sold about twenty minutes before, and placed in the back room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there any other books with them? A. Yes; several lots, but none loose; there were some drawing and mathematical instruments: it is not a rule not to touch books after twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner and produce the books, which the prosecutor said he had taken from him, and he had got them from the auction-room: he seemed much agitated, and begged to see Mr. Machin, and to explain something to him in the hope that he would forgive him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, stated that he had put the books inside his umbrella, it being a rule not to examined lots after twelve o'clock, intending to look at them with a view of purchasing them.</p>
               <p>JURY to WINSTANLEY. Q. Were the books down in the umbrella? A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

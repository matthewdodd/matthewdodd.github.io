                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>). I am 16 years old—in July last I went into the service of Messrs. Morgan, wholesale stationers, of Cannon Street—at that time I knew a lad named Johnson—he introduced me to Eggmore in November, and I went with him to Eggmore's several times—in consequence of a communication Johnson made to me, I went and saw Eggmore, who said to me "Where do you come from, and where do you get the paper"—I told him I worked at a wholesale stationer's, and got it from them, but I did not name them at that time—I had sent paper to Eggmore through Johnson—Eggmore asked me if I could get different sorts of paper, and I said yes—he knew that I stole it—I told him I took it—he told me if I could get the paper to bring it to him after dark, or he would send one of his boys with a barrow to fetch it—I said I would see about it—I then told Johnson, who was waiting for me outside—after that Johnson waited outside my master's warehouse, and I took out some paper to him, and he went away—I did not go with him—I afterwards went with him to Eggmore's with some paper—I was taking paper to Eggmore's about twice a week for six weeks—his place is a cellar in Bell Alley—it is a waste paper shop—I went into the cellar with paper, but not often—Johnson went down at other times—Eggmore never weighed the paper in my presence—I took him 20 reams in the six weeks, and Johnson and I received about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between us—the last time I took paper from my master's to Eggmore's, was Friday, 28th November—I then took away five reams—I believe it was marked "C. M."—it was done up in a wrapper—Johnson chucked it down into the cellar, Eggmore was not there at the time; but when he came I told him I had brought the paper, and he said, "All right, I can't pay you now; I will give you a few shillings in advance," and he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me to call for the rest to-morrow, and told me not to bring any more, as he was going to give up business—I went next day, and he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the five reams—a boy named French was employed there—he introduced me to Mr. King, who carries on business at London Wall, where I was taken in custody—that was after Eggmore's business had been closed—Eggmore had given me instructions that when I brought the paper I was to keep a good look out and chuck it down the cellar—I took waste paper and good paper together to Eggmore's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I commenced robbing my master about November last—sold no paper till I sold it to Eggmore—Johnson was outside when I had the first interview with Eggmore, but he had gone in before I did—that was not on the same day but about three days before—I had paper with me outside when Johnson went in—Eggmore knew that I came as a friend of Johnson's—Johnson had told Eggmore that I was his cousin, and that I was taking the paper from a printer's—I told Eggmore, in direct terms, that I stole the paper from Messrs. Morgan's, that I took it from the warehouse down stairs; he said that if I preferred he would send the boy with a barrow for the paper, and Johnson could take it to his aunt's house, and the barrow could be sent there, only I was to let him know if I had got the paper out of the shop—either Johnson or I were to call for the barrow—after that I</p>

               <p>told Johnson, and he said that if I got the paper he would take it to his aunt's—what they call "waste "was the the outsides, and the other was good paper—the paper was conveyed to Eggmore's the same as it was when it was in the warehouse, but the waste was brought in a bag—the good paper and the bad were sent separately, they were taken separately—I used to take the reams of paper as they were done up—the "outsides" were tied up, and there was nothing over them, they were in a bundle—I put them in a bag to take them to Eggmore's—Eggmore did not say any<lb></lb>thing about the price, but Johnson said that he would give 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per 1b, for the "outsides"—waste paper shops pay 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per lb, for old rubbish, according to what kind of waste paper it is—the waste paper I took would be about 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—when Johnson said he could get 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I asked him if he could not get 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he said "No"—I am sure I was to be paid by the pound for the waste paper, but I never saw it weighed—T took whatever Eggmore gave me—November 20th was the last time I went to Eggmore's, he then told me not to bring any more paper as he was going to give up business—Johnson then said "I will get some of that note paper sold for you"—I said "Where?"—he said "At King's"—and he and French said that if I refused to bring more, they would split upon me—I only robbed my master of three bundles after Eggmore was out of business, it was put an end to only by my being arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I took about sixteen reams of good paper to Eggmore's—the "outsides "were done up in bundles, not in reams—I have heard in the shop that they were worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per pound—Eggmore did not tell me what the paper weighed, but Johnson has said that it came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I could tell from the money Eggmore gave me at what rate it was, and it was not 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb, sometimes.</p>

                  </hi>'. I have known Aldridge about twelve months—I went to him at Messrs.

"There is a paper place in Leatherseller's Buildings, and very likely they will buy it there—that is in Bell Alley—I went there, and it was Eggmore's—I went in and told Eggmore that I got the paper from my mother, who was housekeeper at some offices—that was a lie—I gave him my address in Spitalfields—he bought the paper, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards saw Aldridge, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards went again, and got more paper—Aldridge gave it to me in London Wall—it was the same sort of note paper—I took it to Eggmore's, and he gave me, I think, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I don't know what month that was, but it was about six weeks ago—I do not know what month this is, but I think it is January—the year is</p>

               <p>1874—I don't know what last month was—I cannot read—Aldridge went with mo the second time, and waited outside—I went in, and said "I have brought some more paper"—Eggmore said "Is it from the same place?"—I said "Yes"—I went back with Aldridge to the prosecutor's, and he brought out some more paper in the afternoon—I went to Eggmore's with that; Aldridge went with me—we took it down in a parcel, not on a truck—it was the same sort of paper—I went in and told Eggmore I had brought some more paper, and he bought it for 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—both then and at other times. I gave Aldridge part of the money—I took more paper after that—I went to Eggmore's about seven or eight times, and I got about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., altogether—I went about once in every two or three days, but sometimes I had to go two or three times for the money, because Eggmore was not in—I did not go more than once in one day—I took about twenty reams of paper altogether—on Friday, 28th November, I took two reams of paper, and we both took it to Eggmore's—we started with a truck with twelve reams on it from Morgan's, and two reams were delivered at Eggmore's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not been in the paper trade—I know what a ream of paper is, it is a ream when it is tied up—he declined to buy any paper of me until he asked me who I was and where it came from—it was upon that that I invented the story that my mother was a housekeeper, and gave the address, which he wrote down, and he bought the paper then, but there was no talk about the rate of payment—he bought it by the pound, and I always saw it weighed when I took it down, but I did not understand it—after ho weighed it, he handed me so much money for it—Aldridge and I very seldom went to Eggmore's together, not more than once—when I did not take it there he did—I know that, because I was with him, and waited outside Eggmore's door—the paper was quite as many times in a bag as in a truck—when he had parcels to take to other places, ho put it on the truck in a brown paper parcel, and at other times it was in a bag—I gave my mother's correct address—I live in Steward Street, Spitalfields—my mother did not get the paper as housekeeper—I told Eggmore that Aldridge was a printer's boy, that the printer had given up business, and that this was paper which was about the place after that—Aldridge told me that it was paper which was brought down from up stairs, which was of no use—it is not a fact that I introduced Aldridge to Eggmore, he told me to go there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The last parcel I bought was three bundles similar to this—good waste paper outsides, such as a housekeeper would get, would be worth 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb, if it was dirty, and only fit for waste paper—I never bought paper like this, all of one kind, of Aldridge—after November 28th they brought me a mixture of different kinds and sizes, some torn and some dirty—that would be called waste—I should consider everything waste unless it was reams, and all of one kind, and should give 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb, for it—the boys brought me this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of 3, Bishopsgate Street—Eggmore has sold paper to me, two lots in October, and I think one in November—there were four lots altogether—I see the paper here, this in wrappers is the first lot I bought—that was on October 13th—the other lots were on 29th October, and 18th and 25th November—I gave 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb, for the first lot, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt, for the second, 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb, for the third, 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt, for the last, and I think I bought a little at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was a little under the market value, and I wanted to know where he bought it—he came in with a catalogue, and said he had bought it at a sale—that was on 13th October.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We call this outsides post in the trade—I gave him 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a 1b, for it, the full value being about 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the highest price I gave him for any paper—the other was miscellaneous, what would be termed outside quires—waste paper is worse than that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Morgan, wholesale stationers, of 58, Cannon Street—Aldridge was in their employ as porter and errand boy, from August till he was taken in custody—I missed 30 reams of paper in October or November, besides what we term outsides—we don't call outsides waste paper—I identify this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it has never been sold—some of it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb, to us, and some 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was not possible for such paper to be sold at 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—old newspapers sell at 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb., but this is not printed on.</p>

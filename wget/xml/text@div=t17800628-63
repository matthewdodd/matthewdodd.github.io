They were lost that evening or the next morning, I cannot be positive which; I took them out of the warehouse and put them into the boiling-house, in the corner; I saw them there about seven o'clock in the evening. I was not in the boiling-house afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any body in the boiling-house when you went away? - No. I locked it up about ten o'clock. I went in the morning between six and seven o'clock; I unlocked the door myself; when I opened the door I did not observe whether they were there or not; but about nine o'clock my fellow-servant,

               <p>Was she at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the other prisoner there? - She was not at that time. The broker was the seller of the fins; he said he would sell them at two shillings a pound, and I gave the young woman earnest. She said she had got a few fins to sell and had employed the broker to sell them for her; I was to go for them the next day.</p>
               <p>Did you see the fins? - Yes. They pulled them out, and I looked at them, some were under the bed and some in the closet. The broker called on me in the morning, and I went with him and took Champion with me. We got there about half after nine. I said we could not weigh them there I wished they would go with them to my master's house; they said they would not do that, but they said if I would give them a guinea they would go with me and see them weighed, and have the rest of the money when I came home.

               <p>Before she said that tell me what you said to her? - I told her we had lost these fins out of the boiling-house, and if she would confess how she came by them we would hurt her as little as we could.

               <p>When you came to Mr. Miller's who was there? - Isaacs, the broker, Crow, and I. Mr. Miller was not at home. We sent for him to ask how we should proceed with them.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to Mr. Miller's? - Because Mr. Swinscoe was not at home; he was on a journey; we thought that the properest place to go with them.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Miller come home? - No; he could not be found. There came another gentleman of the trade, Mr. Sawrey, he advised us to stop the things and let the parties go.</p>
               <p>Was that said in the presence of Isaacs? - No; she did not hear that, the things were weighed. We got them there and it was agreed to pay them the money.</p>
               <p>What did they weigh? - 54 lb.</p>
               <p>Was Isaacs told whose property they were, and asked how she came by them? - Not till we spoke to this gentleman. I went and got a constable and charged him with Isaacs. When the constable had got her in possession we told her they were stolen goods, and were Mr. Swinscoe's property.</p>
               <p>Who told her so? - I myself told her so.</p>

               <p>How long had you been at Isaacs' in the morning before you proposed going to your master's house? - An hour or more; then we proposed to bring them home; we did not mention my master's house; we thought we thought it not proper as he was not at home, and therefore we went to Mr. Miller's.</p>
               <p>Did you first go to your master's house? - Not into it, we went by it and went to Mr. Miller's.</p>
               <p>Then it was not in truth at home, but at Mr. Miller's, that you weighed them. Did Mr. Miller come there? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>What was said when the constable came in? - I cannot recollect; the person I suppose who fetched him told him what it was about.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a coal shed in Bow-lane; I am a constable. In the begining of June last I was sent for, to No. 74, in Watling-street, to take charge of the prisoner; I went along with a man.</p>
               <p>Do you know to whose house you went? - I do not know the gentleman's name, though I live so near.</p>
               <p>Was it Mr. Swinscoe's? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it Mr. Miller's? - I cannot say; Champion came to me and said I must go with him; that they had stopped a man and woman with some whale fins. I went with Champion, and Champion gave me charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How long had you been there before you was charged with the prisoners? - Directly as I came in.</p>
               <p>What time in the day was it? - About three or four in the afternoon I believe, but I cannot be positive; I was at work; I had had my dinner. Isaacs said the goods were brought to her house.</p>
               <p>Do you know Crow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was there when you came? - He was in the warehouse at the back of the house; the prisoners were in the front shop.</p>
               <p>ISAACS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have no counsel; I leave myself to the mercy of the court; I appointed my witnesses<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280152"></xptr> to come on Monday; I did not think I should be tried till Monday.</p>
               <p>(Levi was not put on her defence.)</p>

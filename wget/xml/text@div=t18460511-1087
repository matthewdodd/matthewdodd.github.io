                  </hi>. I am single, and am a tobacconist, at No. 7, Sidney-street, City-road—my sister lives with me—on Friday the 27th of March the pri<lb></lb>soner came for half an ounce of common tobacco—it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me a shilling—I gave him change, and he took it away with the tobacco—I placed the shilling on a ledge over the till, where there was no other money—I looked at it again very soon, but I did not ascertain it was bad—I took it up in the course of an hour—I had not mixed it with any other money—I thought it looked peculiar, and I placed a mark on it—I then put it on the mantel-piece in the parlour—the next morning I took it in mistake for another, to go to a shop to purchase a trifling article—I then found it was bad—I looked at it and found it was the same shilling I had marked—I took it back, placed it in a vase, and it remained there till Saturday night, when I marked it again and gave it to Garling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of Emma Fossett. On the evening of the 27th of March I saw the prisoner in the shop—I sat in the parlour—the minute he had gone out of the shop I went in and saw a bad shilling on the ledge over the till—it was laid aside by itself—I tried it with my teeth and found it was bad—I bit it in such a way that I should know it again—I am quite certain he is the person—on the 31st of March between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he came into the shop again—I was sitting in the parlour—I went into the shop to serve him, he asked for half an ounce of the best tobacco—he gave me a bad shilling—my sister came into the shop and told me there was change wanting—I went out to fetch a policeman—that had been settled between us—I kept the shilling in my hand—I gave it to the policeman when he returned with me to the shop, in ten minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

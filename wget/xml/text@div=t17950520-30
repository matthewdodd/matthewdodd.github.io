             got into bed first; before I got to lay down in bed, I took and put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out a guinea and some silver to shew it the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it the landlord? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to shew it the landlord? - Because he should see that I had such money in my pocket,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect the prisoner? - No, I did not suspect him at all. I took it out when I paid for the half pint of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - No purpose at all.</p>
               <p>Q.Either you suspected the prisoner, or you had a foreknowledge of what would happen? - No such a thing; I had no reason at all for shewing him. When I paid for the gin I shewed him the money in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for the lodging? - I paid nothing at all for my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he to charge you any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you when you went to bed? - I took and put the money again into my pocket, and took hold of the pillow in my right hand, and laid my breeches under my pillow. In the morning I went to get up, and I found my breeches were moved from where I put them, part of them drawed out from under the pillow, and I searched my pockets, and I found my guines and some silver, as I thought, gone. I was not exact as to the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it gone before you put your breeches on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you shew your landlord the over night? - I did not count the money at all, no otherwise, than I know there were some silver; I believe I had a guinea, and about eight or nine shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a guinea and twelve shil<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200096"></xptr>lings? - No, it was not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - I was not in liquor, I was sensible what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many drams had you that day? - That I cannot tell, not many.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you guess at it? - Not many. I was steady. I know what I did, I was not out of my senses. I had been drinking great part of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you begin? - In the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it you took this last dram? - Eleven almost at night. When I came down stairs, I told the landlord that I lost such and such money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your money again? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You are the landlord of this house? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place was Smith sober? - He was a little disguised, but he was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not dead drunk? - He was not. The man was drinking a little to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. But he was sensible to call for more gin at your house. Was the other man sober? - Yes, solid sober. I lighted them to bed, and I left one candle in the room for the half pint of gin with the other, and when I came up I handed them a glass of gin a piece, and drank one myself; Smith had got his breeches off, and he got into bed, and he pulls out his money, and turns over a guinea and some silver, which he had in his hand. He took all his money out of his pocket to pay me the half pint, one sixpence, and he put it all into his pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not offer it to you to keep for him at all? - Not at all. When they were both in the room, I see Smith take his breeches, and put them under the bolster and gets into bed himself; in three or four minutes Carter gets into bed likewise by the side of him, I staid to see them both in bed. Then I took the candle and wished them good night, and went to bed to my wife immediately. In the morning I got up at five, according as I do the year round; Smith got up and came down, having missed this guinea, and he was asking me if I know any thing about it; while he was asking me, the prisoner came down directly. I said to Carter, do you know any thing of Smith's guinea? and he says, no; and knowing myself there was no other person in the room, I could think nobody else had got the guine but Carter; accordingly Carter still denied. I thought the best way was to get the constable, and take charge of Carter, and take him before a magistrate. The constable came up, and we gave him charge, Smith and me together, and we persuaded him always to produce the money. We taxes him to Queen's-square, Westminster, and he was committed for prison, and after that he owned where the money was, that was after he got his mittimus to go to prison.</p>

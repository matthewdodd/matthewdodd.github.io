                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live in Bridge-place, Ship-lane, Hammersmith. The prisoner and I have been living together for some time—on the 15th of Sept. she had not been home all night—about half-past eleven o'clock, that night, I was in the house, and heard a crash of glass—I looked at the window, and found the prisoner's hand coming through the squares of glass as quick as possible—I went out and tried to prevent her—I tried to push her away, but she ran away before I could do so—she said she had got my master in her hand, and she would stick it through my b----heart—she then struck me on the left hand, as I supposed, with a knife, as the effect was a violent wound—she kept striking at me—it was dark, and could not see the knife in her hand—she struck my hand several times, once right athwart the wrist—in struggling we both fell on the ground to<lb></lb>gether—we pushed one another, I think—as I was endeavouring to get up, she struck at me underneath the throat—it cut me very much—it bled very fast—I also received one wound on my right hand after I got up—she then ran away after a policeman—I did not strike her at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bridge-place, Ship-lane, Hammersmith. On Thursday night, the 14th of Sept., between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a smash of glass—on looking out, I saw the prosecutor standing at the door of his house, and the prisoner standing close by, using very abusive lan<lb></lb>guage—she said she had something that would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for him, she would run it through his heart—he came out, and she struck at him several times—he did nothing to her before that—I saw something in her hand at the time she struck him—I do not know what it was—a scuffle ensued between them—they both fell on the ground—I was standing outside my door at that time—I came down stairs, into the street—I observed Taylor's left hand bleeding very much, and the left side of his throat—I did not see her hand at all then—Taylor went in-doors to wash himself—I never saw the prisoner again till she entered the house with a policeman—I cannot say whether she was drunk or sober—he appeared rather in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hammersmith. About half-past two o'clock on the morning of the 15th, Taylor was brought to my house—I found two wounds on his left hand—they appeared to have been inflicted by a sharp instrument, like the knife produced—there was one wound across the wrist in a transverse direction, about an inch long, or a little more, not very deep, going through the skin—the other extended from the knuckle upwards, about three inches—it was deeper than the other wound—it had gone down to the muscles through the integuments and cellular membrane—I observed a wound on the left side of the neck, about an inch and a half long, not very deep—it might have been inflicted with such an instrument as this—I did not consider any of them dangerous.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Ship public-house, which is about sixteen or twenty yards from Bridge-place. I know the prisoner and prosecutor—on Thursday evening, the 15th, a little after ten o'clock, the prosecutor came to my house with a young woman, and remained there with her till about twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock—the prisoner was in the tap-room eating her supper when he came in—she had been in the habit, since she left the prisoner, of coming there sometimes—she was staying next door—she had brought home a dress for Mrs. Bolton that evening—I do not believe the prosecutor saw her when he came in—he and the young woman had some gin and water to drink—the prisoner said she would see him as he was there—I thought they were man and wife—I had told her he was there, and not to have a bother, but she would go in front of the bar, and called for a quartern of gin and cloves between three of them—there were two young men who lodged in my house having their supper—they work on the new sus<lb></lb>pension bridge—after she did that, she sat down by the side of the prosecutor and the other young woman—there was one man between the prosecutor and prisoner—she had a little cigar in her hand—the prosecutor saw it and said, "Now put that down, or else there will be a hell of a row," or something of that—she said she would not, several times—he got up to lay hold of her, I suppose to take it away, and she directly struck him, and told him to get away, he had nothing to do with her—this was about a quarter before eleven o'clock—they then got to fighting in front of the bar—I ran and stopped them, and took the prosecutor away into the passage, and would not let him go near her for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—after that he got away from me and ran round to the other side of the bar to get at her—I pulled the prisoner out at the other door, and did not let them meet again there—I laid hold of the prosecutor and told him he should not go near her any more to have that disturbance in the house—he begged me to let him go in</p>

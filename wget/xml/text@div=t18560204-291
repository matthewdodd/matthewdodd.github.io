ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your attention further directed to it after you got into the vestry, until Dr. Vaughan gave it you, and told you to put it on the file? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was not—I do not know whether the doctor took up the rough book or not, he made the entry—when we got in Malby might have said there was a funeral out of the district, or something of the kind, but I did not hear exactly—I do not know whether he did say so or not, but of course Dr. Vaughan must have known it was out of the district by the money that was paid—I remember Dr. Vaughan asking me whether I had allowed half a crown for the pew opener, and I told him I had—it is no good my saying I do remember anything that was said when we first got into the vestry, for I do not remember—I cannot remember who began the conversation, who took part in it, or anything that was said—I remember the certificate being given to me—I do not know that anybody mentioned anything about Acre-lane—I do not remember whether Malby mentioned Acre-lane—I do not think Malby mentioned Acre-lane, as the place from which the funeral had come—I will not swear anything—I did not notice at the time what the doctor wrote in the rough book—I mentioned it, per<lb></lb>haps, about a month or so afterwards, to Mr. Eastman, one Sunday after<lb></lb>noon; I mentioned that it was put down "Acre-lane"—I looked in the book and saw it on that Sunday afternoon—I looked in the book because I found there were two or three funerals out of the district, and I had only received my single fees for it instead of double; so I taxed Malby with it, and he did not give me any answer, and I looked at the book to see what was put down to the churchwardens, and so I found out what was in it—that was when the doctor was in France; it was after Mrs. Harrison, and her son in law, Mr. Meynell, had come to complain of having been charged double fees, or that there had been an incorrect entry made—I was not pre<lb></lb>sent when Malby begged them to take back the difference, but I heard of it—it was not after I heard of that that I went and looked at the book; I think it was previous to that—it was their coming to make the complaint that first caused the inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you looked at the book before or after; which, because you have said both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Looked at the book, what for, Sir!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I did not say a word about what for, I asked you whether you had looked at this rough book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh! I had looked at it a good many times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But looked at it with reference to these out district funerals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I looked at it a good many times after Mrs. Harrison came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it after Mrs. Harrison came that you went to look at the book, with reference to these entries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I do not know—I have looked at the book a good many times—I have seen the book both before and after Mrs. Harrison came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray did the book always lie open on the vestry table? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it did, where the churchwardens or anybody else could look at it—Malby and I had a running account for fees—we never settled them at a public house—it has gone on for longer than a month—the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which the Doctor said the pew opener was to have, was for the out district</p>

               <p>funerals, that was not to come off my fees, it was an extra thing, the parties had to pay it themselves—I paid it and charged it to them—I got double fees for out district funerals, when they were my own funerals, and when I could not be deceived by it—I do not know as Malby ever acted dishonestly with me, if he did with any one else—the fees were always paid to Malby as far as I know—it would be Malby's business to hand over to me the fees that were due to me, and I looked to him for the money—I kept a sort of running account with him, he never used to pay me after the funeral was over—I did not know at that time that the churchwardens were objecting to having so many funerals from the outlying districts—I will swear I never posted one of the handbills that you put into my hand—I posted some on a Sunday, but not of that kind—I went about in a cart posting them—I received orders from the churchwardens to post the bills, from Mr. Eastman—the first bills that were posted were left—no—the bills were left at my house, and I had to go to Mr. Eastman's the next morning to receive direc<lb></lb>tions where to post them, Mr. Edwards was there at the time—I did not receive instructions from Mr. Eastman to go and poet these bills on a Sun<lb></lb>day, but when I found that the bills were pulled down on a Saturday night, I thought I had better put them up the next morning, which I did; so I went about on the Sunday morning posting them up again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR; SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the bill you posted (<hi rend="italic">handing one to the witness</hi>)? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is one of them, that was the first bill I posted; (<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>) this is one that I posted—I think I posted altogether three lots, or it might have been four—I do not know whether that might have been the second or not, at all events I posted that one—the bills I posted announced a public meeting of the inhabitants—that was the object of the bills—(<hi rend="italic">These bills being read, announced that meetings were to be held on 20th Sept., and 22nd Oct., respectively</hi>)—meetings took place upon these, and a committee was appointed—I believe I know who the members of the committee were—they were some of the most respectable inhabitants of the district—one of the committee was Mr. Evans, a friend of the incumbent—I was present at all of the meetings—Dr. Vaughan sanctioned my officiating as clerk after my father's death—he removed me on 6th Sept, 1855.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What reason did he assign for so doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Will you allow me to read his letter, it is in his own handwriting, it is dated 6th Sept., after he came back from Paris—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Tulse-hill, Sept. 6, 1855. The Rev. Dr. Vaughan begs to inform Mr. J. Plummer that, in consequence of his late mysterious conduct, and great disrespect to him as Incumbent, he hat this day duly appointed a qualified and competent person to perform the duties of parish clerk of St. Matthew's, Brixton. To Mr. J. Plummer.")—he never explained to me what the mysterious conduct was—I had never behaved disrespectfully to him in my life that I know of—I certainly assisted in in<lb></lb>specting the books during his absence in Paris, by the churchwardens' orders—I never recollect his having found fault with me during the whole time I was in office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want you to explain a little more fully what actually took place on the Monday when you paid Malby the money; I understand you to say that you met Malby at the church gates on that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we stood there waiting for Dr. Vaughan at the church gates—when Dr. Vaughan came, he walked through into the vestry—Malby and I followed him—there was no one with him when we got into the vestry, I sat down filling up the heading in the marriage book—I believe that marriage book is here—whilst I was filling up the heading in the marriage book Dr. Vaughan</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040134"></xptr>
               <p>and Malby were settling about these fees; Malby was paying them to Dr. Vaughan—I saw him hand some money, but I could not say what amount it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as your memory goes, was there or was there not one word said about Acre-lane by anybody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not, I have not the slightest recollection of anything of the sort—I handed the certificate to Malby that same morning—after I had given it to Malby, I next saw it in Dr. Vaughan's hand—he told me to put it on the file—the rough book was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had anything been written in the rough book before you put it on the file? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: yes, it had—Dr. Vaughan made an entry in the rough book at the time—I did not see the entry, but I saw him writing—I certainly saw him writing, in the act of writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw Dr. Vaughan write in the rough book before he told you to put the certificate on the file? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I did not catch exactly what you said just now about the occasions upon which the pew opener received half a crown, upon what occasions were those? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was when a funeral was out of the district, and also it was written on the rules of the church by Dr. Vaughan that when there was a vault funeral she was to have half a crown—it was not mentioned in the rules that she was to have half a crown for an out district funeral, but he said to me that monring, "Plummer, I hope you have allowed Mrs. White half a crown"—I said I had, and he said, "Oh, that is right, John"—this was not a vault funeral—it was only in vault funerals and out district funerals that Mrs. White was to be paid half a crown, but I never had an instance of it before, not out of the district.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> All that the Doctor said was, "I hope you have allowed Mrs. White half a crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was allowed something when a person in the district was buried, when it was a vault funeral—I do not know anything further than that what Dr. Vaughan said on this occasion was, "You have allowed Mrs. White half a crown?" or "I hope you have allowed Mrs. White half a crown?" something like that—I said, "I have, Sir," and he said, "That is right, John"—that was all that I heard him say, at least all that I noticed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not a portion of Acre-lane in the Clapham district, and a Portion in St. Matthew's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>the fees, not to the best of my recollection—I have not a particularly bad memory.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not your habit to tell the Doctor what it was he was to fill in, with reference to the last abode? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had the certificate laid before him—that certificate did not contain the last abode—when it is not on the cer<lb></lb>tificate the Doctor or Mr. Eastman entered, according to the information they got from me—I cannot tell how the Doctor got Acre-lane in this instance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The certificate does not mention the place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But this does not, nor does any one from the Clapham district, at least</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040139"></xptr>
               <p>so says the registrar, and you say you always gave the place when the certifi<lb></lb>cate did not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gained information from the undertakers in general, or the relatives that come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you always give the information when it is not on the certificate, did you give it on this occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect seeing Webb's certi<lb></lb>ficate; I do not recollect hearing or seeing that certificate at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been involved in some litigation with the Doctor yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In what way? I do not particularly know what you mean by litigation—he brought an action against me in the County Court—I have been occasionally in a little pecuniary embarrassment—I do not know exactly when it was that I had a distress put in my house, I have the receipt for what I paid, so I can tell you—it was 12th July, 1855—I went to the Doctor and told him the distress I was in—the distress was for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Doctor advanced me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a claim upon the churchwardens for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for salary—it was not arranged that that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should be deducted from the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after all this disturbance took place about the fees I brought an action in the County Court against the Doctor for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he brought an action against me for the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—both these causes stood for hearing on the same day—I did not withdraw my action, it did not come on for hearing—I did not withdraw mine and pay the costs, I did not withdraw it, but I understand it was withdrawn—I got a solicitor to take the cases in rotation—I did not get my 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I bad to pay the costs—the Doctor got a judgment in his favour for the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was sworn—I swore that I did not owe it him—I believe the counsel after hearing me cross-examined, said he would have nothing more to do with the case—the Judge said that I had been guilty of perjury, and that he should consider whether he ought not to commit me—he afterwards said that con<lb></lb>sidering Dr. Vaughan was wealthy enough himself to prosecute me he should not commit me, but that I fully deserved to be indicted for perjury—I did swear that I did not owe the Doctor the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not gone through the rough book with the churchwardens and others in all the cases, I have not done so with any one—I am still sexton—I have not talked this matter over pretty frequently with Plummer—in almost all the cases I received the fees—I used to account to the Doctor every time of the inter<lb></lb>ment—the number of times a week that was, depended upon what inter<lb></lb>ments there were—sometimes there might be one, sometimes none, and sometimes two or three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But supposing in any week there was more than one interment, bow often were you in the habit, taking one week with another, of accounting with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes on Wednesday morning, and sometimes I used to go to the Doctor's residence and settle with him—sometimes, before I paid, the entries were made from the certificates—some of the entries are made by Mr. Eastman, and some are not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that when Mr. Eastman buried on some occasions, no entry was made until a subsequent period? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the biggest part of them, I believe, are out of the district; it was kept private from Mr. Eastman by the Doctor, the entries from the certificates—Mr. Eastman did not have the certificate sometimes at the time of the funeral, the Doctor had it in his possession sometimes—I believe it is the business of the officiating clergyman to have the certificates—sometimes Mr. Eastman was in the habit of burying without them—this rough book was always open on the table of the vestry—there was another book, a third book, a copy of it, which was kept for the churchwardens—the Doctor in general</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040140"></xptr>
               <p>copied that—the churchwardens had a copy of the rough book, and the rough book itself was at all times open to their inspection in the vestry—Plummer had his clerk's fees to receive from me from time to time—at one time I think we had a running account—it was the Doctor's wish that he should know what Plummer received, then I kept back two or three weeks, or perhaps a little more, but generally I paid him—the Doctor wanted to know what he received, and the fees then stood back—you might certainly tell it by the number of funerals—it was the Doctor's wish at ail events—it was only that time that I kept a running account with Plummer—I think so—that was one occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the only one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last two or three weeks perhaps, or three weeks, it all depended.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the whole time Plummer was there officiating as clerk, had you not a running account with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not the whole time, I think, it all depended—I think a few weeks—at all events he was paid all the fees, excepting the double fees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that he was not paid the double fees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the Doctor's wish that he should not receive the double fees after his father's death—the Doctor told me so—I do not know when it was he told me that—he told me that Plummer was not to receive double fees, only when he had a funeral of his own at the Church, acting as undertaker—when the funeral was not his own, the double fees that Plummer should have received were paid to Mrs. White, the pew opener—Mrs. Harrison's complaint was nothing, except about receiving this certificate of burial—she came to complain to the churchwardens that the burial certifi<lb></lb>cate was incorrect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear it, or did she complain to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not complain to me at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you do with the fees, if she paid double fees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I paid the Doctor the fees; double, single ground fee—I had received double—I paid the Doctor single—I did not pay him the double, because I meant to give it to the woman back again after I heard she was poor and deserv<lb></lb>ing—I do not recollect when I paid Dr. Vaughan—I paid him before I offered the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back to Mrs. Harrison—I did not pay him the whole, because I kept it back—I did so on all occasions, because it was the Doctor's wish that she should receive the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back, because she was poor—it was by his permission that I should take them in that way—he was aware that the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to be returned to the woman—I know he was aware of it because I told him—I told him that the woman was very poor—I did not know the parties at all, and they came from Clapham—I told him the woman was very poor in the vestry of the Church—I cannot tell you when I told him—it was before the funeral—I told Dr. Vaughan in the vestry</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040141"></xptr>
               <p>that I had received double fees—I cannot recollect when it was—it was before the funeral, after I had received the money—sometimes I receive the money two or three days before the funeral—I do not recollect on that occasion how I might receive the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Come, you may as well tell us the truth, did not you mean to pocket that 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—the book that was kept for the church<lb></lb>wardens is all in the Doctor's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying that she was poor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not aware that she was, only from the information I gained from the parties that came to order the funeral—it was a party of the name of Lodge—he lives at Clapham—he came to the churchyard—he told me that the woman was poor—he asked me to remit the fees—the fees were taken off for some relative of his in the same way—I kept the fees in my pocket till I gave them up to the Doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I was curate to Dr. Vaughan, at St. Matthew's Brixton. I commenced acting as curate in May, 1853—the Rev. Matthew Vaughan preceded me, a son of the Rev. Dr. Vaughan—the number of funerals at St. Matthew's, Brixton, depended upon the time of year—I was there during the cholera season—then there were a great many—I usually performed the funerals—in June, 1855, I was officiating as curate to Dr. Vaughan—on 11th June, 1855, I find this entry in the rough book: "11th June. Jane Webb, Acre-lane, sixty five years," with my initials and the figure 6—the whole of that entry is in Dr. Vaughan's handwriting, with the exception of my initials—the figure 6 is in Dr. Vaughan's hand<lb></lb>writing—the initials G. E. are mine—I should imagine that that entry was in the book when I put my initials there—I have in one or two instances put my initials to a blank entry—I had the entry of the funeral before me at the time I put my initials—sometimes I saw the undertaker's certificate—I dare say I have performed a funeral without the undertaker's certificate and the entry in this book by Dr. Vaughan—I do not recollect—I cannot speak clearly as to this entry of 11th June—I do not recollect that just now—I should imagine this entry of Jane Webb was there before I put my initials to it, for this reason, there was a wedding at the Church on that morning, which I think was performed by Dr. Vaughan—I have here the entries of the marriages which took place at that Church in the month of June—this is the marriage register of St Matthew's,</p>

               <p>Brixton—I see there were two weddings performed on that day—Dr. Vaughan officiated at those weddings—he signs as the clergyman on 11th June, 1855—I think the body of the entries with regard to the weddings is in Mr. Plummer's, the clerk's handwriting—the fact of there having been two weddings at the Church that morning does not recall to my recollection anything with regard to the entry of this burial—I have no recollection of the entry—it was so common for me to place my initials to Dr. Vaughan's handwriting, and the cases were so numerous, that I could not recollect them individually—my initials are placed in the same line—I think I have once or twice placed my initials to a blank entry where there was nothing written—I do not recollect whether I did so on this occasion—I have here the register of burials (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—here is an entry on 11th June—it is in Dr. Vaughan's handwriting—it is, "Jane Webb, Acre-lane, 11th June, sixty-five years."</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the churchwardens of the district Church of St. Matthew, Brixton—I am the incumbent's churchwarden—I commenced my duties in Easter, 1855, including this period—in the in<lb></lb>stance of Mrs. Webb, Dr. Vaughan accounted to me for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a single ground fee, and not a double one—these two bills (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) were published by the direction of myself and my brother churchwarden, Mr. John Edwards—they were posted about the parish by my direction—one of them, the first, speaks of a requisition from a body of the inhabitants—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the requisition upon which the meeting was called—there are no other bills upon the subject of these affairs of which I am cognizant, except the bill for the calling of a vestry—I saw the bill which has been produced, alleged to be abusive of Dr. Vaughan, but I had nothing to do with it—I saw it when I found it stuck up on the walls; until I found it there, I did not know of its existence—I had nothing whatever to do with it, either directly or indirectly—I have given no authority for, or had any share in, the publication of any other handbill but the three I have referred to—I see an entry in the rough book of the funeral of Robert Parsons—that is the entry of Plummer, the late clerk—(<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

                  </hi>. I am one of the churchwardens of St. Matthew, Brixton. I am not capable of stating what would be the advantage to the party receiving double fees instead of single fees for burials in the course of a year, I have not made myself acquainted with it—my year of office not having been gone through, and the account not having been made up, I am not competent to give you an answer as to the amount of the fees, or how they are distributed—the single fees for a funeral are 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the double fees, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—of the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. single fee, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I presume would go to the incumbent, as desk or surplice fees; 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the churchwardens and the Rector of Lambeth, one half to each; and the residue would be made up by the sexton and clerk's fees, but what they are I do not know—I have made it my duty to understand how far the churchwardens are answerable, and how much of the fees it would be their's to account for; so far I can give you an answer, but as to the sexton I cannot—the relative proportions are the same in double as in single fees.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. If a burial takes place of a person who has died in the district of St. Matthew, Brixton, there is a single ground fee paid—the amount of that is 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a person of full age, and if buried in what is called the third ground—that ground fee is divisible be<lb></lb>tween the rector of Lambeth, the mother parish, and the churchwardens of Brixton, in equal moieties—for the burial of a person of fall age dying out of the district, and buried in the third ground, the fee is 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is dis<lb></lb>tributable in the same way—in that case it would be 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the rector of Lambeth, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the churchwardens—in neither of those cases would the incumbent get any portion of the ground fee—he is paid by surplice fees.</p>

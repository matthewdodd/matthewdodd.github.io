My house was broken open on the 9th of August, after I went to bed. Me and my wife went up stairs to bed together; the doors and the windows were all secured. I cannot say whether any one of the lodgers had gone out, and left the street door open, or no. We went to bed at half after ten o'clock, on the 8th of August; we got up on the 9th, at seven o'clock in the morning, it was day light then; I missed my coat and shirt, they hung up in back parlour. I heard no noise in the night. It was the celler partition that he broke open, and crept out of the shop through a trap door. All the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140043"></xptr>things in the indictment, and much more were missing.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READ, JUNIOR. I produce the things; they were delivered to me in the office, by the constable and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor, I found the things in the bag in the morning of the 9th of August, they had not been taken out of the house; only put in the bag. He had on a shirt, a shift, and my stockings on his feet. I was present when he was found; he was found in the outer shop; he pretended to be asleep, he was laying on the bag that he had packed the things up in. I can swear to all the things produced are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with a young woman at the Trumpet public-house; I said it was late, I could not get in; she said, she would find me a bed. She went to this house, and asked for a bed; the door was wide open. I crawled down into the kitchen; I there found some flocks, I laid down. This woman came down, she took my shirt, my clothes, and all my money in my pocket. I never heard a soul come in; it must be her that robbed me. As to a hammer, Mr. Weston did not find on me. They dragged me out of the kitchen; I had not a thing to cover me. I put a shift on instead of a shirt. I being blind, did not know what I laid hold of. I have been blind six years.</p>

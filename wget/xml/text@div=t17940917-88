               <p>Q. Had you an occasion at any time to take the contents of your stock? - I had on the 12d of June last. It is customary for us to take it once a year; we are assisted by five or six of the trade; I found my stock four hundred and odd pounds at the time deficient of the sum it should be of the money that I had taken in trade that year.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence, did you search any box or trunk in your shop? - I recollected Barney's telling me the Sunday morning, that there was a trunk that contained clothes and other things for nine pounds nine shillings of his taking in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else but what there was a trunk? - The trunk had a ticket on it for nine pounds nine shillings in the name of Cooper, in Barney's hand writing; when we opened the trunk, which we were obliged to break open, what should it contain but chiefly his own wearing apparel, and other things, his property; a watch, and a pair of spurs, and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any property particularly that did not belong to him? - There was a shirt that we found; the shirt is here; I brought it here; it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose that is? - It is my property; it has been worn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You took stock the 22d of June? - I did.</p>

            How am I to know when he was discharged, or the Jury, or any body else? - To the best of my knowledge, the 3d of August. He was in the Hospital for a broken leg, which he got in his pleasure, and I could not accuse him while he was in the Hospital; I went before the magistrate and spoke of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, man, did you go before a magistrate and give any information about your suspicion of stealing the shirt till the 3d of August? Now we are on tender ground let us go on quietly? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you that you did not accuse him till the 3d of August, because he was in an Hospital for a bad leg? - I was at the justice's before this to accuse him of making false pawns, but as to the shirt I did not accuse him of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then you was before the magistrate, and accused him of several other things, but not of this till the 3d of August? - I did; and you was present, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. If the reason of your not accusing him was being in the Hospital, how came you to accuse him at all of any thing? - Because he told me that there was a parcel for nine pounds nine shillings, which when opened consisted of nothing but his own clothes. My son discovered this shirt before we went to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Your son did. You never saw that shirt in your possession till your son accused him of taking it, and told you it was your's? - I never saw the shirt in my possession till my son found the parcel, and compared it with other shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet here, before the Gentlemen of the Jury, you have already positively sworn it is your shirt? - I never saw it in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you come here and call God to witness, that you never saw it in your life? - I saw it as soon as it was found in the trunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170206"></xptr>Q. And yet you swear positively on your oath it is your's. On your oath, did you ever live in this No. 154, Gravel-lane? - Almost seventeen years ago; in general I sleep there two or three nights in a week.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath that you have taken, has there been any two persons on worse terms than that young man and your son? Has there not been continual quarrels between your son and that young man? - I don't know of any quarrels between my son and the prisoner; I know he has been very disturbing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that they have been on very bad terms, and have been so for a long time? - Not that I know; I am sure it is quite new to me; I don't understand your meaning; my son did no business in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that your son has not always spoken unfavourably of him, and he of your son; has not he complained of ill usage from your son? - My son does not interfere at all in the shop in Gravel-lane; he is at the shop in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The reason you did not make your accusation of him before, was because he was in the Hospital with a broken leg? - That was my sole motive.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken out any warrant against him for stealing this shirt? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - About the 1st of August; I shewed him all the favour I could.</p>
               <p>Court. You had taken stock the 22d of June? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was there at the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this shirt found? - On the 25th we opened the trunk, that was on Wednesday, and the shirt was not found till the 27th, by my son's information.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shirt found in your presence? - It was in my presence, with other things, and he had it in wear.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present besides you? - My son, and William Pomfret; I believe; I think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at that time? - He was in the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner go to the Hospital? - He got his leg broke on Sunday, the very day that we took stock; we cannot do it on another day in our business, because the people coming in and out so; he broke his leg on the 22d in the afternoon, he went out on his pleasure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when this shirt was found? - I was present when the trunk was broke open, and the first thing I took up was this shirt; it belongs to a pledge; it is a particular made shirt; a foreign made shirt, and the sleeves are strait sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shirts were pledged with it? - Four shirts and two waistcoats, all for a guinea; they were pawned last January was a twelvemonth, they are my property now, because they are unredeemed, and the person is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken it into your stock? - It had been entered as part of my stock. I have not got that book, because it is a book so long back that this pledge was put down in.</p>
               <p>Q. Your son he carried on the pawnbrokering business for you in the Minories? - Yes; he carried it on for me there, No. 105.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not any thing at all to do with this shop in Old Gravel-lane? - No, only assisting me to take stock.</p>
               <p>Q. He never took in pledges nor made entries in your books? - No; and when I missed so much property as four hundred pounds, I was determined to follow the business no longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170207"></xptr>Q. Then all you know is, that this is made like the others? - Yes; the gussets are made down low in the shirt.</p>

            When you receive these pledges you make an entry in a book? - When we receive a pledge of five shillings we make an entry in a book, and put them up in some part of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you keep your book which refers to the different pledges, and when these are forfeited you take off the different duplicates that were on the goods and enter it as so much stock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This had been in your warehouse locked up safely for a year and a half? - This had been in my warehouse, but I never had any account of it; it was, as I judge of it, concealed by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being with your father when you opened any trunk? - I was present; I brought it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a pawnbroker in the Minories, No. 105. On Wednesday, the 25th of June, I opened the trunk; the first thing I see was this shirt rolled up; going a little further I found a coat; I found different things, some things I knew to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that shirt to be his? - No; I know it to be one belonging to a parcel that I found afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any thing to do with this business in Gravel-lane? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a ticket on this trunk? - There was for nine guineas, of the name of Cooper.</p>
               <p> Mr. Ager. How many people have you and your father prosecuted this Session? - Not one except Barney and Curling.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you prosecuted a woman this Session? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - I did not give evidence against any one; but my father has.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray is there any one individual in his business that he has not one time or other prosecuted? - No other than these three.</p>
               <p>Court. How many parcels did you tumble over in this warehouse? - This was the first parcel I opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know what parcel to tell you to bring down stairs? - Barney told me in the morning that there was a trunk of nine guineas, and my father said bring it down stairs and I will look over it. There were a great many pledges there besides this one.</p>
               <p>Q. But you was so unfortunate as to hit on this first? - There were cupboards in this warehouse where this was found, and household furniture in the same warehouse; this trunk laid in a chair out of the cupboard; the ticket was pinned to the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this been written? - January 1793. January 14, 1793, Sarah Laws, four shirts and two waistcoats, one pound one shilling and a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Sarah Laws? - She is not here. I issued out a subpoena out of the office; she was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Jury. Your father said the person was dead? - She pawned them for a man that is since dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the book? - It is not here; it has been sold among some more old books.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that shirt? - By its remarkable make.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out Sarah Laws? - My father found her out; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take in that pledge at all? - I never did any business there.</p>
               <p>Q. To Matthews the elder. How long have you been a pawnbroker? - Near seventeen years.</p>

               <p>Q. You did a great deal of business in Gravel-lane? - We did some business; we took in about one hundred things a day.</p>

               <p>Q. Has there been any dispute between your young master and the prisoner? - There has been a dispute some time between the master and prisoner.</p>

            Look at the shirt? - That is the shirt I see the prisoner purchase in the shop, as near as I can guess, about four or five months back; I cannot justly tell to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that he bought it? - In Mr. Matthew's shop, in Old Gravel-lane.</p>

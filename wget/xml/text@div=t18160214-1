No person came in as a customer; a customer had been in three quarters of an hour before, and had gone out. I had had a person in about ten minutes before, and he had gone out again; he was not a customer; when I let him out, I fastened the door after him; I shut the door on the latch, and I am sure it was latched; I did not try it; but I know the door was shut and fast. Then I went into the back parlour. The first thing, I was sitting in the back parlour, with the parlour door open, and I heard a noise in the street, and directed my attention that way; I went out of the parlour towards the shop door, and I saw a man in the shop, near the door; I ran towards him, and stopped him, seeing him with something in his arms; that was the prisoner; he had a piece of sheeting in his arms; the piece of sheeting, when I stopped him, fell from his arms; I did not pick it up; my servant picked it up; I saw it on the floor, and knew it immediately, it was mine; we call it sheeting; it was given into the custody of

The prisoner is the man whom I caught in my shop; this was about a quarter before seven; I am perfectly sure as to the time, it was dark about an hour; we had candles lighted. I know nothing more than what the prisoner said when we were taking him to the office. I asked him when I caught him, what he was about; and he made answer that he wanted something for a pair of trowsers, and that was all I could get from him. I had seen that piece of sheeting on that day, in my shop; it layed on a box in the shop, on the right hand side, with six or seven other pieces; I had seen it, but I don't know at what hour; the place where it had been might be six or seven feet from where I laid hold of him; he was on the threshold of the door, just in the act of stepping out. When I was going before the magistrate, the same evening, he said he was sorry for what he had done. I said nothing to him; I made neither threat nor promise, and that is all he said. He might me a little in liquor, but that I can't say.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty on the 31st; I saw a mob round the door of the prosecutor, and upon that I went into the shop, and received charge of the prisoner; it was about a quarter before seven; I was going to the office to meet the rest of the officers. Mr. Strelly's house is in the parish of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch; Mr. Strelly had him by the collar when I went in. In going down to the office I met my father, and gave the sheeting to him. In going down to the office, the prisoner said he was sorry for what he had done. I had hold of the man when I met my father; Mr. Strelly had the sheeting. The prisoner was in liquor, and had been drinking, I have no doubt.</p>

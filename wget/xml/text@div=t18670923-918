                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 38, Upper Marsh, lam<lb></lb>beth—I have known the prisoner by sight—she lives somewhere in the Borough—on the 31st August, before ten in the morning, she came to my house; my window was open—she threw some stones and gravel into the room, and called me very rough names—I took no notice—I went out about half-past seven in the evening to market, and as I returned, about five minutes to twelve at night, the prisoner rushed on me like a tigress and struck me four or five times in the face—I had not said anything to her; I had not time—after the blows I felt something sharp at my head, and became insensible, and fell—I was picked up by the crowd—when I came to my senses I found I was wounded—I was taken in a cab to the hospital and had my head dressed there—I then came home, and was confined to my bed for a week—I am not fit to be out now—I feel bewildered, a if I should lose my senses—there is no pretence for saying that I have been lying with the prisoner's husband—he has lodged with me and my son, but not since last April—the prisoner is a very base bad woman—I will be on my oath there is no pretence for saying I have encouraged her husband away from her.</p>

She was out, and I waited there; they wanted to turn me out, and threatened to give me in charge for going to set fire to the house. They locked me up, and I was let out on Saturday. I went to look for my husband. I did not see her till she struck me in the face, and then I picked up a stone and struck her. She has gone to my daughter to her situation, and passed herself off as her mother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Her husband has been lodging in my house on and off for the last four years, but not since April. My son is in his twentieth year. He and I have slept in the same room because he has been ill, but never with her husband; there is no connection between me and her husband. I went to see her daughter while she was in the reformatory, but I never passed myself off as her mother. I am positive if this woman comes out again she will have my life; she swears she will be hung at Newgate for me.</p>

I am house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—Mrs. Davis was brought there on the night of the 31st August—her face was smeared with blood, and there was a quantity of blood on a handkerchief that she had round her neck—I found three or four wounds about the left side of the head and on the left ear—they appeared to haie been made with a sharp instrument, but a blunt instrument on the skull would very often cause that appearance—the wounds were not in themselves dangerous, but there might have been danger resulting afterwards—she was weak from loss of blood—two of the wounds went to the bone—they could not have been caused by a fist—some instrument must have been used—a piece of granite might have caused them.</p>

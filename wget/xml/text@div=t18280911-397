            . I am the wife of Thomas Vickers, and live at Poplar, On the 9th of August, I gave the prisoner the articles stated in the indictment, to wash; she was to return them at six o'clock in the afternoon, but she did not- she lived in Green Arbour-court: I have never seen any of them since - in the afternoon I went to her place, and she was not there; I went again next morning, but she was not there - I met her about three weeks afterwards in Cloth fair; I called her by name - she pretended she did not hear me; I followed her till I came in front of her, and then asked her how she was, and where she lived; she said at Hoxton - I said "You might as well come and see me;" she said she did not like on account of the things - I said "Never mind the things at all; you may as well come and see me" - she said she did not like to come on account of the people in the next room; I said they had nothing to do with me, for I had had words with them - after a good deal of persuasion, I got her to come; when my husband came home, I gave charge of her - she said at first she had pawned the flannel petticoat, and then she denied it - when the officer came, she said she had had a little drink and lost the things.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I was sent for and found the prisoner there; I asked her if she had pawned the things; she said No, they were stolen from her, either in going home or bringing them home - I forget which: I searched her and found nothing - I again asked her if she had pawned them, and said it would be better to give up the duplicates; she said No, they were stolen.</p>
               <p>COURT to JANE VICKERS. Q. Did she say in the officers presence that she had pawned the petticoat? A. Yes.</p>

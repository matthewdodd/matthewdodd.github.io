               <p>Mr. Justice Deveil. The Prisoner was brought before me, and made a voluntary Confession, which was taken in Writing, and sign'd by him.</p>
               <p>Then the Confession was produced and read in Court. It was to this Effect, That being lately come from on Board the Namure, and being in want of Money, on the 19th of July, about eight in the Evening, he went into the Queen's-walk, in the Upper-Park, and seeing two young Gentlewomen walking by themselves, he pull'd out a Mask, which he had brought on purpose to rob with, and going up to them; presented a Pistol, and demanded their Money. One of them dropt a Purse on the Ground, but he did not take it up; for they squaling out aloud, he took to his Heels, and threw away his Pistol and Mask.</p>

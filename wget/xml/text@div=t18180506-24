On the 9th of April the prisoner and another man came in and looked at some gold seals; they fixed upon two, which came to 2l. - they said they had no money about them, but would call in the evening for them. I asked them for a deposit; they said they had only a shilling. I said it was odd they should come to buy gold seals with only one shilling about them - I suspected the other man. He took off his hat, took his handkerchief out of it, and went to the door; I followed him knocked his hat off-the seal dropped out of the handkerchief into his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. The seal was in the other man's handkerchief. They were together.</p>

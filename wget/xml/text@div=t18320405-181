            . I am fourteen years old; I am a weaver - I know the three prisoners. On the day stated I met them about twelve o'clock; they were at play, and I played with them till about two; while we were playing I heard Goodfellow say he had had 15s. one week out of Mr. Johnson's till, and 1l. the week afterwards - this was on the Sunday they were taken up, but I do not know the day of the month; he did not say how he had got it, but said he was by himself; I was taken up on this charge, and have been ever since in the House of Correction; I met the prisoners again about four o'clock, near the prosecutor's house - I played with them till about five, and then went to my tea; I came out and joined them again in about an hour; then Goodfellow said to me, "Will you be in getting Johnson's till?" he said it would be a gift to get it, and he would go and get it - I refused to have any thing to do with it - the other two prisoners were there at the time, and must have heard what was said - I left them, and in about an hour I saw them again in Bethnall-green-road - Goodfellow told me that he had got Johnson's till, and said there was a good load of money in it; the other two were close to him; he said they had chucked the till over some palings behind Johnson's house - I was taken at one o'clock on Monday morning - I told the officer what I have now stated; I showed him the place, and the till was found there - I saw the prisoners again an hour after; they told me of this, and Bentote asked me if I would put a pair of pigeons into my father's loft till Monday morning, and I did; he did not say where he got them from.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, did you not tell an officer that you had buried 12s. of this money in a garden? A.

            . I am pot-boy to Mr. Johnson. On Sunday, the 3rd of March, as I was getting in my pots, I saw Bentote at the back of my master's house; I asked how he thought he should get on - he said he did not know yet; I asked him if he had any of the money; he said he had but 1s. 6d. in silver, and some copper - he said the money was shared by handsfull; he said that Saint held the door, and Goodfellow went in and took the till, and they ran down in the hollow, emptied it into Goodfellow's cap, and he put it under his arm - they ran off where they thought no one could see them - I told him I thought they would get a severe flogging; he said he did not think that - he thought the case was not large enough, unless it went to Newgate, and he did not care about two or three month's imprisonment, so long as he did not get a teazing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You seem to have a very perfect recollection of it, how often have you told this? A. Two or three times; I do not recollect any thing being said about Prince peeping through the window, or his name being mentioned.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY COLEMAND JOHNSON. This is my father's till, and I can identify some of the money.</p>

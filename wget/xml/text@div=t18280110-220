               <p>JOHN JONES. On the 14th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was at the door of the <placeName id="t18280110-220-crimeloc1159">Lock and Key public-house, in Smithfield</placeName>

I said middling; he asked if I would stand treat; I said No; but I had a pot of beer, and he was welcome to that; he asked me to lend him a shilling- I took out the purse - he snatched it, and ran away - he was not stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you knew the prisoner before? A. Yes; I was quite sober; I ran as far as Long-lane, and then missed him; I did not call Stop thief! the Magistrate did not ask if I made an alarm, nor did I tell him - I thought it was done in fun, and expected he would come back; the prisoner had high shoes on - they were half-boots.</p>

            . I saw Jones at the Lock and Key on the 15th; he described the prisoner to me, and I took him- he tried to get from me - I took Jones to the prisoner's house; I asked the prisoner if he knew Jones; he said No; I called the prosecutor, who said to him, "Give me the money, that is all I want;" he said he would swear he was the man; I found nothing on him; he said he never saw Jones in his life; but afterwards said he had known him twenty-seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you and the prisoner ever quarrelled? A. Yes, once - I had him once before a Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer, and live at No. 23, Woodbridge-street. I have known the prisoner thirteen or fourteen years. On the evening of the 14th of December, at a quarter to five o'clock I went to the prisoner's house, and asked him what time it was; he told me about five; I went in, drew the clock up, came out again to smoke my pipe, and the parish clock struck five; I walked up stairs, and saw the prisoner looking out of his window, with a night-cap on; I called him; he came down; we stood looking at the men killing sheep, and were together till a quarter or half-past seven o'clock.</p>

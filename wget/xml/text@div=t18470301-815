I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday night, the 6th of Feb., in a garden in front of his own house, in Elder-walk, Islington—when I got him a little way from his own house I told him he was charged with stealing a watch at Plaistow, in Essex—he said he✗ found it, and pawned it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grazier, and live at Plaistow. On the morning of the 22nd of Dec. I had occasion to go to my water-closet, and placed my watch where I had been accustomed to do, and, anxious to get an omnibus, I hastened out, and left my watch in the water-closet—the prisoner was working on the premises at the time, for the landlord, who was carrying on repairs—my watch cost 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ten years ago, I believe—I missed it on my return—I have seen it since—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is my watch, and seal and ring—this chain has been added to it—it had a black ribbon when I lost it.</p>

I was employed in pointing a garden-wall down to the ground; on the side of the wall some grass was growing; I had to take it away, to keep the water from injuring the wall, and I turned this watch up with the grass; I put it into my pocket, and kept it seven days; it had stopped, and I gave it to a watch-maker to repair—I took it form him after it had been there eight days, and I pawned it on the 9th of Jan.; I em<lb></lb>ployed my brother to see if he could find anybody belonging to the watch; he found the prosecutor, and he went and told him I was willing to redeem it; he came back and said the gentleman would prosecute me, as I did not let him have it before; I only pawned it on the Saturday, and on Monday I let the gentleman know; if I had known whose it was I would have given it up; I would sooner have had the money than the watch.</p>

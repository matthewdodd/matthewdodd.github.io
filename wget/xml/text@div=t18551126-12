                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother. I was present on 17th Nov., 1833, at Hinchford, in Wiltshire, when he was married to Mary Ann Mining—he lived with her about four years, as near as I can recollect—he then left her—I was not living at that place—they had one child—I saw him in London about four years ago, and spoke to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Maiden-lane. On 26th Feb., 1846,1 was married to the prisoner at Paddington church—he was then a police con<lb></lb>stable, and stated that he was a widower; it is so in the certificate—he was married in the name of James Howell—after I had been married about four years, I heard about a former wife of his—I told him of it, and he said he would rather lie in prison and rot, than such a woman as that should have any of his money—I went into the country, and saw his wife in the last week in August in this year—I went on living with him—he was always receiving letters from his sister—I had no conversation with him respecting these letters, I merely told him he ought to send something to his wife, and to support his child, and he said he never would—those letters are destroyed—I did not ask him how he came to marry me, having a wife—I only told him I considered he had been a rogue to her and to me—he made no particular answer, only that he never would allow her anything.</p>

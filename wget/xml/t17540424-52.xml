               <p>Ambrose Dawson. On the 27th of March, between seven and eight at night, my chariot was stopped as I was near my Lord Bath's in <placeName id="t17540424-52-crimeloc277">Piccadilly</placeName>

               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Dawson. It was a plain gold watch with a seal set in gold; then he rode off.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing in particular against the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dawson. No, the prisoner is much about the size of him, but I cannot say he is the man, from what I saw of him, for it was pretty dark; but he was taken up on the Saturday following and owned he had pawned my watch to Mr. Scriven, who is here.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker; on Wednesday the 27th of March, a little before nine at night the prisoner at the bar brought this gold watch to my house, he asked me ten guineas on it, I looked on it and said if nine guineas would do, he should have it, I gave it him, and he gave me a bit of a bill, as is usual, he wrote his name in it, G. Thompson, nine guineas, 27 March, a gold watch.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in Brook-street on Saturday night the 30th of March about ten o'clock; there were five or six of us after him: as he was riding in the street I took hold of his bridle, and we soon unhorsed him; we took him before justice Fielding, there he confessed several robberies, and this was one of them; one he said was in Picadilly, another at the upper end of Swallow-street, another in Wych-street, and that one of the watches he had pawned in the name of Thompson with Mr. Scriven, and gave us it in writing; we went to the gentleman in that name and he went up stairs and fetched it.</p>

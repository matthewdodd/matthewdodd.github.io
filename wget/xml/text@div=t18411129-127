                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Baynham, a grocer, at Ux<lb></lb>bridge. About nine o'clock on Saturday, the 16th of October, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to our shop for half a pound of candles, which came to 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him—he offered me a shilling—I saw directly that it was a bad one—I asked why he gave me a bad shilling—I do not know what answer he made—I said I would detain it—he demanded to have it back—I made an attempt to weigh it, and he attempted to snatch it from the scale, but failed—I laid it securely by out of his reach—he still wished to have it—Is till denied it—I inquired his name—he told me his name was Thomp<lb></lb>son, working for Hutchinson, a builder, at I ever—he still wished to have the shilling, and caught up a candlestick from the counter, and was very abusive—I asked his name again—he said, "Smith, working for Thomp<lb></lb>son"—he still wanted the shilling, and offered me some other money, which I refused—I gave him the shilling after he became so abusive, as I thought he would throw the candlestick through the window—he then left.</p>

I was on duty at Uxbridge on the 16th of October—I received information, and saw the prisoner—I watched, and saw him go into the Red Lion public-house, which is from fifty to eighty yards from Mr. Baynham's—I went quietly in behind him, and saw him leaning over a little window-sill that looks into the bar—he asked the landlord for a lodging, and put down two good six-pences on the sill of the window which was open—the landlord said, "You can't lodge here, you are drunk"—he then said, "D—your eyes, you think I have got no money," and pulled some money out of his pocket—the landlord said, "You have got some bad ones there"—I caught it out of his hand—there were five bad shillings, three good ones, and four good sixpences—he was drunk—I took him into the bar to search him, and he took something out of his pocket and held it in his left hand—I could not</p>

Chaplin and Horne's, Hambro' Wharf, Upper Thames Street, where the goods are stored (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "24, Lawrence Pountney Lane, 23rd June, '71. Mr. Mead.

Hird, R. Jones.") We had a customer of the name of Hird, whom we did business with—I went to a house and saw the four cases which have contained preserved meat belonging to our Company—they held 96lbs. each, and were worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard that the prisoner had obtained four, instead of six—I ordered two to be sent to Messrs.

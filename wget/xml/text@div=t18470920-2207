                  </hi> I live at No. 3, Swan-yard. On the 19th of Sept., about twelve o'clock, I was in the Blue Anchor, Parson's-street—they wanted to close the house, and turned us all out—I was outside the door—the prisoner <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> me against the shutters, and darted a knife into my arm—nothing had happened between us before that—I know no reason for his doing it—he was half-drunk—I had nothing to do with turning him out—it was a sailor's knife—it was open when I first saw it.</p>

                  </hi> I am waiter at the Blue Anchor. The prisoner came there about a quarter-past twelve o'clock—it was raining very hard, and the people were staying—it was time to turn them out—he appeared in liquor, and was rather excited—he came in to inquire the way to Old Gravel-lane, my master told me to show him—as soon as I did so he struck at me—we got him outside—I did not see him with the knife then—I saw him and Dowd down together, and took the knife out of his hand—I saw nobody strike him.</p>

On the 20th of Sept., about one o'clock in the night, Dowd was brought there, bleeding very much from a wound on the back part of the left arm, an inch and a quarter deep—it was done by some sharp instrument—this knife (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) would have done it—it was a dangerous wound—it just escaped as artery—I measured the wound and the knife—they corresponded exactly.</p>

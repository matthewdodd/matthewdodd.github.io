                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On the morning of 21st September I was with constables Obey, Witney, and Green—we left the city soon after seven, and got to Tottenham Court Road a little after eight—we there saw Shaw, James Dyer, and Norrington, about half-past nine, with another man not in custody—I first saw them at the corner of Stephen Street and:</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186710280058"></xptr>
               <p>Tottenham Court Road—I was in plain clothes—they remained together about half an hour, and then I saw James Dyer and Shaw go up Tottenham Court Road, and the others went in a different direction—I lost sight of them then—I next saw Norrington coming from the direction of Percy Street—(I was with the other officers, and had continued with them nearly all the time)—I saw him at the top of Percy Street, coming from the direction of Stephen Street—he was carrying this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), marked No. I—I stopped him and asked him what he had there—he said, "Linen, why? "—Green and Obey then came up, and I said I should charge him with being concerned in entering Nos. 1 and 2, Falcon Street, City, and stealing a large quantity of chintz and other articles, about the 16th—he said, "It is a bad job"—I put him in a cab, conveyed him to Moor Lane station, and charged him—I found on him a pocket-book and some memoranda, a sketch, and an assay paper with Shaw's name on it, and these two pieces of wood—they are used by burglars in fitting locks, to judge the keyholes; by putting them in the hole they get the depth of the key, they then make a sketch and fit the key afterwards—he refused his address—at the station I opened the parcel and found these two pieces of chintz and eleven pieces of ribbon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards received from Obey some skeleton keys, and on 26th September I went to the warehouse in Falcon Street, and found one of the keys opened the front door easily—this is the key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 21st September I was with the other officers in the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road, and saw the prisoners there—I afterwards saw Norrington taken into custody—I went to the Dyers' room, and assisted in making the search there—on a shelf I found this skeleton key, wrapped up in a piece of eily rag—I asked then how they accounted for the possession of the key—they said they never saw it before—I afterwards on the same day went to 7, Berry Street, with Obey—I found there this skeleton key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) between some plates and dishes on a shelf, and also another one hanging up—Shaw came in while we were there, and I showed him the keys—he said, "That one I made myself at the shop"—he afterwards said he bought a basket of them at a sale—I called his attention to the other one, and he said it belonged to the room door—I saw two aprons there, one worn by his daughter—on 26th September I went to 7, Stephen Street, and went into the cellar—the door was fixed in—it wanted to be pushed violently to open it—I found among some rubbish this bag marked 4, containing remnants of chintz—I did not find anything else relating to this charge.</p>

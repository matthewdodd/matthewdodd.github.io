                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Union-street East, Spital-fields. The prisoner Shimmell is my brother—he worked for me, learning the trade, but did not sleep in the house—it was hit custom at night to shut up the shop, clear the window, and pack the things on the counter—on Friday, the 9th of Feb. he closed the shop as usual, and left a little before ten o'clock—after he was gone I went and saw the shop all secure, all the doors and shutters fast, and I fastened all the bolts and doors—a wooden prop was stuck Against the front and back doors—I have a cellar at the end of my passage—I was called up by a neighbour next morning between ten minutes and a quar<lb></lb>ter after six, and found the street door open—I went into the shop, and found everything on the counter had been taken away—there was a quantity of cloth, ready-made clothes, and things amounting to nearly 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my own great coat hung up on a peg in the shop, and in one of the pockets I had left a pair of black kid gloves, which I had had about four years, but not worn them regularly—I missed them—I sent for the police, and examined everywhere, but could discover no marks of violence—I do not suppose it possible for any one to open the door from the outside, and I concluded it had been opened by some one secreted within—an iron crow-bar was found behind the door—I had never seen that in my house before—while the police were examining, my brother came to the shop, about seven o'clock—he merely asked what was the mat<lb></lb>ter—he</p>

               <p>remained with me till the Monday evening following—Convey came to my house that night, and in the prisoner's presence asked if I had not a brother in the habit of going out with a child in the middle of the day, about half-past eleven o'clock—I said, "Yes"—he said, "That is the person, have you been robbed?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Your brother is the person who has done the robbery; I have learnt that he is the associate of thieves"—my brother made no answer—Convey then said, "I have got a trace who the parties are, I will go and look after them, and return to you"—I was not to let my brother go—he would come back and look after him—when he was gone I said to my brother, "Now it is all found out, you are the guilty party, and you will be sorry to find yourself in Newgate"—he fell on his knees, and asked me to save him, he would tell me all about it—he began to tell me a few words—I told him to stop, and went and fetched in my next door neighbour to hear his statement—when he came in he said, "I could not help it, I was forced to do it, it was me that took your other cloth that you lost some time since; the parties were not secreted under the counter as you sup<lb></lb>pose, it was a boy named Stevens was in the cellar; it is me that has been cut<lb></lb>ting your cloth, and taking it to a person named Durant; when you found it out, and a watch was kept so close, there was no opportunity of taking any more, he threatened me if I did not let the boy Stevens be secreted is the cellar, he would dash my brains out, and would bring the cloth that he had already had and show to you, and get me transported"—he said when he shut up the shop the boy was at the window ready to come in, and now was the time or never, that the boy came in, and he shut him in the cellar and left thim there—Mr. Hayward, my neighbour, then took him to the station, and I followed—he made the same statement there, and said a person named Sampson had bought the cloth—it was traced to that Sampson, in Gun-yard, Houndsditch—I went with the policeman to Sampson's house—I found a yard of silk velvet, a piece of doeskin, a piece of cloth, and a pair of trowsers, which were mine—next morning I went to the station, and found the prisoner Jacobs there—a pair of gloves were shown to me, not in Jacobs's presence—they were produced before the Magistrate twice when he was there—I knew them to be mine as soon as I saw them.</p>

On Monday, the 12th of Feb., from information I received I went to the prosecutor's house, and saw him and his brother there—I asked him in the prisoner's presence if he had not a brother in the habit of taking a child out about eleven o'clock—he said he had—I said, "Have you been robbed lately?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You were robbed a week back"—he said, "I have"—then I said, "From information I have, your brother is the party robbing you; he is con<lb></lb>nected with a parcel of notorious thieves"—I said, "Don't you know Durant?"—the prisoner said, "No"—I said, "Do you know Stevens and Lee?"—he denied knowing anything about them—I said, "I feel confident you know these parties, because you go out with a child," and I described the child—I said I should go and make inquiry, and told the prosecutor not to allow his brother to go, that I should come again—I then left—I was not dressed in my</p>

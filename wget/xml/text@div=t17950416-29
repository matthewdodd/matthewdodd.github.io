               <p>Q. Did you, after this, miss any metal from your shop? - Yes, I did, on the 20th of March, one of the persons brought me an ingot of metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any before he brought it to you? - I had missed several ingots, I knew it because I made some private marks on some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed several ingots, how long before? - Six or eight, or ten days previous.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that brought it to you? - His name is Faulkner.</p>
               <p>Q. How many ingots did he produce? - Only one, at that time he only brought one. I beg your lordship's pardon, the first ingot was received of Wild; that ingot I knew to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What weight was that ingot? - About fourteen pounds. That was one of the ingots that I had marked with a small punch, the counter part of which I keep at Goldsmiths Hall.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you with that ingot being brought to you by Mr. Wild? - I kept that ingot, and endeavoured to come at some other proof.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not apprehend the prisoner on that day? - No, not on that day; and the next day they, by appointment, were to go to the prisoner Horne.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by they? - By the witnesses; they were to go to buy some metal that she said she would have ready for them. The next day they brought me a piece of metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other ingot brought to you besides that brought by Wild? - Yes, on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it? - Wild again.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. When was the first time you took any ingot of Mr. Nutting? - I had that of one Jonathan Faulkner, on the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same day as you delivered it to Mr. Nutting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you it of him? - I asked Faulkner if this old lady bought this kind of metal; and he told me yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Faulkner? - I had heard that he had some metal of the old woman, he went along with me to recommend me to an old lady to buy some metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live? - In Newtoner's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she a house there? - She had; when we came there she said she had a good deal of metal, but them that bought it must melt it down immediately as they had it; she said it was a woman that brought it, and it was brought from Covent Garden; when I went on the 20th, she told me that the metal was gone to Mr. Faulkner's, because she could not pay for the metal but when she was paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you bought the ingot of Faulkner before you went to Hone's? - No, she told me it was gone to Faulkner's.</p>
               <p>Q. But you said that Faulkner went with you to Mrs. Horne's, to recommend you to buy the metal? - That was before the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before? - Not many days.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said about this ingot that you bought at Jonathan Faulkner's? - I went to her dwelling after I bought the metal there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160058"></xptr>Q. This was before you bought it of Faulkner? - It was when I had bought it of Faulkner I went back to her, and told her I had bought it of Faulkner; she said that she was very sorry that he had it, because she could have got a far thing a pound more; I gave Faulkner seven-pence a round for it, and he gave her sixpence three farthings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that this buying was all with that view to assist Mr. Nutting in his discovery? - Yes, all with that view.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told Faulkner then about your suspicions that this was Mr. Nutting's metal? - Yes, he employed me on that business, for that purpose, and I bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it after you bought it? - I took it to Mr. Nutting, and Mr. Nutting had happened to have marked it, and he knew it. After I had bought it of Faulkner I went to Mrs. Horne, and asked her when she should have any more metal; and she said she should have some more in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that ingot that you received on the 20th? - Mr. Nutting had it in his possession.</p>

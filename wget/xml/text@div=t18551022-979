                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of William Lee, who is in partnership with Mr. Jardine. On 13th Sept, I received this letter by post, in consequence of which I sent the coals ordered, by William Barnett—I am acquainted with the prisoner's writing—to the best of my belief, the letter is his writing disguised—the manner which is a similar one to his own is like his writing, and when I told him of it he acknowledged it—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>: "4, Queen's-row, Walworth, 13th Sept, 1855. Sir, Please send me 4 1/2 tons of best coals, and 1 sack of cannel, let them be well screened and the best; my friend, Mr. J. Foster, of the Loughborongh-road, speaks very highly of them, send-them in on Saturday morning with the bill. Signed, J. Percival.")—we had supplied Mr. Foster, of Lough-borough-road, with coals about a week before—Barnett returned without the money—in consequence of something I heard on Saturday, 6th Oct, I found the prisoner at No. 3, Hanbury-street—I told him I had called about those coals that he had illegally got, and that it was very wrong that he should write such a note to me; he said that if I would be quiet, on Mon<lb></lb>day, he would send the money down—this was on Saturday—I told him that I could not give an opinion myself, and if it was not done immediately it would be very bad for him—he said he was sorry for what he had done, that he was very short of money, and if I would wait a few days, it should be settled—he said, "I suppose the money is all you want"—he was clerk to my employers about eighteen months, and would be perfectly acquainted with the course of business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the employ of Lee and Jardine. In Sept., I was sent with four and a half tons of coals, and a sack of cannel—shortly after leaving the wharf I met the prisoner, he asked me where I was going—I said to Mr. Percival's, in Walworth-road, and he said it was all right—I was hunting about and went to one Mr. Percival, who is here to-day—he said that there must be another Mr. Percival, as he was not the person who had ordered coals—I then saw the prisoner, he said, "Oh! these are the coals"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You can put them there, pointing to a shed"—I delivered them there as he ordered—I gave him this delivery note, and the invoice—I did not see this signature, "J. H. Percival," put in it—I gave it to the prisoner without that name, and a young woman brought it to me signed.</p>

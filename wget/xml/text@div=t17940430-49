On the 22d of March last, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, in company with another man, came into my shop, I was at the farther end of my shop, at the parlour door, with my back towards the door, hearing a noise I turned about and saw the prisoner and another man, the prisoner immediately ran away, I followed him to the door and hallooed out stop thief! he ran a few paces from the door and threw down a piece of callico, which he had concealed; into the middle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300083"></xptr> of the street; I see him do it, he ran a little further and was stopped, I picked up the callico myself. I am certain I saw him drop it, I took him then before a magistrate who committed him. I never lost sight of him, except merely in the action of picking the callico up. I brought him back immediately, the other man went away, I past him in following this.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you the whole house as well as the shop? - Yes, the shop is a part of my dwelling house. The callico is here, my apprentice has it; I have kept it ever since myself.</p>

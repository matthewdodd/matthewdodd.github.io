                  </hi> I am a gamekeeper to Mr. Gooding, of Breestock Lodge, Northamptonshire. I have had letters in the prisoner's name which I have reason to believe were not written by him—in Sept. last, I received a gun and a letter in the same writing as that I used to receive from the prisoner—in about a week I received a letter signed J. Bateman, telling me to take care of the gun that was sent down—I sent back a letter to know how he came by it—he wrote saying he had it from John Mays—this is it.</p>

               <p>About eight months. I am a relation of the prisoner's—I have destroyed the letter—he said he had it from John Mays for a debt due from him for board and lodging—he did not say it was to be kept till Mays paid him—it looked like a woman's writing—the prisoner cannot write, unless he has learned since he has been in London.</p>

On the 30th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to the shop, and asked the price of tamarinds - I looked behind me, and saw him put his hand up, and put it again to his pocket. I missed the weights, and asked him where they were; he pointed to the end of the counter to some basins - I collared him, and said he had them; he pulled them out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you seize this man by the collar yourself - A. Yes; he made no resistance - he begged of me to let him go. His manner appeared strange; he seemed to want sense.</p>

            . I know the prisoner; he appeared to me not to be in his right mind lately - his mother has often called me in. I have seen him break the windows, knock his head against the wall, come down stairs without his clothes, and roll his head in the kennel. He had one or two fits some years ago; this strange conduct has happened within this three or four weeks.</p>
               <p>- AARON. I am his mother. I believe he is not right in his head; he is subject to fits, and I have sent for the neighbours in on account of it - he has been taking medicine, and he sometimes took three or four pills when he should have taken but one. My belief is that he is out of his mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the General Post-office; mine is the Leadenhall-street district; a man named Cale is under me; my dis<lb></lb>trict begins at Messrs. Maine and Reed's, 158, Leadenhall-street. On Monday morning, 8th April, about half-past five o'clock, I received the letters at the Post-office, and divided them between myself and Cale—it was the practice for him to deliver on one side of the street, and I on the other—I put my letters in a blue bag, and we went together to Leadenhall-street—there was some veal and pork in the bag, with mustard on it, for my dinner—Cale carried the bag—at a few minutes before nine, I met a friend in Leadenhall-street; while I was talking to him, Cale went on a little in advance of me, and I saw him place my bag at the door of Maine, Reed, and Co.'s—he then crossed over to his own side of the way, and nodded to me to show me where he had put it—I went towards it, and met three or four people, which caused me to go a little out of my way, and obstructed the view of it, and when I got to the place, it was gone—I looked about, and gave an alarm—there were about 300 letters in it, besides a great many newspapers—if a letter was posted at Braintree directed to Simpkin and Buck, it would come into my delivery.</p>

On 8th April I left the Post-office with Peckham—I had his bag and my own—he met an acquaintance at the corner of Leadenhall-street, and stopped to speak to him—I put his bag at Maine and Reed's doorway, the first house in his delivery, I saw him looking at me, and I pointed to the bag and nodded</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">City-police inspector.</hi>) On Wednesday, 10th April, I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street, a little after six o'clock, and saw the prisoner a few yards from the station—he came up, and said he wished I would take him into custody, and he would give me information of a very extensive robbery—I was going into Mr. Fitch's shop, and said, "Very well, wait a little"—I saw him move away, and came out—he walked towards the station—I followed, and found him at the station door talking to a constable named Lott—we went in—I said, "Well what have you got to say to me?"—he said he was the person that stole the postman's letter-bag—I had heard of it, and asked him when; he said, "On Monday, about ten minutes past nine in the morning," that he was crossing over from Gracechurch-street, and saw an old blue bag on the sill of the door at the corner of Leadenhall-street; that he walked two or three times backwards and forwards, and seeing no person near, and thinking it contained old boots and shoes, he put it under his arm, and went along Bishopsgate,Threadneedle-street, and Broad-street, to the back of the Bank into Moorgate-street, along Finsbury-circus; and there, having a piece of an old black bag, he threw it over it to cover it, and went along Long-alley into a court to a privy, and examined the contents of the bag; that he opened several letters which contained half notes, and one of them had twenty-two postage-stamps in it; that there was some meat in a saucer wrapped up in a napkin with some mustard on it; that he ate it, and it was the best thing be found, and he was glad to get it, for he was hungry; he then became very much frightened, and covered the bag over with the old cloth, and walked about London all day, and in the City-road he picked up a stone, put it into the bag, and went to London-bridge about dusk, and threw it over into the river; that he then saw a very respectable person, who he asked if he would take a person in custody for a robbery, who there was a reward for, but the person would not; but afterwards he said he dare say there would be a reward; that he went to Tyson-street, Hackney, and slept there that night—I asked him what he had got about him, and he handed me this half of a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was searched in my presence, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him—I after<lb></lb>wards took him to London-bridge, and he pointed out the place where he had thrown the bag over—he took me to Long-alley—he said he did not know how he got the half note, he supposed it was in one of the letters.</p>

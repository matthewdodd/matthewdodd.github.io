                  </hi>. I am foreman to William Adams, of West Ham, Essex. On 14th Oct., 1848, the prisoner was in his service, and was sent to town with sixty dozen of carrots, in a wagon, to Mr. Gregory, of Spitalfields-market—I made out a note of the quantity, and the carter's name; he was the prisoner—I left it with Cordery, the watchman, to give to the prisoner—the prisoner had no authority to deliver any of the carrots on the road, but to take them to the salesman—I did not see him start or come back—I did not see him again till he was in custody, nearly twelve months after—he was in regular employ—he never came back to his master—the carrots were Mr. Adams's property until delivered to Mr. Gregory, for sale.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Saville-road, Mile-end-road. On 14th Oct., 1848, about half-past three in the morning, I was walking to town, and as I passed the Fountain public-house, in the Mile-end-road, I saw a wagon with carrots in it, and saw the prisoner and two other persons unloading the carrots into the Fountain stable—the prisoner was on the wagon, and the two others carrying them into the stable—I afterwards saw the prisoner go on with the wagon—about three-quarters of an hour afterwards I went with a police-man to the stable, and saw the carrots there—he took charge of them, and I gave information to Mr. Gregory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Gregory, a salesman of Spitalfields-market. On the morning of the 15th the prisoner brought a wagon of carrots there—there were six or seven wagons came that morning from Mr. Gregory, and one man brought a note of the whole—the prisoner left his wagon, took an empty one, and went to load some dung—Mr. Imray then gave me infor<lb></lb>mation—I examined the wagon, and found the carrots had been disturbed, and there was a space where some had been taken from—I then went to the stable at the Fountain, and found three dozen and two, bunches of carrots, which I compared with the others and found them to be the same—Mr. Gregory sells entirely for Mr. Adams—I can swear they were Mr. Adams's carrots—we <hi rend="italic">told</hi> over the remainder of the carrots, and there were three dozen and three punches short—I went after the prisoner to Theobald's-road, where he was to load the dung, and found the wagon and four horses there, and no driver—I did not see him again till this Oct.</p>

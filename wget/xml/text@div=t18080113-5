               <p>Q. When you went out did you fasten the door and windows. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the lower window fastened. - A. The prisoner was a lodger in the lower room; I lived in the one pair of stairs room; I fastened my one pair of stairs door when I went out, and the key of my padlock I took with me; I am sure I locked my door; there are only two rooms in the house; I came home about eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130005"></xptr>o'clock, I went into the Cock and Neptune opposite of my house; the prisoner came to me; he says, you have left your door open; I said no, I am sure I have not; it is a thing that I never do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you are certain that you had locked the door, because it was your custom, or are you sure that you did lock it at that time. A. I am certain that I did. I asked the servant of the public house to go to my room and see if it was; fastened, she did, and returned and said it was; when I went home, I observed the padlock had not been picked, it was locked; I observed that the staple had been pulled out; I went into my room, I found my drawers open and the corner of this pillow case was out of the corner of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. The drawer was partly open was it. - A. Yes, it was broken open; I cried out, I am robbed; I went down stairs to call for assistance, Mrs. O'Hara, my neighbour, told me I could do nothing at that time of night, to make myself as comfortable as I could and tomorrow to go and see after my property I went immediately to my drawer; I missed a silver watch, two silver seals, a pair of silver salts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the silver salt cellars. - A. I gave thirty five shillings for them; the silver pepper box I gave one pound eighteen shillings for it; I missed that and a pair of silver table spoons, they are worth about thirty shillings, and a silver mustard pot two pound, a pair of silver salt spoons I gave fourteen shillings for them; the two silver seals were marked with E. P.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen these things before you went out. - A. I put the watch in the draw from off the mantle piece, and then I saw all the other articles there just before I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lodged with you. - A. A month and three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever been in your room where you left the things. - A. On the Sunday morning his wife was very ill, he came in the room and asked me to lend him a spoon for some company that he had; I looked for a pewter spoon, I could not find it; I went to the drawer; I gave him one of the silver spoons, I said Mr. Davey, I will beg of you to take care of this spoon till you return it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he standing at that time, when you opened your draw. - A. At my room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see where you took it from. - A. Yes, my drawer fronts the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so situated that he could see what was in the drawer. - A. Yes, it was the middle drawer he could see.</p>
               <p>Q. This you say was on Sunday morning - on what day did you miss the goods. - A. On Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house besides the prisoner on the Wednesday. - A. Nobody but him.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a married man, I suppose his wife lived with him. - A. Yes, they lived together, she was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was out was he. - A. My husband is at sea, and there was no person left in my room when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade does the prisoner carry on. - A. He is a journeyman carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your things again. - A. The next morning Mr. Grindel brought all the things forward that I lost; they are here. The prisoner took the two seals off the watch, and had them up his coat sleeve; I saw them the same day they were found, with the duplicates. I saw the officer search him in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out at four o'clock on the 17th of December. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it, light or dark. - A. Darkish; I could distinguish any body.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell what time the property was stolen. - A They were pawned between six and seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Court. That you cannot know yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Monday night did not you set my wife's gown and petticoat on fire. - A. No, I never set any thing on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send me to pledge the goods to make up the affair between us. - A. No, I never clapped my eyes on you that day; the night before that if I had not gone down stairs just as I did, my place would have been on fire; you and your wife were both in liquor; she sate her own gown alight by smoking; I said to her, ma'am, your gown is on fire; I put it out myself, I came down by accident to get a pitcher of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you drinking all that evening till you was so drunk I was obliged to put you out of the room. - A. I never was in the room to drink any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I go to the magistrate to get a warrant and the magistrate would not grant a warrant - did you not take me to the Cock and Neptune and make me drunk, and you was drunk yourself. - A. No, I never saw you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tie up the things in your handkerchief, and tell me to pawn them for three pound; you told me they had been often there before, you told me not to tell any soul. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You called me up in the room in the morning, you asked me if I would be any thing towards making up your loss; I said I did not care if it cost me five pounds, so as you lost nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any truth in that. - A. No truth whatever; I never set sight of the man all the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever pledged any of these things. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you keep an house of ill fame. I was deluded to go and live with a woman that was not my wife; by this woman's persuading her she let me have the room. - A. I have not a creature in my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By being down at that house I have made all my friends my foes.</p>
               <p>MR. GRINDEL. I am a pawnbroker. On Monday the 16th

            . I am an officer belonging to Shadwell office. On Thursday morning the 17th of December, Mrs. Sibley came down to our office and told us she had been robbed; I went with a brother officer; the prisoner was at home; he was some time before he would open the door, but he did open it at last; we told him he was the person that we suspected had robbed Mrs. Sibley. We asked him if he would give us leave to search him, he did. I found two duplicates upon him, which exactly answered to the property that was lost.

             told her she had left her door open.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it. - A. About eight o'clock; she said she was quite sure it was not, she had got the key in her pocket; she asked me if I would go and see; I said I was going out with my eight o'clock beer, I would look. I did go. I found the street door open; I tried the room door that Mrs. Sibley lives in, it was fast; I put my hand against it. I had no candle, I did not examine the lock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All that I have got to say in my own defence is, that this woman sent me to pawn the things; that we were drinking together on Monday night, and the greater part of Tuesday till the evening; she wanted some supper, I told her I had got no more money; she said if I would go and pawn the things she would have a good supper. I pawned the things for her; I told the pawnbroker my name and where I lived. We went to a house, we had a goose and half a pig, but where it was I do not know. The next morning she called me up, and said she was robbed; I thought she was in joke, as the things were pawned, because she told me I was not to say any thing to any body about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN - You must be satisfied in the first place of the prisoner having broken open the apartment of this woman, and that it was so dark that the face of a man could not be distinguished. By her own account she went out at four o'clock. We have no means of knowing the precise time when these goods were taken, if they were taken; - it might be two or three minutes after she went out, or it might be two hours after she went out. The best way is to take it the most favourable to the prisoner, and that this was not done when the face of a man was easily mistaken. Then the main point to consider is this - whether he stole the goods or not; - that these goods were pledged by this man is quite clear, and he does not deny it. - On the part of Mrs. Sibley she would have you believe that this man must have taken the goods, because he pledged them; - on the other hand the prisoner would have you to believe that is not the case, but that they were given to him by her to pledge; that this woman gets drunk, and that it is a house of ill fame. That it is a disorderly house the pawnbroker has proved it. - He further stated, that she set his wife's gown and petticoat on fire, after having been drinking together; they had a quarrel, and they were to have a supper to make it up; that is the account he gave. - It is remarkable that the watch was found at the pawnbroker's, accompanied with all the other things; the seals to be sure were found in his pocket; that is a circumstance which appears as if he was acting for himself, and that he was doing business for himself, and not for another, because he put the seals in his pocket; he did not go to a pawnbroker at a considerable distance, but one that is near, and where in fact he is known; that is a circumstance in his favour; add to this he gave the pawnbroker his name and where he lived. The pawnbroker said that he did understand there had been words, and that was the occasion of his pawning the articles. - The officer found these two seals in his pocket, which is a symptom that he had taken them; these he converted to his own use. - If you think there is sufficient said upon the testimony of the prosecutrix to be satisfied that he was the person who did break this door, enter the room, and take the goods against her inclination and pawned them, then you will find him guilty of stealing in the dwelling house to the value of more than forty shillings. The prisoner so far from concealing his name, he pawned them in his own name, and to a pawnbroker in the neighbourhood. Another circumstance in his favour - she has told you she had never parted with any part of these goods; whereas it does appear by the pawnbroker that she had pawned the watch. - If you are of opinion there was a matter of dispute to be settled between him and her, she wishing to make it up, and at her desire a sum of money was to be raised on these goods, and that he pledged them for that purpose - if you are satisfied that you are upon good grounds that he did not actually steal the goods, you will upon that acquit him.</p>

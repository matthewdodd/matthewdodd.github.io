            . I am a turnkey of Newgate, and was present about a fortnight ago when Lavender came and asked to see Charles Jones - he was in the yard at the time; it was in the middle of the day - there might be upwards of twenty prisoners in the yard; the prisoner was walking up and down with the rest, for Lavender to point him out if he could - Lavender was looking through a window, and had full view of all the prisoners in the yard; the prisoner did not come up to the window - he came towards the rails in front; they all walked up and down the yard several times - no means were used by me to conceal him, but I understand he had a different hat on to what he wore before; he did not come on any other day to my knowledge - I had told the prisoner a person was coming to identify him. and, I believe, he changed his coat after I told him so - we always tell them when any body is coming to look at them.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q.You told him somebody was coming to look at him, and he changed his dress? A. Yes; the window is grated: it is a good square place - the men walked up and down the middle of the yard in front.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you many people recognized through the window? A. Yes; as he could not identify him through the window, I opened the gate and let him go close up to the rails to see better.</p>

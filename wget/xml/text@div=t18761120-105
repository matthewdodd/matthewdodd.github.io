                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Brighton Police</hi>). On Sunday morning, the 9th July, I was on duty in the London Road, Preston, about 7.30 a.m., and saw the prisoner walking in the direction of Brighton, from Preston—she had a bundle on her left arm—I wished her good morning, and she said "I wish you good morning, sir; what time does the train leave for Burgess Hill, as I have left my situation, and am going there for a few days; I have another one to go into, and am going to see some friends "—I was then close to her—I told her that I could not tell her what time the train started—I heard a noise inside her bundle, and asked her what the bundle contained—she said "Dirty clothes "—I told her that I must look inside the bundle, and see what there was, as there was something besides dirty clothes—she said nothing until I began to open the top part of the bundle, when she said "Oh! do let me go and bury it, for it is quite dead "—I saw the head of a child, and told her that it was not dead, for I could distinctly hear it making a noise, and that I must take her to the station, and I did so—the parcel was opened there, and it contained a female child, with the string of a petticoat tied three times round its neck, and the ends tucked underneath the folds—I sent for a cab, and took the prisoner to the work-house infirmary—the string was very tight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It could not have been on very tight or the child would have died, would it not, before you got to the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was wound round three times; it was not so very tight—the child's breathing resembled that of a puppy; it laboured very much when it was drawing its breath, I could see that—it appeared to be a great relief to the child when the string was taken off, it breathed much easier, and then began to cry—I asked the prisoner on the way to the station, where the child was born, she said in a field near the church at Preston, at 4 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What first attracted, my notice to the prisoner was that I saw her looking very ill, and a man told me she had been sitting by the church gate for three quarters of an hour—she is very deaf; she did not seem excited when she spoke to me—the noise inside the parcel attracted my attention—it was a parcel done up in brown paper, carried underneath her waterproof—the noise I heard was a cry resembling that of a puppy just born, or more of a moaning—I could not have heard it if I had been so far off as that door—I was touching her—she did not appear to hear the noise at all—I was about a mile from the police-station when I took her into custody, and she walked that distance with me—she carried the parcel, but I assisted her—I took hold of her arm, and assisted her along; she was in a very weak condition—she was not fainting then, but she did after I got to the station, and I got a cab—it took me about twenty-five minntes to get her to the station, and during that time I had not opened the bundle except</p>

               <p>merely at the top, so that for twenty-five minutes the string which was, as I say, tight round the neck, had not been removed, and yet the child was breathing—I had only opened the parcel just enough to see the child's head—I did not see its face then because I saw she was in a very weak state, and I wanted to get her to the station—I did not think at the time that the child was in state to require immediate assistance—I could not judge whether the cry was that of a child undergoing the process of strangulation; at any rate, I did not open it till I got to the station—I was there when it was opened; the parcel was about 2 feet long, with several dirty petticoats, and the child inside them, and it was done up in brown paper—a petticoat was round the child—the string was still attached to the petticoat and the petticoat was wrapped round the child, and the brown paper round the petticoat—the petticoat was retained in its place by means of the tape round the neck—the end of the string, which was attached to the petticoat was the first round the child; I mean that the part of the string which was fastened to the petticoat; the part nearest to the petticoat went round the neck first—I went to the workhouse with the prisoner in a cab, and took the child with me—no medical man saw the child till some time after we got to the workhouse—two minutes after we got to the station I assisted in taking the string off the child's neck—we simply unwound it, we did not cut it, we simply took hold of the end and pulled it out—it came out. easily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I took the prisener into custody when I saw the head of the child—the noise of the child first attracted my attention; it sounded like a child that had something round its neck—I cannot say whether the noise was like that of a child being suffocated—it was a free sound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 1, Robert Street, Brighton—on 8th July, the prisoner hired my room for two nights, and came into it about 10 o'clock that evening—I heard her about very early in the morning,. which caused me to get up, and I saw her go out about 6 o'clock and cross the road, and turn up North Road; that is in the direction of Preston—she turned the corner, and I did not see her again till I saw her at the Town Hall—at 9 o'clock, a policeman came and told me something, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I went into the room and examined the bed, and was fully convinced that a birth had taken place there, as I saw what is usual on such occasions—I am able to say that from my own knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon to the work house infirmany, Brighton—on the morning of 9th July, the prisoner was admitted to the lying in ward, at about 8.30—I examined her and found that she had been recently delivered, but it was not complete; the child had been born, but the after birth had not been taken away—she said nothing at that time—I examined the child and found that the string had been cut, about a foot from the body and there was a mark round the neck, evidently produced by some string or tape; it was a narrow mark—the tape is not here; it was cut off—the neck was reddened as if from the pressure of a piece of string or tape; the skin was broken, and it took about a fortnight to heal—as far as I could judge that wound was caused by the pressure of a string.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. It was an abrasion of the skin and it ulcerated after<lb></lb>wards—the mark was just over the trachea—that is a spot where if there is</p>

               <p>any tight pressure, even on a grown person, it would be serious, a grown person would be rendered absolutely powerless in a moment by any strong pressure there—the mark might have been accidental—a ligature round the neck must have been tight to produce that mark—supposing that the string was so tight as to cause the abrasion, it would be impossible for a newly born child to bear it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RAVEN</hi>. In my opinion the string might have been tighter and become slackened—I believe that was accidental—the prisoner afterwards told me in the course of the day that she did not know what possessed her to try and kill the child—the child stayed in the infirmary, and the prisoner left well, on August 8th. (<hi rend="italic">The child was now in the prisoner's arms.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was in bed when I first saw her—I had to use ordinary force to complete the labour; it was not the process of nature—I merely asked her how it was she got into this trouble, and she told me she did not know what possessed her to try and kill the child—I think she heard my question—when I said "this trouble," I meant being arrested—she was in a very weak state, but she was able to speak; she had rallied then; she was walking about the ward in nine days or a fortnight, and the child took about a fortnight to recover; it was with its mother all the time, and I treated it for a laceration of the neck—the wound was about 1/8 of an inch long all round the neck—it was an abrasion—in newly-born children very little is required to make a serious wound—there is not a tendency in the, folds of the neck to show very bad signs, but there is lower down—I do not think the same cause that would bring forward a tendency to produce those marks would cause laceration—there was a mark on the windpipe—no lasting mark is left on the child—I was in Court and heard the whole of the case before the committing Magistrate—the prisoner is very deaf and there was no" one defending her—I did not hear the answers she made to the Magistrate's questions.</p>

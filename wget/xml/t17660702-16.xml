I went into the house; the prisoner and another woman laid hold of my collar; I called some of the men to take hold of the woman; they did, and I went forward and found some pieces of board; there were ten pieces, some twelve or fourteen feet in length; they were cutting them I suppose to burn; the fire that was burning was of deal boards; they were boiling of cloaths; they had drawn a deal board over into their garden, and after I searched the house, that deal board was raised up to be put on the pile, but was not put up.</p>

            . I know the long deal, and others too that we found to be the prosecutor's property: they were deals that had been in the yard three years; I laid them on the pile myself; I told them what pile they came from before I went to look upon the pile, after I had seen them.</p>

               <p>I am only servant in the house; the boards were to keep up the ground in the garden; I split some to put on the fire; I know no more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is it possible a woman could get the deals from a pile without the assistance of a man? </p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a man in the house, he secreted himself a good while, till the beadle found him.</p>
               <p>Heard. I had them all three in custody, and the prisoner said she did it all herself, and cleared the other two.</p>
               <p>Thomas. The prisoner is only a servant there; she has lived there two or three months. The mistress was in the house at the time.</p>

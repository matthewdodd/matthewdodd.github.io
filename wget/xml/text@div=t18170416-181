On the 12th of March, I saw a cart that I suspected, with two men by the horses; I asked them what their load was, they said - A drunken man. I walked gently on by the side of the cart, and a man jumped out-it was the prisoner; before this I asked them who the cart belonged to; they said, "Joseph Jennings, Islington." The prisoner walked by the side of the cart, I asked him who was the owner, he said it was his; I told him I would speak to him, and all three ran away, leaving me with the cart and horses."Jennings, Islington," was written on the cart. I found forty-five dozen of stockings in the cart, and one odd pair, covered over with the hay. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I had seen him before; it was about half-past eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

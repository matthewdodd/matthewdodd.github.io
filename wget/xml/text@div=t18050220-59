               <p>Q. What happened to you as you were going along together? - A. He seemed to keep behind me; I called to him to come up to me, as I had walked a little way before him; he said, aye, aye, I am coming, and when I looked round again, I did not see him; I called him by name, he did not answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag tied up? - A. Yes; the next day after I heard he was hanging out at Rosemary-lane, and the next morning I found him at the Three Kings, in White's yard, Rosemary-lane; he had then a shirt and jacket of mine on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you take him into? - A. The Old Fountain, in Rosemary-lane; there I gave charge of him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing? - A. He said nothing in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner? - A. No farther than I gave the description of the shirt and jacket, and when it was examined it had the particular marks on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you had not engaged him for a seaman? - A. I tendered him, but they would not accept him; they said he was a good for nothing old man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a seaman? - A. I am; but I do not belong to any ship at present.</p>

             sworn. - I am headborough: I produce a jacket and a shirt, which I took from the prisoner on the 12th of February, at the Three Kings, in Rosemary-lane; I asked him if he had got the clothes Mr. Graham had given him in charge, for he said he had taken them to the Old Fountain; after that he said he had taken them out of that house; I asked the prosecutor if he had any private mark on his clothes, as he said they were his that he had on his back; he said, yes, and gave me the mark; the shirt was marked on the shoulder and the jacket on the belly; I turned up the jacket and found the marks. (The shirt and jacket identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Where had you come from before you went to Gracechurch-street? - A. From Rosemary-lane up to my house, and from there to Gracechurch-street; he brought the things from my house with me.</p>

They had forced the iron cramps out of their sockets. I went with Mr. Chapman to the goldsmith's arms, in Earl-street; there I found Garnan asleep, his coat-pocket was turned over his thigh. I had him searched. There was found in his pocket three table-spoons, four tea-spoons, the silver salt, and tea-tongs. A pewter pepper-box and a tea-spoon have been found since. (Produced in court and deposed to.) I took him to justice Welch's, and he was committed.</p>

Coming back, I went in at the Goldsmith's arms. There was the prisoner Garnan sitting on the coal-box, and another person asleep at the table. I said, we had had a robbery in the neighbourhood. A person there took me into another room, and asked what things were lost? I said, spoons; a salt-seller. He asked me if I knew the mark? I said, No. He said, the person sitting on the box had shewed him such things. I said, they are Mr. Mould's. I desired him to stay till I fetched him. (It was not above twenty yards distance.) We got a constable, and awaked the prisoner Garnan; and the spoons and salt-seller were taken out of his pocket, which Mr. Mould swore to before Mr. Welch. There he said;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250032"></xptr> he and three more broke into Mr. Mould's house.</p>

After that Mr. Chapman came in; I told him of it. He said, Mr. Mould had been robbed of such things. He fetched him. The prisoner was searched, and the things taken out of his pocket. He was taken before justice Welch: there he confessed he and three more got into Mr. Mould's house, and took the things; but he would not tell their names.</p>

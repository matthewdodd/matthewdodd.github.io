                  </hi>. I live at 5, Cottage Square, Lock's Fields—tie deceased, who was my husband, was a soda-water bottler; his age was 43—we occupied the front room, and the prisoner and her husband the adjoining one—their door was outside our door; they both opened on to a narrow passage—the stairs were in front of my door—on Saturday, June 9th, we were in our room; we had just come in, and my husband was not sober—he sat down and took off his coat and boots—the prisoner began talking from her room to my husband, who opened the door and held it with his right hand, standing partly on the landing—I remained in the room, and heard him say "Oh, Lizzie, I am burnt to death"—T saw him one mass of flames, and saw some pieces of glass and drops of paraffine fall on our floor—they frequently had a paraffine lamp in their room—I tried to <hi rend="italic">daft</hi> the flames, and my husband ran downstairs—I went down and saw Mr. Hearn standing by the street door—I saw my husband rolled up in coats and taken to Guy's Hospital—I did not see the prisoner, I only heard her voice—through me and my husband the Hearnes had had notice to quit—we made frequent complaints to the landlady, as their quarrelling disturbed us, and she gave them notice to go.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> My husband did not swear to settle yours before he came out of the room—he did not say that he would have his life that night—he was not in the house ten minutes before he was in flames—my husband did not say "I will have the b——," and burst the door open, nor did the lamp fall from your hand in your fright, on the landing.</p>

The deceased was brought to the station with only his trowsers on and a rug over him; we took him to the hospital—I then went and knocked at the door of the prisoner's room, and was let in, and saw Hearne and his wife and two children—I told them I should have to take them in custody for the injury done to the man—he said "All right," but she said "I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, my husband had nothing to do</p>

               <p>with it whatever; I threw the lamp, and am very sorry for it"—I took them to the station, the charge was made, and she still adhered to her statement that she had done it—Mr. Wheeler gave me part of a broken lamp, and here are some pieces of glass which I found on the landing—I also found a whole lamp at Hearne's—the prisoner was sober—her husband was a little the worse for drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in the same house—my mother is the landlady, and the Hearnes were her tenants—f heard Mr. and Mrs. Jackson's voices, and Mr. and Mrs. Hearne and Mr. Jackson came out on the landing and banged the door, and it was opened, and I heard a smash and screams, and saw the man on the stairs in a blaze—I ran and caught him at his own door, and tried to put it out, but burnt my hands, and, with the assistance of another man, held him on the ground and tore his shirt off, and went and got a rug, and while I was putting it over him the prisoner said "It was not him, it was me threw the lamp at him"—after I came from the station I saw the prisoner again, and she said "I bare done it, I know I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I beg for mercy, he burst the door open, I had the lamp in my hand and threw it at him, but not with such an intention, I did it through terror. He has always been on at my husband because he is a quiet man; only a fortnight previous when I had my daughter at home he said he would kick the door in, and I fastened it to keep him out. He burst the door open to take my husband's life, and I believe one blow would have killed him. He was a very violent man, and his wife had to walk the streets for two nights, as he ran about with a knife in his hand; my hus<lb></lb>band locked the door.</p>

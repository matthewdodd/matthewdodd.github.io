            . I am Mr. Strange's coachman, and have been so many years. On the 23d of November, I believe I was the last person up - I saw all the fastenings complete - I remember fastening the scullery door with two bolts at the top, two at the bottom, and a bar across the middle; this was about half-past ten o'clock. I was the first person down stairs in the morning, and found the door quite open: there was a round piece of wood cut quite out by some instrument - an arm could then be put in to undo the bolts: I missed two livery coats, a livery waistcoat, two pairs of boots, and a hat, belonging to me; the prisoner is my brother, I am sorry to say - he had been in the house, and slept there, some years ago; he has not called on me there for twelve months I think; I have seen some of the things, and know them again.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live at No. 52, Shoreditch. On Saturday morning, the 24th of November, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the Angel and Crown public-house, Tabernacle-square - I never saw him before; he had a bundle, two coats, and a hat-box: he was dressed in stone-blue livery, and plush breeches; there was a drab coat, boots, shoes, and a drinking born in the bundle - I did not see the hat-box opened; I bought two coats of him - they were besides the one that was in the bundle; I did not buy that one: one coat was a kind of drab great coat, with false capes, and appeared like a servant's coat; it had plain buttons, I believe: the other was a close drab coat, with lace on it, and livery buttons; I also bought a pair of top-boots, and two pairs of women's shoes. I gave 20s. for the whole lot - I sold the two coats to Mr. Folkard, a pawnbroker, of Sun-street, for 24s. I have the boots and shoes here. I saw "Strange, Enfield," written on the hat-box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose your attention was taken up with looking at the things? A. I looked at the prisoner; I might not be a quarter of an hour buying the coats - he had a hat, I cannot say whether it was on, but he was in the house all day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Although you were only a quarter of an hour dealing, how long were you in his company? A. I was in the house from half-past nine o'clock till five in the evening: he was there all the time, and I left him there - Mr. Holmes was there.</p>

            . In November last the prisoner lodged with me. I remember the night the robbery was said to be committed - he did not come home that night, for we did not go to bed till near one o'clock; he was not at home then; I did not see him till the Sunday morning: I make the beds myself - his bed had been lain in - I went up at nine o'clock in the morning, and saw some clothes lying in the room; I went in, and made the bed. I found a spur on the floor, and another between the sheet and blanket; an orange coloured waistcoat laid on the table, and in a chair was a piece of new calico - there was a dirty shirt on the floor. I went into the other room, and saw him - I knocked at the door for a broom - he came to the door: he had a drab coat on; he usually wore a blue livery: there was a blue livery coat on a chair in his room - this was on Sunday morning. I do not think he went out all that day, but he might have gone out: he went out on the Monday, but, having a private door, I do not always know who goes out; his apartment was afterwards searched, and nothing found, but in the next room where Lee lives, a shirt, some stockings, and handkerchiefs were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you went into the room in the morning you found him there? A. Yes, on the Sunday morning - the bed appeared to have been lain in, but whether for an hour, or how long. I could not tell; he did not sleep at home at all on the Friday night, and he was not at home on the Saturday night, between twelve and one o'clock, when we went to bed.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield. In consequence of the prosecutor being robbed, I went in search, and on the 6th of December I saw the prisoner at the Swan public-house, Southampton-court, near Russel-square; I told him his brother thought it very strange he did not come to see him, knowing he was very ill: he said he had not an opportunity. I then said I wanted him on suspicion of a robbery at Enfield - he asked where - I said, at Mr. Strange's, where his brother was: he said he knew nothing at all about it - that he was never at Enfield, and was willing to go to the office; I asked where he lodged - he said he had no lodging. I took him to Worship-street - I asked him again next morning, where he lodged - he said at a baker's-shop in Phoenix-street, Somer's-town, but he could not tell the No. - I went to a baker's-shop, at No. 8, kept by Mr. Reed, whose wife has been examined; I searched the lodgings there, and found some handkerchiefs, stockings, and shirts, and some calico - the corners of the handkerchiefs are cut off. The things were in Joseph Lee's room - I produce them.</p>

            . I am a broker and cabinet-maker, and live at No. 53, Wilsted-street, Somer's-town. About the end of November I had the stock of a centre-bit in my shop; it is an open shop - the prisoner came in on a Tuesday or Wednesday, and asked if it was for sale: I said No - that I used it in my business, but I had no objection to lend it him - he said, what would I charge? I said, "If you will tell me where you live, I will bring it;" he said, at No. 8, Woburn-place, but he came back and said, "Perhaps master will not like its being brought there - I will leave you the value of it;" I said, "Very well:" he came again on Friday, the 21st or 22d, left 3s. as security for it, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100038"></xptr>it away; I think I saw a centre-bit in his hand when he came for the stock. On the Monday I went out, and found it there when I came home; I found it was broken - I inquired at No. 8, Woburn-place, but could not find him there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was about the 21st or 22d - might it be on a Saturday? A. No, I am certain it was not.</p>

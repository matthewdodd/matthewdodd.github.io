            . I am labourer to Mr. Cane - the prosecutor is his bailiff. On Friday morning, the 13th of May, in consequence of something I heard, I went to Barrett, the constable of Whitton, and went with him to the prisoner's house - the prisoner was at home, and in bed; Barrett took him into custody, and left me in charge of the house - Barrett returned in about an hour; this was between ten and eleven o'clock - about twenty minutes after he returned, I saw him find two parts of a flitch of bacon, which I knew - I had seen it every day in master's house, which the prosecutor lives in; I can safely swear it is the bacon I had seen in Gordon's house - it is his bacon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the bacon in the house a whole flitch, or part of one? A. Part of a flitch - it was in one piece in the house; I know it by its appearance - I saw a piece cut out of it the night before, and when the constable drew it out from under the bed he said, "Do you know this?" I said Yes - I had seen it so many times in the house I can swear to it - the two pieces found join together. I have no mark on them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. I worked with him three days, and only knew him by that.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I heard of Gordon's robbery, and saw the prisoner in the cage at Hounslow on Thursday afternoon - he asked me if I would change jackets with him - he said "Because the old woman can swear to that jacket;" he said he would send my jacket back again, and his wife was to have his back - he said his was better than mine; I did not change with him: he put the jacket between the bars, between eight and nine o'clock, and told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300007"></xptr>me to strip; I would not - his wife took it away: I went up the street, leaving it in her possession.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The jacket, I believe, has never been found? A. I have not seen it; mine is here, which he wanted to exchange for it - he told me he had had the jacket in his possession about two years - that it had been laying about in his box, and he had never worn it, but he said the old woman said she could swear to it; I had been looking out for work two or three days before this - I had not been at Gordon's; I live at Hounslow - I did not tell the officer of this conversation; I told my father of it at breakfast next morning - he went and told the constable, and they sent for me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a jacket was it? A. A white flannel one, such as labourers usually wear.</p>

C., and here is a rent where the mark was, and a patch put on: here is the mark of some liver and crow on it, by which I know it - the constable brought the prisoner out of the cage at Hounslow to me on the Friday afternoon, about one o'clock; I observed the jacket he had on, and knew it - it was my husband's: I knew it by the mark where the binding was loosened behind - the constable said, "What do you think of it?" I said, in the prisoner's presence, "That will do;" the constable sent me out of the room while he had some refreshment, and then put him in the cage again.</p>

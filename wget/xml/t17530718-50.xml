I did not hear her name; he said, he heard she was gone to live with another man, and that he thought she was dead, for he had not seen her for 3 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that woman to day?</p>
               <p>Owen. Yes, I drank part of a pint of beer with her, and I am sure she is the same woman I saw before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was charg'd did he deny his marriage ?</p>
               <p>Owen. No, he spoke as civil to her as a man could speak, and said before a great many in the room, that, she was his lawful wife, and he would not deny it.</p>

The justice ask'd whether the accusation was true, he said, he was married to them both, to one eleven years ago, and to the other in last April; then the justice ask'd him whether he knew any difference in the ceremony, he said, he beliv'd them to be much a-like; then the justice ask'd him which wife he lik'd best, he said, he lik'd the last best, and should like to live with her; when his mittimus was made he desir'd I would intercede to make it up for him, I told him as he acquies'd in the felony, I could not make it up, but he must submit to.</p>

               <p>I did own her to be sure, but she has absconded herself from me for four years. I had a very good account that she was dead, but I have heard since that she was married to another man, that goes by the names of Staves, and lives at Deptford. It was easy for her to write to me, for I have been upon the same spot ever since; and I did not know where to send to her, so that last April I was married again.  <rs id="t17530718-50-verdict263" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I was returning home last Wednesday night, about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock, and about half way up Whitecross-street I saw the prisoner with two other men and three females going slowly in the same direction I was—I stepped off the pavement into the road, endeavouring to pass them, and while doing so, the prisoner laid hold of me by the two sides of my coat—he let go of one side of me, and put his arm down me, and one of the females behind me hit my hat completely over my eyes—I felt the prisoner's hands about me in front, about my watch-chain—I partly got away from them, when he again seized me, and in the act of doing so I called out "Police" twice—a policeman came up, and I gave him into custody—I lost nothing—I had a watch in my fob, and in the scuffle the chain and seals got into my side breeches' pocket.</p>

On the night in question I was in Whitecross-street—I heard a scuffle, and went towards it—as I was going, I heard the prosecutor call out, "Police, police, "—when I got up there I saw the prisoner and two more males and three females there—the pri<lb></lb>soner's arm was round the prosecutor's neck, and the prosecutor's hat was over his eyes—as soon as he saw me, he said, "Policeman, I give that man in charge for attempting to rob me of my watch"—I immediately took him—he said; "If I have done any thing I must go with you, but do not handle me as though I was a thief"—he appeared as though he had been drinking, but he knew what he was about.</p>

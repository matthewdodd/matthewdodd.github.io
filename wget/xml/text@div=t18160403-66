               <p>JOSIAH SMITH. The prisoner came to our shop on the 4th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and bought a yard of calico, for which she paid ten-pence, and a handkerchief, for which she paid two shillings. She went away immediately after paying for these things. In about a quarter of an hour after, an officer of the name of Maidment brought her back to my shop; when she was brought back, she had two quantities of printed cotton; one was about nine yards; the other about four yards and three quarters; the cost price of the two was about thirty shillings, and I have no doubt but that they were my property; the nine yards, which cost about twenty shillings, I can swear to; to the other, I cannot so positively. These things had been near where the prisoner stood. I and a neighbour of mine were the only persons in the shop when she came in. My neighbour is not here.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Winfield's, the pawnbroker's at the corner of Compton-street, High-street, St. Giles's; I was in the pawnbroker's shop when she came; she offered to pawn the smallest piece of cotton, and asked eight shillings on it. I asked her whether she had been to treat herself to a new gown? and she said, yes. I asked her how much it took to make a gown? and she said, six yards. I asked her had she six yards? she said, she had, and when the pawnbroker measured it, there were but four and three quarters. That excited a suspicion in me, and I asked her if she had not something else in her apron? she said, she had, and what she had got there, she had brought from her mother's. I asked her if she would let me see it? and she said, no. I thought she had not come honestly by it, and I was determined to see what she had got in her apron, and I found the other piece of print, together with the calico and handkerchief. I asked her if she would take me where she bought them? and she said, she would; and she took me to Mr. Smith's. I asked him whether she brought the calico and handkerchief there? and he said, she had. I asked him whether she had bought the cotton there? and he said, she had not; and it was his property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As soon as I turned out of the prosecutor's shop, a strange woman followed me, and asked me if I wanted to buy a cheap gown? and I told her, no; I had bought all I wanted. She asked me fourteen shillings for this cotton, and I was going away twice, and she offered it for twelve shillings; when I unfortunately gave her my market money, and was about to pledge the cotton again, as I could not do without it; and when I was pledging it, the officer stopped me.</p>

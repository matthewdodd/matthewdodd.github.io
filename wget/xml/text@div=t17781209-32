I lay in the first floor; my father, mother, and two sisters all lay upon the same floor. Soon after I heard the noise, I saw several fellows come up. My room door was open; they came to my door; three of them came in.</p>
               <p>Did they bring any lanthorn or light with them? - They had three or four candles lighted. One of the three men had a handkerchief over his forehead .</p>

               <p>Were there any lights in your room? - Yes; all the time. There were two candles in the room, sometimes three.</p>

               <p>Had he any disguise upon his face? - No; none at all. He had on a brownish coloured great coat, almost a copper colour, buttoned together round him. I saw him very plain two or three times.</p>

               <p>My Lord, there was a prosecution against, I think, four men for this burglary, who were all convicted . Three have been executed; Condon, one of the four persons convicted was, (I presume, upon well-grounded doubt stated to the crown) respited, and has since had his sentence changed to working on the Thames; therefore it is fit the Court should know, that there has been an enquiry upon this subject before, and that there have been three executed. The whole will turn upon this; what sort of credit is to be given to this kind of positive evidence as to identity .</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The question is, whether you did not swear to

            ? - I did not swear positively to Carleton.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, you had been a-bed an hour when this man broke into the house? - More than that.</p>
               <p>I suppose you must have been a good deal frightened? - Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>And these men continued in your house some time! - Near two hours.</p>
               <p>Did you lie with a light in your room? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You had no light at all in your room? - No; only the lights they brought up stairs with them.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Hartley before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Nor you had never heard his voice before? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did they cover you up? - No. One of them struck me on the back, and bid me lie down. I laid down upon my side. One was going to throw the clothes over my face; the other said they should not, and I had only the sheet and blanket upon my face, and sometimes they were off. I was taken out of bed afterwards.</p>
               <p>I should suppose you thought your life in danger during this time? - To be sure I did. I did not see the first man only now and then; he came in two or three times, but did not stay above a minute or so in the room when he did come in.</p>
               <p>He never came close to the bed to you? - A yard and half or two yards from the bed.</p>
               <p>Where were the candles? - They had them in their hands. One man stood by me a little time.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - No. My back was to him.</p>
               <p>Did not he take care that your face should be covered? - He cried out now and then. you don't see do you? you don't see do you? He was at the drawers.</p>
               <p>What is there particular in this man's voice that you can swear to it? - He has a very remarkable gruff voice, and I know him by his face.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether the back-door had been fastened over night? - It was bolted, I think. There were marks where it had been forced open.</p>

             is one; the first or second man had a dark lanthorn, and he came with the face of the lanthorn into the door, that enabled me to see them all; it showed a light in the room. One of our carters, that lay in the next bed, jumped out immediately. The maid called to him, Will Carter; he ran to the door, and seeing them come up stairs; he said, Lord, have mercy upon us! there are a parcel of fellows broke into the house! He got under the bed, and his bed-fellow got under the bed after him. The men saw them, and pulled them out, and made them get into bed. One of them called them villains, and said, he would cut their bloody heads off. They all went down stairs, but they had covered us all up close; Hartley stood at the door to see if any body moved. When he was at the door there was no light in the room; when they took the light away, I thought I could get from under the bed, and get into bed; I was afraid, if they saw me there, they would kill me. The bed was so low that they heard me; Hartley cried out, you bloody thieves, d - n your eyes and limbs, and so on; upon which they all came tumbling up stairs again. Will Quick had thrown the clothes off him; they thought it was he that made the noise. One of them said, blow his brains out, cut his bloody head off. They covered him up again, and struck him on the head with, I believe, a pistol.</p>

               <p>Was that lanthorn left in the room? - Not directly; it was not when they came up again. There was always a light in the room, from the time they were there till they went down again; they brought up the lanthorn with them again the second time; they halloo'd out to those below to bring more candles.</p>
               <p>How came you to know that Hartley was the person that continued behind? - I could see him when he came to cover us up . I lay with my face towards the door; I could see them go up stairs; I know him by his reprobate swearing; and I knew him again by his voice when he was at Sir

               <p>Hartley. He said he was two hours under the bed? - I was near two hours under the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was you in the bed, lying with your face towards the door, when you said you could see them go up and down stairs? - No; it was while I laid under the bed. I continued under the bed as they came up stairs, and prevented my getting from under it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You immediately got under the bed when you heard the noise? - Yes, till they came all tumbling into the room. While they were getting the men out, I got under the bed.</p>
               <p>Was you waked by the noise of the people coming into the house, or only when they came into your room? - I waked when they were at my mistres's room door swearing.</p>
               <p>That was soon after they got in? - Yes; They were swearing there, that waked me, and before I could well get out of bed they were coming up stairs.</p>
               <p>And during that two hours this Hartley continued in the room all the time? - Yes, except he went down for about ten minutes; he said he would go and see if there was any victuals or drink in the house.</p>
               <p>He only went down once? - Yes; only once.</p>
               <p>Then this man did not leave your room several times during the two hours? - I do not think that he left it more than that once. There were several fresh ones of them came up. I cannot be positive he staid in the room all the time; I know he went down once; I believe he did not go down often.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see this man before the 1st of March? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw him till you saw him at Sir

            's people attending about you there? - I saw them come over the way; they told me to go in; when I came in they got up the yard. Nobody said they were the men till they came to the bar and began talking.</p>
               <p>Did not they give you a hint? - No indeed, nor nobody ever said a word to me that they were coming. One of the door-keepers told me to go in; they were coming up the yard. I heard the irons rattle, and looked back.</p>
               <p>What difference is there between his voice and many other people's? - I know him very well by his voice.</p>
               <p>What, because it is gruff? - I know him by his speech, and his swearing when he was up stairs. He talked so much there, that I knew him again.</p>
               <p>You believe him to be the man, because he talked and swore a good deal? - Yes, and by his face. He had a brown coat on, buttoned up close.</p>
               <p>How nigh is your young mistress's room to your garret? - Upon the first pair of stairs. You go along a little entry; there is my young master Dickey's door; then we turn to the right to my young misstress's door which is nearly opposite. Could the man who staid in your room, watching you, have gone out of your room without your seeing him? - He did not go down till some more came up. They came up several times to show what they had taken. One of them showed that they had got a watch; they asked what it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090034"></xptr> was o'clock.

               <p>You go out a charring? - When I can. When my master can employ me at patten-making I do it; when he does not, I get work as I can.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the matter with Hartley? - He had the gravel and stone.</p>
               <p>Court . How came you to recollect the day so particularly? - I got my husband to set down the day, for it was the day my little girl died.</p>
               <p>What day did she die? - I cannot justly say; my husband has got it down.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to recollect this day so particularly, when you cannot recollect the day your daughter died? - I was obliged to go out; things ran short with me, and I am willing to earn a trifle when I can. His business runs dead sometimes, and I do not love to be idle if I can get any thing to do.</p>
               <p>Court. Is March the second or third month in the year? - I do not know.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know Hartley? - He was a lodger of mine.</p>
               <p>Did he lodge with you at the beginning of March? - He came to me as last January. On the first of March last, which was on Sunday, he was taken very ill indeed. I was much frightened at that. I sent for a woman; I gave her 3 s. for the week, to be with him. On the Monday morning, the second of March, I went to an apothecary in Holborn; he came, and turned us both out of the room, at the time he used an instrument upon him, but what it was I cannot tell . Hartley was not out of his room for three days after he came home bad on Saturday. I sent for the woman on Sunday, which was the first of March. On Monday the second of March, I went to the gentleman, the doctor in Holborn; he used some instruments on him, and sent him some stuff, which I paid four shillings out of my pocket for. Hartley never was out of doors, not so much as out in the yard. He could not go down stairs, nor walk across the room.</p>
               <p>Where did you live at that time? - Number 20, Gray's-Inn-lane, up one-pair-of-stairs backwards.</p>
               <p>You did not keep a house, you only lodged there? - No, I gave four guineas a year for the room.</p>
               <p>Who did keep the house? - Mr. Duncan.</p>
               <p>What is he? - By all account a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>What family had he? - He built a place backwards, and let the fore part of the house out.</p>
               <p>You lodged in this house as well as Hartley? - Hartley was a man at that present time that lodged in my room.</p>
               <p>You had but one room between you? - No; I had but one room.</p>
               <p>Who was this woman that you sent for? -

               <p>When did you send for her? - On Sunday the first of March.</p>
               <p>She did not come before Sunday? - If you will be please to believe me, I sent for her on Saturday; she sent word she could not come; she would come on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>But did not she come on the Sunday? - I sent for her on the Saturday; she came to stop with me.</p>
               <p>Was she with you on Saturday at all? - I saw her, but not to stop with her.</p>
               <p>Where did she come to? - To Number 20, Gray's-Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Was she in your room on Saturday? - Yes; but not to stay. I am upon my oath; she stopped on Sunday; she was with me on Saturday, the last day of February for a little time. On the first of March she attended that man and no one else.</p>
               <p>He was so ill, that it shocked your humanity; therefore you sent for somebody else to attend him? - I could not attend him myself.</p>
               <p>Who was the doctor that attended him? - I will tell you where he lived, but the doctor is dead. He lived just against the bars.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had you a bill? - No. I paid for the medicines as I had them.</p>

               <p>How came you to recollect that this was the 1st of March? - Because on the 3d of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090037"></xptr> March. I had some money coming to me, and I had nothing to support me, but what I carried to pawn.</p>
               <p>You received some money on the 3d of March? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who paid you that money? - His name is

            , and lives at this time in Northamptonshire .</p>
               <p>What did he pay it for? - For a little place that I have down there, though it is not properly mine. The rent was paid to him; he paid it to me.</p>
               <p>Did you give him a receipt for it? - Yes, for the money; he wrote it, and I crossed it.</p>
               <p>There was nobody present to witness that receipt? - No foul . It was a Monday or Tuesday; there is one Willoway comes up that can prove it.</p>
               <p>How soon was Hartley able to go out of doors? - It was four or five days first I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Duncan knew he was ill? - Yes, at the time.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Duncan alive or dead? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have changed your lodging? - I have a house of my own since.</p>
               <p>Where? - In Little Maze-pond, (not Little Maze-court, Maze-pond, in the Borough) No. 3.</p>
               <p>You keep that house now yourself? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You do not know whether Duncan is dead or alive? - No; I know he is in Wales .</p>
               <p>Court. How long might the apothecary attend him? - The first day he came he turned us out of the room. When we came in there was the prisoner very bad; and then, on the next morning, up came the gentleman; he said he thought he should have found him dead. He lay in his bed very bad; he found him better; he asked him if he found that he was any ways injured by the instruments which he used upon him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the journeyman or apprentices of this apothecary ever attend? - Not that I know; but when I went for the stuff, I dare say the gentleman would say it now, that I always paid for them as I had them in, because I would have no bill.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you pay him? -</p>
               <p>The first time of coming I paid him half a crown for using the instruments upon him, and eighteen-pence for a small bottle of stuff; and afterwards one shilling and sixpence for every bottle of stuff sent in; four shillings the first time, and eighteen-pence for every bottle of stuff after.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mr. Duncan see him in this condition? - He was a man that was never at home. I can send for the woman that was in the next room; she saw him, and went out of the room because she thought he would die. I can send for her; she lives in one of the new houses against the Spa-fields; she went there from Duncan's.</p>
               <p>Was the woman that you hired constantly in the room with you? - She was there night and day till such time as she left the place, she had no other room but that to be in.</p>
               <p>Whenever you went out you left him in charge with

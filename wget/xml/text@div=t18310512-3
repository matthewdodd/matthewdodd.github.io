On Tuesday, the 3rd of May, about a quarter before two o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Mrs. Burket's, a Neighbour, leaving nobody in the room - I left the street door open; other lodgers were in the house - I occupy only one room, which is at the top of the house; I am sure my room door was shut, and latched - it opens right on the stairs; there is no passage - I was not absent more than a quarter of an hour, and as I returned I observed the prisoner in the street; I am sure he is the man- he was about six doors off, picking up a pair of boots in the street - I did not see a child with him; I did not then know I had lost any thing - when I got to my room, which is up two pairs of stairs, I found the door latched, as I had left it; I looked for my shawl, to put on to go out to work - I had left the shawl on the top of the bed, and I found a blanket on the top of it; this made me look about, and I missed a sheet, which I am sure was there when I left the room - I went down stairs, received information from the neighbours, and went to Petticoat-lane; I was informed the prisoner had gone down Rose-lane - I went and got information there, and found the prisoner in Petticoat-lane, with a child in his arms; this was about half-past two o'clock - he was then selling the boots for 4d.: the man gave the boots into my hands, in the prisoner's presence, and said he had bought them of the prisoner for 4d.; the prisoner said he had given 1s. for them in Petticoat-lane - the boots were my husband's, and I am sure are those I missed from my room; I also lost a gown, a shirt, and a sheet, all of which I had left safe in the room.</p>

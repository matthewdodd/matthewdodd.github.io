                  </hi>. I now live in Bloomsbury-square. In Jan., 1845, I car<lb></lb>ried on the business of a jeweler, in Argyle-place—on the 7th of Jan., 1845, the prisoner called at my house—I had known him nearly a month—(I had been dealing with him before—he had brought me some orders in Dec., 1845)—there were two diamond brooches among other things on the counter—he looked at them—I beilve he said he could sell them—I am not certain whe<lb></lb>ther he did not say he had an application to show such things to the Queen—as far as I recollect, he came for something, and said he could sell some<lb></lb>thing handsome, being commanded to get such things—I do not recollect his precise words—I believe when he had them away he said he had come expressly from Windsor—that he had on that day been employed by Her Majesty at the Castle; and, as far I recollect, he said he was sent for these brooches—that he was sent to get something handsome to show Her Majesty—some brooches or articles of jewellery—he said he was employed at the Castle, and had two guineas a-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he explain what opportunity he had of showing them to Her Majesty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I recollect, he said he was commanded to bring them, and that he had means of showing them to Her Majesty—I gave him the brooches, and told him the price of one would be 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think.</p>

               <p>One—he said he was certain of selling the other, and he would bring me the money for both of them—he said he was too late to get the check from the Palace for the money, and he could not get it till the Wednesday following—I saw him on the 15th, a week after; I do not recollect that he said anything about the brooches then, but I expected he would bring the money every day, but he never brought it—he mentioned the Prince's name to me many times—on the 5th or 6th of Jan. he had a stick from me, which he said he had sold to his Royal Highness Prince Albert—he brought me the money for that—I think he paid me for the stick before he had the brooches or the same day—I think he paid for the stick with the money he pawned the brooches for, but it is so long ago I do not know whether it was before or after; it is now two years back—he said he was too late in his application at the Palace to get check—he had to apply to the Treasurer; I think he mentioned the name, but I forget it—I saw nor heard nothing more of him till last year, and never received either brooch or money from him—in Feb., 1845, I received a letter from him—I have looked for it, but have not been able to find it—it contained two duplicates of the brooches and of two other articles—in consequence of receiving that latter I went to Mr., Lorton, a pawnbroker, in Green-street, Leicester-square—I did not see the brroches there—in consequence of what passed between me and Mr. Lorton, I after<lb></lb>wards got my brooches from Mr. Attenborough.</p>

I received the letter I have lost—I do not remember the post-mark, but I think it was King William-street, City—the substance of the letter was that he was going abroad, it was not that he was obliged to go, in consequence of a suit for a divorce that was going on, it was apologizing for this conduct to me, and returning me the duplicates, and saying that he would pay me some day—I do not think it said he was going abroad—I directly ordered inquiry to be made for him, but could never ascertain whether he had gone abroad—received information that he was in this country from a man named Wilson, who I had in my employment, and who the prisoner had brought to me as a workman, a man in distress—my affairs were not in the hands of the assignees at the time I received the information of his being in this country—I did not receive information from Wilson to take him into custody—I lost sight of him for some months—I received the next information that he was to be found only a few months back—when my attention was called by the return of the duplicates I did not refer to my books to ascertain the exact dates of the transaction; I think I had no other transaction with him till early in Jan.—I never saw him after the 15th—I had not fifteen jobs from him in Dec., I think only four, they came to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ascertain that from him my workman's books—I have one book here, in which payments appear, that is for the stick—my payments for work are in a petty cash-book, which my son kept, he is in India—I have had notice to produce that book, but cannot find it—I have lost two books, the book in which the amount paid to me for work appears is lost—I have ascertained the amount from my workman's books.</p>

               <p>whatever, except that they might be shown on approbation to Her Majesty—I can only tell you form recollection that the stick was returned to me a week or eight day after he had paid me for it—that would not be quite so late as the 15th or 16th—I think he had the rings when he brought the stick back to have the alteration in it—he said he brought the stick from the palace, because Prince Albert was about to make a present of it to the Emperor of Russia, and the Emperor being a very tall man, he wanted a very long gold ferrule to it; which I put, but he never came for it.</p>

                  </hi>. In Jan., 1845, I was in the service of Mr. Philip Lorton, Pawnbroker, of Green-Street, Leicester-square. The Prisoner came to me on the 7th of Jan., 1845, about the middle of the day, and offered two brilliant brooches—he asked for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—I lent him that day 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one of them—I had offered him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the two, which he declined taking—the articles being of great value, I questioned him particularly as to who they belonged to—he said they belonged to himself; that he had purchased the stones abroad, and had them manufactured into brooches in London—I gave him a memorandum of the transaction—on the 9th, two days after, he came again, and brought the other brooch, and I advanced him 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, which made the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave him a memorandum of that transaction—in Aug., 1845, I delivered those two brooches, with other things, into the possession of Mr. Attenborough, by order of Mr. Lorton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

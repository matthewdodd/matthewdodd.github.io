On Thursday evening, the 6th of March, the prisoner came into my house, and called for a pint of porter, while he was drinking of it, he asked me to lend him two shillings, I did not like to deny him in company, I told him I would; I went out of the parlour into the kitchen to write a letter; while I was writing the letter the prisoner came into the kitchen, and says, will you do that for me, Coxeter, meaning to lend him the two shillings, I told him, No, I had been done so many times; I told him I did not like to say so before the people, as I did not like to hurt his feelings; the prisoner left my house, and says Good night to you, God bless you, master; a gentleman had been drinking six pennyworth of brandy and water in the parlour where the prisoner came from; after the prisoner was gone Mr. Alexander, who has been in my house seventeen years, asked who took the glass and spoon out of the bar, the tap boy said he did not know, I said count the spoons, they counted them and there was one missing; I asked what glass was missing, they said the rummer, we had but one rummer, as I do not use rummers in general; I turned my letter upside down, and went into the tap room and asked who went into that room, they said Peck; I pursued him with my horse, knowing he lived somewhere in Shoreditch; I suspected he had taken the glass out of the box that he sat in; when I came up to him I catched hold of his arm and let my arm drop down his coat and felt nothing, he thought I was going away, he said, Good night, master; I turned round and felt the other side, I felt a glass, I took him into a public house, and sent for an officer, he was searched and the rummer and spoon were found in his pocket. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house and called for a pint of porter, there were several other people in the parlour; I sat down and drank the porter, and after I drank it I got up and went out, it was put in my pocket by some unknown person; I know nothing of it, nor did I know it was there at all.</p>

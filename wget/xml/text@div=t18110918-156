            . I work for Mr. Langridge. On the 2d of September I used the vice and the plane the thing myself, between eight and nine in the evening. I came the next morning at six o'clock, the vice and the plane were gone, and the bag taken from the shop window on the inside. On the next day I saw the vice at Mr. Rhodes's, Vine-street, Clerkenwell; I said I could swear to it. I afterwards took my master there, and Mr. Rhodes had hid it, or taken it away.</p>

               <p>Q. There was a vice found on your premises by a search warrant - A. No, I found it afterwards, it was not upon my premises when the search warrant was executed I was alarmed about the prisoner, in case he had given me a wrong direction where he lived. I took the vice to the office, it was claimed by Mr. Langridge. I bought the vice on the same day of the prisoner, I gave twelve shillings for it; I bought a hatchet the same morning of the prisoner, that was sold to a stranger. This is the vice.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This property was all concealed in a nail bag. On the morning of the 3d, at half past five I picked it up; after I picked the property up, I thought it was my own. My wife was brought to bed, I sold the vice to make money, and the rest I kept for my own use.</p>

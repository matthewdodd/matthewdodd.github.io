I am a photographer, residing at 297, Qxford-street—in September I had in my possession twenty-three brooches and sixteen lockets—I last saw them on Friday morning, 20th September, about 12 o'clock—the prisoner was in my employ about three months—I do not know that he would know the premises—he was at one of my branch establishments—I went to 297, Oxford-street on Saturday morning, and found that the outer-door had been forced—there were marks of a chisel or screw-driver where it had sprung the door-post away, and the bolt was shot—I went upstairs to the first-floor room and that was the same, and there were marks of a chisel—that is the room where the case was, containing the things—my house is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square.</p>

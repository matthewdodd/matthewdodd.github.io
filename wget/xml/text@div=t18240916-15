I remained there, and in about ten minutes, after washing himself, he came to the place, but on seeing me did not attempt to take his hat, but in ten minutes he went and took it up carefully with both hands, and moved it five or six yards - he then waited about five minutes, took it up, stooped down, and put it on; he went into the street; I followed, and told him the clerk wanted him in the counting-house - he came bark, and Hale, the clerk asked him what he had in his bat - he said nothing - Hale told him to take it off, which he did, and I took this brass out of it; the handkerchief was not in his hat when I took it off his head.</p>

             sworn. - Q.You are assistant Solicitor to the Mint? - A. I am, and produce a copy of the record of the conviction of the prisoner, which I got from the Office of Mr. Shelton, and examined with the original.(Record read:)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you attend the trial? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same woman who was then tried? - A. Yes, I have no doubt of the person.</p>

               <p>EDWARD KIRBY sworn. - Q. Are you nephew to the present keeper of Newgate? - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when she was tried? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she in your custody? - A. Yes, for one year.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about her person? - A. Not at all.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM RICHARDSON sworn. - Q.Where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060050"></xptr>do you live? - A. In Charlotte-street, Portland-place.</p>

               <p>Q. What business are you? - A. A carpenter.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop? - A. Yes, a turnery and toy shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, I know her again; I saw her on the 3d of June, about seven o'clock in the evening; a woman came to my shop for a pennyworth of marbles; she gave me a bad shilling; I returned it to her; she said she was going a little further, and would call again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you follow her out? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see whether she joined company with any body else? - A. Yes, I followed her into Weymouth-street, and there I saw her join company with the prisoner; after consulting some time, they went across Portland-place, and Harley-street, to a tallow-chandler's in Weymouth-street; Rowley went in, and the prisoner went gently on; I waited till she came out, upon which I went in to learn what she had done; in consequence of what I heard, I was induced to follow them still further; I came out as Rowley had overtaken the prisoner; they consulted together, and something was exchanged, but I cannot say what; she gave something to the prisoner, who appeared to be feeling in her pocket as if she was going to return something; I followed them into Mary-le-Bonne-street, and observed Rowley go into Mr. Loosely's shop; the prisoner walked gently up Wimpole-street; I went into the shop after she came out, and in consequence of what I heard there, I again followed the prisoner and Rowley; I got the beadle of the parish to assist me, because I was determined to take them up; we followed them to Oxford-street; they several times consulted together; the prisoner never went into a shop, but had a letter in her hand, and often stood against a door, as if she had knocked and waited; Rowley went into a linen-draper's shop, upon which I told the beadle to go and take that woman, and I would take care of the other.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you secure them? - A. Yes, and there were plenty of people to see the prisoner nor the other did not drop any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she searched in your presence? - A. Yes, by Hamilton; there were four or five shillings found in her hand, which she was loath to unclench; in her pocket was found a great many sixpences, and a great deal of copper; the officers searched Rowley, and said there was nothing to be found on her.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Richardson? - A. I have seen him here; what he has said is truth about the marbles; Mrs. Barrel shewed me where to go in, and gave me a shilling, and told me to go in; I told her I believed it was a bad shilling; she said, it was of no consequence whether it was good or bad, for if I had no more than one about me, they could not hurt me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go into any shop of Mrs. Loosely's? - A. Yes, and into a wax shop, where I bought a pennyworth of wax; she told me the wax was for making gum flowers, and I gave it to her.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060051"></xptr>Q.Look at that bit of wax? - A. That is the wax.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where you bought it? - A. I cannot tell either the street or shop.</p>

               <p>Q.Did she afterwards carry you to another shop? - A. Yes, but whether it was that shilling or not I cannot say; I bought two sheets of paper, and paid two-pence for them.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of paper? - A. Like scowering-paper.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to go when she had made such a speech to you? - A. I did consider her as a bad woman when she said there was no danger in the second; I did think it wrong, but the first I did not think so much of.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you pay with? - A. With a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you get it? - A.From Mrs. Barrel.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at those four? - A. They are all counterfeits.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any letter stamped on them? - A. Yes, part of the letter N; they seem to be of the same coinage.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>

               <p>"To the Right Hon. the Lord Judge, and the Honourable the Jury - The humble defence of the prisoner at the bar, sheweth, that she lived lately in two respectable places, and left them with a good character, and has since worked for different shops; on the day she lost her liberty, she was unwilling to go out at all till Mrs. Rowley tried every art to prevail, nor succeeded till Mrs. Rowley produced a paper, containing an advertisement to attend a lady to America, and a lady that they called on in Portland-place, and Mrs. Rowley called at a house while the prisoner waited, and returned, saying, the lady was not at home; in Lower Brook-street I missed her; I went down Welbeck-street, and heard her call after me; I observed to her that three men were following her; she uttered an oath, and said, I don't care for them; she asked me to have some rum; I answered, no, but would wait for her; I took a glass of ale, which was all I bought that day; I proceeded to Hanover-square, when I was seized by a strange man; I enquired the cause, but to no effect; I was hurried to a Magistrate, and on searching my pockets, some change was found which I had received for sundry work, and had taken out for the purpose of buying some mode, having a cloak bespoke; this is all I know, and all I have to say." <rs id="t18030706-73-verdict397" type="verdictDescription">

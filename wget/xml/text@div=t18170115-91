On the 20th of December, the prisoner, Smith, came into my shop, and looked at several pair of shoes, none would suit him, he said, he would be measured for a pair; I measured him, he said, he had a brother outside the door, and that I should measure him, and he would fetch him in; we did not agree for any price. When the other prisoner came in, he said, perhaps I had got a pair that would fit him; he tried two or three pair on; then Mason said, he would be measured also; my back was turned from them to look for the shoes; the prisoner walked about the shop. When I had measured them, Smith said, I will be a pot of beer, and put his hands to his pocket for some money; I would not be treated by them; they left the shop, and I began to think all was not right; they were to call for the shoes, and both gave me the name of Smith to put on the measure; there was nobody else in the shop, while they were there. Mason had got an apron on, and by his manner of going out, and shutting the door after him; I suspected them, and followed them, and laid hold of Mason, about one hundred yards from the shop; they were talking together, and had another boy with them. Smith and the other boy ran off. Mason had got one pair of shoes in his apron. I lost four pair of shoes; I am sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM HEMMINGWAY. I am an officer. I took charge of Mason; I asked him where the other lad was - He told me, that Smith lodged at his father's, at Shoreditch; I went there, and took him that evening; he was outside the door; he had a bundle with him, I asked him what it was - He said, it was shoes that he had been mending, and he was going to take them to a shop; I took him to the next door, I found in the bundle, three pair of new shoes, and one pair which had been mended; while I was examining the bundle, he made his escape down stairs, and ran away; I found him the next morning, at the prisoner, Mason's house. Mr. Sinclair claimed them.</p>

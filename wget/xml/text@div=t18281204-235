               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Why would you not believe him? A.Because I have known him tell great untruths; I never knew him on his oath before - but Mrs. Marshall says she never sent him at all - it is from what she said that I state what I have on this occasion; I have had him once or twice at the watch-house for little rows, and there he proved himself a great story-teller, but I cannot charge my memory with one.</p>
               <p>MR. MARSHALL re-examined. Good is in my employ; I have a very bad opinion of him - if any loose characters come there he is always with them; I was going to discharge him on Saturday.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did your wife send him to Dyke, to come and look at the persons in the ground? A. No, she did not.</p>

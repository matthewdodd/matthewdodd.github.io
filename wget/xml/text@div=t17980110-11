             sworn. - I am a broker, in Whitechapel-road, about half a mile from the prosecutor's; I had known the prisoner six years; he was a carpenter in Ratcliff-highway, when I first knew him; and he has entered as a soldier within these two months; I was going to Homerton, to a sale, with two other brokers, and going along, I met the prisoner, just by the Salmon and Ball, he lives within six or seven doors of the Salmon and Ball, and he asked me to buy this stove; upon that I went to his house, next door to the Green Man, and there I saw the stove, and I agreed with him for half a crown and a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a fair price? - A. Yes; they are very unsaleable articles; they cost five shillings new, and this is an old one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by it? - A. I had no thought of it, he kept a house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the stove that you bought of the prisoner, the one that Mr. Rogers saw at your house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he acknowledge in your presence that he had sold you the stove? - A. Yes. (The stove produced).</p>

             sworn. - I am a gardener; I was present when the prisoner sold the stove to Mr. Revell for half-a-crown and some liquor; I believe this is the stove, to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot say positively; it was about ten weeks ago, or it may be more.</p>
               <p>Rogers. I know it to be mine by the handle being bent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to Spitalfields-market, I picked up this stove wrapped up in a bit of canvas, against a fence; I kicked against it twice before I picked it up, and I kept it at the door six or eight days to see if an body would own it, and then I sold it to Mr. Revell; I live within four doors of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Revell.) Q. Did you see it exposed for sale at the prisoner's door? - A. No; it was in the back part of his house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant and corporal, who gave him a good character.</p>

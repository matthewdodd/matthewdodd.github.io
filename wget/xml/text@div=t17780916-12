               <p>JANE EAST sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you must tell what the prisoner did to you? - The prisoner's wife went out to Whitechapel about six weeks ago; the prisoner lay on the bed; I lay at the feet; he put me up in his wife's place, and got a top of me, and put something into me, but I do not know what it was; I cried out; he said, if I did not have done he would beat me; he got up, and locked the bed-room door; then he came to the bed, and got a top of me again, and put something into me again, and hurt me very much; I cried out, he said again, that he would beat me, and lick me, if I had not done.</p>
               <p>How far did he put any thing into you? - I cannot tell how far; I felt something wet come from him. The Sunday before this happened, I went to the necessary in the yard; he came to the vault, and pulled the door open, and would have done it then, only the mistress of the house was in the necessary with me, and saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where does Mr. Williams the landlord of the house lie? - In the back room; the parlour.</p>

               <p>Where did you dine that day? - At Mr. Mifflin's.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you told this to anybody? - I kept it to myself a week; then I told it to Mrs. Ramsey, a grocer's wife.</p>
               <p>Had not you seen Mrs. Ramsey often in the course of the week? - I had seen her once before in that week; but I did not tell her then, as I expected to see my mother.</p>
               <p>Had your master Larwell and you any quarrels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He used to be wicked enough to whip you? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Had he whipped you that morning? - No; it was after I told of this affair that he whipped me.</p>
               <p>Did not he say when he dined at Mr. Mifflin's, that he had whipped you for doing something in the bed? - He said so.</p>
               <p>Was it true, or a lie? - It was true, he had whipped me.</p>

             that it might be done by digitation, or some other cause; I examined the hymen, and found it quite perfect; there was no sort of laceration.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160010"></xptr>Do you think from the appearance that you saw that it was possible, or not, that she should have been entered by a man? - It was impossible as there was not a laceration of the hymen.</p>
               <p>How far in this child do you suppose the hymen to be up the vagina, because I have understood upon former occasions, that it is various in different subjects? - It sometimes happens so, but in the common course of things there is little deviation.</p>
               <p>How high do you suppose the hymen to lye up the vagina in this child? - Not high; I suppose about half an inch.</p>
               <p>Whatever then was the cause of this injury, you think from appearances it was impossible that she should have been entered by a man? - I should suppose so. It is necessary to observe, that previous to this complaint that was made, the child had a relaxation of the bladder; her urine came away involuntary, which would cause an inflamation of the parts.</p>
               <p>How long had she been troubled with this complaint? - I cannot justly tell. I am pretty confident she must have had it some time.</p>
               <p>Was she troubled with that complaint at the time you examined her? - I believe she was.</p>
               <p>Whether in your knowledge and experience that disorder, occasioning a discharge from young girls, which produces a degree of inflammation, is not extremely common? - It is very common.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I examined this girl a few hours after the prisoner was committed, and seeing that there was a good deal of rancour and violence in the women and friends about the girl, I inspected her with the greatest care and accuracy possible; I found there was neither laceration, ulceration, or excoriation; I could not for my part observe the least swelling of the labia or the lips. The hymen was as perfectly complete as any I ever saw; I observed a small discharge, I must own, upon the shift; the mucous was not more upon the part than what we commonly observe. There was a very slight degree of inflammation, about the urethra, which is a little distance from the vagina, where the urine passes out, there I did observe just round the passage a very slight degree of inflammation. In short, from the appearance all together, there was not the least reason to suspect that any violence had lately been done to the parts.</p>
               <p>Are you clear from these circumstances, that she never could have been entered by a man? - It was impossible; the orifice was not larger than the size of a large quill.</p>
               <p>How high up in the vagina do you imagine the hymen to have laid? - The hymen, in all that I have examined, lies at the very enterance of the vagina, not within the vagina; it is not called the vagina till you pass the hymen.</p>
               <p>What do you call it till you arrive at the hymen? - There are the external labia and the little labia, which we name nymphae; they belong to the external parts.</p>
               <p>If there had been any force or violence used to her so recently as a week; do you think that you should have discovered it? - If there had been much violence used, I think she could not have recovered it in that short space of time; there must have been some more marks.</p>
               <p>With respect to the discharge, whether it is not a complaint to which children are very subject? - Exceedingly common; we see it every day in the female sex of all ages; it may arise from a variety of causes, and when this happened it was exceeding hot weather.</p>
               <p>And when that acrid discharge is produced; it is always attended with a degree of inflammation? - Less or more.</p>
               <p>Jury. I believe, Sir, you heard the evidence of the child? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose that if the violence had been used which the child mentioned, that it was not possible to have seen more appearances of it? - There must have been some different appearances, I think, to what there was; it is impossible to say what six or seven days may do in case of little violence done, but if great violence had been used, I think it impossible; if there had been an introduction, there must have been other appearances of it.</p>
               <p>Dr. COOPER sworn.</p>
               <p>I examined the child very attentively; there was a little redness upon the external parts; in other respects the appearances were quite natural. There was no swelling at all, no excoriation, and much left any laceration<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160011"></xptr> at all; there was not the least. The hymen was quite complete, as perfect as possible, and much more so than it usually is in children. There was a little redness upon the passage to the bladder, but the child had a weakness in the bladder; redness is universal where there is that weakness, if the hymen hath once been penetrated it never unites afresh; the remains of it forms the caruncula myrtiformes. So it is absolutely impossible that there could have been the least penetration, nor were there any marks of violence whatsoever upon the parts.</p>

            , came to Mrs. Ramsden's, the grocer's, in Gray's-inn-lane, while I was there on a Monday; the fact was committed a week before; she told us that the prisoner took her up from the foot to the head of the bed, when his wife was gone to carry a gown home to her mother at Whitechapel; she said the prisoner got upon her, and put something into her, that she cried out; upon which the prisoner got out of bed, and locked the door, and then got into bed, and got a top of her again, and threatened that if she told her mother or his wife of it, that he would lick her; I examined the child; there was a great running upon her at that time, and she looked very sore.</p>

               <p>The child spoke to me first on the 2d of August; she came in when I was at dinner.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing further than merely the account that she has given us? - I took her into the entry; she spoke to me, and nobody else; then she came in again; I know nothing of the people that she was at nurse with; I had not seen the child, further than her coming on errands; she did not say any thing to me till that day. I took her through the entry that goes to the yard door, and asked her what she wanted; she said, she was used very ill where she was at nurse; I asked her in what respect, whether she had victuals enough, or whether they beat her; she said, she had victuals enough, and they did beat her, but that they had used her worse than that; she told me that the woman she lived with went home with her mother's gown, that then the man got out of bed, took her from the foot of the bed to the head of the bed, and got on her, and she said she cried out; upon which he got up, and shut the door, and said he would lick her, if she did not hold her tongue; I asked her why she kept it to herself so long; she said, she expected her mammy on the Sunday, and did not like to tell anybody; that her mammy did not come on the Sunday and therefore she came to tell me on the Monday; I asked her if she was in any pain; she said she could not for three days sit, but half way in her chair, and it hurt her when she made water; I told her I could not have an opportunity of sending to her mother till next day, because I was washing; I sent next day to her mother, and her mother came immediately.</p>
               <p>Did you examine her? - No; the woman that was washing for me searched her, but I was standing by in the kitchen; I saw something on her shift, and she looked reddish and sore. She said that was not the shift that she had on, for that the woman who washed for her put another on; she said the other was worse than that.</p>

The prisoner bad been in my service for nearly three months—she was the only servant I had—she left me about six weeks or two months ago—after she was gone I missed some articles; 1 sent for her twice, and she said they could not go without bands, but she knew nothing about it—she said she would come on the following Monday, and help me to search the house to see for them; she did not say she had any thing belonging to me; she denied everything—as she did not come according to her promise, I got two officers, and went to her father's house—that was on Monday, about 25th April—I found the prisoner there, she answered the door to me—I told her I had brought the constables to give her in charge on suspicion of stealing three articles—she said she knew that she had taken the mantle and bottle, but the mantle was at her sister's up the Kent-road—she said she had given it to her sister—she said she did not know where the child had put the bottle—I searched her box, and her bed room; I found a great many various things—the trimmings of the mantle which she had taken off—a flannel petticoat, and a piece of calico—I did not find anything else that day—I did not give her in charge, for she had a violent fit while I was searching—I went again a week afterwards, and found a basket, a hair brush, a child's toy, and several other things, and two station flags, which are my husband's; they are used as signals on the railway; these are the articles, I know them all—I did not find this bottle there—her mother brought it up in the evening, and in the evening she went to her sister's situation to get the mantle—I found some of these things in her box, some in her mother's boxes, and some in her sister's box—they are my husband's.</p>

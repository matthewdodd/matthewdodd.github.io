                  </hi>. I carry on business as a tailor and draper, at 113, Minories—on the Saturday night, the 1st April, no one was sleeping on the premises—I and the porter were the last to leave—I saw the place locked up, at about 6 o'clock—the door was bolted—I left some cash in my private desk which was open—I think the amount was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I identify these coins and these goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was some clothes left behind—I found an old coat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman C</hi> 765). On the 3rd April, I was on duty in the Minories, not in uniform—about 3.50 in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming up out of a grating from the premises of Mr. Tayler—I went to the grating and found I could lift it up—it was not fast—I followed the prisoner with another constable; I caught him and said "Where did you come from"—he made no reply then—he afterwards said "I had been drinking last night, I went to see my girl; I fell down and hurt myself"—he did not mention the grating—I asked him "What have you got about you; "He looked rather bulky—he unbuttoned his overcoat, he was wear<lb></lb>ing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said "I have nothing about me"—I then unbuttoned an undercoat and saw a shawl wrapped round his waist, and under that were two others—he said "That belongs to my girl, I am going to take it home and take care of it for her"—I said "You have more about you"—I noticed he was wearing a new pair of trousers with a ticket on it of the price—I told the constable about it and took the prisoner back to the grating and said "Is this the place you came up out of"—he said "Yes, it is no use denying it, I took the things from there"—I then took him to the station and searched him—I found on him three. new flannel shirts and new trousers, two now waistcoats, one new body coat, one new over<lb></lb>coat, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and two knives—there is a franc which was amongst the silver in his trousers pocket—he had bis own trousers on as well—I produce a candle and matches, and screwdriver, handed to me by the other constable. George Measure (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 65). I examined the premises shortly after the occurrence referred to—I found the window beneath the grating was open on the ground floor; I found a lighted candle outside the shop door—the door had been forced open—at the top of the banisters I found a waistcoat, a woollen shirt, a pair of trousers, and an old coat; they were banging on the banisters—I produce a bolt which was forced off the door—I found the desk had been forced open and a number of things lying about—I took the old coat to the station, and the prisoner said "That belongs to me; give it to me. I feel rather cold, and I will put it on."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Cordell; we live in Munday-place, Whitechapel. The prisoner came to my house on the 1st of October, and I bought a penny-worth of worsted of him—he remained there about a quarter of an hour—before he Went he asked for a piece of linen rag, to put on his sore foot—I can swear the watch was there when I went up stairs—I saw it while the prisoner was there—I gave him the piece of rag, and the minute I shut the door after him I missed the watch and seals, which belong to John Cordell.</p>

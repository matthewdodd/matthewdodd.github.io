On the 6th of March the prisoner came to my house in Maidenhead, and said he wanted to deliver himself up, as he had robbed his master in London of a coat, curling-tongs, and other things—he had a pair of gloves, which he said were his master's—I took him to a Magistrate, who ordered me to write to London.</p>

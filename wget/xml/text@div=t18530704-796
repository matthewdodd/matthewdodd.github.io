                  </hi>. I am a soldier, of the Coldstream Guards. On 29th June, about 11 o'clock in the evening, I was in the Crooked Billet, on Tower-hill, sitting in front of the bar, and William Thomson was on my right hand side; he was rather the worse for liquor, but was sensible enough to know that he lost something—he was sitting between the two prisoners—I saw Foley put his hand in Thomson's pocket, and take out a box—he shook it, and I heard something like money in it—he then knocked Thomson down, gave the box into the hands of Justice, and they both went out together.</p>

On 29th June, about 11 o'clock, I saw Justice run out of the Crooked Billet, and Foley followed him close, without his cap—in consequence of information I overtook them, and desired them to come back with me—I saw Justice put his hand in his pocket; I did not see him give anything to the constable, but I saw the constable take something from his pocket—Thomson gave them in charge—coming out of the public house I saw Foley's hand closed, and in it I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "I have not got the box; the other one has got the box in his pocket."</p>

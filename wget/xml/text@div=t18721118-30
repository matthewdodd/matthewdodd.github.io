                  </hi>. I am sixteen next July, and live at 1, Regent's Place, Leader Street, Chelsea—I have known the prisoner sixteen years, and never knew anything against him—he is a labourer—I have seen him in the "Guy" and in the "Jack-in-the-Green" for the last three years—on 7th November I was outside the Royal Oak public-house, and saw him in a clown's dress, with three <hi rend="italic">chaps,</hi> about twenty years old, dressed the same as he was, and a boy—they were dancing, and some boys, who live in Oakum Street, were round them—the boys went behind Him, and stuck him with pins—they always do so every time there is a "Guy" or a "Jack-in-the-Green;" that is part of the amusement, because they think it is a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—a clown's dress is loose over the figure—when the pins were stuck into the prisoner, I saw him attempt to kick one of them, who stepped on one side and avoided it, and he kicked another boy instead, who fell down—I do not know his name—I don't think it was Robert Pasley—I have been examined before, but my father said I did not know which boy it was, and I was taken to the house where Pasley was lying dead, and he was not so big as this boy—I have not said "The prisoner kicked Robert Pasley in the stomach;" I never mentioned his name, I did not know it—I have only talked to the Magistrate and the Coroner's jury about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 40, Ive Street, Chelsea, and am the wife of a cab-builder there—on Thursday evening, 7th November, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I went by Oakum Street, which is close to Leader Street, and saw a "Guy Fawkes" and two clowns—the tallest of the two clowns caught Robert Pasley with his feet in the side, near his stomach, and he fell down—I mean that he kicked the child—the child went towards the gate, and he could not stand, and fell down by the gate—the prisoner is the clown who did it—the boy fell first, and the prisoner fell across him—the prisoner got up, and ran after the "Guy Fawkes"—the boy crawled to the gate—some one came up and rubbed his side, and he said "Don't rub me there; that is where he has kicked me"—I saw no other boys, and saw no one doing anything to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at Fulham—on Thursday night, 7th November, a little before 9 p.m. I was called, and found a little boy on a bed writhing in agony; he was cold and pulseless, and complained of great pain in his side—I found no external marks, but great tenderness on pres<lb></lb>sure on the right side of the belly—that would not be a likely place to show a bruise, the elasticity of the walls of the stomach would prevent it—a sharp-pointed boot would have produced a mark, but a dull heavy blow would not—he died the following night Friday, and on opening the cavity of the abdomen I found the intestine bunt; it was a lacerated kind of tear, and there was a quantity of fetid matter and faces—that was the cause of death—the laceration must have been the result of some direct external violence; some heavy pressure—a fall and being run over by a man would produce it—I have seen a waggon wheel which passed over a body produce the same result—it would be too much of a guess whether it was more likely to be produced by a kick or a fall.</p>

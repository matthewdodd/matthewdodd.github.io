               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you ever tried for stealing a crow-bar? A. Yes, and acquitted -I never said I preferred this charge entirely out of aggravation, and that he had not robbed me; they took and made me drunk, and gave me 15s.; I did not sign any paper, or put my mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this? A. I know nothing about it; his sister was taken, and he came forward to clear her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you get out of the house? A. When he robbed me he let go of me, and I ran out - he and his friends remained there.</p>

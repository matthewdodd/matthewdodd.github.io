                  </hi> I am a widow, and live in Long-alley, Shoreditch. I occupy one room; the rest of the house is let out in different tenements—the landlord does not live there. On Tuesday, the 8th of June, I had been out to work—I came home at half-past seven in the evening, and found my room-door open—I had left it locked, and had the key in my pocket all day—when I got in I found my things disturbed—I opened the shutters, and then saw the prisoner standing in the corner of the room—I did not know her before—my tea-pot was moved from my drawers on to the table with the candlestick, which had been on the shelf; a gown had been taken from a nail behind the door, and thrown on to another table, a cloak and bonnet were moved, and two sheets—these are the things—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all mine—I said to the prisoner, "What do you do in my room?"—she said, "Do not be afraid; have you lost anything? two ladies sent me to ask you to go to work"—I said, "What ladies?"—she said she could not say, but they were little ladies—Sarah Robertson was in the passage, and she went and fetched the officer.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of James Robertson, and live in the same house with Mrs. Monksfield. On Tuesday evening, the 8th of June, about half-past seven o'clock, I went out for an errand—I saw no one in Mrs. Monksfield's room then—I came back in about ten minutes, and then saw the prisoner in her room—I observed the cloak and bonnet lying on the floor, and a bed-gown, and this tea-pot on the table—Mrs. Monksfield was very much agitated and frightened—she said to me, in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, "Mrs. Robertson, who has been here to-day for me to go to work?"—I said, "No one"—the prisoner answered, "Yes, there has"—I do not know anything of the prisoner—I asked her if she knew Mrs. Monksfield, she said "No"—I said, "Do you know me?"—she said, "No"—I said, "What do you do here?"—she said, "I do not know"—she looked at Mrs. Monksfield, and said, "Poor woman, have you lost anything?" Mrs. Monksfield an<lb></lb>swered "I do not know"—I went out and found the policeman standing talking to the landlord, and called him in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman G</hi> 89.) The prisoner was given into my charge by the prosecutrix, as she was coming out of the passage of the house—I asked her what she had been doing down there—she told me she had gone to tell the woman of some work—I asked what business she had in the room—she said she had not been into the room—I asked what business she had down there at all—she said she had been to the water-closet—I took her to the station-house—she was searched, and a knife and spoon found on her, they do not belong to the prosecutrix—I examined the room-door, and saw a place cut in the door-post, as if something had been put in to push the lock back—it was fresh chipped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long defence, stated that she was sent by a person on a message to the prosecutrix, but that she did not enter the room.</hi>

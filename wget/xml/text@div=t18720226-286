                  </hi>. I am a coach-builder, and live at 22, Park Street, West Ham—I was acquainted with the deceased, George Raymond, for fourteen or fifteen years—he was always a healthy man—he was thirty-one years of age—on February 16th he and I went down to Ilford upon veloci<lb></lb>pedes—we got there about 9.15 or 9.30 in the evening—I went to the Rose and Crown, kept by Mr. Milton—the deceased went further on, and returned to me at the Rose and Crown in about an hour and a half—he was then per<lb></lb>fectly sober, and perfectly well—we remained there till closing time—we had three or four pints of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. half-and-half, I also had three 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worths of warmgin-and-water, and we each had one glass of rum—when we left we got on our velocipedes for the purpose of going home—we were sober enough to ride them—the deceased was quite capable—there had been no quarrelling or angry words between us that evening, or at any time all the years I have known him—it was a very dark night—we came away together, but I was before him, perhaps 100 yards—I was jogging along, and all of a sudden I found myself go over—I thought that I had run against something, or something had run against me, and as I was getting up I found a constable (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) had hold of my collar—he showed his lantern—I asked him if he had done it, and the reason he had done it—he said what was I making a disturbance there for?—I said I had made no disturbance, and I should go down to the police-station and report him—he shook me as well at the same time that he collared me—I called to my friend to mind the machines—I said "George, this policeman has been ill-using me, and I will go down to the station and report him for his conduct"—the prisoner said "The next man that comes up I will knock down"—there was no one there but the prisoner, Raymond, and myself—I then went straight away to the station—I made a complaint there to the inspector—the prisoner came in some few minutes afterwards with the deceased, and I said "That is the man"—I did not take particular notice how he had got the deceased, they were not walking separately, they were both together—he was being dragged like up the steps—when we left the public-house he was quite capable of walking—I did not hear the prisoner make any answer when I said "That's the man"—he said "That is his friend"—we were both put in the dock—he said he would charge us with being drunk and causing a disturbance, and we were locked up in the cell—no more notice was taken of my complaint—when I first went in I complained to the inspector that one of his men had been assaulting me—he asked if I knew the man—I said "No," and when the prisoner came in I said "That is the man"—I had been in two or three minutes before he came in—I believe my complaint was not taken down—I was talking to the inspector when the prisoner came in—when he saw me</p>

               <p>he said "Oh, you are here then," and then he took hold of me, and put me in the dock—I was on the left-hand side of the road with my velocipede, the near side, coming towards London—there is no footpath on that side, only on the other side; there is a hedge and a sort of ditch, and some heaps of mud raked up—I am almost confident that I did not run up against the policeman—I never gave him the least provocation for catching hold of me—I don't suppose we were going at the rate of more than about two or three miles an hour—I could not have fallen off my velocipede, because I was too particular in keeping the right side of the road—I can't explain how I came off—it was done all of an instant—my velocipede had two wheels behind and one in front, and Raymond's had one behind and two in front—they would stand perfectly steady—I did not strike the policeman to my recol<lb></lb>lection; I had no occasion to do so; I did not; I have no recollection of striking him—this happened 400 or 500 yards from the police-station—I ran back to the station—the station is higher up the road than the Rose and Crown.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not became I had had so much beer that I do not recollect whether I struck the policeman or not; it was too dark to see anything, too dark to see a blow struck; he could not tell that I struck him, or anyone else—he did not know which it was—if he was struck at all it must have been either by me or Raymond—before I went to the Rose and Crown we had only been in one public-house—we had one pint of four half-and-half there between us—at the Rose and Crown we had four pints of half-and-half, three glasses of gin-and-water, and one small glass of rum—I had the biggest part of the four pints—I was not quite sober when I got on my velocipede, but I was quite capable of riding it; of course if I was not sober I must have been drunk—I was drunk, but not incapable—Raymond was much better than me; he had slot had as much as I had—we started from the Rose and Crown between 12.30 and 1 o'clock—I can't say what time it was when I got to the station—I don't know whether it was 2.30, that was what the constable stated—I can't tell at all what we were doing during the two hours—we had only got between 300 and 400 yards from the Rose and Crown—I have not the slightest idea how we had occupied those two hours—I was not on the near side of the road, nor the off side—the velocipede might have been on the off side after the occurrence—I can't tell how it came there—it is a wide road—when my friend came up to me he <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> his machine across, more into the middle of the road, because he should not run against me, I suppose—I called out to him before he came up to me—there are no lamps there—there was a lamp outside the station door—I have no recollection of a man driving a dog-cart stopping and speaking to me—no one spoke to me—I heard a man named Coomber give evidence about coming and speaking to me—I can't say whether it was before the Coroner, of where it was—I was not present when he gave his evidence—I did not call out to my com<lb></lb>panion "George, stop the b—"—I can't recollect it—I did not say "George, give it to the b—"—I don't make use of such expressions—I don't re<lb></lb>collect anything of the sort—I charged the constable with assaulting me, for throwing me over with the machine—I did not think he had upset me, I merely asked him afterwards if he had done it—I asked him that before I went to the station—he did not say he had or not, but he said what was I making that disturbance for—I should think Raymond was 100 yards behind me—we don't very often go out with our velocipedes—I had only</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My impression was that the policeman had knocked me over, velocipede and all—he took me up and shook me, that was the assault complained of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor, and live at 4, Mercury Gardens, Romford—on 16th February, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was coming from Wanstead in a dog-cart—when I reached between the Coach and Horses and the bridge I heard something rattle like the wheels of a truck turning over—it was near me, exactly opposite—I looked over my near side wheel, and saw a man in the act of falling, and he fell very heavily, just as if he was falling off something—he was on the near side of the road—if he was going to London he would be on his wrong side—I did not feel that I struck the vehicle—I was going about six miles an hour, I could not go any faster because it was so dark—if I had run against it I must have felt the shock, you can feel almost anything in a dog-cart—I asked the man if he was hurt—he did not answer me for the moment, but the first words he spoke were "Stop the b—, stop the b—, come here, George"—I asked him again if he was hurt—he still continued calling—I walked my horse four or five yards in the direction he was calling to, and presently I saw a man leave the bridge—I said "You had better go and look after your friend, he has fallen over, I think"—he never replied to me, but replied to the man that had fallen—I turned my horse's head and went back to the spot, and asked him if he was hurt—they neither replied to me, but one said to the other, "No, I am not hurt, only the b—knocked me over"—I don't identify Humphreys as being the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I called at the police-station and told them what had occurred—I did not know whether it was a truck, a velocipede, or what it was—when I left the men they were squabbling one with the other, I could not make head or tail of them, they were <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> one another, noisy, I</p>

I am stationed at Ilford—about 2.30 on the morning of 16th February the witness Humphreys came into the station—I was the sergeant on duty—he said "One of your men has assaulted me"—I asked him who—he said he did not know—I asked where it was—he said "Up the road"—I asked him his name, and at that time Police-Constable Strickland brought in Raymond—I did not take down Humphrey's charge, he was so drunk, and the constable brought in the other man at the time; he walked in with him with his hand on his collar, Raymond appeared to be very drunk—when Humphreys saw Strickland he said "That it is the man"—Strickland said "What are you here, are you," and he immediately took hold of him and put him in the dock by the side of Raymond, and said he charged the two men with being drunk, creating a disturbance, and assaulting him in the high road, in the parish of Little Ilford—before I took the charge Strickland said that he had struck Raymond on the head with his staff—he had his staff with him—I asked him what the disturbance was—he said he was coming down the road, he heard some men quarrelling, and he went to the spot, he found the two prisoners, he per<lb></lb>suaded them to go away some little time, when Humphreys struck him on the chin, and immediately Raymond came up and struck him on the chest, they then both struck him several times, that he kept off the blows as well as he could with his arms underneath his cape, he then threw off his cape, drew his truncheon, and said he would knock the first man down that struck him again, Raymond struck him again, and he struck Raymond on the head and knocked him down—Humphreys said nothing then—when he was put in the dock he said "We should have <hi rend="italic">went</hi> away if the constable had let us," or "had let us alone"—whilst Raymond was in the dock he said something, but I could not understand what, I thought he was so drunk—they were both apparently very drunk—I did not see Raymond put his hands to his head—they were both put in the same cell about 3 o'clock, and I never left them 15 minutes at a time up to 6 o'clock—Raymond laid down on the floor, and Humphreys on the seat—on the third occasion that I went in I noticed that Raymond breathed very heavily—I sent for the doctor—he was afterwards taken into the charge-room and placed before the fire—I saw him there at 8 o'clock—I went off duty at 6 o'clock and returned at 8 o'clock—he had vomitted just before I sent for the doctor—ultimately, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, a cart was sent for—he was placed on a stretcher and taken in the cart to the hospital.</p>

               <p>was on duty at Ilford Station, about 2.30—a knock came at the door and Humphreys came in, and he complained of having been assaulted by a policeman up the road, that he had been roughly handled, he did not know who the policeman was—during the conversation Strickland came in with Raymond by the collar—he put Raymond in the dock, and also took hold of Humphreys and put him in the dock, and charged them both with being drunk, creating a disturbance and assaulting him—he said he had found them quarrelling in the Romford Road, that he advised them to go away; that they refused, when Humphreys came and struck him in the mouth; that they then both made an attack on him; he undid his cape, drew his staff and said "The first one that strikes me again I will knock him down;" that Raymond came towards him to strike him, and he struck him on the head and knocked him down—I did not examine Strickland's mouth—I did not observe any marks of violence on his face—I was standing three yards away—from his general appearance, I saw there was no violence on him—I did not go to his face and look—I also examined Raymond's head, but did not find the least marks of violence on him—he tried to speak, but could not—he was very incoherent—I did not understand a word—I did not see that he placed his hands to his head—the charge was read over to them and Humphreys said "You are not going to lock me up, are you? I have not done anything. I don't know what my mate has been doing, I am not drunk"—they were placed in a cell—the doctor was afterwards sent for—I was present when he came—I should not have locked Humphreys up as being drunk and incapable from what I saw—he was drunk, but I should not have locked him up for drunkenness alone—I continually looked at the deceased in the cell after 6 o'clock—I think Humphreys was quite capable of giving an account of the assault that he alleged against Strickland—at 7.30 I noticed that Raymond had moved his head—a pillow had been placed under him—he vomitted before the doctor came—I tried to rouse him, but could not—his eyes were half open and half shut, apparently fixed—I had him carried to the fire—after the doctor came I had a cart sent for, by his direction—I placed Raymond on a stretcher and put him in the cart and accompanied him to the London Hospital—on the road near Bow, I observed his features change, and a little further on I found he was dead—I afterwards accompanied Strickland to the place where this occurred, about 500 yards from the police-station, and about 300 yards from the Coach and Horses—I there found two tricycles, one with two wheels in front and one behind, on the left had side of the road, the other with two wheels behind and one in front, about 70 yards nearer London, on the right-hand side of the road—the first one was about 120 yards from the bridge, on the London side—I said to Humphreys in the morning "What had you been drinking last night?" and he said "We had three or four pints of four half-and-half, and the deceased had a glass of rum"—he also added "If the policeman had not interfered with us we should have been all right."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—Raymond was brought there on 16th February—he was dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on opening the scalp, I found extravasation of blood into the brain and into the muscle underneath—the skull was opened, and there was a fracture about two inches long, and under the fracture extravasation of blood—that corresponded with what I discovered before I opened the skull—the skull was thin; thinner than the majority of skulls are—there was extravasation of blood in other parts of the brain—the heart and lungs were healthy—the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> was separated from the skull—the brain itself was a healthy one—the cause of death was fracture of the skull, and extravasa<lb></lb>tion of blood into the brain—a policeman's staff would be calculated to cause such a fracture as I saw—the fracture would cause insensibility and inability to speak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no external mark—it might have been due to a fall of any kind, provided it was not against a sharp-pointed instrument, which would have produced a puncture—he was a strong, muscular, powerful man—the wound was on the left side—the skull being thin, less violence would cause the fracture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you judge at all, from the shape of the fracture, whether the man was going towards the policeman or away him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might be going away from him, but then the policeman would have to use a back handed blow—he might have been coming towards him—the extravasation was the immediate cause of death; that was certainly due to violence, but what violence I can't say—a policeman's truncheon might inflict such a wound, and a fall might—I could not, of course, tell in what position the man was at the time—it might have been that the man was going to<lb></lb>wards him—the direction of the fracture was downwards—it Would make no difference whether he was going towards him or not at the time the blow was given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He might have been standing still—he was a man of about 5 feet 8 inches in height.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Praed-street, Padding<lb></lb>ton. On the 9th of April I was drinking tea with my wife, in my back-parlour, and heard footsteps in the passage—in consequence of something my wife said to me I went out into the street, and saw the prisoner walk<lb></lb>ing fast—I followed her—she looked back and saw me coming, and began to run—I caught her round the corner, and found a shirt, petticoat, and night-cap, within a short distance of where she stood—there was nobody else near at the time—I told her to take the things back from where she got them—she began to beg and pray, and said she was very much in dis<lb></lb>tress, and if I would let her go she would never do the like again—I took her back to my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 9th of April I heard footsteps in the passage, and went out—I saw the prisoner on the step of the door going out—she asked me if I could tell her of any one who wanted a woman to wash—I told her I could not, and she went away—I observed something white in a basket she had, and the lid did not shut down close—I went into the kitchen, and missed my husband's shirt, a flannel petticoat, and night-cap, from among the dirty clothes—I told my husband, who went out, and brought the prisoner back with the things—the lid of her basket was closed then, as the things were not in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Fitzpatrick, and live in New-passage, Falcon-street, Clare-market. On the 4th of August I was at the Crown and Still public-house, Clare-street—I got drinking with the prisoner there, I treated them—I pulled out my purse, and paid for a pot of porter—there was a half-crown piece, a few coppers, and a bit of metal in it, which I know—I put my purse into my bosom—I was not drunk—Gosling pushed me down, when I refused to pay for any more drink—I was picked up by the landlord, and then I missed this purse.</p>

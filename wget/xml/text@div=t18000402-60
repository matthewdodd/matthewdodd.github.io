On the 20th of November the prisoner Deakin and I went out in a one-horse cart, and Smith went on horseback, down the Edmonton road; and just beyond Ponder's-end we robbed this coach; I cannot say what coach it was; we took seven boxes and a brown paper parcel from the boot behind.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get at them? - A. Deakin got in and put them out to Smith, and I took them to the cart; the coach was going on at the time; it was just after dusk in the evening; they were all brought to Deakin's house; one box contained three watches, a hunting-watch not finished, and a case of another; eight table-spoons, four small desert-spoons, five dozen tea-spoons, five watch-chains, a quantity of watch keys and watch-glasses, three gown-pieces, two pieces of silk handkerchiefs, a hat in a box, a hat in another box, and a bonnet; I do not recollect any thing else; Deakin had a dozen of small spoons and a watch; Smith kept a dozen, two large spoons, and a watch; I had a dozen also, and two large ones, and a watch; the remainder of the things were sold, and the money divided; I cannot say whether they are the same spoons or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.How long have you been a thief? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you to a year or two? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You were concerned with a man who has since suffered the laws of his country, Galloping Dick? - A. No otherwise than the waggoner at Brixton-causeway.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not treat him with great cruelty? - </p>
               <p>Court. Nothing can appear worse, with respect to his character, than his own account to-day; he ought not to be credited in a tittle in which he is not confirmed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.You do not know what coach this was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor what day it was? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to go out with a cart with other people to rob carts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to go out with a man of the name of Ryland? - A. Yes, that I have answered for.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you always said these were the two men that were with you in this robbery? - A. I have always said so.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath did you not twice say they were not the men? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, I know nothing against these men? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing of that kind? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How often were these men brought up for examination before you swore to them? - A. I was there twice without them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not recollect the Magistrate telling you, all this amounts to nothing if you cannot speak to these being the men? - A. I always said they were the men.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not charge a man of the name of Ryland with this robbery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020058"></xptr>Q. The Magistrate discharged Ryland? - A. Yes; there were no owners for the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beville. My Lord, there is a mistake in the indictment, in the names of the proprietors; I must now prove the property in the coachman.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DANCER MARKHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Beville. I am coachman to the Boston coach; I drove it on the 20th of November to Royston, which is thirty-eight miles from Shoreditch-church; I never missed any thing at all; I knew nothing of the loss till the coachman came back.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Suppose these things are lost from the coach while you are driving, who is liable for that loss? - A. The proprietors.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is answerable to the proprietors? - A.Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q.Are not you liable? - A. No.</p>
               <p>

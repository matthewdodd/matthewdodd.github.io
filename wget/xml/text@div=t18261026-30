This property was in a chest of drawers it was safe on the evening of the 22d of September; I got up between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and went out - I returned at eight, and all was safe then. The prisoner is a stranger to me; I went out, and was sent for about ten o'clock - I found my drawers open, and my clothes gone; the drawers had not been locked. I gave notice to the pawnbrokers, and that evening saw one of my coats exposed for sale, at Regins' stall, in Rosemary-lane; I found a waistcoat at his house. The prisoner was taken that evening, with the trousers on his legs. The house is let out in lodgings - the landlord lives next door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you told us all you know? A. Not exactly; I did not know Regin; he took me to the prisoner's house, where I found the trousers on his legs; I asked where he got the property; he said he bought them that morning. of a Jew, in Cheapside, at a quarter past ten o'clock - he said the Jew hung his head down, and he did not know whether he should know him, and could not swear to him - he said he could not recognise him; he afterwards saw Mr. Pitcher, who lodges in the house, and said he thought he was the person; I occupy the second floor front room, and an old lady lives on the same floor. I understand my wife had locked the room door; Pitcher lived on the third floor. He said at once he had bought them of a Jew, but did not say what he had done with them in my hearing; Regin was present. The prisoner was asked if he had bought anything besides the coat and waistcoat - he said he had not - I am quite certain of that. I never said the robbery must have been committed by a person who knew the premises, nor anything like it. The officer of the night liberated him on his own word, to appear at the Mansion House on Monday, and he did appear - Pitcher was examined before the officer of the night, and by the Lord Mayor. What the prisoner said at the Mansion House was written down, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember charging Mrs. Pitcher with having one Jack to visit her? A. Never - it was the prisoner charged her with it; I then inquired who Jack was, and found a person answering that description had been visiting her - I did not express dissatisfaction at it.</p>

            . I live with my husband, at this house. I went out after my husband, at half-past nine o'clock to the butcher's, and locked the room door - I returned in about ten minutes, found the door open, and the lock seemed very loose; I had left my husband's clothes in the drawers - I found the drawers shut, as I had left them, and missed these articles. The prisoner was brought to the room, by the officer, that night - I had never seen him before - I was confused, and hardly recollect what passed - I did not notice his dress; Mrs. Pitcher lodges up stairs with her husband, who is a cutler. I never saw them in my room till after the robbery; her husband went with her to the Mansion House on Monday - the clothes were brought there by the officer; I never heard my husband say Pitcher must be concerned - we suspected nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you heard your husband say he thought it must be done by a person acquainted with the premises? A. Never - he never thought of such a thing; I never saw the prisoner in our room - the drawers could be seen when the door was open; I saw the property safe the evening before. The prisoner told my husband on Saturday night he would go with him on Monday, to Holywell-lane, to see if he could find the rest of his clothes; he called on Sunday night, to say he should not be able to go - I asked him at what time he bought the clothes - he said about a quarter past ten o'clock, and that he had dealt in old clothes for three years. I was before the Lord Mayor at the third examination - Pitcher, his wife, and my husband were all there. When the prisoner called on Sunday, my husband called Pitcher down, to see if he would know him again - he said he would not swear to him, as the man he bought them of held his face down. Pitcher was discharged on the first or second day.</p>

            . I and my husband live at this house: he is a cutler, and works for Mr. Bear, of Chandos-street, and has worked there five years - we live on the next floor to Winn. I was never in their room till the night of the robbery; I had seen a man go out of the house about an hour before the robbery - I described him; he was a very respectably dressed man. My husband's brother, who has been at sea three years, came to see us on Tuesday - he stumbled on the stairs, and my husband said,"Hold up mate" - the people in the house mistook it for Jack; he is they mean by Jack. I described to Winn the man I had seen go out, as having a blue coat and trousers, and a moreen bag in his hand, full of something; I got up on Saturday a little after seven o'clock - my husband went out about a quarter past seven, to his work, and did not come home till eight at night; I was in bed when he went out - he is still in Mr. Bears' employ. When I went to the watch-house Winn said, "Will you see if you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260021"></xptr>can recognise the man?" as soon as I went in I said to the prisoner, "Will you turn your back to me?" as I had noticed the man's back - he did so, and I said, "I think you are the man" - he said, "Thank you ma'am;" and immediately said to my husband, "I bought them of you"- my husband has no bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you go to the watch-house? A. On Saturday evening, the 23d of September; the constable of the night was going to discharge him, and detain my husband; I said, "Harden, what, are you going to let the thief go, and detain an innocent man?" he went to his head officer, came back, and let them both go- I had seen the man go out of the house a few minutes before the clock struck ten; I was looking out of window, seeing half-a-bushel of coals measured from a waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you say a word about the man going out till he said he bought the clothes of your husband? A. Yes, the moment the robbery was mentioned to me, and I told an officer of it - my husband is not here. The Lord Mayor asked the prisoner if he could swear he bought them of him - he said he could not, and he was discharged - I believe Mr. Winn was present. My husband is hard at work, which there is a hurry for, for the last fortnight; he said if he had been slack of work he would have attended - he leaves off about eight; I do not expect him to call here for me.</p>

            . I deal in second-hand clothes, and live in Crown and Shears-place, Tower-hill. On the 23d of September, about eleven o'clock, I bought this waistcoat and coat of the prisoner, for 6s. - they were very much out of repair; I have dealt with him for three years- it might be a few minutes before eleven o'clock; my house is about half an hour's walk from Cheapside - he did not say where he got them; he brought them in a black linen bag; I did not ask him about them - he had nothing else, except a few children's things; I think it was a brown poplin frock - he had not other men's clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have dealt with him for three years? A. Yes, and always found him honest and upright; I do not keep a shop, but expose my goods in the open street, directly I buy them - I gave him the full value. The prosecutor was passing at seven o'clock, and asked where I got them; I accompanied him to the prisoner's house, and heard all that passed - he immediately said he had sold them to me, and had bought them in Cheapside that morning - I do not recollect what time he said. I know he goes about the street with a bag, to buy clothes - (looking at a bag), that is the one he brought them in; the prosecutor then asked if he bought any trousers - he said, "This pair upon me I bought with the coat and waistcoat, and seeing them about my own size I thought I would wear them, to save a better pair." The prosecutor said Pitcher who lived in his house, was rather a doubtful character, habituated to drink, and he had not the best opinion in the world of him. I was before the Lord Mayor on Monday; the prisoner said, "I believe Pitcher is the man, but cannot positively swear to him."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prosecutor's wife present when the prisoner said this about Pitcher? A. No - that was said at my place, and it was there the prosecutor said about Pitcher being addicted to drink; nobody but my wife was present - she is not here. On Saturday night, as we went along to the prisoner's house, he said Pitcher was an idle character, a drinker, and he had not the best opinion of him; the constable was with us.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Winn and Regin to the prisoner's house on Saturday evening: I did not hear him say anything about his suspicion of Pitcher - he said there was a man in his house who he had some suspicion of - that he did not know the man's name, but he lived up stairs. Cheapside is half an hour's walk from St. Mary-axe; if Winn had mentioned Pitcher's name I must have heard it; when we arrived at his house Pitcher had not come home - we went and waited at the watch-house, then went to see if Pitcher was come home, and met Mr. and Mrs. Pitcher, with the prosecutor - we walked behind them with the prisoner, who said, "I think that is the man;" I never heard Winn say he suspected Pitcher to be the man, for he went on the Sunday to Pitcher's employer, to inquire where he was on the Saturday- if he had mentioned Pitcher's name as we went to the watch-house I must have heard him; Mrs. Pitcher said the prisoner resembled the gentleman who went out that morning. I was not in the watch-house when she desired him to turn round.</p>
               <p>Q. After she said she believed he was the man, did you discharge him? A. By the advice of Plaistow, the wardbeadle - he is my superior; he seemed to be respectable, from the neighbourhood he lived in, and the house he kept; I did not know him before. I consulted my superior.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He made his appearance on the Monday? A. Yes - he said he thought Pitcher was the man before Mrs. Pitcher said she believed him to be the man; he said so the moment he saw him in the street, but afterwards said he would not swear to him.</p>

            . I never said I suspected Pitcher, for I had never seen his face till Saturday. After the prisoner said he bought them in Cheapside, he said he bought them of another person, in Hartshorn-alley, near Aldgatepump - he said that at our house - the constable was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you not to state this in your evidence in chief? A. I was not asked about it; I never said I suspected anybody in my house - what the constable has said is false.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you never said before that he said he bought them in Harishorn-alley? A. I was going to tell the whole of it, but I was interrupted by that gentleman. Regin has told a positive lie. The clothes are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he had bought the trousers which he had on at the same time? A.

                  <hi rend="italic">Horner's statement before the Magistrate was here read;</hi> "On last Wednes<lb></lb>day fortnight, I was at the top of Hunt-street and a young man came up to me and spoke to me, and got playing with the baby I had in my arms. He asked me if I lived down the street. I said, 'Yes.' He gave me a piece of plush, and said, 'That will do to make you a bonnet.' I said, 'Yes.' I went indoors. Mary Rooney came down, and I said, 'Look what I have had given to me. 'I gave it to her to go and sell it On the Friday morning, I met the man again; he had a horse and cart at the corner of the street; he asked me if any one was at home. I said, 'No one, except myself and two children;' as Mr. and Mrs. Mangon were out He asked me if he could put a box in there. I refused at first He said he would only be away an hour, and would call for it again and give me a shilling. He asked me to help him up with the box, and I did so. I did not know what was in the box. When we got upstairs, he said he would cut me a piece off if I liked. I said, 'No,' and told him not to stop. He told me to show it to no one if I cut a piece off. I tore a piece off, and hid it in the copper for fear they should see it when they came in.—I gave that piece to Rooney to sell. I did not tell her I had got a box up stairs. The police came in, and Mr. and Mrs. Mangon did not know the box was there till the police came."</p>

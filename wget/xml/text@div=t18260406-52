            . I live in Paradise-place. Lower-road, Islington. On Wednesday morning, the 22d of March, about half-past six o'clock, I was going towards home from the watch-house - I am the watch-house-keeper - and in the Lower-road the prisoner Smith went by me with a basket on his shoulder, with something very heavy in it; I saw Gurney coming along, within thirty yards of him, with another basket, similarly loaded - I stopped Gurney, and asked what he had in his basket; he said"Meat;" I pulled the basket off his shoulder and found two fore-quarters of mutton; I asked where he was going to take it - he said to Mr. Salter, a salesman in Newgate-market; there was a chopper in the basket; I said it was not usual for men to carry choppers to market with their meat - he made no answer; I told him to carry the basket to the King's Head - I there searched it more particularly, and found a gamble hook, which they hang sheep up with, and half a sheep's head - I found the other half of the head in his pocket, with a liver; I left the basket there for twenty minutes, took him to the watch-house, then pursued and took Smith with his basket, by Sadlerswells; I asked where he was going - he said he did not know; I found in his basket both the hind quarters of a sheep together, and a knife, and in his pocket a piece of lights, and in the other pocket a gamble hook. When we came to turn the two baskets out together, there were two sheeps' heads, two lots of fat, two hearts, and two livers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know whether either of them are butchers? A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to James Coleman, who lives at Upper Holloway, about two miles from the Lower-road. On Tuesday, the 21st of March, my fellow servant,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060029"></xptr>George, put eighty-one sheep into my charge, in a field nearly opposite the Red Caps public-house - one field from the road; I counted them, and saw them safe in the evening, at six o'clock; I shut the gate of the field and locked it - next morning, at eight, I counted them, and found only seventy-nine; I found the skins of the other two in the next field but one, a little after eight that morning, laying in a ditch; I saw Brown afterwards with the parts of two carcases; I compared the two hind-quarters and two forequarters, which he produced to me, with one of the skins - they corresponded with that skin in every point.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were all the eighty-one sheep of one breed? A. No; different, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Sheep of the same year's birth are about the same size? A. They are sometimes, but not always.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hundred thousand sheep would have fitted these skins? A. I should not think they would correspond in every point to fit - the fat left on the skin corresponds with the carcass.</p>

            . These eighty-one sheep were in my care - I saw the two skins - they had my mark on them; I was present when the meat was compared - it seemed to correspond with the skin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is Sadlers-wells from your field? A. About two miles and a half. I am a grazier and salesman; I do not know the prisoner; the mutton appeared to be dressed as well as it could be in any slaughter-house; the sheep belonged to one Mossman - I was answerable for them - they went from me to market on Friday.</p>

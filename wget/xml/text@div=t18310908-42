Yes, and I employed him particularly in mother-o'-pearl turning; I never allowed him to take any turnery home to do - I never allowed him to take home two needle-books as patterns; if he had work of his own to do he would want such tools as these, but these fit my lathe - he had been working on his own account for about a fortnight; I had no quarrel with him about introducing another workman - I only said I should want a few more men; I employed the prisoner at weekly wages, and he was not to take work from any other person; he left as soon as he saw another man - he said, "That man will be likely to take bread from my mouth," and went away; I had employed the prisoner's brother about three weeks or a month, and then turned him away - the prisoner wanted his brother to be instructed at my shop; the prisoner was at work when we took him - I had sold him a watch for silver gilt - I had bought it as such; the gilt was nearly worn off, and he had it gilt again - I do not know that it turned out to be brass; I told him to give me my watch back, as he had not paid for it - we had no quarrel about it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodging - I told him I had a search-warrant to search for property belonging to Mr. Perrottet, his master - he said, "I have no articles belonging to him;" these articles were then found - the prisoner said they were all his own, and part of the tools he had brought from Birmingham with him; there were a great many other things there.</p>
               <p>MR. PERROTTET. I was in the habit of using these tools, and seeing them in my shop; these pieces of mother-o'-pearl were in a drawer, which I opened almost every day - one or two of these pieces have been worked upon; I helped to make part of this - this tool fits my lathe exactly; the prisoner had a lathe, but I did not try it to that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear to these rough pieces of mother-o'-pearl? A. Yes, they have been more than two years in my drawer; these are tools commonly used - there is no mark on them; I know them by using them from time to time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw any thing of this kind in his shop; I had been in business before I came from Birmingham - he allowed me to take those two needle-books home one night to forward them.</p>

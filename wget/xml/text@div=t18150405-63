               <p>JOHN COLEMAN RASHLEIGH.

I saw a crowd of persons assembled at a butchers shop in the Harrow Road, and when I came there, the prisoner was among them; some person told the prisoner that he had cut the trunk off the carriage; the prisoner appeared in great aggitation, and said nothing; I saw the trunk that was brought out of the butcher's shop, it was mine; the prisoner was taken to Marlborough street office.</p>

I was on duty at the police-station when the female prisoner was brought in—when the charge was made she said that she was innocent, for her boy brought the lead into her room—I saw the sergeant-major, and arranged for him to go to the male prisoner at the Tower the next day with the boy Griffiths, and then in the presence of both prosecutors, said that when she was charged the night before she said that she was innocent, as the boy had brought it into the room—the boy said, "Yes, that is right, and he gave it to me" (pointing to the male prisoner)—I said, "You hear that"—the male prisoner said, "That is right."</p>

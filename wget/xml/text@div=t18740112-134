                  </hi>. I am a smith, of 41, East Street, Kennington Road—on 6th December I was in the Union public-house, Lambeth, between 4 and 5 o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—he was a stranger to me—I was taking a splint to get a light for my pipe, and dropped it, one of them trod on it, and I said "You might look out where you are treading" the prisoner insulted me, but it had nothing to do with him—he abused me and began shoving me—we then went outside, and he challenged me to fight—I went out with the intention of fighting, and was going to take my coat off, but before I could do so somebody knocked me down, and my head went against a cart wheel—I got up and got the best of him with my fists, but was knocked down again—when I got up I took my coat off, and we had a fight—I warded a blow off my head, and a knife went into my loft side—I did not see it in his hand, and I did not see it go in, but I saw</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Union Flag public-house—on Saturday, 6th December, about 4.20 p.m., I saw the prisoner in front of the private bar—there were three people there altogether—I did not see the commencement of it—I heard Shorricks say he was one by himself, and did not want to fight, and that he had a family of children; with that the prisoner shoved him three times, and Shorricks said "Come outside and see what I can do"—he went outside, and I followed—the prisoner came out and seized Shorricks, and struck his head against a cart wheel, and he fell, and the prisoner kicked him three times in the head, I believe, but I am not certain—Shorricks got up and they had a fight, and he got the best of the prisoner—with that the prisoner seized Peploe, and pulled out a knife and struck Shorricks in the left breast—Shorricks began to jump, and said that he was stabbed; he fell, and then the prisoner went into the school-yard—I ran after him, caught him, and threw him down—he tried to put the knife down a sink in the corner of the lane, but I caught hold of it and held it till I saw a constable—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

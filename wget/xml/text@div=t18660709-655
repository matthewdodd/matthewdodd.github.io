                  </hi>. I live in High Street, Putney—at the time of this accident I lived at No. 2, College Street—on Monday night, 21st May, I got home about half-past seven—eight o'clock was the time to go in, appointed by me and my wife—I went in company with my wife and a broker—we all three went in together—the broker was to buy the things—there had been some disagreement between me and my wife—we had a mutual consent to sell the things—I consented to sell the goods and give her half the money, and separate, and for me to allow her a maintenance—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090101"></xptr>
               <p>I only sold part of the things to the broker—after they were sold it was very nearly eleven o'clock, or a little after, I could not say to a quarter of an hour—I saw my wife go up Wandsworth Lane towards Putney, and I thought I would go home and have a doze with my clothes on, which I did—we were to separate on that night—I was at the street-door—she went one way and I another—the street-door was locked, and the landlord opened it—I got into my room by entering the window, as the door was locked, and my wife had the key—when I got into the room I laid down and went to sleep, for I was very tired—I had worked very hard all day—when I awoke I found my left hand tied above my head to the head of the bed-stead, and my right hand to the foot, and the rope passed across my bed, and my throat cut—I awoke by the feel of the cut, and the blood coming out of it profusely—it was perfectly dark, there was no light in the room—I heard my wife say, using a foul word, "I will see if you will go away from me," and she gave me another cut—I was entirely in her power—I then got my feet disentangled, and got them on the floor, and I promised her I would not go away—I felt something, I do not know whether it was a razor or a knife, in her hand, but I felt something cut my throat—she then loosened my right hand from the rope, and I got loose, opened the door, and went out into the street—she followed me—she said she hoped I would not transport her; she would attend to my throat herself, and say nothing about it—I told her I was going to the doctor's, but I made my way to the police-court—she helped me part of the way—I fell down, and I know nothing more till I got to the station.</p>

I am sure my hands were tied—we had lived a very unhappy life from three weeks after our marriage, which is close on five years—I do not wish to enter into that—I wish not to hurt her more than possible—I do not wish to punish her—she has sold my home and left me destitute, and several other things—I do not think I have given her any provocation—she has never accused me of having done so—she has made complaints and charges against me ten or eleven times—I have been to Marlborough Street on summonses at her instance, for abuse and one thing and another—I was innocent of it—she convicted me once for twenty-eight days, falsely swearing I struck her—that is nearly two years ago—previous to that I had to swear my life against her, and for the protection of my daughter—she is my second wife—she was bound over for six months—that was two years and a half ago—after that she drew a bill on me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and broke 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of crockery—I cannot say she has taken out a summons against me for the last twelve months—I thought it was best to take her away from a lot of her companions, and I went from London to Putney, and when I went to remove my goods I found they were all taken for rent; I did not owe anybody a halfpenny—it was a conspiracy between my wife and the landlord—I have been paying double rent—she kept the rent-book—that caused disturbances between us—I have lost many of the best places in London in my business through her—I have gone home at seven at night, and have had to walk the streets till twelve and half-past, she has locked the door and gone out—I go out at half-past four or five every morning—I am a farrier by business.</p>

I live at Wandsworth—on Monday night, 21st May, after 12 o'clock, I was returning from Putney, and saw the prosecutor lying on his back in Wandsworth Lane bleeding, and the prisoner lying on him—I asked what was the matter—he said his throat was cut—I asked who did it—he said his wife had done it, and said that was the woman—I told him he must get up—he said he could not—I got him up as well as I could and got him to the station—I was present when he made the charge.</p>

On the morning of the 22nd of May, about half-past twelve o'clock the prisoner came to the station with her husband accompanied by Tuck—the husband did not charge her at that time—the doctor was afterwards sent for—Tuck told me that the prosecutor had accused his wife of cutting his throat—I asked him whether his wife had done it; he said, "Yes"—I then took her up into the office, cautioned her, and asked her to explain how her husband came in that position—she was crying and sobbing very much, and she said, "I don't know"—I then removed her from the presence of her husband into another department, when she said, "I will tell you the truth. For some time past my husband has been in the habit of ill-treating me, and saying terms towards me that I never deserved. He commenced again last night, and I could not stand it any longer, and I committed the act"—I asked her what she had done it with, and she said, "With his razor"—I asked her where it was—she said, "On the top of the dressing-table in our bedroom"—Inspector Usher came in at that time.</p>

                  </hi> (Police Inspector). I was sent for to the station—I got there about one o'clock in the morning, on 22nd May—I found the prosecutor attended by a surgeon in the reserve room—he was in considerable danger—the magistrate had been sent for, who arrived shortly afterwards, and I took down his statement—he afterwards charged his wife with attempting to murder him; at least, I charged her for him, for he was unable to write—I told her it was by cutting his throat with a razor—she paused for a second or two and then said, "Yes"—I then asked her for the key of her door—she gave it me—I asked her whether there was anything particular I should find in her room—she said, "You will find the razor on two boxes in the bedroom"—I went there and found this razor open, covered with blood, on two boxes by the side of an iron bedstead—I found this rope tied round the bedstead two or three times—it extended from the foot of the bed to the side, and then back again across the top part—there was blood on the razor—the counterpane and the floor and the rope were covered with blood—there was also blood on the handles of the door—there was no cut on the rope—I afterwards examined the yard, and found a clothes-line with a portion of rope missing, and this corresponded with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons—on the morning of 22nd May I was sent for to the police-station—I found the prosecutor there—he was very much exhausted from loss of blood, and I found that his throat was cut—it was a very extensive cut, about five inches in length from side to side, and it extended through the skin into the muscles—the large vessels were not divided—I suppose it was about half an inch deep—I believed him to be in a dangerous condition, and in<lb></lb>structed the police to send for the magistrate to take his deposition—it was such a wound as might be caused by a razor—it just escaped the main arteries</p>

               <p>—the main artery laid just underneath—I could see the pulsation of the large vessel of the neck—the breathing apparatus was cut, but the cut did not extend right through, so that he breathed through his mouth, and not through his throat, as he would have done if the larynx had been divided—the danger was from exhaustion from loss of blood—there must have been a great amount of force used, and with a very sharp instru<lb></lb>ment, such as this is—there was only one wound, but there had been evidently two cuts—there was a line or cord of skin, showing that the instrument had been used twice—the two wounds went into each other.</p>

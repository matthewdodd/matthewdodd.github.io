                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whose handwriting is this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mine—I took the charge from Barry and Hayes. (<hi rend="italic">The charge was, "being found in the enclosed garden of No</hi>. 63, <hi rend="italic">Gloucester Crescent, St. Pancras, supposed for an unlawful purpose; further, with burglariously breaking and enter<lb></lb>ing the above house</hi>.")The words "burglariously," &amp;c., were not added till about nine o'clock in the morning, after the constables had been and professed to have found the state the house was in—the nature of the charge was altered from that information—it was twenty minutes to two o'clock when the young men were brought to the station—I have got the time accurately—it is part of my duty to book the time; I do not speak by guess, but positively—Barry and Hayes were in plain clothes as detectives—I had given them certain orders—I know what their line. of duty was; it would take them to Gloucester Crescent; that was where I ordered them to go, and patrol in that neighbourhood—I know Eversholt Street; they would not have the slightest business there, if they were there at all they would be entirely out of the line of their duty, they would be off the ground to which they were sent—Mr. Dollman's house is about a mile from the station—I know the Stationers' Arms public-house; that would be also out of their beat—supposing persons taken into custody at Gloucester Crescent, I should think the most direct way for the constables to take them to the station would be down Mornington Road, Stanhope Street, and across Cumberland Market into the station—I should think that would be the nearest road, that is the way I should have taken any one if I had taken them—that would be a route frequented by policemen, they would meet with about six or seven policemen that way I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean "meet" or "pass?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would meet them, as they work that way, they all work to the right.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would reckon on their meeting that number of policemen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should; supposing they came right down Albany Street, they would only pass two, even if they had the chance of meeting them—Albany Street is a straight beat, and there are only two policemen from the York and Albany to the station door—it would most decidedly be the proper course for them to take prisoners along a route</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190023"></xptr>
               <p>where there might be assistance in the event of any attempt at rescue—there had been a good many burglaries in this neighbourhood, and it was in consequence of those burglaries that an extra number of policemen were stationed in plain clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When had Barry and Hayes gone on duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see Hayes till he brought the prisoners in, but Barry at twelve o'clock at night was waiting at the station for Hayes to come—their duty was to go out at twelve o'clock—Hayes did not come to the station till twenty minutes to two o'clock, the time he brought the prisoners; but he sent a policeman in; that was Small, and in consequence of Small's message I sent Barry immediately to him—I saw nothing more of them till they brought the prisoners—after they had brought in the prisoners they went out again on duty—it would be the proper course of their duty to go up to the house where they said they had taken the prisoners, to see whether there were any appearances necessary to take notice of—I do not know that they went, only from what I was told.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there were appearances about the house of an attempt to break into it, but no appearance to indicate that an entry had been made, would it be the duty of the constables to wake up the inmates, or to wait in the neighbourhood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To wait in the neighbourhood—in matters of this kind the possibility of accomplices is not lost sight of—if they waited watching the premises until daylight, and then woke up the inmates, that would be in the ordinary and proper course of their duty—the time at which they left the station after giving the parties in charge was from five to ten minutes before two o'clock—they brought them in at the back door, and placed them in the dock, I then pushed up the window of my office and took their names and addresses, and after I had done that I took the charge-sheet and walked round into the room where they were, and took the charge, and it was then twenty minutes to two o'clock, it very possibly might have been three minutes before that that they came in—both Hayes and Barry gave the charge—Hayes was the first that spoke; he said, "I charge these two young men with being found in the enclosed garden of No. 63, Gloucester Crescent"—I then said to him, "Are these the young men you were watching when you sent into the station at twelve o'clock?"—he said, "Yes"—he had not anything in his hand at that time that I saw—neither of the constables had that I saw—he made this statement in the hearing of the two young men—neither of them said anything then—I then took down the charge, and read it over to them, and one of them, I could not say which, said, "We were not there," and the other one said, "No, Eversholt Street"—a knife was afterwards produced by Hayes, and he told me he had found it in the garden; that was said in their presence, they must have heard him, because they were not standing two yards from him—neither of them made any remark, not in my hearing—I should have heard them if they had—I do not know how long Hayes has been in the force, I think not above three or four years—he has been under me, or rather I do duty in the station, he has a sergeant looking after him doing duty in the streets—he has borne a very good character indeed, steady, regular, and truthful; if he had not borne the character of a good con<lb></lb>stable he would not have been put in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners searched—this knife was not taken from them in my presence—I saw them searched—I saw everything that was taken—no knife was taken from them at the station—I think there were two or three matches, they were thrown into the grate; when persons are brought to the station with short pipes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190024"></xptr>
               <p>or matches we generally throw them away—supposing the young men were taken into custody in Eversholt Street, I should take them down Eversholt Street, up Seymour Street, Bedford Street, across Ampthill Square, Edward Street, across Cumberland Market, up Ernest Street into the station—I know the place where Small was on duty—they would be taken past there, coming from Eversholt Street; that would be a part of his beat.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Within your knowledge, has he not been reported for not properly working on his beat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I can't say that he has—I cannot say he has not—if I was on day duty and he was on night duty I should not know anything about his duties—I know he has been reported, what for I don't know—I do not know that he was in the service of Mr. Curling, of Davies's Wharf, before he came into the police force—I do not know whether Mr. Curling is here—I do not know whether he was in the employ of Mr. Scovel, of Hibernia Wharf—I did not inquire into his character when he joined the police, so I do not know anything at all about it—I can't say what kind of plain clothes Hayes and Barry had on—I can't say that one of them had an umbrella in his hand—I cannot say that he had not—I don't believe that one of them had a light coat on—I don't re<lb></lb>member it—I could not swear that he had—I don't believe that either of them had a light coat on—I will not swear he had not, because I don't know whether he had or not—I would not swear to a thing I am not positive of—I don't believe Barry had an umbrella in his hand; I did not see one, not to notice it—if the constables saw persons of a suspicious character it would be their duty to follow them, up Eversholt Street, or any other street—it would not be their duty, upon seeing the window of a house lifted, immediately to alarm the people in the house, because they told me the shutters were not opened—it was their duty to wait till daylight and not to alarm the persons in the house—the shutters were closed, and there was no proof that any person had entered the house—I should think it would be folly on the part of the policemen to alarm the persons if they saw the shutters undisturbed—I have never heard of persons getting into a house and fastening the shutters after them when they were in the house committing their depredations—I don't say it would be more likely that they would leave the shutters open to be seen by anybody pass<lb></lb>ing by—it was no part of the officers' duty to alarm the persons till the proper time of waking from their rest, just before they came off duty—they would come off duty at six o'clock—if I had been on duty I should have awoke them, so as to have had time to search the house before I came off duty—I should not wait till the last moment before coming off duty, but so as to have time to get to the station at the proper time, six o'clock—if I was confident in my own mind that no person had entered the house, I should not think it right to ring the bell to ascertain whether I was right or wrong in that conjecture, I should use my own judgment upon that—it would be the duty of the constables to go back to the house immediately after leaving their prisoners at the station—the officers left before me, and I was away before two—when they brought the lads in I did not see any<lb></lb>thing</p>

               <p>in the hands of either of the constables—it was after they had been searched that I saw the knife—the charge was booked first, then they were searched, and then for the first time I saw the knife—when they came in with the lads I did not see a knife in the hand of either of them—I can't say that I must have seen it if that had been so, most likely I should not.</p>

About half-past one I saw them in the garden of No. 63, Gloucester Crescent. I leaped over the wall and caught the prisoner Dye, and Pearce was taken into custody by Barry in the garden. I found this knife. We took them to the station, and at the station the prisoner Dye said, 'That is my knife.' The other prisoner said, 'Yes, I sharpened it for you.' I and Barry went back to the house, and saw that the latch of the area window had been forced open, and some pieces of the sash lay on the window-ledge—the knife fitted the marks exactly. I found this chisel in the area. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The knife was not taken from the pocket of the prisoner.")</p>

I reside at Kingswood Cottage, Walworth—I am a reporter at the Middlesex Sessions—I knew the usher who administered the oath to the defendant—he is since dead—I saw the oath administered to Hayes in the prosecution against Pearce and Dye—I took the evidence of Hayes in that case—I produce my notes of it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:—" I am a police constable, 81 S—I remember the 30th of August coming on duty in Morn<lb></lb>ington Crescent in plain clothes—a little before twelve my attention was attracted to the two prisoners, who were standing at the corner of Morning<lb></lb>ton Road—after that I saw the police constable Small on his beat—they stood there about twenty minutes—I met Small, and in consequence of something I said to Small he went to the station to fetch another constable—police constable Barry, 99 S, came to me afterwards; this was about twenty minutes past twelve—the prisoners went up the Mornington Road, that is in the direction of Gloucester Crescent—I lost sight of them at the corner of Gloucester Crescent, and the next I saw of them was in the garden of No. 63, Gloucester Crescent—that was past one o'clock, but I do not know exactly—I jumped over the wall, it is about four and a half feet high—I put my hands upon it—I caught hold of the prisoner Dye—Pearce got over the wall, and Barry took him outside—I found a knife in the garden—at the station I produced the knife—Dye said, "That is my knife"—Pearce said, "Yes, I sharpened it for you"—I had found the knife in the front garden—I examined the area and window—it had been forced and the latch pushed back, and the window lifted up two or three inches—I also found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the area—I had got the knife with me at the time—there were some marks on the windows, and two or three shavings taken off and laid on the window-ledge—I compared the knife with the marks I found on the window in the presence of the servant, and they corresponded—the first time I saw these lads was a little before twelve o'clock at the corner of Mornington Road—Small is here to-day—he was not examined before the police Magistrate, because this defence was not set up at the first hearing—I did not say one word about Small in my evidence before the Magistrate, I did not mention his name—I have made inquiries about these lads since this charge was preferred—I found out that Dye was in the employment of Mr. Ivory, and Pearce in the employ of Mr. Brooks—the lad Dye gave his address No. 18, Bayham Place, Camden Town, and I could not find it—he gave me No. 18—I asked at No. 18 if there was another 18, and they said no—I did not take the trouble to inquire at the next house or at the house opposite—I believe there is a No. 18 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>—I was informed that Mrs. Dye, his mother, lived at No. 18 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>—I gave an answer to the Court that I had been to No. 18, Bayham Place, and found that no such person lived there—I was told there was a No. 18 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi> by a constable since, but I was told here not to answer more than I was asked—I know the Stationers' Arms, at the corner of High Street and Warren Street, Camden Town—I did not happen to go there that night—I do not know the proprietor of the house—I know the house well—I mean to tell you and the gentlemen of the jury, on that night I was not in the Stationers' Arms public-house—and Barry were not together in this</p>

               <p>public-house on that evening before twelve o'clock that night—I was not in the Stationers' Arms in company with Barry, because at twelve o'clock I had not seen him. <hi rend="italic">Mr. Sleigh</hi>. Let Thomas Grocer, George Ostler, and Mr. Wright come into court. (<hi rend="italic">Three witnesses enter the court</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">Mr. Sleigh</hi>. "You see those gentlemen?" <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. "Yes." <hi rend="italic">Mr. Sleigh</hi>. "Let them leave the court again." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examination continued</hi>. "I adhere to the answer I have given, that I and Barry were not in the Stationers' Arms on that night—I never saw Barry until he was sent from the station-house—I did not stay there till past one o'clock in the morning, when the house was closed—I was not near to it—I and Barry took these lads into custody—I saw them both in the garden—one was taken outside—Pearce jumped over the wall—I took Dye actually in the garden—I know Evers-holt Street—it was about a mile, or a little over, from the garden where I saw these lads, and where they were taken into custody—there is not a great deal of difference between Eversholt Street and Gloucester Crescent from the station—we did not pass Eversholt Street to go to the station—they were taken to the Albany Station—I was not in Eversholt Street or neighbourhood between one and two o'clock in the morning—I had no business there—I was not in company with Barry in or close to Eversholt Street between one and two o'clock in the morning—Eversholt Street is a mile from the station—The prisoners were taken through Mornington Road, Stanhope Street, across Cumberland Market, to our station in Albany Street—those are the streets we passed through, although we crossed other streets—we did not pass through Albany Street, because we were more likely to meet with assistance in passing through Mornington Road—that was a straighter road than going through Albany Street—Eversholt Street leads into King Street, Camden Town—I saw no man in a fit in the neighbourhood of Eversholt Street on that night—I was in plain clothes, and the other officer too—I had no umbrella with me, but I do not remember if Barry had or not—it is not true that I and Barry spoke to these lads or pushed them—it is not true that I followed these lads down High Street—I and the other officer did not get into a hansom cab—why should we do so?—it is not true that I took the prisoners into custody in Eversholt Street—it is not true that I said, "I have got one, and you take another, and so let us have a couple of them"—it is not true that I took those lads through Lidlington Street, that we stopped at the post office, and went from there to the station-house—we did not go through Mornington Crescent, but passed the end of it—I went to Mr. Dollman's house, in whose garden we had seen the prisoners, at past three o'clock—we rang the bell for the people in the house, and it was daylight when the people came—these lads were deposited in the station-house before two o'clock—they were in the station-house at that time—before we rang the bell we went into the garden and examined the window, and found the window had been lifted two or three inches, and two or three bits of shav<lb></lb>ing were lying on the window—after seeing the knife I examined it with the marks on the window when I got into the house—it was getting on for five o'clock at that time—the chisel was in the area, and the knife was in the garden close by Dye. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you adhere to the statement that you found the knife there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you adhere to the statement you made here to-day, that the knife was not taken from the lad in the station-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I searched him in the station-house in the presence of others, but I took the knife into the station-house open in my hand. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it your duty when you take persons into custody at the</p>

Q.</hi> I ask you whether in the presence of the sergeant and inspector this lad did not say, "This is my knife?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, before I searched him—I said so before. <hi rend="italic">Mr. Payne</hi>. He was not cross-examined as to any of these things before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they were committed for trial—on the first occasion when the prisoners were brought before the Magistrate there was no professional man—Pearce said it was false. <hi rend="italic">Mr. Sleigh. Q.</hi> On the occasion of the remand did not the solicitor who instructs me say he had an ample defence, and the Magistrate said it was no use to hear a professional man, as he was determined to send the case for trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.")</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Johnson Street, Somer's Town, with my parents—I am in the employment of Mr. Ivory, a pianoforte manufacturer, at Brooks's factory, Cumberland Market—I had been in his employ about ten months previous to this transaction—I know Dye—he is a companion and friend of mine—I remember the night of the 30th August—on that night I met Dye in a place called the "Slips" in the Regent's Park—I should think it was a little before eight o'clock—I did not part company with him at all that night—I was with him during the whole night until we were taken into custody—I know Gloucester Crescent—I was not in Gloucester Crescent that night—I was not in the garden of the house No. 63—a chap of the name of Gregory was with me in the "Slips" besides Dye, another one of the name of Blackburn, and George Potts, and a young girl of the name of Phoebe Glue—I could not say for certain what time it was when we left the "Slips," but it was about a quarter past eight—we went to the Regalia public-house, in Augusta Street—Gregory, Blackburn, and Potts were with us there—Phoebe Glue had left us—we stayed at the Regalia until about twenty minutes past eleven, and then went to the York and Albany public-house—that was the nearest point that we were to Gloucester Crescent—I do not know the house that was supposed to have been broken—I should say Gloucester Crescent was about 150 yards from the York and Albany—we stayed at the York and Albany till they shut up, twelve o'clock—Gregory, Dye, Potts, and Blackburn were with me up to that time—when we left there we went down Park Street into Smith's, the one o'clock house, the Camden Stores, at the corner of Grove Street and Park Street—it was about ten minutes or a quarter past twelve when we got to Smith's—all the persons I have named were with me except Glue—she joined us again at the York and Albany before we got to the one o'clock house—we walked straight into Smith's and called for some ale—all of us went in—I believe Glue went in with us—we remained there till about five minutes to one—after we left there we walked down Park Street, turned down by the Britannia, down High Street, till we got to the corner of Warren Street, where we saw some young chaps standing outside the Stationers' Arms—from what I have learnt since, I wanted to fight some of them—a young chap told me I wanted to fight him—I had been drinking a good deal of beer that even<lb></lb>ing—I had known those young men by sight—I first saw the defendant Hayes when I got to the Stationers' Arms—Barry was with him—they</p>

               <p>were standing outside the Stationers' Arms—they were both dressed in private clothes—one of them, Barry, had an umbrella in his hand—I could not swear which one had a light coat, but I know one had a light overcoat—there was a little bit of a row with our party and the others outside the Stationers' Arms, and we walked down Cam<lb></lb>den Town—the constables followed us—when we got about a hundred yards down there was a man in a fit—we stopped to look at him, and one of the constables said, "Sling your dannel"—he said that to Blackburn, who was with us—we then walked across the road to the other side of High Street, and Barry poked Blackburn in the back with his umbrella—then we ran, and they ran a little way, and Black<lb></lb>burn and Dye turned round King Street—I and Gregory and Phoebe Glue ran straight down Camden Town—our party and Dye and Black<lb></lb>burn met again at the corner of High Street at the perambulator maker's—they would go down King Street, round Bayham Street, and round Earl's Terrace—we were all together at the bottom of High Street, except Potts—he left Smith's public-house two or three minutes before we did, and went home—that was before the poking in the back with the umbrella—when we were at the corner of High Street we stood bidding Blackburn good night, because he lives up Kentish Town—we bade him good night at the corner of Eversholt Street—that is just across the road—before Blackburn had left us we had crossed the road, and stood at the chemist's shop at the corner of Eversholt Street—it was there that Black<lb></lb>burn left us—we then went straight down Eversholt Street—we had gone half-way down Eversholt Street, and Dye ran on ahead—he did not run, he went a little quicker than we—I asked where he was going—he turned round and said he was going round the corner to make water—he went round Crawley Mews, and when he got round there Hayes and Barry were there, and knocked him down—I and Glue and Gregory were on the right side of the road coming from Camden Town—the constables and Dye were on the opposite side—they took Dye into custody, and they were bringing him across the road, and Gregory and Glue ran up, and I said, "What is the matter?" and Hayes said to Barry, "Collar him; we may as well have a couple"—they then took me into custody—Gregory was following behind, and they told him if he did not go back they would have him—Gregory then went home—he went away—we were taken from Eversholt Street; through Lidlington Place, across the road by some iron posts—they stopped there for a second or two, as though considering which way they should take us—we then went through the iron posts, and round Harrington Square, across the Hampstead road, round Mornington Crescent, up Stan-hope Place, along Stanhope Street, into Edward Street, up Edward Street into Cumberland Market, Munster Street, and Ernest Street, to the back door of the station—Phoebe Glue followed us to the station—we were put behind an iron bar and searched, and the sergeant began writing something down in a book—I do not know what he wrote down—I asked Barry what he took us up for, and he told me to hold my noise—I first heard what I was charged with next morning, when we were brought out of the cells to go to Marylebone—I heard it from one of the sergeants—I do not know his name—I saw Dye searched at the station—Hayes held up a knife when he was searched and said, "Here is a pretty thing"—Dye said, "That is my knife," and I said, "Yes, I sharpened it for you yester<lb></lb>day"—we had been in the station about five minutes before the knife was produced—I did not see Hayes or Barry in the Stationers' Arms—I never</p>

               <p>was in the house—I know Stanley, the officer of the police-court—I saw him here last session when the charge against Barry was being tried—I went out with him from the other court to a public-house—I said I wanted to go out and have something to drink, and he said he would go with me and another gentleman—we had some cooper and pork pie—I believe there was a few words between us while we were having it—I cannot exactly remember what it was—I know I said it was a scandalous affair to take us and charge us with burglary, and we knew nothing about it—Stanley merely said, "Yes" and "No"—I might have said a few more words, but I cannot remember them—I did not say I should be glad if the policemen got of—I said I should not care whether they got off or not, as long it was all dropped, as I was tired of it—nothing was said about "trick" and "tie" that I am aware of—I do not remember whether any<lb></lb>thing was said about Mr. Ivory.</p>

I live at No. 18A, Bayham Place, in the neighbourhood of Camden Town, with my father and mother—at the time this cir<lb></lb>cumstance took place I was in the employment of Mr. Burton, a plumber, in Frederick Street, Hampstead Road—I had been in his employment about two years—I know Pearce—I remember the night of Thursday, 30th August—I was in the "Slips" in the Regent's Park, about half-past seven o'clock, with Thomas Pearce, George Potts, William Gregory, Leonard Blackburn, and Phoebe Glue—it was about half-past eight o'clock, as near as I can speak, when we left the "Slips"—we went from there to the Regalia public-house, in Augusta Street—I was in the habit of walking out with Phoebe Glue—she did not go to the Regalia with me, Potts did, and Gregory, Blackburn, and Pearce—after we left the Regalia we came back to the York and Albany again—I know Gloucester Crescent—I was not at all in Gloucester Crescent on the night of 30th August—I was not in the garden of No. 63 with Pearce—the only time that Pearce and I parted company was when I and Blackburn ran down King Street, that was about one minute, with that exception we were together all the even<lb></lb>ing up to the time of being taken into custody—when we left the Regalia we went back to the York and Albany, and Phoebe Glue rejoined us there—when we left the York and Albany we went down Park Street, before that we went into Smith's at the corner of Grove Street, that was</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 63, Gloucester Crescent—on the night of 30th August I retired to rest about half-past eleven o'clock—the servant usually saw that the house was safe, and I did occasionally myself—I went to bed as usual on the night in question—I was awoke as nearly as possible at five minutes to five o'clock, first by the servant coming down the stairs and telling me there was a ring at the bell, and then by the policeman Hayes, I believe it was, who came a short way up the stairs to tell me my house had been broken—I went down into the kitchen—the servant was there, and Hayes, and Barry, and a policeman in uniform—there is a small garden in front of my house—I think this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a fairly correct model of my house—I have not had the garden measured—it was not measured in my presence—I saw the sash of kitchen window that morning when I was called downstairs—the window was open two or three inches, and the shutters were open when I came down—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) gives an indication of the marks that I had pointed out to me on the window—I believe it to be correct—I do not know what the state of the catch might be then, but afterwards it went rather stiff—if I remember right, I tried it, and found it to be rather stiff—I did not try it at the time—Hayes I am sure was in plain clothes—I could not swear as to what dress the other had on, or what coat he had on—I believe Hayes had a dark<lb></lb>coloured coat—with regard to the other, I could not swear whether his coat was exactly light or not—I could not exactly tell whether they were dressed in dark clothes or not, not for certain—I could not swear to it.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Dollman—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 31st August I was upstairs in my room and heard the bell ring—I think it was between four and five o'clock—I do not know whether the front gate was bolted at that time—I opened my door and came downstairs—I saw Hayes and Barry, and a policeman in uniform—that was the first time I had seen them—they said they were two detectives—I let them in and went down into the kitchen with them—they went first, but I followed them—they were in the hall—they had got as far as the stairs when I went up to master; but before I opened the door to them I told my master as I was coming downstairs that there was somebody at the door, and after I let them in I left them at the top of the stairs and went up just two or three steps, and master came outside his door as I was going up—when I came down the constables were where I had left them—they went before me into the kitchen—I followed them quite closely—at that time the shutters were shut—I saw them opened—Hayes opened them—the bell is just outside the gate.</p>

I am a constable of the Metro<lb></lb>politan Police Force—I am now suspended during the progress of this inquiry—I was tried last session on a charge of perjury in relation to this matter, and acquitted—I have been in the police force seven years—I live at Barclay Street, Somer's Town—I am married—I have no family—I was on duty in plain clothes on 30th August, the night this affair took place—I had to go on duty at twelve o'clock at night and come off at six o'clock in the morning—I am off duty during the intermediate time—the course which a police-constable has to pursue before he goes on duty is to go to the police-station and report himself to the acting inspector—it would therefore be my proper course to go to the police-station at twelve o'clock and report myself—I did so on the night of 30th August—I reported my<lb></lb>self at a quarter to twelve—Sergeant Bendall was present when I reported myself—he was the person to receive my report and order me on duty—more constables than usual were on that beat in consequence of many burglaries having been committed in the neighbourhood—I waited at the station till twelve minutes after twelve—I was told to wait till the de<lb></lb>fendant Hayes came—I am quite sure I was at the station-house from about a quarter to twelve till ten minutes after twelve—Hayes did not</p>

               <p>come—Constable Small, 80, came—he went and spoke to Sergeant Bendall and I was ordered to go and meet Hayes in the Mornington Road—I should think Mornington Road is about a quarter of a mile from the station—I should say rather more—that is the nearest point, the railway bridge—that is at the corner of Stanhope Place, in the Mornington Road—I went beyond Stanhope Place and met Hayes to the left of that, between the two bridges in the Mornington Road—that would be about twenty minutes to twenty-five minutes past twelve—Hayes pointed out two young men, Pearce and Dye, some little distance up the Mornington Road from where I met Hayes—they went in the direction of Gloucester Crescent—they were walking together—they were just moving away when Hayes pointed them out to me—I and Hayes watched them—they went up Mornington Road and afterwards into Park Street, and into Mornington Crescent after that—directly they got into Mornington Crescent I lost sight of them—we were in the Mornington Road when we lost sight of them—I do not mean Mornington Crescent, I mean Glou<lb></lb>cester Crescent—we watched them into Gloucester Crescent and then lost sight of them—we made an arrangement between as and I searched the right side of Gloucester Crescent, the gardens, and Hayes the left side, and when I had got about half-way round the Crescent I heard Hayes raise an alarm—I turned round and saw Hayes going over the wall and saw a man leaving a garden on the opposite side—that man was Pearce—he was running—I ran after him and took him about 150 yards from where I saw him leave the garden—I collared him and took him back and met Hayes coming out of the garden with Dye—I took Pearce to the station—I left Hayes coming behind with Dye—I saw an open knife in Hayes's hand—I am quite sure about that, Hayes called my attention to it at the time—he showed it to me in the presence of Dye and in the hearing of Dye—he told me that he found it at Dye's feet in the garden—Dye did not say anything to that—I arrived at the station I think at about half-past one as near as possible, it might be a little earlier—the police are not supplied with watches—I have a watch—there is a clock at the station—when we got to the station we charged the prisoners with being found in enclosed premises for an unlawful purpose—we were not aware at that time that any attempt had been made to break into the house—there was no other constable in Gloucester Crescent when we took the two young men—the route we took to the station from Gloucester Crescent was across Park Street, through Mornington Road, till we got to the railway bridge, and then turned to the right up Stanhope Street—Albany Street may be a shorter route—there is a reason why we went the particular route we did—if we went through Albany Street and required any assistance, we should meet but one or two constables: on the other route we would meet about seven, and if we required assistance we could get it more readily there—I saw some policemen going that way—I saw two or three persons not policemen also—I saw a person of the name of Davey just a few yards beyond-Park Street—I might have seen him before, I did not know him—going along the street I saw a policeman named King—after I had seen King I saw another person who turned out to be Davis—I had never spoken to Davis before—as far as I know I never saw him before—after seeing Davis I saw 66, Sinclair—these different people had an opportunity of seeing me and Hayes—after we had disposed of our prisoners at the station we went back to Gloucester Crescent—we arrived there, as near as I can recollect, at about three o'clock—some little time was occupied</p>

               <p>at the station in taking down the charge—when we got back to Glouces<lb></lb>ter Crescent we examined the premises No, 63—we found footmarks in the garden and traced them to the area—we then saw, by the lamp of the constable on the beat, that the window was open—he was present when we discovered this—there were marks of some sharp instrument having been used—we remained in the immediate neighbourhood, in a position that if any person came we must have seen them—from what we saw of the window we formed a judgment as to whether any person was inside—we saw the window open, but the shutters were fast: there were no marks of violence whatever on the shutters, and from that we con<lb></lb>cluded that no person had entered by that way—I consider my duty was, therefore, to remain in the immediate neighbourhood in the first place—I did not think I should be doing right in alarming the house, there might have been an invalid there—I did not think it right to alarm the house at that time, as I did not think any entry had been made—we waited about till rather before five, and then awoke the inmates—my proper beat is the second and third sections—that would not bring me to Eversholt Street under any circumstances—I was not near there—I could not be, in fact I had no right to be there—I did not take these men in custody in Eversholt Street, decidedly not—I was not that evening in the Stationers' Arms—I was there two or three nights previously, with Hayes—I am quite sure I was not in the public-house that night—I have never been in that public-house but once previously to this matter taking place—I was at the station-house, in fact, from ten minutes to twelve till some minutes after twelve—I was dressed as I am now, with a scarf round my neck—Hayes was dressed as he is now—neither of us had a light coat on—I had an umbrella—I always carry an umbrella while upon duty, in case of any change in the weather—I did not poke or strike any one with that umbrella that night—no complaint was made about it till very lately—the knife I saw was decidedly not taken out of the pocket at the station—it was found at the place—Hayes carried the knife in his hand all the way from the Crescent to the station.</p>

               <p>back when I saw Hayes coming towards me—I was not in the garden at all until I came back from the station—I first saw the knife in Hayes's hand as he was coming towards me from the garden—he had got Dye by one hand and the knife in the other—I did not say at the Middlesex Sessions, "I then took Pearce to the station-house; at the station-house the knife was produced by Hayes"—that is not word for word correct—"At the police-station Hayes produced the knife" is correct—"Dye said, ‘That is my knife,' and Pearce said, 'Yes, I sharpened it for you," that is correct—we took the prisoners along this route, on which we should meet seven policemen, in preference to that on which we should only meet two, because there is such a thing as prisoners being rescued—Hayes never shut the knife but carried it in his hand the whole way to the station—the route we came to the station is the route that the section is marched from the station to the beats—I had Dye by one hand, and my other hand was engaged by my umbrella—I did not know that the window was open till I came back at three o'clock in the morning—I did not think it necessary to go back with Hayes and examine the premises when he brought the boy out of the premises—I had a watch—we got back to this garden at three o'clock in the morning, as near as I can calculate—I communicated with the police-man on the beat as soon as I saw him, a few minutes afterwards—his name is Burke, 32—he would know the time we arrived there—we were not in the garden all the time from three o'clock in the morning till five—we came out of the garden at three, with Burke—we went away from the garden, but remained in the immediate neighbourhood, in the Crescent—we felt assured that no entry had been made into the house, and that is the reason why we did not alarm the inmates—we did alarm the inmates at about five o'clock—I said before the Magistrate that one of the then de<lb></lb>fendants gave a false address—he gave the address, 18, Bayham Place—I inquired there and found he did not live there—I did not try the next house or the opposite side of the street—I did not try 18 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, but I must tell you that I asked the person who opened the door at No. 18 if a person named Dye lived in the house; he said "No"—I further asked him whether there was any other 18 in the place, and if he knew a person of the name of Dye, and he said "No." I described Dye, and asked him if he knew such a person or not, and he said "No"—I did not inquire whether there was an 18 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi> or not—Bayham Street is not on my beat or in my division at all—I first found he lived at 18 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi> after the proceedings were taken at the Middlesex Sessions—I won't undertake to say when I found it out—I know that I found out that he lived at 18 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi> afterwards, but I don't re<lb></lb>collect when I found it out—I am not positive that I did not find out that he lived at 18A before the remand; I cannot say when I found it out—I don't know how Pearce got out of the garden, I saw him coming from the garden—I don't know how he got out.</p>

On the night of 30th August I was on duty in plain clothes—my beat leads me towards Mornington Road—I met Hayes in plain clothes about twelve o'clock, a little this side of the Mornington Road, in Stanhope Street—that is not the Stan<lb></lb>hope Street by Gloucester Crescent, but the Stanhope Street between Mornington Crescent and the station—he called my attention to two lads who I had seen four or five minutes before I saw Hayes, about the middle of Stanhope Street, they passed me walking up the left hand side of Stanhope Street—they were going towards the Mornington Road when I saw them—when Hayes called my attention to them he asked me to go to the station for Barry—I reached the station about twelve, as near as I can guess—I gave a description of the two men and what Hayes told me to the inspector on duty, Sergeant Bendall—I saw Barry leave—the next morning, at six o'clock, I saw Pearce and Dye in the cells, and recognised them as the two who passed me on the previous night—I am quite sure of them—I went part of the way with Barry, but he left me and went on to Hayes—when I described the men at the station to the inspector a constable named Geddings was there.</p>

               <p>I had seen either of them outside the court that day, or whether they had been pointed out to me, and I said I never had them pointed out to me, and I was rather surprised to hear you ask such a thing—I know a person named Longland; I employ him occasionally—he is not in my employment now—I did not read the account of the trial of the lads to him, or in his presence, nor did he read it to me—I did not mention it to him—he had some conversation with me; that was after I had spoken to Magett—I cannot explain to you the day I mentioned it to Magett; it was after the 29th—it might be a week after—I should not think it was longer than that—I did not say in conversation to Longland that I hoped the police would be punished for what they had done—there is no mistake about my knowing the man, but it is utterly untrue that I ever made any such ob<lb></lb>servation to him—I know the man well—I have employed him, and he has always done his duty to me, and I have done my duty to him—I had some conversation with him, but I said nothing of that kind.</p>

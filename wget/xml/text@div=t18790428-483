                  </hi>. I am a gentleman residing at Harcourt Street, Kensing<lb></lb>ton—I am married—I have no family—I recollect the prisoner first calling at my house in September last—I had not known him before; he asked for charity, and from what he said I gave him a few shillings; 10 I think it was—I think the next time I saw him was in Piccadilly—he accosted me one night when I was returning home; that was after he had come out of prison—he asked me to give him money—I did not do so—he called at my house again—he always left a note at my house when he called—I did not see him; I refused to see him—I have not got the note—I directed my servants not to admit him—on the evening of April 9th he called—I saw him, I went out and passed him and simply said, "I am going for a constable"—he ran away—on the 11th my servant told me that he had been to the door; he came again a few minutes afterwards—I went to the door; he accosted me as I was going out, and he then attempted to thrust this letter into my hands—he said, "Here, take that," holding it out—I did not take it, but I took him by the collar and told him that he was not going to escape, upon which he worked himself out of my hands and ran away, I following him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I say that you offered me the note; you had it in your hand; you had it in your hand the whole time you were running away, and I saw you throw it deliberately over the wall—I never saw you before you came to my house—I had never met you before to my knowledge—when you asked me for money in Piccadilly I threatened to give you in charge, upon which you went away, you had walked by my side for some distance—I made you no promise to allow you some money weekly, and to send it to the post-office until you got a situation, most certainly not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parlour-maid at Mr. Pearson's—I know the prisoner by sight—I recollect him coming on 11th April, I opened the door to him, and he tried to thrust a note into my hand—I had it between my fingers, and he had it in his hand at the same time—he said "Give that to Mr. Pearson"—it was dark, I could not see him, but I knew his voice—I said "No," and shut the door—my master came out afterwards, and said "Who is that at the door?"—I said "That horrid man again, sir"—when I closed the door the prisoner had the letter in his hand which he had offered to me—I did not take it in—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was a light in the hall, but he always stood back on the doorstep when he came—my master came to the door, but he did not go out then—the prisoner came a second time, and another servant and I went to the door, but did not open it—we saw him through the glass, and I saw him with the letter in one hand, and the other hand in his pocket—I saw by the light of the lamp it was a square envelope that he had in his hand—I did not see the writing—about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour elapsed between his first and second coming.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 151). On the night of 11th April I saw the prisoner running through Redcliffe Square followed by Mr. Pearson—I saw him throw a letter over in a garden in the rear of the Grove, Boltons—I stopped him, and asked what he had thrown over the wall—he said "nothing"—I pointed out the place to another constable—the prosecutor gave him into custody for attempting to extort money—the prisoner said he was very sorry, if he would let him go he would, not see any more of him—I saw the prisoner searched, an envelope was found upon him, but not containing any letter; that envelope was not directed to Mr. Pearson, but to a Mr. Boultby.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City police—from infor<lb></lb>mation I received on 7th January I watched the premises of the prosecutors, Messrs. Hickson &amp; Sons, boot and shoe manufacturers, in Hosier-lane—I saw the prisoner leave those premises about 7 o'clock that evening—I followed him through some courts into Cow-cross—I noticed something bulky under his coat—I went up to him and said, "What have you here? I am an officer"—he said, "Nothing, all right, master"—I said, "What have you under your coat?"—he said, "Nothing"—his left hand was then placed down, and supporting this lead—I took it from under his coat, and said, "You have brought this from your employers"—he said, "Who says so? I have not"—I said, "I have watched you from your employers, Messrs. Hickson's"—he said, "I have only borrowed it, I was going to take it back again; let me see Mr. Hickson"—I took him to the station and charged him—I knew his address previously—I went in company with two of the firm to 51, Gray's-inn-lane, where the prisoner resided—I searched the premises, and found eighteen lasts, partly wood and partly iron, and eighteen pieces of cutting toe-pieces and heel-pieces—next morning I went to the prisoner's cell, pre<lb></lb>viously</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Hickson—I have examined the eighteen iron lasts produced by the constable—they are the property of Messrs. Hickson &amp; Sons; they were used at their premises in Hosier-lane—they have another place of business—I am not aware that the prisoner had any authority to remove these lasts from the premises—he was employed as a leather cutter—I can identify these leather vamps or cuttings—I have the knives here that stamped them out—these knives are manufactured for our firm—I am able to say they are the property of Messrs. Hickson—the prisoner had no authority to remove these pieces from the premises—we use lead similar to this piece produced, but I cannot swear to it—we have pieces of that size and thickness used for stamping.</p>

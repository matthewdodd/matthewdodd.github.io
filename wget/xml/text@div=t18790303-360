                  </hi>. I am a zinc-worker, of 19, Octavia Street, Deptford—I served my time to Mr. Banks, and afterwards went into Nixon's service—I was working for him some three weeks before Christmas last—on or about 6th December, about a quarter to 8 a.m., I was outside Nixon's private house; he is a zinc-worker—his workshop is at the back—I saw Lane with a roll of zinc on his shoulder composed of three or four sheets; he placed it outside Nixon's door—I knew him to speak to—I knew that he was in Mr. Banks's service—I saw written on the zinc in French chalk. "Harvey gutters" or "Harvey pipes"—Nixon came from the passage to the side of the house leading to the workshop; they spoke and went away together in the direction of the Clarendon—Nixon returned alone in about ten minutes, picked up the zinc, and put it in the passage—I saw no more of Lane that morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> by <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I was 24 last January—I was appren<lb></lb>ticed to Mr. Banks, and was out of my time three years ago—I have been in the Brighton Railway Company's service since I was out of my time as a plumber and zinc-worker, at New Cross for about six months—I was dis<lb></lb>charged through shortening of hands, but with the promise of going back again when they became busy—no complaint was made against me—I once worked for Mr. Palmer with a man called Murphy—I swear I did not steal and melt down lead there—I did not in Murphy's presence make a mould with my wide-awake hat in the sand and pour lead into it and carry it off—I was at work at Dowell's, in Thames Street, Greenwich—I did not take any lead pipe away from there or put any pipe behind a bag of charcoal—I never sold any lead pipe to Ribbends—Mr. George Banks, the prosecutor's son, did not refuse to pay me in November, 1876, until I brought back some lead pipe 12 inches long, and a screw boss which I had stolen, nothing of the sort—I afterwards went into the employment of another son of Mr. Banks, who carries on a separate business in Deptford Broadway—I have been in four situations including the railway—when I went to work for Mr. Banks's son I was paid off because they liad not sufficient work—I was not discharged, I left of my own accord—I was there 12 months, and 6 months at the railway—I was at Mr. Palmer's 9 months—I left Mr. Nixon's last November—I swear I was not discharged—no complaint was made of me in my presence—I had a time sheet made up there—this is my time sheet for the week beginning 2nd December—I did some work on Monday, 2nd December, at Thomas's, the builders—I was not repairing a cornice—on Tuesday, the 3rd, I was at work at Mr. Best's, the builder's, making two windows with zinc—On Wednesday I was at Best's again, and at Mr. Feather's, repairing a cup and ball—on the Thursday I was at Mr. Smith's, the builders, at Brockley, also at Wright's in the High Street, fixing a chimney—I know Smith, the builder, at Brakespear Road—I think I was there on the 6th December repairing the lead pipe and the window—I have</p>

                  </hi>.—I am a zinc-worker, and live at my father's premises, 40, Blackheath Road—he stores a considerable quantity of metal in his warehouse—Nixon was a retail zinc-worker in Oscar Street—it is a little over a quarter of a mile off; there is a front and a back way there—I have known Nixon two or three years—Lane has been in my father's employ two years—I knew Nixon before Lane came into the employ; he first recommended Lane, and we took him in consequence—he also mentioned him to my father and mother—we missed zinc for some time previous to 2nd Jan., and communicated with the police, and detective Fox came—on 2nd Jan., about 8.45 a.m., I waited round the corner at the bottom of the street, and eventually followed Fox and Barnes and saw Nixon; he was not up, he came downstairs as I arrived—the constable told him he had come to search his premises, he said "Very well, you are quite at liberty to do that"—I went and looked, and found 16 sheets of zinc which I identified as my father's and they were taken away—four of them had a cross on them made by me—in April last our premises were inundated, and we had two feet of water, which went to a certain height on the metal, and that which was lying down was stained all over—each sheet is stained, and four of them have the mark I have put on—Nixon has not dealt with us for 18 months, and what we did for him was bending zinc and forming gutters—that was not entered in the books; we never book bending work—he paid when he took them away—these 16 sheets weighed 2 1/2 cwt.—I marked them, as I had missed metal—we always gave him a bill for money paid—if any one comes for a sheet of zinc I give him a bill for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 115, Church Street, Deptford, and have worked for Nixon three years—I was apprenticed to the prosecutor, and worked there six years and a half—I have been managing man for Nixon for the last three years—all that time the sheets were marked by weight—two of the sheets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came from Pimm's to make baths—they have stood there ever since—about 20 baths had to be made, Mr. Pimm sending the zinc, and we doing the work—Nixon's business was principally making up zinc—he always has some on the premises waiting to be turned into the forms required by builders—we generally kept it in the passage—I have seen zinc there since April, with the water stains of the flood upon it—I make out my time-sheets, and James made out his own—this is my time sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), by which I am able to say that I was at Nixon's five hours and a half on Friday, 6th December—I went there at 7 a.m.—I saw James that morning—this is James's writing on his time—sheet—he was at work on that Friday for Mr. Smith, of Brakespear Road, Brockley, and also all the day before—it is not true that any sheets of zinc were brought into the place that Friday morning—it could not be brought in without my seeing it—I was in the workshop, and I could see the passage from there—I must have noticed if any extra quantity of sheets had been put there, and they were not—no zinc was brought to the premises for work to be done to it from the beginning of December—I saw James a week after Christmas—I understood</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030039"></xptr>
               <p>from Nixon that he had been discharged—he asked me if I was at work, and I said "Yes"—he said, "Well, Nixon served me shabbily, and I will make it hot for him," or "b——hot for him"—that was before Nixon was taken into custody—it was in January—I can't tell you the day of the month—I was the head man at work for Mr. Nixon for some time—a man named Murphy was also there—I knew of zinc being supplied by Pepper<lb></lb>corn's, Pimm's, and different firms—I never saw Lane on the premises with any zinc—I work at Nixon's shop in the early part of the day—I have done work for Mr. Hunt, and for G. and A. Smith, and for Mr. Brewster, and for Stanley and Gurbeck—I have constantly received zinc to be made up—when zinc is of the same quality we are not particular to apply each man's particular sheets to his work.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I left Mr. Banks's employ when I was 19; that is fourteen years ago—I am paid by the hour at Nixon's—I have generally work to do—he does not pay me whether I am busy or idle—I swear that Mr. Pimm required twenty baths made; I was present when he gave the order—I have not seen him here—he gave the order in Nixon's workshop in my presence about the middle of 1878—the zinc was sent at different times, not all at once—there were about three sheets to each bath, perhaps not so much—it came in a van—some of it was foreign metal, some London—I have seen a dozen sheets come in at a time; this is one of them—I say that this sheet came from Mr. Pimm's—I cannot tell you when, but about four months ago—I am not in the shop all day to see what is brought—I have been there of a morning up to dinner-time—I said that none could have come from Lane on that particular day or I should have seen it—this zinc has been standing there about three months—Pimm's zinc has no mark on it, but it has a foreign brand—I know that this is Pimm's because it has been standing there ever since and has never been shifted—I went to work on 6th December at 7 o'clock; here is my time-sheet—I was at work in the workshop adjoin<lb></lb>ing the passage; the passage is about 6 feet long—I was at my bench; James was there a little while.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Pimm's sheets for making the baths were delivered some time before Nixon was taken in custody; they commenced to send them in about the middle of last year, and went on delivering from time to time; the last delivery was two months or more before Nixon was taken—I do not know that I saw the last delivery—it would not be possible for four sheets of zinc to be put down without a noise, and I am prepared to swear that it did not happen on 6th December—I was working for Nixon when I met James, and I am working for him now.</p>

                  </hi>. On 2nd December I entered Mr. Nixon's service as a zinc-worker—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my first week's time-sheet—I was in the shop on Friday, 6th December, at 8 a.m.; Sewell was there, but he went out to his breakfast—we get breakfast before we come—he started at breakfast—James was working in the shop before he went to Smith's—this is his time<lb></lb>sheet—I saw no man bring any sheets of zinc to the place early that morning—James was working at the same bench with me—he was in the shop with me till 10 o'clock—I do not know how long he was in the shop on the 7th, 8th, or 9th, but I remember the 6th—James left on the Saturday before Christmas, and on the Saturday after Christmas I met him on Deptford Bridge—I went into the Clock-house with him, and we had a glass of ale together—he asked me if I had been to work—I said "Yes"—he said "Mr. Nixon is a nice b——man, and I will get it b——well up for him"—he</p>

               <p>did not say in what way he had been dismissed—he gave no reason for the threat—I never saw any zinc brought to the premises by Lane in December.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. All our time-sheets are made up at the end of the day, but we may go a day over—on Saturday we should make up the time-sheets for Friday; if it was not done on Friday we should put down Friday and Saturday together—James gave me some work on the Friday—he would say, "There is a job at So-and-so's," and I should go—until then I worked in the shop—we keep on with our job—James may have gone out at the back of the shop after he came in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HARVEY</hi>. I am a dealer and worker in zinc at Lewisham—I have known Nixon ten years; he bears an irreproachable character—I have done bending work for him, and generally supply the London mills zinc, but sometimes the other—I sometimes have foreign brands—I re<lb></lb>member the overflow of the Ravensbourne River in 1878; it flooded Lewisham and Deptford, and my zinc was stained—some zinc was stained more than other—it was not limited to my warehouse—the zinc is weighed and marked with chalk, and laid flat and put in a bin—I had metal from Banks eighteen months ago, but not lately—I do bending for the trade generally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is no mark on these sheets that I recognise—I could not swear to my own figures after so long a date.</p>

I am a builder, of Lewisham Bridge, and have known Nixon eleven years—he started in business for himself three years and a half ago, and bears a respectable character—he lias supplied me with zinc which was affected by the flood, and there were seven sheets of it left—I cannot say that they are the same, but they are similar as to water-mark and everything else—I had the flood both at Deptford Bridge and Lewisham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and am Nixon's brother—he sent me to Mr. Banks for three sheets of No. 11—I paid for it, but got no receipt—I have done that twice; the last time was about a fortnight before Christmas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went because my brother said that they would not know me, as there was a little bad feeling about some work which had been spoiled—I saw Mr. Banks's son; the one who is sitting by your side—that was about 14 days before Christmas—I bought three sheets of No. 11 of him—I forget who I saw when I bought the first lot—that is about 18 months ago—I had a horse and cart then—I got no account, I paid for it—it was at the beginning of a week, I know, and about 10 a.m.—I carried it as far as the corner of the street where the tramways stop, where my brother took it from me, at the public-house 10 minutes' walk off—that is not the Clarendon; that is in another direction entirely—my brother gave me the money to pay for it before I went—it was on the floor—Mr. Banks told me how much it was, and I paid for it—I have often seen Lane about Deptford, but I swear I did not know that he was employed at Banks's—I never saw him there that I know of—I swear I have never spoken to him—I never saw Champ till I was at Greenwich Police-court—I went there as bail for my brother—I did not hear the evidence given—I cannot say how much weight was given me on the second occasion, but I know it came to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I was able to carry it on my shoulder.</p>

               <p>weeks—he had an order for making between 20 and 30 baths, but they were not ordered all at one time—Nixon was employed to make them—V. M. zinc was employed—we mark zinc sometimes with red chalk of the consistency of paste, sometimes with French chalk, and it is not unusual to mark it with a nail or a bradawl when it is to be put away—this zinc produced is, to the best of my belief, the same—when Nixon was taken in custody, four or five baths were unfinished, and we average three or three and a half sheets a bath.</p>

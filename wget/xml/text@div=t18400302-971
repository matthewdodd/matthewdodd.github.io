                  </hi>, I live in Basinghall-street. On the 24th of January, about five o'clock, I was in the Old Jewry. I felt something touch my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner close behind me—I was walking arm-in-arm with a gentleman—I saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's left hand—I took him by the collar, and charged him with it—he tried to get away, and strug<lb></lb>gled—I took the handkerchief from him—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it has my initials on it—I held him till the policeman took him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 288.) I was called, and took the prisoner—the handkerchief was given to me by the pro<lb></lb>secutor.</p>

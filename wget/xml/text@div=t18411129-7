                  </hi>. I am a butcher, living at Denham. On Saturday fortnight I went to Uxbridge market—when I was leaving I had a side of mutton, which I put into my cart the last thing at night—I left the cart a short time with a boy, and next morning, when I was at Denham, I missed the mutton—I informed the police, and on that day Roadnight brought me a leg of mutton, which was part of the side of mutton which was in my cart on Saturday night—I knew it by its being my dressing and cutting—I had a quarter of the same mutton, which I had sold—I matched them together—they were part of the same animal.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant T</hi> 11.) On Sunday fortnight I received information from the prosecutor—after that I saw the prisoner and two other persons coming along some fields near Uxbridge—I and my partner apprehended them—the prisoner had this basket over his shoulder, which contained a leg of mutton, which I showed the same day to the pro<lb></lb>secutor—I matched it with the other piece, which had been sold—there was a bit of the tail left on the leg, which matched the other part exactly—Warner, one of the men with the prisoner, said he never saw it till he saw it on the others' backs—the prisoner said, "You want to saddle it on me, but it is a <hi rend="italic">barber's mess</hi> we are all in it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I Warner and Cox, went out about seven o'clock; we were forwards; Cox called us back, and said, "There is a basket in the hedge;" we took it out, it had a leg of mutton in it; we came back about twelve, and it was still there; Cox said, "We might as well have it as let it spoil;" he took it, and carried it first, and then I carried it; the others owned how they came by it, the same as I did.</p>

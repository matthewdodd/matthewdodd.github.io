                  </hi>. I live at 5, Houghton Street, Strand, and am a compositor—on the afternoon of 13th July I was in a boat on the Thames, about 4 o'clock, between Vauxhall and Chelsea—I saw a woman in the water, about two yards from the shore—she was trying to reach a chain that was attached to the wharf, and she succeeded—we rowed towards her, got her out of the water into the boat, and then went ashore—a constable came up, and I gave her into his charge—she said she would attempt it again if we let her go, and had come all the way from Somers Town to do it—I went with the constable to the station—I believe she was quite sober.</p>

I was called to the assistance of the last witness, and he gave the prisoner into custody for attempting to drown herself—on the way to the station she said two or three times it was a good job I had taken her, for if she was left alone she would do it again—she was quite sober.</p>

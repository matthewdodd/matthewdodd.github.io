            . I am in Mr. Lawton's employ - at his house in Green-street. I remember the prisoner coming there on the 7th of March last, and producing duplicates of property to the amount of 34l., which he had previously pledged there; he desired the property to be brought up, and a light, as he had some diamonds to seal; he then produced a small packet of diamonds, which he desired me to look at, and advance the most I could upon them; I looked at them, and agreed to advance 160l. upon them; I then, at his request, having agreed to advance that sum, handed them over to him to seal up, which he did, in my presence, and returned a packet to me, which I supposed to be the one containing the diamonds, as it resembled it in size and composition of paper, and every other respect. I put it into my breast coat pocket, and opened the parcels containing the other pledges; there was a diamond locket, which had been pledged for 9l. - a diamond brooch, for 5l. - a pair of gold watch cases, for 7l. 10s. - a watch movement, for 7l. 10s. - a gold chain, for 3l., and two seals, for 2l.; they had all been pledged on the 4th or 5th of March, and as such, were the property of Mr. Lawton. I cast up the whole amount which, with the interest, was 35l. 2s., and deducted it from the 160l. - I then left the parlour, and fetched him the balance of 124l. in gold and Bank notes, and some silver, which, with the goods, I handed over to the prisoner, for the diamonds, which I supposed I had got. Here is the packet which he deposited with me - I opened it about the first week in June - it contains coloured stones, called rubies and emeralds - the full value of which is 4l. I took out a warrant at Marlborough-street, and he was taken in November. I had no authority from my master to lend money, except upon pledges of an equivalent value.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he took you in? A. Yes. I delivered the money and property, supposing I had an equivalent for it in the diamonds, which I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you delivered these goods to him, to the value of 35l.; you parted with them entirely, thinking you had your master's consent so to do, thinking the diamonds left with you were of sufficient value to cover the value of them, and the cash you advanced? A. Certainly - impressed with the belief that the diamonds shewn to me in the first instance, would cover what I advanced in money, and the pawned goods, I parted with the goods stated in the indictment; and before I parted with them I had received the parcel containing, as I supposed, the diamonds.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Had you examined the genuine diamonds? A. Yes, and I might then have detained them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you at that time given any thing for them? A. No, and he might then have put them into his pocket and gone away if he chose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had looked at these diamonds, and believed them to be of genuine value, and given them back to him to seal? A. Yes, from a pre-arrangement made between us, as he said they might go through the hands of a second person, and he changed; I then received the sham diamonds (which I had not an opportunity of seeing without breaking the seal) and then handed to him the pledges, worth 35l. and the money - I had only delivered the genuine diamonds back to him, for the special purpose of being sealed.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. What became of the parcel of false stones? A. It was put into the plate closet, which two persons besides myself have access to - one of them is here. The packet is in the same state as when I received it; it has part of the seal on it now - it was not opened till I opened it in June: it was then in the same state as when I received it - I had enclosed it in another paper, which I sealed with my own hand; it had never been disturbed. - I never lent him money on his I.O.U. I have no share in the business.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you the key of the drawer in your possession? A. Yes, part of the time. All the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080060"></xptr>time it was there it had the outside paper on it, which was put on and sealed by myself; it had not been disturbed or altered till I opened it myself in June, and the inner paper had this seal on it then; it was exactly the same in every respect, wafer, seal, and all.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. In whose presence was it opened? A. There was no one present.</p>

            , JUN. Mr. Burgess is not a partner in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you in the house? A. Yes. I never changed or did anything to this packet of diamonds. Mr. Burgess is my father's managing man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I became acquainted with Mr. Lawton at Newmarket horse races, where he used to bet upon horses, and after that he accommodated me with money; I have had as much as 1000l. a-week, and he charged me 15 per cent., and when I have not been there from one to six weeks, he used to meet me at certain places, and ask me why I did not come, as he was anxious to do business with me; at last he offered me money to take-shares in a gaming-house - he said the profits belonged to him, and he promised me 20 per cent. profit - at last I ran in debt 900l. to him, which I have not the means of paying, and he and his shopman have conspired, and invented this, gaming debts being illegal. When I had nothing of my own he used to lend me money on a ring, or a key, which he took from his own shop; he has made a ticket on his own ring, and lent me, perhaps, 20l. upon it, to make money on the ticket, and thus he took things out of the shop, and made tickets of. I am labouring under great disadvantages, because he took me into his back parlour, and let no one know what we did. I cannot, therefore, prove his conduct to have been illegal.</p>
               <p>COURT to PHILIP LAWTON. Q. Have you ever kept a gaming-house? A. No. - nor have I ever spoken to the prisoner in my life. I do not think I ever saw him ten times.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you never live in Bury-street? - A. No, never, I swear that.</p>

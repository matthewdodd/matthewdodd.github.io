                  </hi>. I am time-keeper to Messrs. John Peto and John Briant; the firm goes by the name of Briant, Price, and Co. On 29th November I was on their premises, about six o'clock in the evening—I saw Robert Thompson go through the counting-house, and he went back again and went out into the yard, and when I listened I heard the middle gates make a noise (those gates divide the yard into two parts)—I went out and saw a bundle of leather, containing twenty-five pieces tied toge<lb></lb>ther against the gate—that was not its proper place—I stood close by the counting-house door and watched—I saw a man take the bundle, put it under his left arm, and go out of the wicket-gate into Dacre-street—I said, "Halloo, where are you going with that leather?"—he made no reply—I could not follow him, being lame, but I called to Mr. Fowles, who was in the office, and he came out directly—this was about twenty minutes past six o'clock—the man who took the leather had got on a cut-away coat, buttoned with one button at the top, light buff-coloured trowsers and a cap on, which was on one side—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner, John Thompson—I saw John Thompson brought to the counting-house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185012160076"></xptr>
               <p>the same evening, about eleven o'clock—he was then dressed just as I have described—he had been employed on the premises for years, off and on, so that he knew the premises well—Robert Thompson used to work there, off and on—Robson's coming through the counting-house would be nothing strange.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prosecutors—Robson was in their employ. On the 29th Nov. I heard Mr. Bingley calling in the yard—I went out in the street immediately—it was very dark—I could not see im<lb></lb>mediately, but I saw three men crossing the street about fifty yards from the premises—I could not see their countenances—I followed them—two of them went through Jeffry's-buildings, in the direction of the Almonry, and one ran down New Tothill-street, in the direction of Tothill-street—when they separated they were about eighty yards from the premises, and they had turned a corner—they separated in New Tothill-street, which crosses Dacre-street—I observed that the two men were very close together, but I did not see anything between them—I followed the one who went down New Tothill-street, and lost sight of him—I turned back into Dacre-street, and saw Margaret Scott; she pointed out the direction in which some persons had gone—I saw her when I first got into Tothill-street, and I saw her again when I turned back—the men must have passed within a foot of her—there were no persons running but the three men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The night was very dark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was very dark indeed; when 1 first looked out I could see no one; I could bear persons' feet—had they not crossed I should not have seen them, but there was a light at the top of the street—I saw some figures cross in Dacre-street—I lost sight of them when they turned a corner, I got sight of them again as I turned from Dacre-street to New Tothill-street—I got sight of two men passing into Jeffry's-buildings, that was about twenty yards beyond where Scott was—I saw Scott when I first turned the corner, but I did not speak to her—when I turned back I spoke to her, and heard her say something—I think Robson had been at work on the premises six or seven years, and Thompson eight or nine years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, at 14, Dacre-street. On 29th Nov., between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the top of Dacre-street, where it runs into Tothill-street—I saw Robert Thompson and Robson—Robert Thompson said to Robson, "Tell him not to be long"—they had been running together in a direction from Old Tothill-street into New Tothill-street, and they stopped at a chandler's shop—when Robert Thompson said this, Robson went away, and came back again in two or three minutes, with John Thompson, and they were carrying a bundle, tied in three places—they were walking—that was at the top of Dacre-street—I do not know how far it is from the factory—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185012160077"></xptr>
               <p>John Thompson then gave his end of the bundle to Robert Thompson—they crossed the street, and Robson and Robert Thompson went down Jeffry's-buildings, and John Thompson went down New Tothill-street, in the direction of Old Tothill-street—(Robert Thompson stood still by the chandler's shop after Robson had left him)—I saw Mr. Fowles come up after them, in a few minutes—he was running in the same direction—John Thompson was then in sight—Mr. Fowles ran by me, and down New Tothill-street—hellost sight of John Thompson, and came back to me, and I spoke to him—I knew the prisoners before by sight, but I had had no conversation with them—Robson's father and mother live at 7, Dacre-street, and he lives at No. 13—Robert Thompson lives in Tothill-street, and John Thompson in Dacre-street—the bundle was about two feet long, and had two strings across it, and one up the middle—they knocked against me.</p>

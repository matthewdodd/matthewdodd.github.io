I cannot positively swear, they are of course the same, there is one of them I had, it is the same which was marked in the window, which is the one I have with me now; we had one that the lamp overflowed in the window and spoiled a great many things; I recollect a lamp that overflowed and the oil fell on some silk handkerchiefs, that handkerchief was put up and was not shewn to any other person after the young man came in and let me know it. I recollect having the pattern of this piece when I shewed it to them.</p>

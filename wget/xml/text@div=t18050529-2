             sworn. - I am shopwoman to Mr. Macaulay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming into your master's shop on the 6th of May? - A. Perfectly well, it was between three and four o'clock, and another lady with her; the prisoner enquired of the boy to look at some British lace; he was the only one in the shop; I was in the adjoining room; the door being open, I heard every thing, and by the glass I saw every thing, that passed; he shewed her a draw of British lace; they did not approve of that; she asked to look at some real lace; the boy shewed her a draw of real lace; she did not make choice of what he shewed her; he went to the window to fetch a card from there; she did not approve of that, but she made choice of one in the drawer, and agreed with him for seventeen yards, which he cut off for her; she had not money to pay for the whole of the lace; she desired it might be put by and she would call the next day; she gave the boy one shilling and sixpence towards the payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any lace? - A. We did not miss any at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a quantity of lace lying about the counter? - A. None, but what was in the drawer, she and the other woman sat upon two stools by the side of the counter, and the drawer was between the two women; the prisoner was the person that cheapened the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman offer to buy any? - A. I believe the lace that was to be bought was for the other; I believe it was the prisoner that gave the one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she intoxicated at all? - A. It appeared to me so; she had a very odd behaviour with her, and had a great deal of action with her hands; they were very genteel people, and very well dressed; the other woman had on a white dress and long sleeves, and a feather in each of their hats.</p>

             sworn. - Q. How many cards of lace might you shew the prisoner? - A. Several.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any cards of lace on the counter, or were they all in the drawer? - A. I took some of them out to shew them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them appeared to be most dealing for the lace? - A. The prisoner was the person that cheapened.</p>
               <p>- KINCADE sworn. - I live in Fort-street, in the old Artillery-ground; I am a silk manufacturer; on the 6th of May, about half past five, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290004"></xptr>assed the prisoner at the bar in White-Lion-street; she was apparently very well dressed; she being very much intoxicated, abused the passengers as they went along; it attracted my attention, seeing a woman so well dressed, and so very abusive, that I crossed the way, to see who or what she might be; knowing where the beadle of the district lived, I went and knocked at his door, and he came down; I sent for an officer by him, and immediately gave him charge of this woman on suspicion that she was a shop-lifter.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you? - A. This lace, with this ticket, which appeared to be a shop-mark, was hanging somewhere under her clothes, with the ticket to it; I ordered her to be taken to Worship-street, I gave particular charge that she should not drop the lace; I went with her to the office, and it was taken from her there; there was another card of lace which the officer took from her at the Office.</p>

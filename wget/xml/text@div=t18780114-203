                  </hi>. I was formerly in the employ of the prisoner Stepney, a bottle merchant, at Euston Mews, Euston Square, as general labourer—my sister lives with him as his wife—I came up from Herefordshire—a man named Barnes was also employed there—I recollect going with the horse and cart to Wapping—I saw Sleven there unloading his van, which contained long boxes, after which he came over to Srepney, who was in a public-house opposite the wharf—I stood outside minding Sleven's horse and van—they remained in the public-house 5 or 10 minutes, and Sleven told me to back the van into the wharf—two large barrels were then rolled into Stepney's van, which was driven on the opposite side of the road, and Sleven followed in his van as far as Lower Thames Street, near Billingsgate, where Stepney and Sleven went into a public-house while I stood outside with the horse and van—Stepney and I then got into my master's van, with the two barrels in it, and drove home to Gower Mews, where Stepney has a warehouse, into which the barrels were put—on the same night Simmonds came to Euston Mews, where Stepney lives, and said "Are you going over to the <hi rend="italic">tother</hi> place?" mean<lb></lb>ing Gower Mews—Stepney asked me for a hammer—I got it, and Sim<lb></lb>monds had it—they went to Gower Mews and I followed them—Mr. Stepney came into Gower Mews intoxicated—Simmonds was then apply<lb></lb>ing the chisel-end of the hammer to undoing the hoop of one of the casks which I had left there, and Stepney was standing alongside it holding a candle—Mrs. Stepney said to Simmonds ''I will <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on you to Mr. Schweppe if this carrying on is going any furthur"—Simmonds said "Hold your tongue," and Stepney pushed her against the door—I caught her as she went down—Simmonds then opened the casks, and took a paper out of each—both barrels contained empty lemonade bottles—next day Barnes and I went to the warehouse and unpacked the barrels of the bottles, put them into <hi rend="italic">prittles</hi>, and they were taken away on different occasions to a man named Mason, who lives at Highgate Road or Camden Town, and the barrels were broken up and made into firewood—three weeks afterwards I left Euston Mews with my horse and van with Stepney—there was a bit of loose straw in the cart and two bags, but no bottles—we went to a public-house in Castle Street, and remained three-quarters of an hour or an hour—Sleven came in and said "<hi rend="italic">Step</hi>, all right"—we then got into the van and drove up the street, and when we got 20 yards he told me to get out and meet him at a public-house in Little Tichfield Street—I got out, and when I got into</p>

               <p>Charles Street I met the van coming out of Wells Street with the hampers in it, and a little straw thrown on them and a bag—Stepney was driving—I walked on and found Sleven, Smith, and Stepney in the public-house and the van outside—they asked me to have some drink, which I did—I saw Stepney pass money to Sleven, but cannot say how much—Stepney and I drove home to Gower Mews, leaving Sleven and Smith at the public-house—we carried the four hampers into the warehouse--they were open, and contained empty lemonades with straw at the top—some had Schweppe's name on them and some had his labels—I afterwards saw those four hampers at the station with the bottles—I once saw Sleven under an arch near London Bridge—there were three or four vans of Mr. Schweppe's there—I had my horse and van there, and Stepney was with me—two of the same kind of barrels were rolled out of Schweppe's van into mine—they contained empty lemonade bottles—they were taken to Gower Mews—on the 28th November a carman of the Brighton and South Coast Railway brought two hampers full of empty lemonades, and he and Stepney went to a public-house at the top of the Mews—I went there and saw Stepney give him money, I don't know what—after we had drank Stepney and I returned to the Mews, and Sim<lb></lb>monds came in and said to Stepney "Where are the papers of those two hampers?"—Stepney told me to light a candle and fetch them—I went down and fetched the papers out of the hampers—one had no writ<lb></lb>ing on it, <hi rend="italic">tother</hi> had—I gave them to him, and the one that had no writing on he rolled up and put in the fire, and put the other in his pocket—I fancy I saw "Brighton" on it, but I cannot say—"Schweppe and Co." was on the bottles and on the labels—Stepney and Simmonds then went to a public-house at the top of the Mews, and Stepney gave Simmonds money in a backhanded way—I afterwards saw one of the hampers at the station—I remember hearing Simmonds ask Stepney to have some more, and Stepney said "You will very soon have a house out of old Schweppe"—Simmonds said "It will take me a long while about it"—I subsequently made a communication to Messrs. Schweppe, and the prisoners were given in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. This selling of bottles has been going on for a number of years by his own word of mouth, but according to me about three months—I said at the police-court that I had never been in trouble—I was not subsequently obliged to confess that that was a lie—I have been in trouble as a boy, but not since—I was a man in 1875—I was not committed for 14 days at the Hereford Petty Sessions on 29th May, 1875—I was not convicted in the name of Werter Gay; that is not true—I was convicted as Werter Gay at the Hereford Sessions, in 1867, of stealing lead—I was not committed for 14 days in 1857, at the same sessions, for being disorderly and resisting the police—I have served 11 years in the 23rd Fusiliers, and have a good character—I have not been six times convicted in Hereford City—I have been con<lb></lb>victed twice for drunkenness and once for lead—I gave information against Stepney, and my sister told him she would do the same—I had had no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with him; we went out one Saturday night, he got drunk, and she was drunk, and I will say I was; on the Sunday morning a chest of drawers was covered with glasses, she swept one away, and he swept the others, and he told me I should have to leave—I went out on Sunday and came back on Monday, and said "Are you going to</p>

               <p>pay me for those old corks?" which I had saved from the bottles—he said "Yes," and I said "I am going to Mr. Schweppe," and I did go—I did not know for a long time that the bottles were being stolen, or where they came from, but Barnes said that there would be a noise about them before long—that was about a month before I left—I remained a month after I knew that the bottles were stolen, assisting in receiving stolen property; I was a servant—I did not inform against Stepney because he put me out of my place—I went to Schweppe when I thought I would go; if you had been employed as a servant perhaps you would have done the same.</p>

I was three months in Stepney's employ, and I first knew that something was wrong after I had been there two months—I did not suspect it before, because he is a bottle<lb></lb>merchant—I cannot say how long my sister has lived with Stepney—she brought me up from Hereford to London, and Simmonds came to the house the same night—my sister is here—Barnes was not there when the casks were opened, but he was when they were brought in, and helped to roll them in—I have not seen him here—when I say that I saw Stepney pass money to Simmonds in a back-handed way I mean that I saw money pass, because he paid for the beer out of the same hand—I was the out<lb></lb>side party, I was not between them—I saw money pass from hand to hand.</p>

Schweppe paid for my coming up—they paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day before I went back, but since I have been back I have only had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know where Barnes lives—a large quantity of bottles were bought and sold, but very few were washed.</p>

Schweppe—I saw Sleven on the morning of 30th November, and he said "There are some bottles we may get rid of in the evening"—I told him I would rather have nothing to do with it, but about 5. 30 he came to me just outside the warehouse and said "I am going to fetch the van" and at 7 o'clock he beckoned me down the Mews—I followed him and lowered four full hampers down by the crane into his van, which were placed against the folding doors of the loft—Stepney was with the van, and Sleven was in it—it drove out of the Mews—I went back and put my coat on, as Sleven asked me to meet him in Little Tichfield Street—I went there and saw Stepney and Sleven with the van—I had something to drink, and saw Stepney pass money to Sleven, who gave me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Schweppe and Co.—we furnish our customers with papers like these—it was Simmonds's duty to take them out of the hampers—they would then be initialled by him and given to the clerk—if that was not done the customer would not know.</p>

When bottles do not come back a charge is made to the customer for them—a very large number do not come back—after the accounts are settled we part property with the bottles and charge for them—Sleven has been many years in our employment—I know nothing against his character.</p>

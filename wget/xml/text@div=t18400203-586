About twelve o'clock at night, on the 19th of January, my house was on fire—I never saw the prisoners till they were in custody of the police on the Tuesday following—these boots and shoes produced are mine, and were on my premises on the day previous to the night of the fire—I am positive I had not sold them.</p>

On the Sun<lb></lb>day night on which my master's premises were on fire, I saw Ayres at the door, just before twelve o'clock—I was going in at the door, and he was standing there—in about a quarter of an hour after, I saw him come out with some boots and shoes in his hands—there were some women standing in the road, and he asked them to take them—I did not see whether they took them—he would not let me go into the house at first—he said I had no business there—I do not know Wise, but when I turned round to go for a policeman, I saw another man come out of the house with boots and shoes—I caught him, and asked what he was going to do with them—he</p>

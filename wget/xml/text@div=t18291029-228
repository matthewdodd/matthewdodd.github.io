The prisoner was about three weeks in our employ - he had been in service before he came to us; he did not sleep in our house, but came in the day time. On the 4th of September he came as usual a little after seven o'clock; I let him in at the private door, and desired him to go down into the kitchen and light the fire - I went down into the kitchen with him, and the watch was hanging over the dresser; it was a gold watch - I had hung it there a quarter of an hour before - I left him in the kitchen, and went down again to see the time at twenty minutes to eight o'clock, and the watch hung there then, and he was there; I went up stairs to call my husband and children, and when I came down he had opened the shop door, and was gone; I had told him not to open the shop door - I missed the watch, also a gold brooch from up stairs in the bed-room; he could not have taken that that morning, but it was safe the morning before; I also missed four rings from a drawer in the bedroom, and a silver table-spoon and sugar-tongs from the same place; there was a seal to the watch: about forty herrings were taken from the shop - I had seen them that morning: I have never seen the things since - I inquired about at the pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood. I never saw the prisoner again till the 23rd of October, when I found him in a cart at Kensington gravel-pits; my husband was with me, and took him.</p>

            . I know the prisoner - I have seen him about Kensington gravel-pits; I first saw him about the 7th of September, and have played about there with him - I have seen him with two or three sovereigns; we used to ask him how he got them, and he said he lived at a bonnet-shop in Regent-street three years - that his master never paid him regularly, and when he did he paid him as much as seven sovereigns.</p>
               <p>MRS. MANN re-examined. He came into our service from Mr. Plummer, a hosier, of Regent-street, but we took him on his mother's recommendation, and did not see Plummer. The watch was gold, and worth 20l.</p>

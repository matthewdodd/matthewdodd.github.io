I live at 13, Montpelier Road, Blackheath, and carry on business in the City, as a wine and spirit merchant—the prisoner came into my service last February, upon the recommendation of Mr. Vant, of 14, New Cross Road—she remained till the 19th July, I have lived separate from my wife fourteen years—she lives at Lewisham—on 19th July, in consequence of information I received I sent for a policeman, and went with him to the kitchen to the prisoner—my son, daughter, and servant, live in the same house—I said to the prisoner "You have been robbing me," and asked where the jelly mould and the drugget were—she said "I know nothing about it"—the officer and I searched her box and found articles of which this is a list—amongst them are twelve pairs of cuffs, some collars, a white vest, a pair of socks, and some nightshirts—they are all my property, I found the jelly mould at Mr. Vant's, with other articles—it is my property—the prisoner said "Your son gave them to me"—my son was in the room at the time and denied it—I gave her into custody—the value of the articles is about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I called at the prosecutor's house on 19th July—we went into the kitchen and the prosecutor said "You have been robbing me"—the prisoner said "I have not"—the prosecutor said "Where is the jelly mould?"—the prisoner said "I don't know"—he said "Have you anything in your box?"—she said "Nothing of yours"—we then went upstairs and examined the box, when the prosecutor swore to several articles and the prisoner said it was all spite, the things were given her by William, meaning the prosecutor's son—I took her to the station—I afterwards went to Mr. Vant's house, where some more things were found.</p>

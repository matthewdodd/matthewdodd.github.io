                  </hi>. I am a furrier, and live in Steward-street. On 19th Dec, about 12 o'clock at night, I was standing talking with a friend in Baker's-row, Whitechapel—some persons ran up, and I was knocked down on the sudden by three parties—I received a blow on my forehead between my eyes—I recovered my feet as soon as I could, and I was knocked down again by Murray—there was not above a minute between the two blows—when I was knocked down by three men I was much injured on the knee; two pf them were lying on me—I called to my friend, Mr. Conaughton, and I believe, he was knocked down at the same time—I received a severe wound in my nose—it bled very much—the policeman came up, and he and Mr. Hampton assisted me—I was partly insensible after I had received the blows—I missed my hat—I saw the prisoners at the station—I believe Donovan was one of the men who assaulted me, but I could not positively swear it—I was taken to the hospital, and had my face dressed and my knee bandaged—I am still suffering from the effects of the blows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live in Baker's-row. Between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning of 19tb Dec., I saw the prisoner and another man pass my shop—my attention was called to them by their upsetting my oysters—I went out and spoke to them—Donovan turned round and wanted to fight me, had not Murray pulled him away, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away towards Mr. Hyman—Donovan up with his fist, and knocked Mr. Hyman down with his fist—I ran immediately up—I saw Mr. Hyman, Mr. Conaughton, and the two prisoners all four down at once—I assisted Mr. Hyman—a policeman took Murray in a second or so, and brought him back—I think the prisoners had been drinking; they knew what they were doing.</p>

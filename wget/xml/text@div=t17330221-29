Michael was then next the Chariot, and I was behind him. I put forward to get up with the Chariot, and endeavoured to draw my Pistol, but could not get it out of the Holster. I cross'd the Postilion Horses, and came to the Off-side of the Chariot, and took out my Pistol, with the Holster. The other Highway-man rode after me, Damn ye, says he, stop, or I'll shoot. Do then, says I, shoot. Damn ye, says he, I'll fire. Fire, says I, as soon as ye will.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the Prisoners; are those the Men?</p>
               <p>Parry. I believe they are; I am pretty positive that Bye was he that rode after me, but am not so certain as to the other, who dismounted Michael, and stood over him. Now as Bye and I were presenting our Pistols at each other, and crying, Shoot, and Fire, my Master, thinking I had pick'd a Quarrel with somebody, step'd out of the Chariot to see what was the Matter. Bye withdrew a little, but advancing again, my Master asked him what he wanted. Why, says Bye, I want your Watch and Money; deliver this Minute, or I'll fire. My Master did not seem to mind him, but call'd to my Fellow-Servant, and said, Michael, Why don't ye take your Horse and come to me? But Michael answer'd, They will not let me. Says Bye, I have 12 Slugs in this Piece, and if you don't deliver this Minute I'll fire thro' your Body. Still my Master did not seem to regard him, but call'd to Michael again; Michael answer'd as before, and so did Bye. But when my Master call'd to Michael the third time, Bye was quite out of Patience, and swore my Master's Body should suffer for all that Moment, if he did not deliver directly; upon which my Master called to me, and said, come hither Parry; I went, and he gave me his Silver Watch and 2 Guineas, to deliver to Bye, who would not take them of me, but gave my Master a deal of illprobus Language, and swore at him, Damn you, Sir, you shall bring them your self, or I'll shoot you through the Body immediately; and so then my Master took them from me again, and deliver'd them to him.</p>

I have lost 70 l. lately, but I know how to get 100 l. as soon as any Man in England; and after that, they went to their Horses. About 9 o'Clock, next Morning, I went from Egham, and walk'd to Hounslow, and about 12 I saw the General's Chariot, between the Powder-Mills and Hounslow, and about One, or between 1 and 2, I saw the Prisoners riding through Hounslow as hard as they could drive; my having heard them talk about their Horses, made me take the more Notice of them.

Why, don't you see I'm a Shaving? says Tims; Damn me, says Bye, I'll shave some Body by and by. Then the Ostler at the Crown led their Horses by the Door. One was a Bay Gelding with a swish-Tail, and t'other a brown Mare with a cut Tail.</p>

            . I sold the Mare to Bye 4 or 5 Months ago, she was 13 Hands and an Inch high, a dark Bay, with a brownish Muzzel, a bob Tail, and a Malander on the Off-Foot, but she would not jump over a Straw, and I believe is not able to carry him. I sold her for 3 Guineas and 2 Gallons of Brandy. I believe the poor Man has been out of his Senses. Here are a great many more Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. There needs no more as to his Character.</p>

I have known him ever since he came to Town, which is 16 or 17 Years; the last Gentleman he served was Governor Feak, who is now out of Town; he has been come from that Gentleman 4 Months, but when he was there I have seen a great Charge of Plate in his Custody. I keep a Grocer's Shop at the End of Bedford-Row, and have several times left him in my Shop when he was out of Service.</p>

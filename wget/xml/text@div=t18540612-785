                  </hi>. I am the son of Aaron Johnson, a tobacconist, at Rotherhithe. On the evening of 22nd May, the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco—I served her; she put down a shilling—I told her it was bad, and asked her if she had any more about her—she said she had no more bad, and she gave me a good shilling, and I gave her change—I kept the bad shilling—she left the shop, and I followed her through the Thames-tunnel into the Minories—she went into a grocer's shop—I waited till she came out, and as she came out I went in—I made a communication to the person in the shop; he opened his till, took out this shilling, and threw it on the counter—I looked at it—it was bad—I took possession of it, and ran after the prisoner—I said to hear, "I thought you told me you had no more bad money about you, but you have passed a bad shilling in the grocer's shop"—she said, "Pray, Sir, don't give me in charge"—I called an officer, and gave her into custody with the two bad shillings—before the prisoner went into the grocer's shop I saw her speak to a man, and as soon as that man saw me go towards the shop, he ran away.</p>

               <p>half an ounce of tea; they came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling—I laid it on the counter—I was talking to a lady, and when she went, I put the shilling into the till, but I accidentally put this shilling amongst the copper where there was no other shilling—as soon as the prisoner had left, Mr. Johnson came in, and told me something—I opened the till, and found this shilling amongst the coppers—I gave it to Mr. Johnson, and he ran after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is your till in the counter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is no opening in the counter; we open the till—I am certain there is no hole in the counter through which we drop money—I never said there was—I said there was a partition in the till, but no hole in the counter—the till is a drawer, and at the top of it there is a square place cut out—the drawer has a division for silver and copper—we put the money in by throwing it in the front of the drawer which is cut away—when I put this shilling in, I did not open the drawer but <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the shilling in—I could not swear where I put it—I had opened the till to give her change, but I threw in the shilling when I opened it: I know I had three good shillings in the till before, and when I opened it again, I found this one shilling in the coppers—I only said the prisoner was the woman—I was quite alone, I could not leave the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have the copper and silver in the same drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is a division between them which comes nearly flush with the top—if anything was put in, it could have gone in the division where the silver is—I had had the till open about twenty minutes before—I had not received any shilling since the time that I had seen there was no shilling amongst the copper.</p>

I am a public-house broker, and reside at 4, Brunswick Terrace, Commercial Road—I was employed by Taylor, Walker &amp; Co., the brewers, to let the "Sun," public-house, at Blackheath—I saw the defen<lb></lb>dant on that subject, in October, 1869—he had been down previously to the brewery, and had seen Mr. Sewell, the manager, and expressed a desire to take the house, and Mr. Sewell referred him to me—we met the next morning, at the brewery, and an agreement was prepared, and Mr. Fair-child, paid a deposit of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into my hands—he agreed at that time to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the firm was to lend the other 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he signed this agreement in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of agreement, dated 26th October</hi>, 1869, <hi rend="italic">between 'William Henry Sewell and George Emberson Fairchild, and witnessed by Harry Jones, to assign over the "Sun" tavern, at Greenwich, in consideration of the sum of</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be paid, and as tenant to Messrs.

Taylor, Walker &amp; Co., to which the equitable mortgage related—after signing the first agreement he called on me and said he could not make up the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he wanted first 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he called and asked whether the firm would advance 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., more—the original understanding was that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was to be given, and it was afterwards made up to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the premises in July, and put in a distress for three quarters' rent, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., due at midsummer—I waited at the house about two hours before Fairchild came—I told him we were there for the rent, and wanted 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was in a very excited state, and said he had got the money in his cash box—I said if he would pay us the money, we would withdraw without charging the expenses—he said he should do nothing of the sort, he should allow the thing to go on; in fact, he took up the poker and threatened us—the broken remained in possession—I afterwards saw the defendant on the subject of this letter, which I received from Mr. Sewell, the manager to Messrs. Taylor, Walker &amp; Co.—on 21st July, I saw the defendant at the brewery, after the distraint was made—I asked him whether he was prepared to come to any arrangement—he said he would, if the firm would give him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and allow him to keep the furniture and pay his debt to Messrs. Sewell and Blackie—I said I would go and see Mr. Sewell—I went and saw him—I saw the defendant afterwards, and told him Mr. Sewell would give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and allow him to remove his own furniture, and would discharge Messrs. Sewell &amp; Blackie's debt, and would forgo their claim—he said if they would allow him to remove the billiard table he would accede to it—I saw Mr. Sewell about that, and then saw the defendant—I told him that Mr. Sewell would not allow the billiard table to be removed—the defendant then said he would go home and smash every b——thing up in the place, if he suffered twelve months for it afterwards—I said if he did attempt to do anything of that sort, of course we should punish him for it, and I reminded him that the goods were mortgaged to Messrs. Taylor &amp; Walker—we then parted, and no arrangement having been made, I prepared to sell under the distress for rent—I posted bills about and advertised, and the sale was to take place on 25th July, at 3.30, at the public-house—the things were appraised before the sale at 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they were offered to the defendant at that price, in my presence and in the' presence of a constable—he said we were to sell the things and do what we liked with them—they were sold for 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my brother bought some of the things, at least they were knocked down to a man of the name of Redpath—after the sale the defendant conducted himself in a violent way—he took a mallet up, and threatened me, and attempted to rip my nose up with his thumb, and swore at me—when it got dark the men wanted to remove the goods, and the gas was turned on—he said he would not have any gas on, and turned it out—a clerk went for some candles, and he knocked them out of his hand, and would not allow them to be lighted, and he broke</p>

I am an accountant, and live at Greenwich—I have known the prisoner some five years—I never heard anything against his character, I have always heard him well spoken of—I remember his occupying the "Sun" public-house—in July I wrote one or two letters for him to Mr. Sewell, and posted them myself—I made copies of them at the time, and have them here—I could not say that the prisoner was not able to use his hand at that time, he had met with some accident, I believe.

Please attend to this at once, as delay is simply ruin, and I must shut up the house if I have no beer to draw.")—The representation in that letter was undoubtedly true—Mr. Pratt, the collector of Taylor &amp; Co., came down after the first letter was written; I wrote two—I did not hear what passed between him and the prisoner—I was not at the premises when the distraint was put in—I was present at the sale on the 25th—I have no idea as to the value of the wine and spirits; his furniture generally, as far as I could judge, would be worth from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the fixtures might amount to as much more—there were several protests by the prisoner against the mode in which the sale was carried on; he was very much put out about it, and was in a very irritable state all day—he said he considered they—had no right to hold the sale on his pre<lb></lb>mises.</p>

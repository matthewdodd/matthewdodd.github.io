                  </hi>. I am porter to George Buchanan Kirkman and another, 5, Old Fish-street-hill. On 29th Jan., I missed a long spring truck, which had been left in front of the warehouse door—I had been out with some goods, and had left it there soon after 5 o'clock—it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was afterwards brought by a person named Taylor—there was the name of G. B. Kirkman, 5, Old Fish-street, City, on it—when I saw it again it was partly scraped off; I could make out some of it.</p>

I know the prisoner—in consequence of what I heard from Mr. Cannon, I bought a truck of the prisoner on 31st Jan. for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him I would not buy it without I saw the owner—he said I could not see the owner, she was a widow lady, living in George-court, Leicester-square—I said I would not buy it till he brought a bill and receipt, and he brought this—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mary Taylor, 6, George-court, I truck, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")—I paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Cannon, for bringing me the truck—I observed on it a portion of a name scratched out—I got a scrubbing-brush, and in a short time I made out the name, "George Buchanan Kirkman, 5, Old Fish-street, City"—I made off to Mr. Kirkman, and gave the truck to the last witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse-dealer, living in Chiswell-street. On Sunday, the 18th of October, about three o'clock, I came home, and found the prisoner in my yard, in custody of a policeman—my man produced my coat, and the handkerchief was out of the pocket—the coat I have now—the handkerchief was taken to the station-house, and the officer has not brought it—I had seen the handkerchief twenty minutes before—it was out, and underneath the coat—it was my handkerchief—the pockets were turned out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Alexander. I was at the stable about two o'clock—I was at the Window, and saw the prisoner in the count<lb></lb>ing-house, trying to get the coat—he had no business there—I saw a coat and a silk handkerchief in his hand, and when I went round into the counting-house, I saw him <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it on the horse-block—I asked what he was doing in there—he said he did not know, but came up the yard and went into the counting-house—I sent for my master, and he sent for a po<lb></lb>liceman—I had seen the coat before the prisoner came into the counting-house—it had been removed from the window to the door, a few yards—one pocket was turned out—he put the handkerchief back again, and I did not see it afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I came to see if Mr. Wolfe was there—I went into the saddle-room, and this pocket-handkerchief was lying on the floor—I took it up, put it on the horse—this man came in, and said, "What business have you there? "—I said, "None, but to see if Mr. Wolfe or Mr. Alexander were there." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did say so—he was not out of the counting-house when I saw him first—I saw him with the coat in his hands—when I came by the window I laid hold of him, and held him a good bit.</p>

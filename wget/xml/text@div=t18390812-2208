                  </hi>. I am a journeyman ship-joiner, and live in Leicester-street, Blackwall. On the 19th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night I was in the Red Lion public-house, Poplar, and met the prisoner Marney—I was drunk—we stopped there till twelve o'clock—I then went to the Har<lb></lb>row public-house, and <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> some gin—I am sure I had three sovereigns in my pocket at that time—I changed a sovereign to pay for half-a-pint of gin—I put three shillings into my pocket, the two sovereigns and the rest into my fob pocket—I went home to her house, No. 2, Red Lion-court, with intent of stopping with her that night—she told me to go to bed, and she would be there very soon—she asked for some money to get some gin or what she liked—I had 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In copper in my pocket, which I gave her—I thought she was gone to get it, but she did not go out of the house—I put on my trowsers, and came down to look after her—she asked me for more money—I told her I had no more—she said she would feel whether I had or not—she felt my fob pocket, and as soon as she had done so she went to the mantel-piece and began to rumple some papers about—I said, "You have got all my money," and I found it was gone—she said she was going</p>

               <p>to the Harrow public-house—I went also, she met Tantony there, and after staying a little time I went to sleep, and did not awake until three or four o'clock, when I went to the policeman and gave charge of them—two sovereigns and two-pence were found—I am sure, that at the time she had her hand in my pocket, I had some money in it.</p>

I had given her, and said she did not want my lousy three shillings—when I picked up the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she said, "Now I am going to the Harrow again"—I had the key of the street-door—I went into the tap-room with her—she asked if I was going to stand any thing to drink—the landlady changed the sovereign for me—I told the landlady I had charged this woman with robbing me—Marney asked me then would stand something to drink—I said I would stand no more—I if I went off to sleep.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not give charge of her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I wished to leave it alone till the morning—I was not at the Harrow public-house above ten minutes before I went to sleep—that was after I had charged her in her own room with robbing me—I put 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Into my fob pocket—I had changed a sovereign, to pay for half-a-pint of gin—we had a quartern of gin at the Red Lion, and I believe I had been having some beer by myself—I had beer and gin after I met her—I paid eight-pence at the Harrow public-house—the prisoner went to the mantel-piece in her room—I have not found the sixteen shillings—I cannot say why I did not give charge of her at the Harrow public-house, only I wished to leave it till the morning, that I might have the chance of seeing a policeman—I cannot give any notion how much beer and gin I drank that night—I had been paid at the Britannia public-house, and drank about a pot of beer with my mates—a little will make me drunk sometimes—I went to the Harrow public-house, and had half-a-pint of gin with the prisoner and one or two whom she might ask to drink—the prisoner Tantony was there.</p>

I was sent for about three or four o'clock the next morning, to No. 2, Red Lion-court—I know the prisoners well, they cohabit together—I knocked at their door for some time, when Tantony answered at the window, and said to the prosecutor, "What the hell are you making so much noise for at this time in the morn<lb></lb>ing"—I stood on one. side—after some time, I beard Tantony come down stairs—I thought he was gone to the back garden—I got on a little wall, and looked over—I saw him go to the bottom of the garden, and stooping and raking some mould on one side—he then put the mould over it again—he stood up, and looked at it—stooped, and put a little more mould on it—I got down, and told Dennis—we then began to kick at the front door—Tantony came and opened it—I asked him if <hi rend="italic">Mog</hi> was in which is the name that Marney goes by)—he said "Yes; what is amiss?"—I told him—he called to her—she dressed, and came down, and the prose<lb></lb>cutor</p>

               <p>said she had had it—she denied it—after she was told about being taken into custody, she said, "How can you tell such a lie, to say I took your money, when you know you left a sovereign under the bolster?"—I said to her, "You had better show us where that is"—Tantony and Dennis went up stairs—they said they could not find it—I said to Marney, "You had better go and see"—she went up—I went into the back garden, and found this sovereign in a piece of rag, where I had seen Tantony bury something—I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In Tantony's pocket—I then took him to the station-house—when I got there, I shewed him the sovereign which I had found, and he said to Marney, "The b—y money has done us, <hi rend="italic">Mog"</hi>—she said it was not one of the sovereigns, and had nothing to do with it—Tantony said, "You know it is."</p>

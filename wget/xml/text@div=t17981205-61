No. The coachman stopped for the space of three minutes; while the coachman was stopping, Williams put his hands over my shoulders playing with me, and I felt Moore put his hand in my right hand waistcoat pocket; I said, to Williams, set up; I then put my hand in my waistcoat pocket, and said, George, you have robbed me of four guineas wrapped up in a piece of brown paper; he denied it, and said, did I think he would be guilty of the like; I said, George, if you will give me my money, I will spend half-a-guinea in your company; after that, he would not give me my money, and I sung out to the coachman, says I, carry us to some honest house, for I am robbed, by my messmate, Moore, of four guineas; the coachman then drove to Mr. Carpmeal's, in Bow-street; when we got there, Williams opened the door, and got out and ran away, and the prisoner after him; the prisoner, Moore, was secured by the coachman; the coachman then said, to Moore, don't leave an injured man in my coach; the coachman took him into Carpmeal's, and I went in with him, and gave charge of him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. The information says this, that he discovered his hands in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he speak that loud, or how? -

            In a middling tone of voice; then the prisoner came up upon the wheel, as the other had done, and he said, you must drive us to Covent-garden House, at half-price.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Yeoman? - A. I did not see him till I got to the Tobit's-dog, and did not know I had him in my coach till then; I did not get off my box at all, the little boy that fetched me shut the door; when I got into St. Paul's Church-yard, one of them called out, coachman, get us a shillingsworth of brandy and water; then I drove up to the Tobit's-dog, in St. Paul's Church-yard, I brought them the brandy and water out, and told the servant girl to receive the money; then I saw the prosecutor, and he paid for it, he gave the shilling; then I heard the prosecutor say to Williams, for God's sake do not take me to any bad place, but do as you would he done by; I rather started at that, and then both of them called out at the coach-door, you have no occasion to be afraid, coachman, he is our shipmate, and messmate; then they told me to drive on where they ordered me; then I went on to Covent-garden House; when I got there, they were so very busy that I could not get to set them down where it was clean; then I stopped a little while, and the man cried out, I am robbed by my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050062"></xptr>shipmates, I am robbed by my shipmates, two or three times over; I immediately got down to the door of the coach, and he said, for God's sake give me the money, I will spend half-a-guinea if you will give me my money, or give you half-a-guinea, but do give me my money again; then he said, coachman, get me to some honest house for God's sake; I did not know where I was, then I drove to Carpmeal's; when I got round to Carpmeal's door, Williams jumped out at the off door, and the prisoner after him; I got off my box, and fell, but recovered myself, and caught the prisoner about ten yards from the door, and said, are you going to leave me an injured man.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a victualler, in Goodman's-yard, in the Minories: On the 6th of November, I gave the prosecutor change for a five pound note; I gave him four guineas, a half-guinea, and the rest in silver and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you gave him four guineas? - Yes, I am sure of it; the prisoner was with him, they had got some punch before them; the prisoner wrapped it in a piece of paper, and gave it to the prosecutor, and he put it into his waistcoat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams present at that time? - A. They were all sitting at the table together.</p>

            Therefore, if any body has said the prisoner put it in his pocket, and not the prosecutor, that is not true? - A.

               <p>Q. If the prisoner had put it in his pocket you must have seen him? - A. Yes; I saw the prosecutor put it in his pocket.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep the Vine, in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner and the prosecutor coming to your house? - A. Yes, and Williams with them; the prosecutor was very drunk indeed, and behaved in a very ridiculous manner, jumping about, and knocking every thing about; he made a great noise, and kept holloaing to his shipmates, come along, come along, come along.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come to your house? - A. To the best of my recollection I think between five and six, and they might stay the space of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they did not stay four hours? - A. No, it was about an hour.</p>

            Could a man, who had a distinct recollection, call it four hours? - A. No; my little boy was at the door, and one of them desired him to fetch a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober? - A. I did not perceive that he was the worse for liquor, he behaved very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams drunk or sober? - A. I think he was in liquor; the prisoner said, if the young woman cannot get change, I will pay you; they were at the bar first, and had five or six glasses of liquor; then they went into the back room, and the prisoner ordered half-a-crown's-worth of punch; I told him I had no warm water; he said, never mind, make it like sailor's grog.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He did not tell you where he wanted to go? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him say he wanted them to take him to the Hercules? - A. No, they came to my house in a coach, and discharged it at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe the prisoner drunk at all when he left your house? - A. No, he behaved in a very prudent manner?</p>
               <p>Q. He was not half-seas over? - A. No.(The prisoner called William Baver stock, the steward of the ship, and two other witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

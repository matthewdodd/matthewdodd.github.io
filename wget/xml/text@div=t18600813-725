                  </hi>. I live at 37, Hooper-street, Westminster-road, and am a hammerman—the prisoner lived next door to me, and my father and mother—on the night of 5th July, about half-past 8, I went into the yard behind our house, and I saw a girl there with an infant in her arms—both the girl and the infant were crying—I spoke to the girl, and about three or four minutes after that the prisoner came out of her house into her own yard—there was a fence about three feet high between our yard and hers—I could get over it, because the palings were broken—the prisoner rushed over to the girl that had the infant, and took it out of her arms, she pushed the girl on one side, and caught hold of the infant by the front of the pinafore, and one leg; but before that she hit it with her hand; her hand was closed—she hit it just on the back of the head once, then she caught hold of one of its legs, and the front of the pinafore, and dashed it down on the ground—the right side of the child's head touched the ground—the yard is gravelled—the prisoner then made an attempt to get the child again, and I jumped over just in time to pick it up—I picked up the child and gave it to its mother again—I thought she was going in-doors with it—she said she would go in<lb></lb>doors with it then—she was very drunk—she then walked over to the water-butt, and I followed her—she lifted a bit of wood that acted as a cover to the water-butt, a sort of lid, and then <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the baby head first into the water-butt—I rushed over and picked the child out of the water-butt directly—the child was about four months old—when the prisoner had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the baby into the water-butt she turned her back to the butt to go in-doors—I can't say whether she saw me pick the child out or not—she did not go in<lb></lb>doors—I kept the child in my arms, trying to take its clothes off for a minute or two, and then the prisoner came and tried to take it from me several times—it was dripping wet—I kept her back with one hand as well as I could and I gave it to my mother, and went for a policeman—when the policeman came we went into the prisoner's house—the prisoner was sitting down on a box with her own eldest child in her arms, about eight years old—the policeman told her that she was to go along with him, and she asked him where her infant was—some one in the room said it was outside, and some woman was taking care of it—the policeman caught hold of her arm—she tried very much not to go with him, and said, "For God's sake don't take me; let me</p>

               <p>stop here"—she would not go out with the policeman, and I caught hold of one of her arms—we had a very great job to get her out into the street—at the time she was in the act of putting the child into the water-butt, I saw a woman in the prisoner's room who wanted to come out, I expect, to save the child—she put one of her legs on the sill to come through the window because the door was locked—she could not get out at the door, and when she saw the prisoner coming over to the water-butt with the child she stepped back again—when I picked the child out of the butt the prisoner was not above a foot away from the butt—she turned her back to the butt directly she <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the child in—she stood still about a foot from the butt—she stopped there about a minute till I had got it out—there was water enough in the butt to drown the child; it was three parts fall—directly you pushed the lid on one side you could see the water, you could not help seeing it—the butt was about three feet high, and about three parts full—the woman was reeling about, but I believe she could have stood steadily if she had liked, because, in the room, when we went in, she seemed as if she was all right—there was about ten minutes between the time she put the child into the butt, and the time that she said to the policeman, "For God's sake don't take me"—I did not observe the face of the baby when I took it out of the water-butt—I could see where the mark was on its head, where it had been bruised on the ground, and it was very pale—it never moved—I did not have it in my arms above two or three minutes.</p>

I am the mother of the last witness—on the evening of 5th July I was in my own room about half-past 8—I heard the cry of a baby, and went out into the back yard, and my son gave me the prisoner's baby—it was a girl about four or five months old—it was dripping wet and looked between black and blue in the face, and it had a bruise on the right side of the head—it seemed to be a bruise just received—I undressed the baby, wrapped it up warm, and suckled it—it lived, and is now doing very well—I had known the prisoner for about two months as a neighbour—I never knew her to be cruel to her children before—she was always neat, and was either working or knitting at her door, working hard for her family—I never saw her in liquor before—she was in liquor that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Williams, and lived in the same house as the prisoner, on 5th July—between 7 and 8 that evening the prisoner called me into her room to pay me a shilling that she owed me—she began to tell me what a bother she had had to get her pension money—she is a soldier's widow—she had been drinking a little, but spoke sensibly enough to me—while I was there she took the baby from the bed where it was lying; it was crying—she took it by its clothes in front and threw it down on the ground on its back—she did it violently, in her passion—it was on the bed, but there was no bedstead—it fell on the boards, against the fire-place, about a yard from the bed—I picked it up and took it out into the street, and gave it to the prisoner's little girl; I then went back to the prisoner's room—the pri<lb></lb>soner shut the door to keep me in; the handle was off on the inside and I could not open it—she said she had spent a good deal of her money, but she had only had one glass of gin during the day—she then undressed herself to search and try to find her money, and she broke and smashed the things in the room, and tore down the curtains; after that she heard the baby crying in the back-yard, and she said, "You b—bastard, I will do for you"—I</p>

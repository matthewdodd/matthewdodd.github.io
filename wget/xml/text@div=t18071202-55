            , upon Kearne and Caine, accepted by Kearne and Caine; there was also in the purse half a guinea in gold and some silver. After the fire was put out, I went up stairs to look for the purse, and found it had been taken away. I went into the kitchen and asked the servant if she had seen any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell who had been in that room. - A. Nobody but me, I was there alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had seen no one in that room. - A. Not any one. I asked the servant whether she had seen any thing of my purse, in the presence of the prisoner, the prisoner was in the kitchen with the servant, she told me she had not seen any thing of it; the prisoner said she was the only stranger that had been up stairs, she would leave me her address.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before. - A. I never saw her before; not suspecting her of having stolen it, she was let to go out of the house without my taking her address.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. This is Mr. Mayston's house. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, through the prisoner said she was the only person, were there not other persons that went up stairs. - A. There were to put out the fire; there were only the people in our house and one neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. You I suppose were not up stairs while they were putting out the fire. - A. I went up stairs with blankets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner assist in putting out the fire. - A. The prisoner I believe carried up one pail of water to help to put it out.</p>

            . Q. You are the owner of this house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the fire. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the house. - A. I did see her, I can identify her; she was apprehended on the 4th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day of the fire. - A. The 23d of October; on the day she was apprehended I went to the police office in Marlborough-street, there I saw the prisoner, I asked her what she had done with the bill of exchange.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Before she said any thing to you, had not you told her she had better tell you. - A. No, I never promised her nor threatened her.</p>
               <p>Court. In short, did you use any expressions to her to induce her to say that which otherwise she would not have said. - A. I desired her to tell the truth, and then I asked her what she had done with the bill of exchange of forty two pounds; she told me that she had given it to a Mr. Dawson of Wandsworth, but whereabouts he lived in Wandsworth she could not tell me. I then asked her how she could think of stealing the purse at a time the family were in such distress from the fire. I asked her what this purse contained, she said nothing more than the bill of exchange; I then asked her where she found this purse, in what part of the house, she said she found it on the stairs as she was coming down the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not deny being in the house. - A. Not at all; she confessed that she picked up the purse, she heard it jingle; I said it is very unlikely that a purse would jingle if there was nothing in it but a bill of exchange; she then confessed that she had paid away two of the one pound notes the same day she had stolen it to her landlady. These were her words; I then asked her what she had done with the rest; she replied, that she had got drunk and lost them.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BAXTER. I live in Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. I am a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, have you ever seen her before. - A. Yes, I have seen her many times before, I have known her for years, she is a married woman, her husband is a shoe maker. On the 24th of October, I think, in the morning, the prisoner at the bar, in company with another woman, were in the shop, I did not see them come in; the woman that was with the prisoner was pledging a ring; the prisoner had got a piece of paper in her hand, and she was shewing it to some of the customers that were in the shop; I asked to look at it, she gave it me, she said she supposed it was worth nothing. I told her it was worth nothing to her, I looked at it; I asked her how she came by it, she told me she found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she found it. - A. I do not recollect. I looked at it, and found it be a promissory note.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at it, and found what you thought a promissory note. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a bill of exchange. - A. I told her she had better take it to the acceptor, and by that means she would find the owner, and get something for her trouble; I then gave it her back again; that was on the Saturday. On the Monday following I saw it advertised, that it was stolen from a house; I thought the ring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020043"></xptr>might be stolen likewise; I took the ring that the woman that was with her pledged down to the house of the prosecutor, and the Wednesday following, on the 4th of November, the prisoner came again to the shop. I told her I must detain her till I sent for the gentleman that belonged to the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce the bill then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She had not left the bill with you. - A. No, I gave it her after I had looked at it; immediately, the first time I saw it. She asked me if it was advertised; I told her I must detain her. I did not ask her what she had done with the bill, she told me she had given it to Mr. Dawson. On the Friday following, in consequence of information I had received, I went to the room where the prisoner lodged, I saw a man there, I asked him if his name was Dawson, he said it was; I told him I wanted that bill that he had of the prisoner, the prisoner was in custody; then he took it out of his pocket book; he said he would not give it me, but he would give it to her husband; the husband said he knew nothing about it, and immediately gave it to me. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayston. This is the same bill.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a remarkable one, I am sure you cannot be mistaken. - A. No, it is the same bill, Maria Lavender paid it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that it was upon the table. A. It was upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loose upon the table, or was it never out of the purse in your sight. - A. It was never out of the purse from the time I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. What I wish to know is this, whether you are sure you left it in the purse on the table, or whether you saw it upon the table, or about the house at any time, out of the purse. - A. I never saw it out of the purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Not on that day. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you never saw the prisoner before. - A. I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us likewise that you did not see her in that room where the purse was. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did see the prisoner in the house that day. - A. I met her on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the door of your room from her when you met her on the stairs. - A. I met her about the third stair from the house door, she was going up stairs and I was going down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where you went after you passed her. - A. I went into the kitchen to see after the fire; I saw her again after I missed the purse, and I saw her at the top of the house in the garret; that was two stories from the room where I left the purse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her in the garret you had missed the purse - A. I had not missed it then, I had missed the purse after the fire was put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her after you missed the purse. I saw her in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was in the kitchen that you asked the servant about it. - A. It was, and in her hearing; she said she was the only stranger in the house, she would leave her address.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

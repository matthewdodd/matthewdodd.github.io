On the 19th of April there was a disturbance in Wbitechapel—I saw all the prisoners there fight<lb></lb>ing five or six at the time—I got them in-doors five or six times—I endea<lb></lb>voured to quiet them—about half-past eleven that night I heard calls of "murder" and "police"—a respectable person came to me, and I went to Sugar-loaf court to try to quiet them again—I was knocked down the moment I got into the oourt by Dennis Ragan—the other prisoners were all scrambling and fighting together—when I got bold of Dennis Ragan they tried to pull him away from me—I took him in custody—he said, "you b—y vagabond, if you offer to put a hand on me, I will cut your b—y stones out"—I seised him, and the other men tried to pull him away, catching hold of his arms and legs—William Ragan kicked me in my back, and White and Sullivan both struck roe—I got bruised all over my body—I was then struggling to get Dennis Ragan out of the court—the person who gave me information was not with me then, but there was a person who I had called to my assist<lb></lb>ance—when I called to the gentleman for assistance they let him come quietly a little way, and as soon as the gentleman went for assistance they came and kicked me—all three of them—I had hold of Dennis Ragan, and he bit me under my chin several times—the others kicked me and knocked me about, and two others who are not yet taken—some other policemen came into the street—these men continued beating me till more policemen came up, and White called out "down with the b—y police."</p>

On Thursday last, about half past seven, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100017"></xptr>came into our shop to match a print, I could not match it; we had none of it left; the prisoner seemed dissatisfied and asked us to look again. Mrs. Payne informed our porter something the prisoner said, she had better mind her own business, she thought she was no good herself; the prisoner then said, cut me off a yard of this print; it was laying on the counter; I began to cut her off a yard, and directly she flew in a passion, and said I was tearing her print; one of our young men came up, and said it was our print; the porter came up and told me he saw her take it out of her handkerchief; she then flew in a passion and cried. I told the porter to go for a constable, and before the constable came she confessed that she had taken it. I had noticed the print on the counter just before the prisoner came in. The print was five yards, it was worth fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>CALEB MUNN. I am a porter to Mr. Marshall, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, I saw the print on the counter before the prisoner came in; I did not see the prisoner take any print off the counter. Mrs. Payne told me she saw the prisoner take the piece of print and put it in her handkerchief; I went up to the prisoner, I said, what is your pleasure; she said, I want a yard of print like this; part was in her handkerchief and part on the counter. I told Mr. Grisbrook he went to her; she said, cut me off a yard off this, and immediately he was going to tear it, she said you are tearing my print; he said it was not; I was sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of dealing at the prosecutor's shop. Having purchased a gown at the same shop; I went a few evenings afterwards with the print to get some of the same pattern to make my childrens frocks; they then said that some woman had taken it clandestinely.</p>

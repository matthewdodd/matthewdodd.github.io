               <p>with him—on that, after receiving the money, he paid me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as my salary as auditor, and on that day, after he had obtained cash for the cheques, he paid the auditors somewhere about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 27th, I believe he paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and on the 28th, I believe he paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has been in the habit of paying all along.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he pay somebody for making reports 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe then was something to that effect—I am not aware of the amount he paid on the 29th—he paid some on the 30th—he did not pay me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 30th—I did not receive that sum, I received 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not keep any account of the money received, I am speaking from memory—I will under. take to say I did not receive that amount on that day—I have been the chairman of the executive council since the beginning of the present year—I had been once or twice before—I have not known of cheques being cashed without being paid into the bank—the prisoner has been secretary four years—I have not known anything against him—I am not aware of a movement to bring him back to the society when he was about to retire.</p>

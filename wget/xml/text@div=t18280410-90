            . I am 12 years old - I live with Mr. Sly - I had three half-crowns from him, and was putting them into my pocket in the street - one of them dropped and the prisoner took it up; I asked him for it, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100066"></xptr>said he had not got it; I asked him for it again - he said, if I said he had got it he would knock me down; he tried to make his escape - I called Stop thief! and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the half-crown against a post, about a yard and half from the boy; I took it up but did not know whose it was - the boy came up and said it was his; I asked him what it was, but he could not tell me at first - he then said it was a half-crown. I was going after a man whom I help to cut chaff, and was taken.</p>

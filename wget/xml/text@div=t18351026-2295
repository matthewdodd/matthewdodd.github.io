                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service. I did not direct him to go to Mrs. Almond on the 17th of October—I was not short of money—he made no entry on that evening of any sum received from Mrs. Almond—there are entires in the book on the Monday succeeding—some in my handwriting, and two or three other persons', but none by the prisoner—the prisoner did not enter either the first or the second payment, not tell me he had received them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not Wednesday the regular day that cash was received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was so far the regular day, that if cash was received as that day it would be entered—it was the day he usually went round—he was taken on the Tuesday—I had not told him to make use of money, when he was short in the way of business, on my account—when he came home he said he had spent so much for tolls—he has once or twice asked me to pay his rent—the day for making up Mrs. Almond's account was on Wednes<lb></lb>day, the day he usually went out—after he was taken up a person called on me, but I did not speak to him, and the money was never offered to me—I do not know what he came about—he walked into my counting-house. and talked about the business, and mentioned Woollett's name—I said I had nothing to say to him—I did not give the prisoner an opportunity of answering this charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No matter what the receiving day was, if he had re<lb></lb>ceived this money on the Saturday, was it not his duty to have entered it is the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the tolls of a whole year would not amount to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have advanced him money, but I never authorized him to go to my customers and collect debts and appropriate them to his own use—when he was taken he did not state that he had received any money from Mrs. Almond—if he received money on any day he ought to have entered it, and not to have waited for Wednesday, but to have entered it on the day he received it—I have not the least doubt of that—the cash was balanced every night, and it was balanced that Saturday night—he made no mention of what he had received in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor states that he balanced his book every night. I have known it be for two or three days without balancing; on that Saturday night I asked for Mr. Penson, with the intention of naming to him that I had been driven for money, and I had taken this, and I would account to him on the Wednesday. I have repeatedly asked him to let me have 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "You can take it, Woollett, and settle when you like." My intention was to have settled with him on the following Wednes<lb></lb>day, and I sent it by a friend.</p>

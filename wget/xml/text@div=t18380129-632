                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Holywell-row, Shoreditch. On the 25th of January, I went to Mr. Youngman, a mahogany merchant in the Curtain-road, on business, between eleven and twelve o'clock—on going, I saw the prisoners Scott and Jones, who I knew were in Mr. Youngman's employ—Jones asked me, in the presence of Scott, if I wanted to buy a few rosewood veneers—I asked him where they were—he told me he would call in the afternoon, and let me know—at a quarter past five o'clock in the afternoon of that day, Jones called, and I went out with them about two hundred yards from my own house, round into Phipp-street—there were</p>

               <p>two other men there waiting, who are not in custody—I went and fetched a person of the name of Standiwick, who worked for me—I returned with him to where scott and Jones, and the other two men were, and then scott and Jones introduced me to the other two men, to take me to the man who had the veneers—I and Standiwick, scott and Jones, and the other two men went near to Southwark-bridge—they took me clown some steps into a public-house, which I have since ascertained to be the Rose and Bell—we went into the tap-room, and one of the men, who is not in custody, went out, saying he would fetch the foreman—he returned in ten minutes with William Lane—we were then in the tap-room, and William Lane proposed that we should go into the parlour, and we all went into the parlour—one of the men not in custody said, "This is the man that has got the veneers to sell," pointing to William Lane, and he asked William Lane how many he had got—William Lane said, "I think I can get about four planks"—William Lane then went out, and one of the men not in custody went with him—the man returned, without William Lane, in about ten minutes, and he directed me to go to the yard close by the bridge, to look at the veneers—the other men were present, but I do not think they heard what was said—I have gince found the place to which that man directed me, and it is Mr. Rol<lb></lb>ling's—just as we were going out I beckoned to Standiwick to go oat with me—the man not in custody then pointed to a gateway for me to go to, but ioitead of going there I went to Mr. Youngman, and gave him information of what had transpired—on the same evening, about ten o'clock, Jones and scott came to my house, and Jones said he had put my name down, and I should have some veneers in, either at eight o'clock in the morning, or in the afternoon—scott was with him at the time—I and Mr. Youngman went to Mr. Rosling's, and told his clerk, and we made some arrangements that I should endeavour to detect any crime that should be committed—I went to Mr. Youngman's about the middle of the next day, and saw scott and Jones there—I told them to go and fetch the wood in—Jones asked for some money to drink, and I went to treat them at a public-house opposite—they asked me for some money to drink on the road, and I gave them <hi rend="italic">Is. 6d</hi>.—after treating them at the public-house, they left me at Mr. Youngman's yard—at three o'clock that afternoon, Jones and scott came tc me again, and Jones said there would be some veneers at my place about five or six o'clock—he said that in presence of scott, and Jones told me not to pay the men that brought them, but to send for him at Mr. Youngman's yard—they went away, and about six o'clock Thomas Lane and Coyne came to me, bringing with them sixty-three veneers on a truck—I asked them if they had brought a bill—Thomas Lane said no, he had lost the bill on the road, but he was to take 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back for them—he did not say who he was to take it to—I had two policemen in readiness, and they took Coyne and Thomas Lane into custody—I then took the policeman to the public-house opposite Mr. Youngman's—it was then about seven or half-past seven o'clock—I did not go into the public-house, but the policeman did, and brought out Jones and scott—we had been first to Mr. Youngman, and he had told us they were there.</p>

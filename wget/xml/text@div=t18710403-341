                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 19th March, about 11.5 p.m., I was on duty in Church Street, Greenwich, and saw a disturbance outside a pie<lb></lb>shop—I went up, and saw several persons dancing on the pavement—I requested them to go away, as it was not a place for dancing—I was told to go to the devil, and other terms of abuse—I walked towards one who was dancing, and received a blow on my cheek from behind, I cannot say from whom, but I seized the man, and threw him on the ground—I was at once surrounded by the mob, my truncheon was taken from me, and I was felled to the ground; my helmet was knocked off by a blow first, and then I was struck across the head, and became insensible—I recollect nothing more till I was taken to the hospital—none of the by-standers came to my assistance—I saw the prisoner in the crowd, but did not see him do anything—I am still suffering from the blow; two of the wounds are still open, and I feel pain from an injury on my back.</p>

A little after 11 o'clock on 19th March, I was at the corner of Nicholson Street and Church Street, Greenwich—I heard a policeman's helmet fall, ran to the spot, and saw Robson on the ground, and the prisoner standing over him, belabouring his head with a truncheon—I was in uniform—I heard the blows, and saw him distinctly strike three blows—I did not know him before—when I got up to him I received a blow on the left side of my head from the prisoner, with a truncheon, but I cannot say whether he meant it for me—I got hold of the truncheon, and wrested it from him, and Robson staggered up—he appeared exhausted, and was bleeding very much—this happened all in a moment—some of the by-standers took Robson away, and I laid hold of the prisoner—two other constables came up, a great mob assembled, and a great many prostitutes—the prisoner kicked and plunged about, and kicked me—the other constables assisted me—the mob interfered, and ultimately rescued him—we were struggling about twenty minutes, during which time we did not. get more than fifty yards, and nearly 150 people assembled around us—the prisoner ran down Bridge Street—he was afterwards taken again, and eight or nine constables were engaged in taking him to the station—he said he should like to have any two b—y policemen in a field, and he would either settle or murder them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know the time, because the publicans were turning people out of their houses—I had never seen the prisoner before—there were only two or three people round Robson when I heard the noise, but twenty or more were going towards him—I rushed up, pushed the people away, and caught the prisoner by the coat—his waistcoat was torn com<lb></lb>pletely off in. trying to getaway—he struck me with a truncheon on one side of my head, and a girl came behind me, and kicked me—the prisoner is the man who was standing over Robson—the other two constables took hold of him before I left go; they took him from me.</p>

I was on duty in Church Street, Greenwich, on this Sunday night at 11.5—I heard a blow on a policeman's helmet, and a fall on the ground—I went fifty yards back, and saw people running towards Greenwich Market, and saw the inspector with the prisoner by the collar, against the shutters of a shop—Robson was behind the inspector—Hammond came just after me—Robson, who was not three yards from me said, in the prisoner's hearing, "I am done;" and I took the prisoner from the inspector, and did not loose hold of him for twenty minutes, when I received a blow on my mouth and another on my left eye, which was black for nine days—I was thrown down three times; and the last time I was kicked before my right ear—the prisoner got away—I did not see him brought back.</p>

I was at the Blackheath Road Station—a gentleman called me at about 11.20, and I went with two other constables to Church Street—the prisoner had then escaped—we went in the direction he had gone—I went down Bridge Street into Thomas Street, and found the prisoner in a court, leaning over some railings, very much exhausted, and his clothes all torn—I was not sure he was the man—I asked him what he was doing there—he deliberately aimed a blow at me—it struck me that he was the man, and I seized him by the collar, and by main force dragged him from the passage—in the struggle we fell to the ground—I shouted for assistance, and Hammond, Browning, and two other constables, came and identified him as the man who escaped—I had a severe struggle with him, and he kicked me on the shins, and I received a severe kick from some of the mob.</p>

I live at 93, Eveland Street, Deptford—on Monday morning, 20th March, I examined Robson at the police station—he had three wounds on his head, varying from an inch to an inch and a half long, a bruise on the side of his left eye, and another on his back, between the blade bones—they were contused wounds, and might have been caused by a truncheon—they had been dressed at the hospital when I saw him—they would have been dangerous if erysipelas had followed, and it probably would follow in a person who was not very healthy—he is improving now, but the wounds are still open—I do not apprehend danger now.</p>

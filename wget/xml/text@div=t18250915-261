               <p>MARGARET FURLONGER. I am a widow. The prisoner is my nephew, and visited me. On the 14th of July, a little girl came to me with a note, and I gave her this watch to deliver to my daughter; I found it in possession of a pawnbroker; the chain was not on it then. I live in Great New-street. I believe the letter to be the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you read it you thought it your daughter's writing? A. Yes; I have received letters from the prisoner; I did not suspect it when I read it, but it is spelt the same as letters he has written to me. I apprehended him next day, and he confessed writing it.</p>
               <p>

             (aged nine years, appeared perfectly to understand the obligation of on oath). I know the prisoner; my father used to bring him to our house - he gave me this letter, and told me to say it had come from Mrs. Furlonger, at the White Swan; and told me to take it to Mrs. Furlonger, of Great New-street - which I did; she gave me the watch - he stopped at a public-house, near the house, and I gave him the watch - he gave me nothing - next day I was asked about it, and told how I got the note.</p>
               <p>(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>"DEAR MOTHER, - I should be obliged if you will send Furlonger's watch; he has sent to me to get it repaired against he comes home; there is something the matter with yours - it don't go, but he will have it repaired before he brings it to you. He is very well, and sends his love - hopes this will find you well, as it leaves us at present. Please to send the watch by bearer.</p>

               <p>MRS. FURLONGER. The watch was my son's - he had mine, and I had his - he was gone to France, and we had changed watches. I thought by this letter that he wanted it back.</p>

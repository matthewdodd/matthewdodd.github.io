            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 21st of May, about half-past one o'clock, I went to the shop, No. 84, Fleet-street, City; the name of</p>
               <p>"R. Carlile" is over the door. The defendant Hassell was in the shop - I asked him for another book, and then for</p>
               <p>"Paine's Age of Reason;" he said he had merely come into the shop to keep it open, as some of the men there had been taken out, and would not serve me with</p>
               <p>"The Age of Reason" then; but if I called in an hour or two I should have it, as he had a person coming into the shop who did not care what he served. I left, and returned about half-past three that afternoon, and found both the defendants there. I said to Hassell,</p>
               <p>"Can I have it now;" he said,</p>
               <p>"What is it;" - I said,</p>

               <p>"The Age of Reason."</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this shop - A. It is a large double-fronted shop; O'Conner was not more than a yard from Hassell - he spoke quite loud enough to be heard. When I said I wanted</p>
               <p>"The Age of Reason," he turned round to a small box kind of a place behind the counter, and brought me two copies, one bound and the other not; the books were further from O'Conner - he brought them to where I was standing; I asked the price - the bound one was 8 s., and the other was 4 s.; I said I would take the unbound one; O'Conner was within a foot of him at this time. I was going to pay Hassell for it - but he pointed to O'Conner, who held out his hand, and took the money and jingled it on the counter. I then asked for</p>
               <p>"Palmer's Principles of Nature." Hassell said they had not got a copy in the shop. O'Connor said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; we have got one; let him have it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FRENCH. Q. Do you know O'Conner - A. From seeing him on that day. I put no question to him, but paid him the money - Hassell referred me to him; and he held out his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hassell. Q. Did O'Conner appear to have any concern in the shop - was he not sitting down reading at the time - A. He was not; he was behind the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. For whom did you buy this book - A. I was sent by the Solicitor of the Treasury. I have not read it.</p>
               <p>(The Libel was here read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. FRENCH addressed the Court on behalf of O'Connor. The Learned Gentleman, after pursuing the same arguments as upon the trial of Jeffery, stated that the defendant, who was a member of the Established Church, was driven by poverty to enter this shop, but that he himself had not published the libel, and that there was no proof of his knowing for what work he was receiving the money. The Learned Gentleman called the following witnesses: -</p>

            . I live at No. 23, Thomas-street, Grosvenor-square, and have known O'Conner for fifteen years - he was a moral, well-disposed young man, and always kept to the Established Church - he has an aged mother entirely dependant upon him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you - A. I keep a green-grocer's shop - he was abroad for four years, and returned in December - he has always frequented church since his return.</p>
               <p>MR. WONTNER. I am keeper of Newgate. I saw O'Conner on Sunday week attending the chapel - his conduct was very proper. I noticed him particularly; he has only been in my custody for two Sundays.</p>
               <p>HASSELL'S Defence was of a most blasphemous and revolting nature.</p>

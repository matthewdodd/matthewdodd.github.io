            . I am an officer of Thames-police. The prosecutor made a complaint at our office against Ross, for detaining his money and clothes, and complained of the prisoner about the beginning of June: I was sent with the prosecutor to see where he gave the prisoner the money; what he calls the Crown-office, where he paid 10s. is the Excise-office, which is in the City.</p>

            . I live in Joseph-street, St. George's East: Thomas lost a good deal of money which he had left with a publican; I heard the prisoner say he was an Excise-officer, and would forfeit 500l. if he did not get him the money from Ross: that was three or four months ago; he said he could not get it without going to different lawyers in the City, and every time he went he wanted money from Thomas - I saw Thomas give him some money in my room; I then kept the house in Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written) I was an English prisoner in France, and belonged to the ship Prosenjine - I took a lodging in the same house as the prosecutor; I paid some money to him off the debt I owed him - when the officer took me to the Thames Police-office, he stated that he heard the prosecutor say I had paid him part of the money back; when the clerks heard this, they discharged the Policeman, and gave me into the charge of a Thames Police-officer.</p>

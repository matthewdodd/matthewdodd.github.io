               <p>FRANCIS BREWER. I am a corn-dealer, and live in Kensington Gravel-pits - I ordered some corn of Mr. Lucas; I think more than fifteen quarters, but I am not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120048"></xptr>certain. On the evening of the 8th of April Taylor brought some corn - he gave me a note of ten quarters of one sort, and five of another; I saw the cart was loaded, and asked him if that load was all for me - he said it was; I saw him unload it, but while I was counting the sacks he brought in, I was called to speak to a person, and I lost my tale - when the person was gone, I said to the prisoner,"How many more sacks of that sort have you unloaded?" and he said, "I will count the sacks, and see;" while he was doing that he said to a lad, "Here is one sack, marked R.M., which is not to come out;" I did not see any mark on it myself - I did not say any thing to him; he went on unloading till he had finished all that he said was the five quarters - he then unloaded the ten quarters till I think there were but three sacks left in the cart; I said to him, "How many more sacks are for me?" he said two more; it was then I observed that there were three sacks in it - my attention had been called away, so that I had not observed what were delivered of the first five quarters; I saw the ten delivered - he then proceeded to deliver the two sacks, and I asked him how far he was going with the other sack; he said not far - I again said,"Who is it for?" he said, "For Mr. Sturm," who is a baker, living in the Gravel-pits not far from me - I had not at that time any means of knowing that I had not received the fifteen quarters, and I signed the return-note of the fifteen quarters; part of the oats were shot in the shop, and part up stairs - they were not disturbed till they were afterwards measured; Taylor shortly afterwards passed by my house with the cart, but it was dark and I could not see whether any thing was in it; in consequence of the return of Taylor I went myself to Mr. Sturm, and then desired my brother to follow the cart - in consequence of what my brother said, we measured on the Saturday the five quarters of oats which had been first delivered, one sack of which had been pitched in the shop, and the others had been delivered up stairs; we found one sack short of those which were shot up stairs -I did not measure the ten quarters, as I had seen them delivered, and was satisfied.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.How soon after the delivery of the whole was it that you signed this note? A. Directly - the ten quarters I did not measure; they were not of the same description as the five quarters, which were Irish oats, and the ten were Scotch potatoe oats - I should think a sack of the five quarters was not shot amongst the ten quarters; I do not see that I can swear it was not - two other persons serve in my shop; the corn which goes out I as often serve myself as any body - it was on Friday night I received the corn; Saturday is sometimes a busy day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You say he went on, and it was dark - now, supposing he had a sack in the cart when he went away, could you tell that he had not disposed of it before he returned by your door? A. No, I cannot - I did not observe whether he had or not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a great difference between Irish oats and Scotch potatoe oats? A. Yes - if I had seen any Irish oats mixed with the Scotch potatoe oats, of course I should have known them.</p>

            , at Kensington Gravel-pits. In consequence of what my brother said on the 8th of April, I followed Taylor's cart, (which had gone past his house,) to the Swan, at Bayswater - it there stopped; I concealed myself on the opposite side of the road, and in a few minutes I saw Mantell come over the road and take a sack of something up from behind some heaps of dirt, near to where I was concealed - he took it down the Swan stable-yard; he then came out, looked cautiously around him, took an empty sack from under his arm, and threw it into Mr. Lucas' cart; I was about twenty yards from the cart - it was dark; I saw there was something in the cart, but could not tell what - Taylor soon after came out of the Swan; Mantell and he had some conversation while Mantell put the reins on the horses' heads - Taylor then went on with the cart; I followed, and overtook him - I asked him to let me have a ride, that I might see if there was any corn left in the cart; he gave me leave - I got into the cart; there was no corn in it, but some empty sacks put into one sack, and one single sack close on to the tail-ladder, where I supposed the sack was thrown by Mantell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were the lamps lighted? A. Yes - it was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>HENRY LAPTON. I am a Police-constable. I took Taylor at Mr. Lucas' on Saturday. the 9th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, and asked what he had done with the sack of oats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Did you hold out any hope or threat to him? A.None; I did not tell him it would be better to tell the truth - I did not caution him that what he said would be given in evidence; Mr. Lucas was present.</p>
               <p>MR. LUCAS. I was with the officer when Taylor was taken; I told him I would know the truth, and that I knew more than he was aware of - I said if he would tell me the receiver of the corn, I would pass over this.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.How long was that before you delivered him to the officer? A.About ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; I did not hear him say any thing to the officer.</p>
               <p>Mantell's Defence. I went over the road, and took up the sack which Mr. Johnson's waggoner had thrown out of the waggon; I took it into the stable to their horses - three or four persons come and leave their corn there.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARRIS. I am waggoner to Mr. Johnson, a carrier. I bait at the Swan, where my master rents a stable - Mantell is ostler there; on the night of the 8th of April, I stopped there as usual to bait - I took the sack of bait there that evening, and threw it on the ground, as I do every night; Mantell is no relation of mine - I recollect this was on a Friday, because I go three times a week; I stopped there about nine o'clock in the evening - I did not carry the oats into the stable, because I had to secure the things in my waggon, and fasten it up behind; there was no cart of Mr. Lucas'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120049"></xptr>there at that time - the sack was taken up while I was there, and I went into the stable and gave the horses the oats.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BREWER re-examined. Q. How far from your brother's premises is the Swan? A. About one mile - it is in the way back to Mr. Lucas'; a waggon drew up to the Swan at the time I was there, but I did not see what it was loaded with, or who was with it - I did not see any thing put out of it; the sack that was on the ground was ten or fifteen yards from Taylor's cart, exactly opposite to it, not on the side the Swan is - the waggon was on the same side as the sack, and nearer to it than the cart.</p>

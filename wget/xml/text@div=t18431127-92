I was going into the Constitution, and saw the prisoner coming out, with the coat on his arm—he went into the opposite pawn-shop with it, and a yellow handkerchief—he came out without it, and with the money and a duplicate in his hand—I went into the Constitution, and saw the prosecutor terribly intoxicated—the prisoner paid for two pots of beer after I came—he went out, and two men followed him, and after a time the prosecutor asked for his coat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I took the prisoner into custody—I told him it was for stealing the prosecutor's coat—he said he had not got it—on the way to the station, he said if the prosecutor would wait till Saturday he would make it all right—I received a duplicate from Nightingale, went with it to the pawnbroker's, and found the coat—the pawnbroker appeared with it before the Magistrate, and the prosecutor identified it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> At seven o'clock on Wednesday morning, I was drinking with the prosecutor at the Coach and Horses, Edgware-road. He tossed for beer and had no money to pay for it; and coming along Bell-street, he pulled off his coat twice, and asked me to go and pawn it. I told him to keep it on; when we got to the Constitution, he pulled it off, gave it me, and told me to pawn it; he took out his pocket-book, and I went and pawned the coat, brought back the money and duplicate, and put it on the table before him; he pushed it away, and the money was spent in drink, and I went home; in the afternoon Ciscell came and asked me for the duplicate, and said I was a pretty fellow not to give him any of the money. I gave him the duplicate, and went with him to the prosecutor; he pulled off his waistcoat to pawn, and the witnesses had part of the money; after that they talked about giving me in charge, and we were going to make up the money among us, as a good many had part of the drink, to get the coat out again.</p>

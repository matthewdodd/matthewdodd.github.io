On Thursday, the 21st of September, about half-past seven or eight o'clock. I was in the Harrow-road, going home in my chaise-cart, at the rate of six miles an hour, the moon was remarkably bright; I saw three men about twenty yards off, as I advanced near they separated - one sprung from the footpath and seized my horse, that was Hughes. Eaton went round to the horse's head and caught hold of the reins likewise - the other prisoner jumped on the step of the cart, and the other jumped up, both came into the cart nearly together. Hunt had this bludgeon - (producing it) - it is the rail of a fence; it dropped out of his hand as he searched me, and I found it in the road. I asked what they wanted? they said my money. I said,</p>
               <p>"You shall have it if you will not illtreat me;" both said,</p>
               <p>"We will not ill-treat you." Hunt said he would not ill-treat me if I would be quiet. He rifled my pockets, and took about 25 s. my comb, and a bunch of keys, which he returned. They searched for my watch, but did not feel it then. Eaton

             a knife, went behind the cart, trod on the wheel, felt for my pocket, and found a pocket-book in it, he cut my pocket off and took it away altogether. I asked them to have the goodness to give me the papers which were in it, and which were of no service to them; they did not, but all retreated into the footpath. I stood up in my cart, and asked them to return my papers, as they were of service to me. They returned and threw the pocket-book into the cart without the papers. There was a 10 l. bill in it which they took. They entered the cart again as I stood up, unbuttoned my coat, and my watch-chain dropped down, they then found I had a watch. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't take my watch;" they said,</p>
               <p>"We shall have it," took it, and retreated - it was a silver watch, the chain, seal and key were gold. It was very light - I saw all the prisoners as plainly as I do now and had an opportunity of taking a full view of them. I have since seen the tortoise-shell comb in Chapman's possession. I had had it for a year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HUNT. Q. At the first examination you fixed on Smith instead of me and pointed him out - A. I did not. I recognized Hunt immediately, and did not point at all.</p>

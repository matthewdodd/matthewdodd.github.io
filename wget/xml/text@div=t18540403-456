                  </hi>. I am a colourman, living in Bowman's-buildings, Marylebone. On Sunday evening, 26th Feb., I was in Bell-street, Maryle<lb></lb>bone, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I was going home—I had a watch and guard, two keys, a watch key, and about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—my watch was in my fob, and the guard was hanging down; but when I was attacked I put it into my pocket—it was a short guard—the money and the keys were in my left pocket—as I was going along the prisoner tapped me on my right ear, and made a snatch at my guard—I said, "Old fellow, that won't do," and away he went behind me—he came by the right side of me, as I was going across the street; I did not see anything of him until he hit me—I then went on towards home—after speaking to one of the witnesses, I went on about thirty yards, and the prisoner jumped out from a doorway, caught me by both shoulders, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> me down on my left side, and knelt upon me—I had not seen anything of him from the time he first came up to me, till he knocked me down—the doorway that he came out from was at the side of me—he caught me by the collar, and threw me down directly, and as I laid upon my back he knelt upon me, and got hold of my guard, trying to get my watch—he broke the guard off; the watch remained in my pocket—he thrust his hands into my left trowsers pocket, and tore it right out, with the contents, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the keys—as he was tearing my pocket out, I hallooed out "Police! Murder!"—he then got up, and ran away—I ran after him, till he turned down a lonely place, where there, are some old ruins, and I would not follow further—I did not see him stopped—I am sure he is the man; I saw his cap and his coat by the public house lamp, as he ran away—he was dressed as he is now.</p>

On Sunday evening, 26th Feb., between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in the street; I heard a cry of "Murder!" and ran in the direction from whence the sound came—I found the prisoner there, kneeling on the prosecutor, with his hand in his pocket—I saw him take his hand out, but what he took out I do not know—he walked away a little way, and when he got as far as the lamp he began to run down Bury-place, and crossed Manning-street, which is a dark street—a policeman came up a few minutes afterwards, and we went in search of the prisoner, but did not find him—I afterwards saw him in the custody of the policeman—I stood right against him when he was kneeling on the prosecutor.</p>

Q.</hi> You heard the clock strike before you went in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and when I came out; I always hear the clock strike when I am at home—I heard of the prisoner being taken up, two days after he was taken; it was last Sunday five weeks that I went to his mother's—I do not know what day of the month it was, but I know it was last Sunday five weeks, because I removed into the room I am now living in, the Saturday night before—I did not hear what the charge was against the prisoner for three or four days after he had been taken; the mother told me what it was—I never told this story before to-day—I have not had any talk with Mrs. Barry about it—I have heard them all talking about his being there on the Sunday evening, but I did not want anybody to tell me what I saw—he had neither coat or boot on—he put his book on the table, and turned and talked to me about the militia, and one thing or another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of the parish of Old Brentford, Ealing—a little after 10 o'clock on the morning of 18th of July last, I was standing at my door, and saw three pleasure vans coming down the road opposite my house—they were coming in a line when I first saw them, one after the other, and coming pretty steady—the first van was in the regular line where it ought to have been, on the near side going to Hounslow—it was drawn by three horses—I believe music was playing—the second van was following the first, near the middle of the road—the third van was drawn by four horses, and loaded with people—the third van tried to pass the other two; the horses were being urged as fast as they could trot without gallop<lb></lb>ing—the driver was using the reins—I was on the off side; the van passed very near me—I should say within a yard of the kerb, and then came into the gutter—it was going at such a rate that I expected to see it turned over—I went into the road to look—I heard the screaming of women, and saw the old man, the deceased, lying in the road—I ran up as fast as I could, to get the man out—the wheel-horse of the van had fallen over the barrow, and the leader was on the footpath—the man lay between the two hind wheels, hit head towards the footpath, and not above four or five inches from the wheel—I cannot say who was driving the van—I saw the prisoner afterwards among the crowd, he was pointed out to me as the driver, and I took him into custody—he said, "I hope you won't lock me up."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You took someone else in custody at first, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had known the deceased many years—he was about 75 or 76 years of age—I don't believe he was deaf—I was standing at the sill of my door when this happened; I was not inside—I did not tell the prisoner's father that I was in-doors, and did not see it—I did not see the accident—I saw the vans coming down the hill—I believe the bands were playing—I believe there was a big drum in the second van, and the man was beating it very loud at the time the third van was trying to pass the other two—I think the people in the second van were cheering—I did not see that the horses in the third van were frightened; they were trotting as fast as they could trot—they were being urged by the reins, and the whip too; the reins particularly.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Plaistow Park Road, and am clerk to a soap manufacturers—on 18th July, I was standing on the footpath, about seventy yards from the last witness's house, on the opposite side—I saw three plea<lb></lb>sure vans, very crowded with passengers, coming down the road, at what I should term a steady pace, when the driver of the last van suddenly urged his horses to the off-side of the road, endeavouring to pass the other two—I saw him pull his horses on one side, and whip them—I did not see the acci<lb></lb>dent—I went away to my business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, at Old Brentford, and live between twenty and thirty yards from Hughes, lower down on the same side, towards Hounslow—I was standing at my door, between 10 and 11 o'clock on the morning of the 18th, and saw two vans, one near the gutter on the near side, and the other about the middle of the road; the first one must have passed—all at once there was a cheer, but from which van I don't know—after that, or almost simultaneously, there was a scream from the women, I think, from the second van, but I could not swear to that—I immediately ran to the spot, and saw the deceased lying on his back behind the van, with his feet towards the middle of the road—I believe the hind wheel of the van had passed over his head—he lived about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you had known him for several years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I should think for seven years—I should think the horses were going from nine to ten miles an hour—I don't think the deceased was deaf—there was music playing, but I did not notice in which van—the drum was playing; it was nothing out of the way, not very loud.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford, about thirty yards from Hughes, between his house and the deceased's—I was standing at my door, and made a great alarm, because I saw that the deceased was sure to be killed—he had a barrow with him, and was going towards Hounslow—he was in the road, close against the path on the right side, in the gutter—I saw three vans going by very fast, one with four horses, and two with three I saw the horse knock the old man down and trample on him, and the van went over him—I don't know who was the driver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the driver try to pull up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think that must be so, because it was out of his power to pull up four horses in a moment—one of the leaders fell on the path, and the other fell in the road—he tried to pull up—I don't believe he could avoid knocking the man down—I have known the deceased nearly twenty years—he was not hard of hearing, but he was an old man, and had no power to get out of the way, because the horses were upon him, going so quickly.</p>

I am a mason, and live at 13, Dunford Place, Kentish Town—on 18th July, I and a number of other masons hired a van of the prisoner's father, to go to Hampton Court—it was drawn by four horses—the prisoner drove it; I sat by his side, on the left—when we got to Kew Bridge there were two vans in front of us—we kept behind them—just before we got into Brentford, a drum on the van we were following frightened the horses of two market gardeners' carts, which very nearly backed into the side of our van—they were going the same way as us; we were passing them—when the big drum struck up it frightened our horses and threw the leaders out—we had been following close behind the other van for about ten minutes—we had not attempted to pass up to that time—the horses flew out then—there was a man wheeling a barrow on the off side of the road—we halloaed to him, but he took not the slightest notice—the off side horse hit him right in the back, and he was knocked down; and the prisoner in pulling up, which he did with all his main, threw the off side horse down, also the wheeler, and the old man went underneath the van—the prisoner did all he possibly could, he even put his leg over the rein—we were going between six and seven miles an hour—there had been no racing—we had not been ten minutes on the high road—there was a cart behind us—the prisoner did not use his whip at all, it was in the socket; I am sure of that—he did not shake the reins, or urge on the horses—I attribute it entirely to the drum, which made the horses shoot out.</p>

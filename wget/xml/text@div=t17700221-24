After that we all three went to bed together. They went out of the room about two o'clock; I was awake, but did not think they were going, I then felt for my breeches, and missed my watch. I got up, and put on my coat and waistcoat. I missed my hat, cane, shoes, stockings, and buckles. I put on my breeches, and came down to the man of the house, and got a candle, and went up, but my things were gone. I told the man, I had been robbed in his house. He got up, and we went together to two houses. We had a constable with us. At the second house, where Carey lodged, the Duck, in Duck-lane, we found her and Whitely.

            . I am a constable. The man of the house came for me, and said a man had been robbed at his house. I went with him; we could find nothing. Then we went to the Duck in Duck-lane: there we took the two women at the bar, a cane and a hat. We had them examined before Justice Miller; he granted a warrant to take the man at the bar: he was committed and brought up again to be re-examined. It was reported the watch was thrown into the kennel; then the soldier gave me the key of a little box, and sent me to his room where he lodged. I went; it was in Pye-street, at the sign of the Bell; there I found a pair of stockings, and the watch in the box together.

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a tea-dealer, at 54, Ludgate Hill and elsewhere, under the name of Herbert &amp; Co.—in 1870, I engaged the prisoner as warehouseman, at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and in 1873 I appointed him as manager at Ludgate Hill, at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it was his duty to take the general management under me—he was to superintend and assist in keep<lb></lb>ing the books—on 19th October, I executed an assignment of my estate and effects for the benefit of my creditors, and paid them 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—from that date it was the prisoner's duty to account to Mr. Good for the moneys daily received—I have not received any money from him since 19th October—he did not at any time give me any information with regard to the three Post-office orders that he had cashed through Beverton—I dis<lb></lb>covered the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. order cashed through Mr. Jones, after he was in custody—he has never given any explanation of those post-office orders—I know his hand-writing—the post-office orders signed "Herbert &amp; Co.," were written by him—on 10th July, 1874, I was managing the business without any reference to Mr. Good—the prisoner never accounted to me for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Farquhar—in the ledger, the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Brass is entered by Clisby over an erasure—that would prevent any application being made for payment—I made that discovery after he was in custody—I have not been able to find the counterfoils of the banker's paying-in slips—I had seen them on the premises a day or two before the destroying of the papers—at that time Clisby was in custody—I found some papers lying about, and other remnants on a file, some of which I have here, they are somewhat torn—I never saw the banker's counterfoil book again, or the letters that accompanied the four post-office orders that were not accounted for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In some cases, the documents I found on the floor enabled me to collect a debt—I then destroyed the fragments of that one,</p>

               <p>I have others—I have ten or twelve shops in different parts of London—Ludgate Hill was the head-quarters, and supplied all the other shops—the prisoner would see all the goods in and out—he had nearly the whole con<lb></lb>trol of the business—I looked over when I came down, which I did daily—sometimes I was there the whole day—I did not visit the other shops every day—I had the control of the business, the prisoner simply had the receiv<lb></lb>ing of the goods, and sending them out, and the receiving the money, I suppose about 10.000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he did not draw cheques—he endorsed those received, and post-office orders up to 19th October—he generally signed "E. Herbert &amp; Co.," when it was necessary, in the course of business—he did that for nearly the whole three years, thousands of times—I don't think he helped to enlarge the business very materially—I did not hear that he was going into business himself before I applied for the summons—I did not hear that from a traveller who had been in my service—I did not hear it at all—I do not attend sales and purchase on behalf of Mr. Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner never complained that his duties were too much, and that he could not attend to them properly—after Mr. Good came, I never authorised the prisoner to endorse a cheque or sign a post-office order.</p>

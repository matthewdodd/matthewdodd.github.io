I saw the Shirts in the Trunk, and took Notice that it was lock'd, about two Days before I miss'd them; but then I found the Lock burst open, the Shirts were gone, and likewise a Hat out of a Box in the Closet. Two of the Shirts<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170008"></xptr> were found at two different Pawnbrokers, and the Prisoner wore the Hat when he went into Confinement.</p>

At the time in question I was quartered at Woolwich, in Frances-street, in houses rented by Government, and occupied by officers of the Marines—the Go<lb></lb>vernment pay the rent and taxes.

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Royal Marines. On the 8th of November I went to the prosecutor's quarters about ten o'clock and found the prisoner Tyer lying on the top of the area, against the front door, on her back, very drunk indeed—one part of her body was through the gate, partly in the area of the next house, and partly out, with three table-cloths and a pair of trowsers lying within a foot of her, and some might be two feet from her—the front door and private door of the prosecutor's house were both wide open—Tyer was so drunk that she had no senses—I took a light to see whether she was dead or alive—she was frothing at the mouth just as if she was mad—I thought at first she was dead—I looked at her for some time, and then went into the prosecutor's quarters, and on the table there was a small basket with several articles in it—there was a pillow-case marked with his name on it—I left it there, locked the door, and took the key with me, and put a sentry there—when the pro<lb></lb>secutor returned I gave him the key and his property—I went with him to his quarters about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and found the door as I had left it—I had Tyer taken to the guard room—Alexander had come crying to me about ten o'clock, saying, that Tyer had been in Lieutenant Varlo's quarters, and taken out some property, and she went back with me to the prosecutor's quarters—she had been drinking, as she smelt strong of liquor.</p>

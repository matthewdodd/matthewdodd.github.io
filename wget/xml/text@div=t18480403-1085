                  </hi> I live in Providence-place, Lisson-street, Paddington and an in the service of Stephen Finney and Samuel Seal, coal-merchants. I was at their wharf, on the Junction Canal, on the morning towards a barge—he got into the barge, walked along it, and kept picking up coals as he west along; he then went from that barge to another—the elder prisoner was in the stern of the second barge—the boy jumped into the bottom of the barge, and was handing up coals to his father, who had then got into the boat—I went to the boy, and asked him what sort of game he was carrying on there—he made me no answer, but presently his father said, "It is only <hi rend="italic">Doggy"</hi>—that is a nickname they call me—they shoved the boat away, and towed her upon the further said—I went to the station and gave information—we found a lump of coal in the boat.</p>

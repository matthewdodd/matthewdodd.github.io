               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say if you are certain he is the man? - A. I am certain of it; I have no hesitation in saying he is the man; he produced a measure, and asked for a pair of women's shoes of that size; he put his hand into a pair of shoes that I gave him, and he said they were not big enough; then I went to the glass case and got a larger pair; he said, they were to go to Mr. Brandon's, in Tabernacle-walk, a family that had dealt with us a good while; I said, I did not like to send the shoes by him, but I would send my litle girl with them, and I sent her with three pair of shoes; she came back again, I am sure it was not five minutes after; I gave her the purple shoes, and she took them; the child came back direcly afterwards, crying very much indeed, said, mother, the man has run away with the shoes that you gave me, and here is half-a-guinea he has given me; I looked at the half-guinea and saw it was a pocket-piece, (produces it;) the next morning I saw him again at the corner of Union-street, Bishopsgate-street, with a barrow of apples; I did not say any thing to him, but went home and fetched my husband; he went with me; I said to him, did not you rob me last night of three pair of shoes, and he said, go along, woman, I never saw you to my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you are certain the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes, I am very sure of it, by his hair, and being marked with the small-pox; I am very sure he is the man; he is a great deal cleaner than he was then, and he has a different coat and waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Q.Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The man was a stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that came to you, told you he came from Mr. Brandon? - A. No, he did not say he came from Mr. Brandon, he said they were to go to No. 25.</p>

In the morning he took away two shirts, two sheets, and a silk handkerchief; he stopped so long in the room before he went out I suspected him; I went up to his door and peeped through the key hole, I saw him trying the other man's hat upon his head; when he unlocked the door I went into the room, he came out immediately; I went round the room and threw down the blankets, I missed the sheets immediately; I pursued him, he got out of the house before I overtook him; I gave the alarm of stop thief, he was stopped at the corner of Budge row, I saw him stopped, he had the sheets wrapped round him, and the shirts were concealed about him; they belonged to two men that slept in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. When the sheets were taken from about his person did you know them to be yours. - A. Yes, I can swear to them; I have washed them, one is marked, the other is not. When I came up to him, he said he would give me any thing to satisfy me; I said I did not want any thing of him but my own property.</p>

He had given me the two sheets and a shirt before she came up, and he begged I would let him go; he pulled two sheets and a shirt out of his small clothes. I told him I would not let him go; I took him back to Mrs. Talbot's house; Mr. Emmily searched him. The other shirt was found in his coat pocket, and the handkerchief in his breeches pocket.</p>

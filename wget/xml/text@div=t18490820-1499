                  </hi> I live about two miles on the other side of Great Missenden. About the middle of last month I was movving near Uxbridge—on a Thursday evening I was sitting on a bench outside the door at the Standard public-house at Cowley—I had 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and amongst it were three half-crowns, in a purse, in my right hand trowsers-pocket—the prisoner sat on my right side—I walked with her about forty yards—I then came back because they called me and said my cart was ready—I then called for a pint of porter, and went to pay and missed my purse—it was safe half an hour before—the prisoner was then going towards Uxbridge—I went after her with one of my mates—I overtook her just before she got into Uxbridge—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Hey!</hi>"—she said, "What do you want; you want your b—y farthings"—I said, "I want my money, and you have got it, and nobody but you"—she gave me half-a-crown and two shillings and a sixpence—she said, "Here is your b—y money"—I said to her, "Now I want the re<lb></lb>mainder of my money and my purse, and then I will forgive you"—I gave it to the policeman—while she sat with me on the bench, she said she had not got a farthing about her—I have not seen my purse since.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know that tobacco to be yours? - She told me she had taken it from out of one of the hogsheads in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What promises did you make her at that time? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Not any? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>At some subsequent time you did, did not you? - I went up stairs afterwards; she came and set down in a chair, and said, Lord have mercy upon me! I said, pray Mary how often have you taken tobacco? let me know where you have disposed of it; she said, I never took any before, this was taken for a sick person; I said that was very improbable.</p>
               <p>Are you sure, Sir, you did not make her some promises at the time? - Only that I did not know I should take any further notice of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before she acknowledged taking it out of this hogshead? - It was after.</p>

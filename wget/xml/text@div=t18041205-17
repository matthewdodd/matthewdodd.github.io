             sworn. - I am an officer in the Excise: On the 26th of November, they were letting out wines from the bonded cellar of Messrs. Scott and Idle, in Leadenhall-street; it was my part to go down and regage the casks, and to examine the bond; when I came there, I found several casks ready to gage, and pull up; there were several vintners' porters, and soldiers, there at work, bringing the casks forward for the officers to gage at the foot of the stairs; I was there about ten minutes; the master of the vintners ordered all their men up, in order to pull these casks out of the cellar; I observed, about 7 yards further up the cellar, a light with two men, who did not seem to come forward; I got over the casks with the light in my hand to them, and their light went out; whether they blew it out, I cannot say; I turned round, and saw one of the casks leaking very fast from a spile; the prisoner at the bar had his leather apron and buckle on; I asked him what they had been about, and putting my hand between his leather apron and frock, I took out a tin can filled full with wine, (the can produced;) it is a can belonging to the army; I called the officer that was there, and shewed him the can; the cask was then leaking.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you very hard at work that day? - A. I believe there was a deal of wine pulled out that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When there is a very hard day's work, they give them a glass of wine in the vaults? - A. I can say before this Court I never heard of such a thing; I saw the prisoner with the can, and took it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him very drunk? - A. I did not make any observations upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an Exciseman, and make no observations at all; there were many soldiers there? - A. There were, and I found nothing upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several casks with spiles in them - you have heard of such a thing as leaking; who put in the spiles there? - A. I suppose Mr. Scott's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there in the can? - A. Full a quart.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near was the prisoner to this cask? - A. Not five feet from it; he was close by the cask when I took him, it was running very fast.</p>

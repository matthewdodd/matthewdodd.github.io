On Saturday August the 22nd at one o'clock I was coming from the first floor to the shop; I discovered the prisoner with some part of the harness on the bend of his left arm; he was in the act of taking down the bridle and the reins when I called to him; part of the reins was on his arm, and part on the ground. I had passed it two minutes before, and then it was hanging on the pegs. I called halloa, then he dropped it; I ran to the door and gave an alarm to my neighbours. He set off running, and my neighbours took him; he was brought back in two or three minutes. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing removed out of the place except the bridle and the reins. - A. The bridle and reins hung on the place; he took the saddle and the collar, the traces and haims; he left the bridle and reins hung on the peg when I called out to him.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said he took the bridle and reins off the peg. - A. No. I am confident he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q Was this saddle a chaise saddle. - A. I believe it is.</p>

            . I am a carver and gilder, I live opposite Mr. Westall. On the 22nd of August I was standing at my door; hearing Mrs. Westall calling particularly loud I looked towards the door, I saw the prisoner drop part of the reins, I ran after him, he took up Angel-court, I brought him back immediately. I lost sight of him for a minute and a half, when he turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after he first began to run, was it before you took him back to the shop. - A. Not more than six minutes. I am positive he is the man that dropt these things upon Mrs. Westalls alarm and run away.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Situated as I am and impeached with so serious a crime as this, and being the first time I ever was before a court, I am obliged to trouble the court with a written defence. I am a painter by trade. On the day afternoon of the mentioned in the indictment went to Mr. Quin, Angel-court, to borrow a brush which I wanted to use that day; as I went through the court I heard a cry of stop thief; there was a man past me in full speed; at the moment I had not the idea to stop him, if I had it would have been prevented me from being tried, and had I thought I should have been tried for this offence, I would have taken him. I went to the top of the court to see what was the matter; I saw several people, but I saw nothing of the man; therefore I returned to my acquaintances abode. On my return I was met by two men and charged with the theft. This is a simple state of the fact, and I hope your enlightened minds will be cautious if in this great populous city one person is to be mistaken, or to be taken in custody for another. I solemnly declare I never saw my prosecutrix till I was brought to her; nor I never was in her house. Therefore I hope for my acquital, to be restored to my family.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bushnan. At the time that you were pursuing this man, did you find any man running before him, upon the cry of Stop thief. - A. No, that you may rely on. There was another person that went round another way to meet him, as he was coming out of the court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Knight, and live in John's-place, Duck-lane. The prisoner was in our service about three weeks, to look after the children during my absence from home—she had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, but no board—on the 13th of Feb. I left home about half-past six o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was there with my children—I re<lb></lb>turned between eight and nine, and missed her—I also missed a sovereign from a cup on the mantelpiece, a shawl, handkerchief, gown, petticoat and a collar—they were safe when I left home, except the sheet, which I had not seen since the Sunday before—the prisoner was taken into custody on the 12th of March—I have only recovered the sheet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She has given her wrong name, her name is Love; I pledged the sheet on the Monday as I left on the Tuesday, to boy firing; she allowed me none, and I left the ticket on the mantelpiece. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> My name is not Love, that is a nick-name they have given my husband; I can show my certificate; I found no ticket on the mantelpiece; she had put the children to bed, and left them; the youngest not seven weeks old, and the eldest not two years, and that hurt me more than losing the things.</p>

I have a sheet which was given up to me by a person named Burridge, shopman to Mr. Williams, a pawnbroker—the prisoner was given into my custody at Paddington, on the 11th of March—I told her what I took her for—she said she knew nothing of any of the property but the sheet, and that she had pledged at Williams's, in the Broadway, Westminster—she said that her mistress did not allow her any coals, and she did it for the purpose of getting coals to make a fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman. On the 24th of August I was passing through Shadwell with a wagon—Stratton was with me—I saw the Prisoner standing at a door there—I merely laid my hand on her shoulder and asked her how she sold her oysters—her shoulder was covered—the answer she gave me, was, "Three for a penny"—I said they were too</p>

               <p>small—I did not purchase any—I walked away—I did not stop, I should think, half a minute—when I got on from three to five yards I felt a stab in my shoulder—I was walking along—I turned round and saw the prisoner going from me—I heard nothing said—she returned again and made another snatch, I thought she was going to stab me again, but she snatched the blade of the knife out of my shoulder, having at first only got the handle out, it had been separated—my horses were then stopped—I felt very sharp pain indeed—I could not tell how it was—I was almost fainting—I felt as if I was shot—I put my hand up behind and felt the blood—I was taken to the shop door, and the prisoner begged of me to come into her shop—when I went in I said to her, "You have done for yourself," or "you have done a pretty job"—she said she was very sorry, but I had taken indecent liberties with her—I said, I had not—she said if I did not, somebody else did—I had not seen any body near her—I should think there was not half a minute passed between my laying my hand on her should and feeling the stab—she was quite a stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper. I saw the prosecutor and another person in Shadwell, on the 24th of August, and the prisoner near them, at on oyster-tub—she had a knife in her right hand when Webb came up to her—he put his hand on her shoulder, and no fur<lb></lb>ther, and there was a question about oysters—she ran after him and struck him with the knife—that was not a minute after he put his hand on her shoulder—she followed him as quick as she could—I did not hear her say there had been indecent liberties taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Webb on the day in question, and saw him with his hand in the prisoner's shoulder—I cannot say whether her shoulder was bare or covered—he kept his hand there for about half-a-minute—he then came away—she followed him, and a blow was struck—I saw the knife sticking in his neck—I looked back again, and saw the prisoner snatching the knife to get it out—the blade had been left in, and had separated from the handle.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the night of the 28th of April, the watchman came to me; I went with him to a house in Long Acre; I broke the door open, and I and the watchman searched the house; we searched every floor until we came to the top, and in the corner of the back garret we found the two prisoners; they said they come there because they had no money to pay their lodging; I asked them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020063"></xptr>who belonged to the porters knot; they denied it belonging to them. I saw some stones had been taken down, and some lead was taken from the first floor, and the lead all round the sides of the pump was ready to take away, and one grate stood at the door, ready to take away, and three mahogany window blinds were taken down and carried away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a poulterer, and live in Bermondsey-street The prisoner was in my employ, and lived six months in the house—on the 12th of April, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning I was in my bed-room—I heard the prisoner calling "Master"—I went down and found him on the floor in the passage, apparently in hysterics—I moved him into the sitting-room—he remained in the fit some time, till I talked of sending for a medical man—then the fit appeared to leave him, and I asked him what had been amiss—he said the place had been robbed, and he had been knocked down by one or two men, and one man he believed came from the cupboard, and the other he did not know where he came from—I</p>

               <p>found twelve silver spoons removed from the sitting-room and lying in the cupboard, under the stair-case, on a candle-box—I missed a metal watch from the drawer of my desk, two five-shilling papers of halfpence, an opera-glass and a musical snuff-box—a case of stuffed birds were moved from the mantel-piece and was lying on the floor—two squares of glass in the window were broken in the sitting room even with the shop—the shutter was taken down but not at all broken—there was no external violence—a Venetian blind was broken in pieces on the floor—the home was safe when I went to bed over night—I found a screw-driver in the shop that morning, it corresponded with the marks on my desk where the money and watch were taken from—I did not suspect the prisoner—he remained in my service till last Monday—I have a key which opens the drawer under my desk—the policeman produced to me a duplicate key which I kept in a small drawer in the top of my desk, and I missed it from that drawer—I had a good deal of bad money which I had taken for years past, and I missed some of that from a bag.</p>

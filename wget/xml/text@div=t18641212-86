                  </hi>. I am a market gardener, and live at West-street, New Charlton—on 26th November I bought two saddles of mutton of Mr. Salis<lb></lb>bury, of Newgate market—I afterwards saw the prisoner, who is one of the meat porters, and asked him to go to Mr. Salisbury's, fetch the two saddles of mutton, and take them to my cart—I afterwards went to my cart, waited about half an hour, found they did not come, and went back to Mr. Salisbury's shop—I spoke to Ripley the salesman, and then went with him in search of the prisoner—after looking about for an hour and a half I saw him in Warwick-lane, Newgate-street—I asked him what he had done with the chines of mutton I had sent him for—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I said, "You do, I sent you for them half an hour ago," and Ripley, who was with me, said he had been to him and asked him for the meat, and said he had come from Mr. Smith, of Woolwich—the prisoner said he knew nothing at all about, it, he had not fetched them—I said if he did not tell me what he had done with them, I should give him in charge—when he got to the station, he said, "I quite admit that you sent me for them, I went to two shops after them, but could not find them.

I am salesman to Mr. Salisbury, of New-gate market—about 1 or 2 o'clock on 26th November, I saw the prisoner—he came and asked me for two saddles of mutton, for Smith, of Woolwich—I asked him several times who Smith of Woolwich was—he said it was quite right, he was sent by Mr. Smith himself—I delivered two saddles of mutton to him, and placed them on his shoulder—I had seen him before—I knew him by sight in the market—I am quite certain he is the person who came.</p>

            . I live at the next wharf to Mr. Delamotte; my husband's name is Joseph. On the 3d of October the prisoner brought me a sack of oats to my house; I paid him for them eight shillings and three-pence. I have had several sacks of oats, and I always paid for them as they came in; he brought me the price in writing, I said I must have a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you always a receipt when you paid the money?</p>
               <p>M. Jefferson. No; neither should I have asked for a receipt then, only as he brought the price in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to bring the price in writing?</p>
               <p>M. Jefferson. No, my Lord: He went down into the wharf, and brought me this receipt: I believe it to be the same; Mr. Delamotte has had it ever since last sessions.</p>

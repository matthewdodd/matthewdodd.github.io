I keep the King's Arms, Suffolk-street, Southwark—on Thursday, 2d June, between 9 and 10 in the evening, the prisoner came into my house and asked for half-a-quartern of the best rum; which was three pence—I served her—she gave a counterfeit shilling, which my wife took up and broke in the detector into several pieces—I said the shilling was bad, and the prisoner said, "I did not know it; I will give you another one"—she then gave me a good shilling—I gave her the change and she went away—I took care of the pieces of the bad shilling till the fol<lb></lb>lowing Saturday, and then gave them to the constable—I followed the prisoner out of my place, after I gave her the change for the good shilling; and saw her go into Mr. Eyles's, the confectioner's shop, in Blackman-street—I saw her come out, and I went in and spoke to Mr. Eyles—he went to the till, and I saw him take out a bad shilling—we then both went after the prisoner, and overtook her, but by some mishap or other she got away—on the following Saturday I saw her in custody at the police-station.</p>

I work for Mr. Donaldson, a confectioner, of Blackman-street—on 2d June the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a seed-cake—I did not serve her then—Mr. Piggott came in, and in consequence of what he said, I went to the till and found a bad shilling on the top of the other money—on the Saturday following the prisoner came in again—I served her with half a seed-cake—she tendered a counterfeit shilling—I told her it was bad, and that I should give her in charge, which I did—I gave the shilling to the constable with the one I found in the till.</p>

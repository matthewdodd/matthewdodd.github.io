I was charing at Mr. John Brown's, in Upper George-street, Edgeware-road, on the 26th of November—the prisoner and another man called there as dustmen to take the dust, between twelve and one o'clock—I saw the other man take up this grating, which was under the area steps, and put it on the prisoner's shoulder—I told them it was Mr. Brown's, and they said the footman had given them leave to clear all out—I called the footman, who said he had given no such leave, and they must not take it—the footman then went up stairs, and I went into the kitchen—in about a quarter of an hour Miss Holloway and I were stand<lb></lb>ing by the kitchen fire, and saw them taking the grating on their shoulders again—I ran up stairs to tell the footman—he came down, but they were gone, and had left their cart at the door.</p>

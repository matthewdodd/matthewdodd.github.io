            . I am deputy publisher of the Observer Newspaper. The prisoner's office was to count out the papers. I myself take the blank paper to the <placeName id="t18161030-17-crimeloc95">Stamp Office</placeName>

I paid the duty then; the next day I sent the prisoner for them. I believe he brought me back the same numbers, but we don't count them. I then deliver them out to him in quantities to be wetted, and he finishes wetting on the Saturday morning. It is then put up in a cupboard in the press-room, and he locks that cupboard himself. Then when the pressmen begin to print, the two first come to me for the key. The printing goes on with great velocity. The first and last page are first printed at one press, then the third page is printed at another press, and the last page is kept open for the latest intelligence. The prisoner is then employed to count the paper out at the presses, and bring them down to me. Then it is delivered to the different Newsmen who come for it, and I count them out to see that the number agrees with the number that was brought from the Stamp Office. When the paper comes from the Stamp Office it would be smooth, it would not have the appearance of being folded up in a pocket. When it is so counted it is distributed among the Newsmen, The prisoner used sometimes to take out newspapers for Mr. Clements on account of the Office. He would get sixpence for them each when selling them for Mr. Clements, and they would be retailed afterwards at sevenpence, and the penny would be the profit of the retailer. It was not known that he sold papers on his own account; it was not his duty. He had to go a particular round, which was from the Observer Office, along the Strand to Charing Cross: Drury-lane was not in his ward. He lived in Drury-lane.</p>

            . I am one of the pressmen of the Observer newspaper. On the 22nd of September I observed that this sheet had a stamp inlaid. The regular course is for the stamp to be printed on the paper itself. That occasioned in me some suspicion that all was not right. The manner in which we conduct our business is, after the outside sheets are composed, the printers go to the closet where the paper is deposited, and take the stamped paper out as they want it. It is made up into parcels of 250, that is, a sheet is turned down after every 250, which projects. They are delivered to Meyrick, who takes them away when they are finished. He counts them into quires, and delivers them to the publisher. The customers take them away by quires. The pressman has no check against the person who wets. He might put two or three more into every 250. The printer goes printing on as he finds the paper, and does not count. The fly boys have also access to the place where the paper is deposited. I believe it has been the practice to repair sheets at our office when a sheet is spoiled, by taking the stamp from the spoiled sheet and putting it on another sheet.</p>

               <p>Q. But you could not pick up any stamp in the Observer printing room, except an Observer stamp. For instance, you could not pick up a Morning Chronicle stamp? - A. No, not unless it was brought in with some refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. The stamp on the paper you hold in your hand is not an Observer stamp? - A. No; it has been used before, and there is the tyye of another newspaper on it.</p>

            . I am in the office of the Solicitor for the Stamp Office. I saw the prisoner. We had before applied to Bow-street, and procured a warrant for his apprehension. He came to the Stamp Office and surrendered himself voluntarily. I then shewed him the newspapers with the stamps pasted on them. I asked him how he came to have done it? He told me that he certainly did do it, but not with any fraudulent intention. I asked him what he meant by fraudulent intention? for it appeared that one stamp had been torn from a Morning Chronicle, and another from some other paper; consequently the revenue must be defrauded of the duty in those two papers. He said he could explain it in no other way, than that he had received a certain number of stamped sheets from the deputy publisher to wet down for the printers, and after those sheets were printed he was responsible to the deputy publisher for a like number. That in the course of printing off the newspaper a number of copies would be spoilt, and in that case he was required to tear off the stamp, and paste it in an unstamped sheet: and knowing that he was responsible to the deputy publisher for the number of sheets he had before received from him, he would look on the floor of the printing office for stamps which had been torn off spoiled sheets by the pressmen, which he would pick up and paste on unstamped sheets, and the stamps in question must have been stamps which he had so found on the floor, but he could not tell how they came there.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAMBERT, printer of the Morning Chronicle, proved that the transposed stamps had been on a sheet on which the Morning Chronicle of the 21st of September was printed.</p>

            , Esq. I am Secretary to the Board of Stamps. I look at the stamp which has been transposed. It is a genuine stamp for the Morning Chronicle for fourpence; but there is no appearance of discount marked on it, therefore that would not be applicable to a paper. selling at seven-pence, and to which there is 20 per cent. discount allowed.</p>

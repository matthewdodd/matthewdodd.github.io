On 1st Feb., about five minutes to eight o'clock in the morning, in consequence of information, I placed myself in the bar of the Coal Exchange Tavern, in St. Mary-at-Hill, immediately opposite Mr. Wing's residence—I saw Sanderson come in, and Green followed him—he came in front of the bar, and called for half-a-quartern of gin—he pulled off his hat, and gave Green this bag—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she put it under her shawl—I was in my police dress, inside, the bar, but I do not think she could see me—I saw him take another bag from his pocket, and give it her—she put that under her shawl—they then drank up the gin, and went out—I followed them, and took Sander<lb></lb>son, and found five empty canvass-bags in his hat, and this key—I searched his house, and found a number of bags, and some nutmegs, sugar, Spanish juice, four strings of figs, and some ginger.</p>

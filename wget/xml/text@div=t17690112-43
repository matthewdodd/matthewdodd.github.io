            . On the 12th of Dec. at about half an hour past eleven o'clock, I seeing the lad at the bar going from place to place, I watched him. I saw him go up to the prosecutor, and saw his hand in the prosecutor's pocket; and after that I saw him stoop down as if putting something in his breeches. Then he shifted from the prosecutor. As soon as he was gone about a yard, I asked the prosecutor if he had not lost his handkerchief; he felt in his pocket and said he had lost one: then he felt again, and said he had lost two. I said, Come with me, and I will shew you the person that took them. I took him to the prisoner, and in his breeches I found the silk one, and in his pocket the linen one. (Produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

About the 23rd of February, the prisoner came to match a yard of black silk, which she had previously bought a dress of; after she was gone I missed thirteen yards of silk, which had been on the near counter where she had been - I saw the silk at the station, with some ribbons and handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.You are sure she was in your shop about the 23rd of February? A. Yes; ours is but a small shop - we missed silk of this sort, but there may be more of the same sort; it has our mark on it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HORSFORD. This silk was found in the prisoner's trunk.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PRENDLER. I am servant to Mr. Coiney. The prisoner was my fellow-servant; she lived in the family for fifteen years - we generally live in Staffordshire, but we have been in town ten months; the prisoner was in the habit of spending her money in finery - I have seen her buy things of a man who came to the door; I saw her purchase this piece of silk of him - there are thirteen yards of it; she asked if it would make a dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your master here? A. Yes; I swear I saw her purchase a piece of silk of this description of a short man, of a dark complexion - she bought it ten days before she was taken: she paid 26s. for this and some ribbons: it was on the mat just inside the door - the man was there half an hour; I saw the silk in the kitchen - I do not know whether it was measured, but they said there were thirteen yards; I went out and got change for a sovereign for the prisoner to pay for it - she cut this bit off the end of it, before the man went away, to try if it would wash.</p>

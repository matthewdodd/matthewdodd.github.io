               <p>DAVID LIVINGSTONE. I lodge at Mr. Wilson's. The prisoner slept in the same room; I have been there thirteen weeks - he was there before me; I had my money in my chest, which was locked, and stood in that room - I put twelve sovereigns in there on Saturday, the 10th of February, in the foot of a stocking, and missed them on Monday, the 12th - all the twelve sovereigns were gone; another man, named

            . I am a publican. On Thursday last, 15th of Feb., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house with two other men - they had some beer - one of the men went out with the prisoner, and then they came in again - the prisoner had used the house before, and I knew him; he came to the bar, and said to me, "I have saved up a little money - will you take care of it for me?" and gave me nine sovereigns - they were not in any thing; he came on Friday morning, and had one back - he came again on Saturday, and had one from my wife - I produced the other seven.</p>

            . I am night-beadle of Aldgate. I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday, and asked how he came by the nine sovereigns - I held out no promise or threat - his answer was, he supposed he had stolen them - I might take him to the Police-office, or do what I pleased with him - I heard him say at the office that he found them in the room where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to LIVINGSTONE. Q. Was there any silver with your sovereigns? A. I do not know, but think there was twelve sovereigns and 20s. together, wrapped in paper, and put into a stocking; here is the paper they were in - I know it by some figures, and it was given me by Mrs. Wilson, who found it in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I own I picked up the money under my my feet in the room - there were ten sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 19s.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. He lived with us twelve months last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150096"></xptr>August - I considered him an honest man - we do not take in nightly lodgers; nobody but Livingstone, the prisoner, and Harrison, slept in that room - Harrison still lodges with us.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did Perez open the box of cigars? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe with a penknife—he brought them in tied up—they were not opened till he brought them there, though I had paid for them before at his own door—Mr. Pocock was not present, Mrs. Pocock was—the first thing the defendant said was, "Have you a license for selling these cigars?" and the answer was that he was selling them for Mr. Newton—I understood that a person selling for his master did not require a license—his answer was, "No, I have not a license, because I am selling them for Mr. Newton"—that was his answer, to the best of my recollection.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the skittle-ground of the King's Head, Old Change, on 1st Nov.—I went in about four o'clock with Healey and Grant—I remained there about three hours, and was in the skittle-ground the whole time—Grant was there the whole time—I did not keep my eye on him all the time, but I do not think he was out of the ground—Grant and I left as nearly together as possible; I was four or five yards from him—he wished me good-day, and I followed him from the bar to the door, and saw him pass on to the opposite side and go in—we had been having a parting glass be<lb></lb>tween three or four of us—we had been in conversation at the bar about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—while I was with him nobody told him that there was somebody in a public-house selling stolen property—I swear that for that quarter of an hour no one said so to him—there was not a soul in the place, and had not been for ten minutes—there were several persons in the skittle-ground—I sat next him on one side; I do not know who sat on the other</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you play a game of skittles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I did not see him play; I only sat by his side for about three-quarters of an hour—he was sitting by himself—there might have been a dozen persons in the ground; only four were playing—while I was playing, Grant sat on a bench on my left—I will not undertake to say that he did not speak to any one else</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">WILLIAM THOMAS POCOCK</hi>. I keep the Crown and Sceptre. On the evening of 1st Nov. I went to Perez's house—I did not see the search that took place; they would not let me in till the had done searching—I saw the hills produced tor the goods that they took away; nothing was said about them in my presence—I was at the police-station afterwards—I did not hear any statement or charge made by the defendant; I was too late—I had gone to fetch Perez's master, Mr. Newton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Johnson say any thing to you just now, outside the Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To me, Sir? no, I do not recollect—he has not spoken to me within the last five minutes, not about this business—I can hardly recol<lb></lb>lect what he said—he did not say, "Pocock, you must be sure;" I swear that—I think the words he made use of were, that if I was asked respecting the solicitor, it was Mr. Skinner, which I knew before—he did not say I was to be sure to say it was Mr. Skinner—I was to say it was Mr. Skinner, of Apollo-buildings, Walworth-road, if 1 was asked the question, and I said I knew it—he told me to say so—(<hi rend="italic">The Court directed Johnson to be called in, but he did not answer</hi>)—I always understood from the commencement that Mr. Skinner was the solicitor—I understood so from Johnson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant warehouseman to Newton Brothers. Perez is in their employ—I know that he has obtained several cigars from the warehouse for his friends—they were paid for by his friends or himself—there was an allowance made to him, but I have nothing to do with that; Mr. Newton attends to that—it is not a rule in the establishment, but I believe it is with him—I hate been present when he has paid money in that way for cigars.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How were the bills made out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the name of the buyer that he mentioned—they are not always made out in his own name; they are at times—when they are for himself they are in his own name, but when they are for his friends, he states the name of his friend—he does not sell them again; he purchases for his friends, not in his own name—the bills produced are in his name—they are not my writing—he purchases both in his own name and others—I recollect his purchasing in the name of Franco and Bastides, for I have written the invoices myself—the British cigars are 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, and the foreign 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Vincente may be allowed ls. a pound, but I have nothing to do with that.</p>

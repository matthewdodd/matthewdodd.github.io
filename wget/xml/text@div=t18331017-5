               <p>WILLIAM BOWMAN. I live at No. 4, Bevenden-street, Hoxton, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; Mr. Jones's dwelling house is in the same parish; his Christian name is Thomas. On Sunday evening, the 29th of September, about half-past seven o'clock, I was at my own door, and saw two men in the street, occasionally talking together, close to Mr. Jones's house, but on the opposite side of the street; they separated three or four times, and came together again and talked - I don't know either of them; they repeatedly passed Mr. Jones's house one at a time, and then one of them pulled out a watch to see the time, then immediately crossed over to the other side where the other man was, and met him by Jones's door; they were then within five yards of Jones's door - they were both at the door about a minute conversing together, one with his foot on the steps, and the other off the steps - they then parted; the one who had pulled his watch out walked away, and the other entered the house; I saw him put his hand to the door, and he went in, and shut it again- I am sure the door was shut; my house is directly opposite; I afterwards saw a light in the house, in Mrs. Harlow's front bed room, which is on the first floor - this was five or six minutes after I saw the man go in; I could distinctly see one person in the room, holding a light; I directed my son to go over and inform Mrs. Jones, who was in the premises attached to the house, but not where I saw the light; I went myself over to the front door, and knocked gently, and the prisoner came to the door - he had no candle; I said nothing to him; he directly rushed out past me and got from me - I laid hold of him - he hit me a violent blow on the chest, and his hat fell off - he got away; I pursued, and overtook him about an hundred yards off in the street - he was stopped - I was not twenty yards behind him; he ran into a baker's shop, but the crowd was so great round, that I could not get into the shop - I went back to Mr. Jones's house, and saw Mrs. Harlow's apartments - I never lost sight of the prisoner from the time he came out of the house, till he went into the baker's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not rather dark in Jones's house? A. There were two lamps lighted in the street, and it was as light as possible - it was dark in the house; the person inside made a sudden rush very quick - I did not try the door before the man entered, it appeared to me to be shut.</p>

            , JUN. I was in the street with my father - he sent me to Mrs. Jones's - he knocked at the door when I came back, and the prisoner came out; I am sure of him - I saw him hit my father, and he nearly knocked him off the pavement - I saw the prisoner's hat knocked off; he left it behind him, and ran away into Mr. Lloyd's the baker's - I am quite sure he is the man - the street was very light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the door when the man came out? A. About the middle of the pavement on the same side of the way, there was no crowd then - there was a crowd round the baker's shop.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Brookes'. On the Sunday night in question, I was near Jones's house with three more young lads - I saw Bowman go up to Jones's door and knock, and I observed two men come out - the prisoner was one of them I am quite sure; they walked out quickly - I am sure the prisoner was one; I saw him struggling with Bowman; the prisoner's hat was knocked off, and I picked it up and took it to the station-house, and gave it to the inspector; there was one shirt in it marked Kain, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170008"></xptr>separate letters - I marked them before I gave them up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the door when Bowman was struggling with the man? A. On the curb, about a yard from him - I always said the prisoner was the man - I never said I thought he was the man; Bowman's hat was not knocked off; no crowd came up while he was struggling - Bowman hallooed "Stop thief," and several persons ran.</p>

I live within about a quarter of a mile of the place; about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was passing the street, and saw the prisoner and another man talking together in the street Jones's house is in - which is Bevenden-street, they were about an hundred yards from Jones's house; I then went on - I am confident of the prisoner from having known him eight or nine years in the neighbourhood; I returned about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after seven o'clock; (Jones retails beer:) as I returned down the street, the prisoner followed me up very close - I stood and let him pass me, then I went to Jones's to have a glass of beer, that is sold at a back door which goes to the brewery; while there, in consequence of an alarm, I followed young Bowman out as he came and gave an alarm - I went to the front door, and saw a man just come out, and strike Mr. Bowman, and then I saw another come out - I saw the prisoner's hat fall off; the other man got away- I pursued the prisoner after he got from Bowman, and never lost sight of him till he got into the baker's shop - I there gave him into custody; he said,"I am not the man, I was only running as others were;" I said, I was positive he was the man who came out of the house, and that I knew him before, and could not be mistaken - he had no hat on at the baker's.</p>

            . I am a baker. On Sunday, the 29th of September, a little before eight o'clock, a mob of people burst into my shop door, the prisoner was one of them; he had not hat on - I did not know him before; he asked me to let him out at my back door - he could not have got into any street without scaling the walls; I made no reply, and he did not go; I found a policeman at my door - he came in, and secured the prisoner, and took him away; at a quarter after eleven o'clock on the same night, I found a red silk handkerchief concealed between two empty sacks on the top of a full one in my shop - I had seen the prisoner standing there for about a moment; there were six table spoons in the handkerchief, and three castor tops - I took them to the station-house, and left them in the custody of the policeman, No. 21.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the upper sack empty? A. The two were empty - there were seven sacks, and these two were placed on a full sack; they were merely put there out of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Stratford in Essex. On the 29th of july, I was served with a copy of a writ—it was returned to the Palace Court—it was for a debt of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mr. James Spiller was the plantiff—I have not the writ here—the prisoner holds it, and he refused to give it me—I first spoke to the prisoner about it about the 10th or 11th of August—I had received a copy of a writ, and a copy of declaration—I gave them to the prisoner—I told him I was served with a copy of a writ for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I did not owe, and I told him the other paper was a copy of a declaration—I asked him if he was an attorney, he said he was—the reason I spoke to him was, I was going to Mr. Taylor, an attorney, and on my road I met a police-sergeant, who recommended me to the prisoner—when I saw him he appeared by the papers to know where it came from—I told him it was in the Palace Court, and asked him if he could practise, in the Palace Court—he said he could not, there was a limited number of attorneys there, but he told me if I would give him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he would take the declaration out of the office, and put in a plea the next morning—I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I certainly would not hate given him that if he had not told me, and I had not believed that he was an attorney—I saw him again on the Sunday or Monday following—he told me he had not put in the plea, for it would cost 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he would remove it by <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> out of the Palace Court to the Court of Queen's Bench, if I would make the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. up to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him I had no more money then, but I would meet him the next day—I saw him the next day, and he asked me for a sovereign, which I gave him—that was to remove it through the courts it had to go through—I after that received another paper, which I showed him—I told him it was a notice of writ of inquiry of damages which would be executed on the 19th of August—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I showed him this at the Angel at West Ham—he said, "Keep your door shot, and I will meet you at the Palace Court at twelve o'clock on the 19th inst."—I went there on that day, but he was not there—I waited till the Court closed—he never came near the place—on the 20th an execution was seat into my house on my goods—I went to the prisoner a few days after, and told him what had happened—he said he was very sorry for it, he would do all in his power for me, it was through his ignorance of the law, and he would gift me half the money hack—(I think the execution was for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or there-abouts)—I asked him to give me up my papers, that was all I wanted of him—he said he would see me d—first—he would see what position he was placed in—I have searched the roll of attornies, there is no such name as his—I should certainly not have parted with the money on these different occa<lb></lb>sions if I had not believed his assertion that he was an attorney.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop and eating-house at Stratford. I know the prosecutor—I went with him to the Angel-inn, at West Ham, the latter end of August, a few days after all his goods had been taken away—I found the prisoner there—I asked him out of the room, and asked him how he let Judgment go by default, that this poor man should lose all his goods—he said Shean had a good defence, but he was ignorant of the law—he said he would return part of the money—Shean asked him for the papers—the prisoner told him he might go to h—, and do as he liked, he should not <hi rend="italic">give</hi> up the papers, and, more than that, he challenged to fight him before I left.</p>

            , an old Greenwich College man. I was at the trial; he was found guilty and received judgment of death. I am sure that prisoner is the man, he was in the goal seven or eight months: he was pardoned, on condition of transportation for fourteen years. I saw him on board the ship, and have the captain's receipt for the body, but was busy getting the irons off, and did not see him sign it.</p>

               <p>I was sent out of the land; I never received sentence of transportation. I was sent on board; I did not know for what time.</p>
               <p>Question to Stephens. Are not the prisoners informed how long they are to be transported?</p>
               <p>Stephens. We inform them. - When capital convicts are reprieved before the judge goes out of town, we are sure they will be transported: we hear no more of it till we receive the contract. - I said, Jack you go for fourteen years. He said, he did not care, America should not hold him fourteen years, nor two neither.</p>

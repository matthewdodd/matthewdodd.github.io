                  </hi>. I have no occupation—I live at Orchard Villas, 14, Caledonian Road, Islington—about 5 a.m., on 2nd February, I was awoke by my servant and came downstairs and found my house had been broken into, and that the parlour, dining-room, and a little side room had been ransacked, as well as the kitchen and the wine-cellar—the servant's bedroom door had been tied to the stair-rail—I missed two coats, some postage stamps, loose coppers, and this silver ornament—a desk was also broken open, but nothing taken—the silver vinaigrette is the only article I have recovered—the entrance was effected by the side room window—the catch had been put back with a knife from the outside—I was last in that room at 1 o'clock, when I saw the vinaigrette all safe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of High Street, Woolwich—on 7th February the prisoner brought this vinaigrette and said a man of the name of Smith had given it to him—I sent him outside for Smith—he came back and said Smith was engaged—I told him I should detain the ornament—I gave information to the police—the prisoner came the next morning and told me not to give it to Smith if he came.</p>

               <p>

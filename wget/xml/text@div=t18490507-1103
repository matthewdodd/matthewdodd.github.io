I am a corn-porter, at 7, Rose-court, Tower-street. 11 am a widower—the prisoner lived with me as housekeeper for about two years previous to 31st Aug. last—she slept with me during part of that time, but I did not consider her as a wife—she did not do so at the latter part of the time; she had a separate bed and a separate room—on 31st Aug., about eight o'clock in the evening, I was lying down in my room, and my son told me something, in consequence of which I went into my room, and missed a box, which contained the whole of my property, except a few shillings—I about two days before I had seen 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver safe there, and also some silver table-spoons, tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, two silver watches, a silver caddy-spoon, and two silver salt-spoons—the prisoner might have I seen me occasionally go to that box, but I did not know that she knew money was there—on 2d Sept. I received information, and went with Barron, a policeman, to a house in Compass-court, Rosemary-lane, kept by Michael Murphy—we went to a room up-stairs, the door of which was locked—I burst it open, and found my box there—there was no one in the room—Barron took the box to the station, broke it open, and I found my plate there, but the money was all gone; it was chiefly sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and a little silver—I lost sight of the prisoner from 31st Aug, till 20th April, when she came and knocked at my door, and I gave her into custody—I had had handbills printed, offering a reward for her—she lived at my house, but was occasionally missing for a month now and then—I never allowed her to take any of my plate or money—I did not give them to her—she did not tell me she was going before she went.</p>

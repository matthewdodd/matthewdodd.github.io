On the 28th of November, between six and half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop and asked to look at a watch, which was marked five guineas - I shewed it to him; he took it in his hand and looked at it, and then asked to see another, which was marked seven guineas - I remembered his face, from his having been in the shop before, and kept my eye upon him; while I was getting the other watch he called out," Tom, come in and look." I jumped over the counter, he ran out with the watch, I called out stop thief! and pursued him; he and another man ran on the pavement for some yards-the other man turned up a court; I still pursued the prisoner, he ran against a man at the corner of a turning, and I immediately seized him - I never lost sight of him. I did not find the watch upon him-it cost us 4l. 2s. cost price.</p>

I was coming up Chancery-lane, on the 8th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and heard the cry of stop thief; I ran across the way, and pursued the prisoner - He was stopped; he said to the prosecutor, "I have got no watch." I took him back to the shop, and searched him, but found no money on him.</p>

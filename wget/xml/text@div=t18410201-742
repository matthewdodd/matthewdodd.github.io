On the 21st of January I was at a public-house on Smallbury-green—I took out my money to pay for a glass of brandy-and-water—I was separating the sovereigns from the silver—I put themoney on the table—the prisoner was there—he took up two sovereigns, and said, "I shall borrow these," and soon after walked out—I followed him, and asked for them—he would not give me them back—I sent for a policeman, who took him to the station—he attempted to run away once—I was not at all acquainted with him.</p>

I was at the public-house on Smallbury-green between six and seven o'clock—I saw two pieces of money put down on the table—I could not see what they were—they were put down on the table—the moment the prisoner got them in bis hand he held them up, and said, "Gentlemen, you are all witness he has lent me two sovereigns"—I heard nothing before the money was put down—I was but just come in—Mr. Hester said he would lend him from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the last I heard before the policeman came in—the policeman asked us no questions, but the prisoner said he had twenty witnesses that he lent him the money—I was in the room the whole time—the prosecutor did not ask him for the money.</p>

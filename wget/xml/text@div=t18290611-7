            . I am an officer. I was by St. Paul's, and followed the prisoner and another person; on turning round Newgate-street I saw them go close behind Mr. Glyn, and the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Glyn's pocket - I was going to lay hold of him, but a gentleman came by, and I missed my hold; I told the prosecutor to stand still - I followed, and took the prisoner three or four yards off - I observed him putting the handkerchief into his bosom; I immediately took it from him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

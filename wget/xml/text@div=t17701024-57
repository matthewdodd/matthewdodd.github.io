            . The prisoner was brought to Sir John's for uttering bad money; he said he lived near Whitfield's Tabernacle, in Tottenham-court-road. Mr. Rainsford took Gedney to his lodgings, and I took Hodges in a coach to Tottenham-court-road. When we were in the coach, he said, he supposed I was taking him to prison. I put down the window of the coach, and shewed him I was going to Tottenham-court-road. He desired me to take him to prison, and refused to tell me where his house was. I got out of the coach and enquired for his house. A woman at a chandler's shop directed me to the house; it is a corner house in the fields, behind the Tabernacle. I knocked at the door; a woman out of the window asked who was there; I said, Mr. Hodges; she said, she was sure it was not his voice. I then said it was Mr. Gedney; she said it was not. Then I came out in sight (I had stood under the shed before) and I told her she must open the door, She refused it. I told her if she did not, I would break it open. She came down and opened the door; Hodges was with me at the door, concealed under the shed. I asked for Mrs. Hodges; the woman said she was Mrs. Hodges. Noakes, the constable, who was with me, searched her; in her pocket-book<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240037"></xptr> there was half a crown's worth of silver which appeared to be bad; we went into the bed-chamber, and in a drawer there we found 18 s. worth of silver, that appeared to be bad; in the two pair of stairs we found that engine that is in court leaning against the wall, fixed in the block as it is not.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. The 18 s. have since appeared to be good money.</p>
               <p>Bond. There was a block in the room which seemed to me to be answerable for supporting this block and screw. From there we went into the garret; there was a turning lathe; I bid Mr. Noakes sweep off some of the dust, which lay upon the lathe, which appeared to be either brass or silver. I went up into the cock lost, and at the farther end I found this hat full of bad halfpence, (producing them) they are joined together just as they are cast. Hodges said he knew nothing about them. He said that he had a lodger some time before that, and that the engine was his; he said that it belonged to a man near Covent Garden. I went down stairs behind the kitchen; there was a forge with a fire lighted; there was a large trough with black sand in is under the window; there were several frames of wood with screws, which I apprehended were for the purpose of casting.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you the name of the man the engine belonged to?</p>
               <p>Bond. He refused to tell me his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find this piece that seem; to be intended for a shilling?</p>

               <p>Q. Is that an engine to cut round blanks with, by force of a screw, out of flatted metal?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes it is; they might coin with it I believe; but the engine is not quite complete for coining.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the money is coined is it first cut into round blanks?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes. This engine is not quite complete for either cutting or coining; it want what we call a dab and a bolster at the bottom: the metal is laid between them; upon throwing round the fly it throws the metal through the bolster and cuts it; this is what we call the cutting engine, the other we call a dab and bolster.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that, in the condition it is now, without the dab and bolster, a cutting engine?</p>

               <p>Q. It will not now cut blanks?</p>
               <p>Sage. Not now.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Do you consider that as the cutting engine as it is?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes; the dab and bolster are separate and distinct: this is the engine.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Do you call the dab the cutting engine?</p>
               <p>Sage. No.</p>

               <p>Sage. Yes; the dabs are removed as the dies are, according to what you cut or coin.</p>

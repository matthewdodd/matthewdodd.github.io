I am a tailor, of 20, Porter Street, Leicester Square—on Easter Monday, 22nd April, the prisoner came to my shop with another man—the prisoner had a pair of trousers, which he asked me to alter—he mentioned the name of one of my countrymen, who he said he had known for years—he produced a pattern of some cloth, and asked if I would like to buy 5 1/2; yards at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I said "Yes," and he went and fetched it in half an hour—the other man did not come back with him—I bought the cloth—he called again on the Wednesday, and asked if I wanted to buy any more—he had 19 yards left, and he would cut me any length if I did not want it all—I said I did not want to give as much as the first—he said, "I can't very well let you have it for that; it only leaves me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the yard; I bought it in a sale-room"—he went away, and came again on Thursday, and said I could have it for the price I offered, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went and brought it in about an hour, and I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—he said he had a great quantity of it, but he had sold it all—I was charged at the police-court about this—I had the cloth lying in the window—the Magistrate discharged me—I saw the prisoner three days after I was charged at the bottom of Porter Street, standing with a lot of young men, and I went and got a policeman and gave him into custody—he said he had never seen me in all his life—I had not seen him before Easter Monday—I saw him four times in all—I had a person working with me in the shop at the time, and my son also.</p>

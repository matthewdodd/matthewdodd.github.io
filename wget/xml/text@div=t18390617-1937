                  </hi>. I am six years old—I live with my father and mother, in Queen-square, Hoxton. I was out on chimney-sweep day with my little brother William—I took him to the top of the court we live in, to see the sweeps—I do not know what time it was—it was after I had my tea—it was light—while I was standing there the prisoner came up to me—I am sure it was her, I knew her again directly I saw her—she said, "Come with me and I will get you some marbles, and your brother boots and shoes"—the said she knew my mother—I said, "I know you don't"—she said, "Come to Black-horse-fields, and I will give you a large flute," and she took my flute away—I went to Black-horse-fields, which is not very for from the court we live in—she said she lived over the road at a new house—she did not bring me my flute—she took off my shoes and my brother's boots—I had a pinafore on—she did not take that—she took a flannel petticoat—she did not say what she was going to do—she went away—she said she was going to fetch me some marbles—she did not come back with them—I then went home with my brother.</p>

I live at Dagenham, in Essex, with my mother, Ann Thorogood, who is a widow—I manage hex farm for her—the prisoner was a carter in her employ for about three months—on the morning of the 18th of Sept. I gave him direction to take a load of potatoes to the Borough market—I have examined some clover hay which has been produced to me—it is very much like our hay—I would not like to swear to it—we had such growing on</p>

I was on duty at Ilford about half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 8th of Sept.—I saw the prisoner come to the White Hart public-house, in the green lane—he went in at a side door, towards the back of the premises—the house was closed—in three or four minutes he came out again, took a truss of clover hay off from his cart, and took it round towards the back of the premises at the side of the house—I saw him return, and nothing with him—I asked him where he had been—he made no answer—I opened the side door where he had gone, and saw a truss of clover hay there—I asked him about it—he said he was very sorry for it, and he hoped I would not take any notice of it, it was the first time he had taken any there, but not the first time he had had beer left out for him there—I found a glass bottle just close to the truss of clover hay, which had recently had beer in it—there was about a table-spoonful in it then—I took him into custody, and informed his master—the hay weighs forty-eight pounds—there were three nose-bags full of hay besides, and about half a truss of the same quality as that he had left, and a small quantity of loose besides.</p>

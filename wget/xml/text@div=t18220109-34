               <p>MR. ROBERT HANSON. I am a pupil at the London Hospital. I saw the deceased directly he was brought into the hospital, he had a fracture on the scull on the front of the head; we examined him carefully, but did not discover the fracture till two or three days after, but observed a considerable laceration on the head; he did not appear to be under the apprehension of death, a mere fracture in the scull does not always produce death, this fracture was not calculated to produce death - he died early in December, having come in on the 13th of November.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what did he die - A. Of an inflammation on the lungs, we opened him, apparently he had been subject to that complaint, but I have no doubt but that the exciting cause of the inflammation was the fracture on the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you explain that - A. Many external violences affect the lungs, they had been previously afflicted, without doubt; the fracture was remotely the cause - he would have died of the fracture, had he not died of the inflammation. I say so from the observation I made on opening the body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean to say the fracture of the scull, was certainly the cause; for instance, if the fracture was shewn to you, would you say of course, that he must die - A. No; there was a separation of the membrane of the brain when we opened him, which was sufficient to cause his death - he laboured under two diseases, the inflammation caused his death - I cannot say whether it existed before the wound or not. It might have been of much longer standing than the wound.</p>

            . On the 12th of November, the prisoner and him were at my house, after twelve o'clock at night. I let the prisoner and three others in; the deceased came in about ten minutes after - he and the prisoner had a few words, the prisoner said</p>
               <p>"Dick, don't you remember giving me a slap in the face, when I did not deserve it? the deceased said</p>
               <p>"Don't bear malice, forget that," they drank together, and then the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Dick, look out for yourself, for I shall look out for you." Nothing else passed in my hearing; they left the house directly after, within three minutes of each other; they were not intoxicated - the four who came in had two pots of beer, and Dick drank with them, and he had a companion - I do not know whether he drank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did the deceased come from - A. From a club; a man came in with him, and three or four followed. Stubbs and Haines were two of them; the prisoner called for the beer, and asked Needs to drink; Needs did not first speak of the quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the quarrel happened at your house - A. Yes; seventeen months before - nobody endeavoured to keep the prisoner in the room to fight, there was no scuffle - I cannot say which went out first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure the beginning of it was the prisoner asking if he remembered giving him a slap - A. Yes; he said,</p>
               <p>"Look out for yourself," it was not said in an angry way, he did not explain what he meant. I do not know that. I had seen them together after the quarrel. Needs was a lamplighter, and lived in Essex-street, Whitechapel - the prisoner worked at a gas factory, in Goldston-street, and lived in Castle-street, near Essex-street.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I knew Needs. On the 12th of November, I was with him; we came from a club together, we and the patrol Sanson went into the Green Man, public-house, about half past eleven o'clock. When we first went in, I saw three Irishmen standing by the door, with a pot of porter in their hands - one of the three spoke to the deceased, and calling him out, asked him to drink with them. One of the Irishmen said,</p>
               <p>"Do you remember a quarrel which ensued," or something of that sort; the deceased said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you will think nothing of that," the other said,</p>
               <p>"Look out for yourself;" he then left, and I asked one of them to drink. Needs went up stairs, I stopped at the bar door talking, I was in the house three quarters of an hour altogether. I was there a very little time after these words passed. Needs went out before me, I did not see any of them go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Needs come down? - A. No; there were four or five Englishmen, Needs drank with the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a costermonger. On the night of the 12th of November, I was in Castle-street, Whitechapel, about one o'clock in the morning; and saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090019"></xptr>prisoner in the passage of the Green Man, public-house, with a pot of beer in his hand, drinking with another; the prisoner and Needs had some conversation together, I do not know what it was; the prisoner went out with his partner. Needs went out in about half a minute, alone, I and Francis came out of the public-house together after Needs went out, and saw him about twenty-five yards from us, the prisoner and the other man were before him. We saw Needs fall, and the other two run away - at this time, they were not above two yards from him. We pursued them, and sung out Watch! and Murder! he did not overtake them, and returned to Needs, who was with the watchmen, they held him up as well as they could. I went home with him to Catharine Wheel-alley, he was cut on the side of the head and bled very much, I cut the hair off his head, I got a plaster, put it on, and went away; he was taken to the Hospital the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You and Francis were the nearest to him when he fell - Yes; it was a moonlight night. When the alarm was made, three or four more came out of the public-house. The prisoner went out first, and Needs after him, he was going the nearest way home - Catharine Wheel-alley, where he lives, is near Essex-street.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker. I lived in the same house as Need's, No. 24, Catharine Wheel-alley. I was with Hains on the 12th of November in Castle-street, near the Green Man, public-house, in the street, about seven or eight yards from the prisoner; I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Dick come along," a man was with the prisoner. Needs went on following him about forty yards behind in the middle of the street, and they walked by the side of the houses, and when they got to the bottom of the street, I saw Needs fall, the prisoner and his friend were about ten yards from Needs when he fell, and I about twenty yards behind. I ran as hard as I could to have the prisoner and his companion stopped, as they ran off directly; I called, Watch! and Haines called out, Watch and Murder! he was behind me, but did not overtake them, I returned to where the deceased fell, he had been taken away. I saw him at his own house about five minutes after, sitting in a chair between two other men bleeding at the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lived in the same house - A. Yes; since April, I do not know whether he ever saw Needs; Needs had had a very bad cough for twelve months, but sometimes he was quite hearty.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Needs to go out after the prisoner - A. We were all going home; I did not tell him to follow Mahoney; he said,</p>
               <p>"Dick come along," they walked about forty yards before he fell.</p>
               <p>MR. HARRISON re-examined. He only had one blow, that certainly might be occasioned by a fall on the curb-stone, as well as a blow from a stone.</p>

I found him in bed, he lived about one hundred and fifty yards from the deceased. I took him into Need's presence, there was five or six persons in the room; I told the deceased to look round to see if he saw the person, he said,</p>

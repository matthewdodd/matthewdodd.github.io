            . I happened to be a little in liquor, and as I was going up the Strand I saw a woman, who insisted on my going into Marigold Court (I imagine it might be between nine and ten o'clock at night, three weeks ago last Tuesday) and from thence up to her lodgings, where I fell asleep in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the room with you besides the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bentley. I saw nobody there but her. I had my watch when I went into the room, but when I came out, I had it not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in her lodging?</p>
               <p>Bentley. I imagine, from first to last, it might be an hour. I did not go to bed: I was upon it. When I awaked, she was not there. I felt for my watch, and it was gone. After that a soldier came, and told me the prisoner had given him the watch. I went to justice Fielding's, and there I saw it. The prisoner was taken up, and she said to me, if I appeared against her, she should be transported, and beg'd I would not appear.</p>

            . The prisoner delivered a watch to me last Saturday was a fortnight, and desired I would pawn it, but I would not; I had heard the prosecutor say he had lost a watch, so I told my landlord of it, who desired me to get it if possible, that the prosecutor might have it again. Then I went to her, and told her I would pawn it for her, but she would not deliver it to me till we got to the pawnbroker's door. Then I took her by the hand, turned her about, and bid her go along, and carried it to my landlord; it was afterwards produced before justice Fielding, and the prosecutor owned it.</p>

            . I keep a publick-house. The prosecutor and prisoner came into my house and call'd for a pint of beer, which they drank, and wentaway. I hearing afterwards that a coachman had lost a watch, and she had stole it, I desired the soldier Harding to get it of her, that I might deliver it to the owner. He went and got it, and brought it to me that very night. Then I said I would have it advertised, and he should see me deliver it to the right owner. The prisoner came into my house afterwards: I told her I would take her to justice Fielding if she came to my house any more; but she soon came again. Then I took her to justice Fielding, and there she told me where the coachman lived. I went and carried the watch to him, and he owned it directly. Then I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270034"></xptr> Mr. Fielding, and he told me to deliver the watch into the constable's hands, which I did, and desired the constable last night to be here, but he is not come.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went in at the Red Horse, in Exchange Court, to have a pint of purl, and the prosecutor was drinking some hot, so he asked me to drink with him, which I did. Then he asked me where I lived. I said in the Strand. He desired to go home with me, which he did. We had some more liquor, and then lay down on my bed. I said he should not stay without he would give me some money, so he left his watch with me for a crown. I went to this soldier Harding, and asked him to pawn it for a crown; he was with me three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you deliver your watch to the prisoner to pawn?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>

(I lodged up in the two pair) when I went into the room I saw the prisoner sitting on the bed, I asked him what he did there, he said he was sent up to sleep by Mrs. Plumpton; I told him it could not be in that room, it must be in the other; my box I found broken open and all the things were taken out; in the mean time the prisoner ran out of the room with the things under his arm; I followed him, he dropped some of the things on the stairs, and some on the landing place, and when he got to the bottom of the stairs I laid hold of him; I held him till Bly the officer came.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember being sent for on the 24th of April - A. Yes; I went to Mrs. Plumpton's house; I saw the prisoner below stairs, I took him into Jones's room; I saw the things laying on the stairs; I collected them together.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Plumpton said if she had a spare bed I should have it; I went up stairs and went into the room and pulled off my shoes; my prosecutor came in and asked me what I did there, I told him I was going to bed. I went down stairs upon his saying the room belonged to him, he went to the chest and throwed the things down stairs, he held me; and reported it to Mrs. Plumpton; they sent for an officer; I was taken to Tothill-fields.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had nothing in my hand; I saw him drop them as he went down stairs.</p>

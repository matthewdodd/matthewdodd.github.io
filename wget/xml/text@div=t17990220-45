               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Mr. Bazely gave you this note in the usual way of business? - A. He never brought me a note before that I recollect.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. With respect to the situation in which he stood, if 100l. was paid into the house, in specie, would he direct the clerk behind him to make any entry? - A. Yes, he may; in the evening, he makes an entry in his money-book, and if it was specie, he would make an entry.</p>
               <p>Q. And that money goes into his till? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Out of 137l. suppose there was 37l. in cash? - A. He would enter it 137l. and carry out in his money-book 37l. and hand the notes over to another clerk.</p>

               <p>Q.That appears to have been carried to the account of Gilbert, and that entry made by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Suppose 137l. was paid by Gilbert, in the regular course of business, ought not the 100l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200043"></xptr>to be entered in that book? - A. Yes, if they were Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an entry of a 100l. that day? - A.There is not in the ledger.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. If I understand you right, that book is for the entry of Bank-notes? - A. Yes; to take the particulars of Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the other book for? - A. Merely as a check against this: he places the gross amount in the check-book and the account it is to go to, and I call it over to Mr. Gill to see that it is right.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Do you know whether cashiers are liable to make up deficiencies? - A. I do not know what Mr. Bazely might do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know he paid the seven pounds in the case of Denzelou? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You enter the total amount? - A. Yes.(Mr. Gill was called, but, being one of the people called Quakers, refused to be sworn.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are in Esdaile's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a ledger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the entry of the 18th of January to Mr. Gilbert's account - whose hand-writing is it? - A.Mine; I made the entry of 37l.</p>
               <p>Q.How does it stand upon the face of the book now? - A.137l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put that unit there? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You made the entry as of 37l. on the 18th of January? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how it came there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your business to make the entry of the 18th of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Explain at what stage of any transaction it is that you make your entry in the ledger, supposing a customer comes to pay in 137l.? - A. I make my entry directly from the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your entry was directly from the cashbook of 37l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I think you said you thought it was not a figure of your making - are you more clear than you were at the Mansion-house? - A. I confess, when the question was first put to me at the Mansion-house, the ledger was opened immediately, without my weighing any of the circumstances attending it; the question was put to me, will you swear that is not your figure? I did not give a decisive answer; but having particularly observed this figure by a stronger light, I perceived a difference in the colour of the ink that it does not stand with the next figure, which is my own; and another circumstance is, that it is checked by two clerks the next morning; aided by all these circumstances, I think myself able to swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to say, that, in the hurry of business, you did not make that figure? - A. I say, I must be aided by all the circumstances that I have stated.</p>
               <p>Q. I call upon you to say, yes or no, before God, whether you made that figure? - A. I say positively, before God and man, that I did not make it.</p>
               <p>Q.At the Mansion-house, I understood you to say, it was impossible for any man to swear to a figure of 1? - A. I qualified it by the observations I have now made.</p>
               <p>Q. And, with these qualifications, you said, it was impossible for any man living to swear to a 1? - A. I said, at the Mansion-house, it was impossible for a man to be infallible.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, then, will you say, it is impossible to swear to a 1? - A. The circumstance I speak of is, its being checked by two clerks.</p>
               <p>Q.But you still believe it impossible for any man to swear to a I? - A. There are circumstances that are very strong indeed; this figure of I does not stand with the other figure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.If I understand you right, when the book was first produced to you, you were very cautious, and said, it was possible for a man to make a mistake, you thought it was not your figure; but now having examined the book materially, what is your opinion? - A. That the posting has been altered.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen the I by itself, perhaps you could not have sworn to it? - A. I wish to be cautious.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you make your entry from? - A. From the received cash-book. (The received cashbook produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What is the entry in that book? - A.Thirty-seven pounds.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ESDAILE, Esq. sworn. Q. You have the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.From whom did you get it? - A.From one of the other clerks, of the name of Trott. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Dr. Peers). Q. Is that the note that you sent by your young gentleman to Mr. Gilbert's? - A. Yes, I believe it to be the same; my name is at the back of it in my handwriting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Beauchamp). Q. Look at that note? - A.This is the same note that I delivered to Mr. Gilbert.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Gilbert). Q. Is that the note that you received from the last witness, Beauchamp? - A. I am quite clear it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the indorsement upon it? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note that you paid into the banker's, the same note that you received from your master? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Farthing). Q. Is that the note which Mr. Bazely gave to you at the clearing-house, and which was to take up his drafts drawn upon him? - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. What became of those drafts? - A. I gave them to Mr. Bazely.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any sort of inducement held out to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no promises or threats? - A. No; I told him that any thing he might tell us, would not deter us from taking any steps that we might think ourselves bound to follow.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then I will not press it.(Mr. Esdaile proved the firm of the house to be as stated in the indictment).</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. The case on the part of the prosecution being gone through, I feel a firm conviction, and contend with confidence, that nothing that has been proved in this case amounts to the crime of felony; I apprehend, upon the evidence that has been given before your Lordship, and the Jury, that this is neither more nor less, in the most harsh terms in which it can be expressed, than a breach of trust; that this money was paid is clear -</p>
               <p>Court. I am very willing to hear you, but, perhaps, it will be the wisest way to tell you, that the impression of my mind is to take the verdict of the Jury; as to the fact, and as to the law, which Mr. Fielding opened very fairly, I have been turning it in my mind since the trial has been going on, and I shall certainly reserve the case for the opinion of the Judges; if you can go further, I will certainly hear you with pleasure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Certainly not, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Knowing it to be a case of extreme importance to the City of London, that the line should be drawn, and drawn accurately, I think it will be much better than having my single opinion upon the subject, to leave it for the opinion of the Judges, whether they think this man's offence amounts to a felony, or whether it is only a misdemeanor.</p>

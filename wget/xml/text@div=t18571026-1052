                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, in the employ of Messrs. Leighton and Co. On 29th Aug. I was engaged in binding some books for them—about 5 o'clock that afternoon I left the premises safe, leaving the books there—on returning, on the following Monday morning, some books were gone, value twenty guineas each—there were two copies of these—the pre<lb></lb>mises are covered with a skylight—that had been broken, so that a person could get in and out—on leaving on the Saturday night, the glass was entire—I left at 5 o'clock.</p>

On the Monday morning I went to Mr. Leighton's premises—I found the skylight broken, and on the roof were footmarks—I traced them to the next premises—a person from those leads could get into Mr. Leighton's warehouse—I found some marks of boots on the dust bin—I compared the marks which I saw with a pair of boots which I procured with a duplicate which was found on the prisoner—I took the boots to the prisoner, and he said that they were his—here is one of the boots, which has three nails on each side, and a vacancy—the scratches corresponded with these nails—I got these books from the prisoner's brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an oil and colour shop in Shoe Lane—there is a leaden flat over my parlour, by passing over which a person could get to Mr. Leighton's premises—the prisoner's brother lives on my premises at the top of the house—on Saturday night, 29th Aug., about 10 o'clock, I heard a noise of some person on the flat—I raised the skylight, and inquired who was there—the answer was, "Me"—I lighted a candle, and went and looked out, and said, "Who is there?"—the answer was, "It is all right, Mr. Procter; it is only me "—I imagined the voice to be the prisoner's—I knew him by seeing him come there repeatedly—I was quite familiar with his voice—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minute afterwards I saw the Prisoner come down stairs, and go through the shop into the street—he had been in the habit of coming every two or three days to his brother's.</p>

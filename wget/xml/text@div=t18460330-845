                  </hi>. After my premises had been somewhat repaired, on the 1st of March, I again opened my business—on Wednesday the 11th of March, about ten o'clock, I was in the shop, and a customer came in for some wood—I sent down for a bundle—when it was brought up it was partly burnt round the sides—I remarked that it was very strange, but it did not exeite my suspicion till a subsequent day—I had ordered the wood in, and it had all passed through my hands—it did not then exhibit any burnt appearance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's brother—on Wednesday the 11th of March, about ten o'clock, my brother showed me a bundle of wood very much burnt round the sides, and said it was very strange—the prisoner was standing by the bread shelves at the time—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the room, and he said to me, "Alfred, there has been a fire in the cellar"—I said, "Oh nonsense, it is ridiculous to say that, it is not possible"—he said, "Oh yes there was, and I and <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> (meaning Richard Williams) got some water, and put it out"—I afterwards got a candle and went down into the cel<lb></lb>lar to break soda—the prisoner followed me—I said, "Where is the fire, I do not see it?"—he said, "Oh yes, there it is," putting his hand on the wood—I then moved away a few of the bundles of wood, and met with some paper, which I think was tea paper—I took it up, and said, "Thomas, this is very strange, how came this paper here?"—I do not know that he made any par<lb></lb>ticular remark in reply to that—I said, "The best thing we can do is to inform my brother of it, and he will examine into it"—he replied, "Oh dear so, we had better not tell your brother of it, for it would do no good, and only create an unpleasantness"—I was foolish enough not to say anything to my bother about it.</p>

On Wednesday, the 11th of March, about eleven o'clock, or half-past, I was at Mr. Bell's—the prisoner sent me down into the cellar for some sawdust—I had no light with me—I did not then see any signs of a fire—I went to my breakfast—about five minutes after, I was in the room and heard him call out from the cellar, "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, go and fetch some water"—he was looking at some fire which was smoldering, and stamping on it—I opened the flap door and gave him the water down—I got it from the yard—he said, "I should like to know who has done it?"—he told me to shut down the trap-door, and go on serving—there were two customers waiting in the shop—he afterwards came up and said, "I should like to know who has done it, but you need not say anything about it"—I saw a candle in the cellar lying down by his side.</p>

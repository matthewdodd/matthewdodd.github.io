            . I am servant in the house where Mr. Digby lodges. Thompson delivered the coat to me, and I put it in the one pair of stairs room, it is a private house, and we have no other lodgers. The area gate is left open in the day-time. The coat was missed on the 5th of December, I saw it again at the office on the 12th. I am sure that it is the coat that Thompson gave me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AMES. I am Mr. Perry's errand-boy. I brushed the coat and tied it up in the handkerchief. I saw it again at the Police-office, and I am sure it is the coat I gave Thompson for Mr. Digby, it is worth 2l.</p>
               <p>HYAM HYAMS. I live in Dean-street, Westminster, and am a dealer in old clothes. The prisoner brought the coat to me on the 4th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, she wanted 1l. 10s. for it, thinking it worth much more, I asked her how she came by it; she gave me two or three different accounts, and I told her I suspected it was not her own, she said if I went home with her, she would convince me of it; she took me to Duck-lane. I offered her 1l. for it, and she said she would take it, I told her to send to my house for the money. I went for Pace, the officer, and told him, and he took her into custody as she was coming to my house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PACE. Hyams came to me, and I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of Dean-street, she was standing at the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I deal in clothes, and bought it of a man at the corner of Burton-street, for 1l. 5s.</p>

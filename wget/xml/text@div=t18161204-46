The moment I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040026"></xptr>got it half on he ran out of the house, and my friend followed him and brought him back.

            . I am a solicitor's clerk. I and Mr. Paddon had been spending the evening with some friends until three o'clock in the morning; in our way home we went to the Britannia Coffee-house. The prisoner entered into conversation with us, and asked the prosecutor for drink, which he gave; it was about six o'clock. The prosecutor took out his pocket-book to pay the reckoning; the prisoner was sitting by, and could plainly see him do it. His pocket-book fell down, he picked it up, and put it in his pocket. We went into another room to have some meat, and the prisoner followed. I was laying my head on the table, I looked up and saw the prosecutor with his coat off. The prisoner took the coat up to help him on with it, and as soon as he had got his arms partly into it, I saw the prisoner take a pocket-book out of the side pocket and run away. I pursued him, and took him between the stalls in the market; he offered me the book and money if I would let him go; he gave it to me, and tried to get away; I told him to beg the prosecutor's pardon, and he should be forgiven. I only told him so to get him secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did he not pull off his coat to fight, and challenge you to fight-A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable. About ten minutes after six o'clock the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge, for stealing his pocket-book. I took him into custody; the prosecutor gave me this pocket-book.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the coffee-house when the two men came in; the prosecutor was drunk, and offered to play any body for 5l. He sent me out of the room, and called his friend a d-d thief. He came to me with the pocket-book, and said I was a thief. He went to the house, and sent his friend out, saying, I had stolen his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Jury to MASTERS. You was very sleepy, and you saw him take the pocket-book-A. I did; I was sober, but the prosecutor was in liquor.</p>

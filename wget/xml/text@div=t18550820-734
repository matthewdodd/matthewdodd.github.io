                  </hi>. I am inspector of police at Uxbridge. I saw the prisoner there on 2nd August—he had a horse with him—he was offering it for sale to a man, named George Littlepole, whom I knew to be a house dealer—he went into the stable at the White Hone, and he came out, shook the chaise, and said, "The chaise is worth the money"—Littlepole said, "I will give you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—the prisoner said, "No; there is a gentle<lb></lb>man has offered me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; if you will give me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you shall have it"—I asked him where he got it, and what his name was—he said, "George Bingham, Esq., Lodge, Bromley"—I said I did not believe him—he said it was his brother's horse and chaise, who was a laceman, at No. 133, Fleet street—he afterwards said that was not his name, but he should not give the proper name—he wrote the name of George Bingham on a card—he said, "I hired the horse and chaise in Hayes'-mews, near Mount-street, but I intended to take it back again—I gave him a card, which I wrote myself "George Bingham, Esq., Lodge Bromley, Kent"—I found on the prisoner some papers and a false moustachio—he said, "The reason I wanted to sell the horse and chaise was to get the money, to go to Scotland with my wife."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am the son of an innkeeper, and have held an inn myself for three years, in Essex; having on 1st Aug. received instructions respecting an inn at Uxbridge, I went to witness on 2nd Aug. to engage a horse and gig; he asked if the chaise would do; I said, "Yes;" I engaged it for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; when I arrived at the White Hart, Uxbridge, I was standing in the stable; a gentleman passed a remark on the weather, and he said, "You have a thorough bred horse there?" I said, "Yes, I think he is;" he asked the price; he said, "Is it 100 guineas for him and the chaise?" I laughed and said, "I don't think the owner would mind receiving such an offer;" a short time after a dealer came in the yard, it being market day, and some of them sent the young man whom I took with me, into the house for me; I went out, and the dealer called me into the stable, and said, "Are you in<lb></lb>clined to sell the horse and chaise?" I said, "Certainly not, it is not mine to sell;" he said, "Excuse me;" I laughed, and said, "It is granted;" I was about to order the horse to be put in the chaise, and the dealer came a second time, followed by the inspector; he said, "Let us see the horse walk up the yard," and to gratify his curiosity, as I thought, I led it across the yard; he said, "I have just sold my two horses, if you like to take twenty guineas, here is the money;" I repeatedly refused it, and told him that we could not deal; I might have said I would take twenty-five, thinking he was still joking; the inspector then came forward, and I believe I gave him some very indirect answers to his inquiries, believing him to be one amongst them, not knowing he was an inspector, which caused him at once to detain me, and before I could be allowed to tell him all about it, the superintendent was sent off to London to inquire where the horse came from; this is the first offence I was ever charged with in my life.</p>

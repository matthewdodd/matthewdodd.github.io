About a few minutes past 3 o'clock on the morning of 28th July I heard a rattle, looked round, and saw the prisoner on the roof of 195, Upper Kennington Lane—I heard and saw the constable knocking at the door at the time; he knocked ten or twelve times while the prisoner was on the roof—he was standing still, close by the chimney-stack, with a writing-case and cash-box under his arm—I called to him twelve or fourteen times as loud as I could halloa—there was nothing but the knocking to interfere with the sound of my voice—he made no answer till I had called twelve or fourteen times; he then came and looked over the parapet—he had on a high hat, a dark coat, trousers, red necktie, tied in a knot, night shirt, and slippers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, attached to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—on 28th July, about 3.20 in the morning, I went with the engine to the house in question—on arriving there the back door had been opened—I broke open the front door, and went in that way—I found a great body of fire in the back part of the shop, on the left of the front door; it was a quantity of toys and things burning in a pile, as though they had fallen down on the floor—I assisted in extinguishing it—that fire did not appear to com<lb></lb>municate with any other fire—as soon as the fire was sufficiently extinguished I searched the house to see if there was any one in it—I found there was not, and then made my way down stairs—I found fires burning there in the floor underneath the shop—there was a fire burning under the dresser in the back kitchen; it was a quantity of material, something like rolls of paper—there had been a good body of fire there; it extended to the dresser, which was partly consumed; it had not touched the flooring—that, was quite unconnected with any other fire—I went from the back kitchen into the front—I found the flooring had been broken away, and I found a small fire in the centre along by the dresser, between the passage and the fire<lb></lb>place; that had been very slight; it appeared to be from the old flooring—I found about half of a newspaper, which appeared to have been forced under the flooring after it was broken away; that was about a foot from where the fire was—that was quite a distinct fire—there was no fire there then—there had also been a fire on two chairs, standing close together, in the front kitchen; that was some linen stuff, or some material which, I believe, was</p>

               <p>used for dressing the dolls, cuttings from the dresses—there was no great quantity—that was on fire at that time in each of the chairs—that was another distinct fire—I afterwards discovered a hole in the ceiling of the kitchen—in making my way to the stairs I found another fire under the coal-cellar door—there was a small hole in the flooring, and the fire was burning in the hole, burning the flooring and the bottom of the door as well—I could not see that there was any material there, anything beyond the wood that was burning then; it was not connected with any of the other fires—I should think it was 6 ft. or 8 ft. from the kitchens—I made a further search in the shop, and found there had been another fire in the right-hand corner—it was a quantity of paper, that appeared to be used for wrapping up the goods in; but that had evidently burnt itself out—I saw the paper ashes—that was not connected with any other fire—it was quite at the opposite side of the shop from the other fire—I afterwards discovered a fire in a drawer between those two used for keeping goods in—that fire had been very slight—something may possibly have dropped in there—I found nothing else on the ground floor—I think I have now described six separate fires—there was nothing above but the heat up the staircase—after the fire was extinguished I asked the prisoner if he could give me any idea as to the cause of the fire—he said he could not—I asked if he could ac<lb></lb>count for the fire in the back part of the shop—he could not do that—I pointed out the other fires, and said it looked very suspicious, there being so many separate fires—he said he could not account for it, no further than he had had the sweep, and he mentioned something about the front kitchen chimney, whether it might have been caused from that—he said a fire had occurred there in the afternoon, and he had called a neighbour in to help him put it out—he pointed out the place to me; it was close to where the fire had been in the front kitchen, near the dresser, where the hole was—there were marks of fire about the hole, and also on a part of a packing-case that was standing up by the side, leaning against the dresser—I noticed some paper put up before the front kitchen window as a blind—I asked him why it was there—he said that the servant-girl had put it up to keep the boys from looking in at her—the gas-pipe in the back kitchen was melted—the gas could not have been on, or I should have smelt it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police at Kennington Lane—I went to the house about 3.45 on the Sunday morning—I made a careful examina<lb></lb>tion of the premises—in the back kitchen there had been a fire underneath the dresser; the whole of the inside of the dresser was completely burnt; the drawers were entirely consumed; the legs were partly burnt through, also the table of the dresser; a large roll of carpet that lay on the dresser</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190085"></xptr>
               <p>was burnt through three or four folds; there was a large quantity of what appeared to be rags and burnt paper under the dresser; on the opposite side of the kitchen there was a packing-case full of paper and wood, such as would be used in the business, portions of packing-cases broken into small pieces; there was no fire about that—in the front kitchen near the dresser opposite the windows the flooring was broken up about 6 feet in length and two feet in width—a portion of that flooring had been on fire and a portion of a packing-case that was placed edgeways was also burnt; it was leaning one edge against the dresser and one over the hole where the fire had been in the flooring; the side against the flooring was burnt—I afterwards made a further examination of the flooring, and found that it smelt very strongly of some mineral oil, which I thought to be paraffin; I produce some of the pieces, it smells now—there were two chairs on the opposite side of the room behind the door, in each of which there was an appearance of fire; one of the chairs was charred, the other did not appear to have been touched ex<lb></lb>cept that the paper and rags that it contained were partly consumed—near the chairs were three boxes standing containing paper and wood, the sort of boxes that dolls would be brought in and used in the business; they con<lb></lb>tained a large quantity of paper and wood—one of them contained a portion of another box that had been used for a collection of shells; the shells were on it; that was broken up—there was also a hassock filled with shavings; these were standing near the chairs, nearly touching them—there were also three pieces of packing-cases extending from the chairs into the passage, and to a door at the foot of the stairs; they were very long, about 8 or 9 feet in length, all three lying together; there had been a fire there, but it was then out; one of the boards was partly burnt—inside a closet under the stairs there was a large quantity of paper, and a portion of that door was burnt; that was all on the basement—at the shop door, the passage leading from the stairs there had been a fire; it appeared to have extended both outside and inside; it was rather a considerable fire, as if the door had been burnt through; the door was entirely gone; the materials there were dolls and toys, and there were the ashes of a considerable lot of paper and rags for dressing the dolls—the ceiling of the shop was broken through, leaving the rafters and laths exposed in two places and in the passage outside the shop; one of the holes extended right up to the door I have spoken of; that ap<lb></lb>peared to have been done recently—in the shop at the right hand corner opposite the front door there had been a fire; a large quantity of paper, folds of paper that had apparently burnt itself out; it was perfectly dry, and did not appear to have been touched with water—going up stairs the framework of the staircase window had been on fire, but I concluded that was from the heat of the fire in the passage; the banisters were very much scorched, charred in some places—I am positive there were six distinct fires that could not have communicated with each other, and in addition to those there were others which might or might not have communicated—in the second floor front room the prisoner showed me his bed, which had ap<lb></lb>parently been laid in; the trap door was open, and a child's cot was placed on end which formed a sort of ladder, and from there I got on to the roof—I found a dressing-case between the roof and the ceiling, between the two traps—during this search I spoke to the prisoner; in fact, I asked him to accompany me during my examination—I asked him what time he went to bed—he said about 12 o'clock, and he had not heard anything until he was aroused by the police springing the rattles and knocking at the door, he</p>

               <p>then made his escape by the roof, finding the house was on fire—I asked him if there was any one else in the house at the time—he said no; his wife and children were away, having been ordered away by the doctor for their health; his father-in-law, who lived with them, was also away on a holiday, and the servant did not sleep in the house—I then told him that the circumstances were so suspicious that I should consider it my duty to take him into custody for setting fire to the house and its contents—he had a brown paper parcel with him and a cash-box—I asked him what they contained—he said the lease of his house and also the policy of insurance——this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the policy; it is for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the London and Liverpool Globe Office, dated 17th February, 1870; 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on stock in trade, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on furniture—he said the whole of the furniture did not belong to himself; the furniture in the room which we were then in belonged to his father-in-law, and also other furniture in the house—and he said his father-in-law was insured in some other office, but he did not know the name, for, he thought, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had on his night-shirt, boots, and neck-tie, his hat was on the table—on a further search I found this two-quart tin can containing paraffin, in the cupboard in the front kitchen—when I told the prisoner I should charge him, he said he knew nothing about the fire; and at the station he said he could satisfactorily account for it he felt confident—he gave up a purse which contained these four duplicates of property pledged on 24th, 25th, and 26th July.</p>

I live at 67, Broad Street, Lambeth—for about six months before this matter happened I went backwards and forwards to the prisoner's house as servant—I went between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and left about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening—his wife and two children lived in the house, and Mr. Scroby—the wife and children went away a week before the fire, and Mr. Scroby went on the Tuesday morning—on the Saturday, about 3 o'clock, the prisoner sent me to his sister's in the Cam<lb></lb>berwell Road to take a letter—I got back about 4.40—I went down into the kitchen to make the kettle boil, and then set the tea things—after tea I went down stairs, and remained there about an hour—I cleared up the kitchen—master said he would go down and see if the fire was out—he asked me when I came back from Camberwell if I had left the kitchen all right—I said "Yes"—there had been a fire while I was away—while he was down stairs I was in the back parlour to mind the shop, and I heard a noise down stairs—I called to him and asked what he was doing—he said "I am pulling up some of the boards"—after he came up he told me to go home, and I did—I did not go down into the kitchen again—when I went to Camberwell there was a fire burning in the grate, but none in the boards—when I came back there was no fire in the grate—I lighted it to make the kettle boil—it was not burning when I came up stairs to mind the shop—I let it go out, and cleared the grate before I went away—I saw no appearance of fire then—there was a packing-case standing up in a corner against the fire-place—it was not against the dresser—there were no laths pulled down in the ceiling in the kitchen or in the shop—I did not notice—there was a packing-case standing against the window in the front kitchen, not against the hole where the boards had been pulled up or leaning against the dresser—I did not notice any packing-cases or strips of cases standing against the chairs or leading from the front kitchen to the cellar-door—the chairs were all four against the window—there were no boxes or papers standing against the window—Inspector Hoskinson afterwards showed me the places in the ceiling in the shop—I had not noticed those before—I don't think they were there before I went away—the prisoner used gas and paraffin caudles—he did not use a paraffin lamp—I did not know that there was any paraffin in the house—I did not put up any newspapers in the kitchen window—master told me he was going to put some up so that the children should not look in—I did not ask to have them put there, and did not notice whether they were there when left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had spoken to my master about the people looking in—he did not put up the papers then; I suppose he did afterwards, but I did not notice—there were packing-cases in the kitchen—I don't know what they contained—I used bundles of wood to light the fire—they were kept in the back kitchen in a corner against the fire-place—the packing-cases were not cut up for fire-wood—I did not chop any up—I used some wood that was different from the bundles—there was a dresser in each kitchen—paper and other materials were kept under the dresser in the back kitchen for the purpose of lighting the fire—the mistress was ill, and went away the week before with the children—the doctor came to see her—the father-in-law had not a lamp—he attended to himself, I did not wait upon him—the shop was open when I went away between 7 and 8 o'clock</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate was read as follows</hi>: "In the afternoon I found a fire in the kitchen-floor, which is a very rotten floor, having at least a dozen holes besides the hole which Mr. Parker saw where the fire had been. The boards leading from the one where the fire was to the door where the Inspector has mentioned seeing the paper, is one mass of dry rot; it extends to nearly the whole of the kitchen. After Mr. Barker left, I pulled up the two boards, so as to be perfectly safe with fire, and I saw no traces of it. I poured four buckets of water; I also moved the packing-cases from where they had been standing two months, and put them up against the wall, further from the fire, so that they might be out of the way in case the fire should smoulder and light again. I did this before the servant went home. I also moved some of a collection of shells to a chair, and covered them with newspaper to keep the dust from them. A parcel of cuttings of dolls' dresses were in the chair adjoining, they were placed against the wall farthest from the fire-place, a bare wall I put a sheet of newspaper across the window, because the girl had complained to me of boys looking down into the kitchen. I must have left one piece of board standing against the dresser. I saw nothing more of the fire till I heard a knocking at the door. I jumped out of bed and smelled smoke. I went down in my night shirt to my father-in-law's bed-room to awake him, but as I entered the room I recollected that he was not there. I took his writing-case and ran up to the top. I knew I could not get out at the window. I took my lease out of the drawer and my cash-box, intending to throw them out of window. I got out at the roof, and got some of the things out, but the smoke came up so strong I could not get them all. I called out 'Fire! Police!' Before this I had heard the rattle. I hastened to the parapet. Mr. Parker called to me, and I got through his trap-door. While I was waiting on the roof I put on my coat and my socks. I went to the back of the house and saw the blind was on fire, and as soon as I could get in I went into the shop with my cash-box. I went to bed at half-past 12 o'clock. We have never used paraffin since I have been in the house. I wish to add I was on the roof after I had called 'Fire! about ten minutes, during which time I put on my clothes."</p>

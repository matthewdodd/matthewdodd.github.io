I asked him whether he owned the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190016"></xptr> horse, he said, yes. Upon which, I took hold of him, and said, the horse was mine. He was very much surprised, and said, he bought him at Potton fair, which was on the 28th. I charged a constable with him, and took him before my Lord-Mayor. There he said he bought him between Biggleswade and Eaton, but could not tell of whom. He had my neighbour

            . I missed my mare the same time Mr. Weed did his. I went with him in search. We found them both in Smithfield. I heard the prisoner say he bought them both between Biggleswade and Potton, in Bedfordshire. I lost three horses that night, and in going home from London found one of the others, which had fell lame, and was left by a person at Storton, near Kimbolton: the other I have not found.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Storton from where you live?</p>
               <p>Richards. It is about 14 or 15 miles.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Potton from you?</p>
               <p>Richards. That is about 30 miles, and Smithfield is about 80.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Potton in the road to Smithfield?</p>
               <p>Weed. It is not. It may be about 7 miles out of the way on the left hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I bought them both going to Potton fair, between Biggleswade and Eaton, at a little town called Wymouth, as I was coming home from Huntingdonshire. I live in London, and have dealt in horses some time. The man I bought them of, came from Finden, in Northamptonshire, and his name was John Brown. I gave him 4 l. 16 s. for one, and 40 shillings for the other. Here is the receipt, (producing one signed John Brown.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Weed. Did you see this receipt before?</p>
               <p>Weed. He produced it before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any time to get this wrote between the time he was taken up, and going before my Lord-Mayor?</p>
               <p>Weed. Yes, he lay in the Compter one night before he was before my Lord.</p>

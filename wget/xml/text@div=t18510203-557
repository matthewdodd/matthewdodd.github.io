                  </hi>. I keep the Exeter Hall Hotel, Strand. In the commencement of 1849, the prisoner was in the habit of dining there occasionally—on 12th May he called and ordered two bottles of sherry and some sandwiches—he owed me some money, and that order made it 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he produced this check for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked me if I bad any cash to spare—he said, let me have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I will call on Monday morning for the difference—I gave him half a sovereign—it was a crossed check, and he asked me what bank I banked at—I said, "The London and County"—he said, that is rather strange, I bank there myself—he did not call on roe for the balance—I saw him several times afterwards in the streets—I took the check to the bank, it was returned to me across the counter.</p>

               <p>him the whole amount—a man named Pulling, an old friend of his, called on me for the check, and I let him have it—he told me he wanted it to oppose him in the courts—I did not let him have it with a view to pro<lb></lb>secute him for forgery—he sent a man for it, and I let him have it—Mr. Puling and Martin called on me—I do not know that Martin is an attorney who has been struck off the rolls—I have been told he is acting as solicitor for this prosecution—he was here just now, but I do not see him now—I do not know of his being an old associate of the prisoner's; or of any quarrel between them—I was not aware they were even acquaintances—I am not paying Martin for this prosecution—I do not intend to do so—I am bound over to attend—if he is to be paid, it is by somebody else, not by me—he said the prosecution should not cost me anything if I would prosecute him—I did not know till a short time before the prisoner passed through the courts that he had a clerk named Chardin—I learnt that from Mr. Pulling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 10, Prospect-place, Old Brompton. I have known the prisoner about eight years—I have seen him write—I have received letters from him, and am perfectly acquainted with his writing—I have no doubt the whole of this check is his writing, signa<lb></lb>ture and all, except this "state on what account drawn," in the corner—I know that in Dec. last the prisoner applied to the Insolvent Debtor's Court—I was in attendance, and opposed him—I called on Mr. Dickenson on 19th Dec; he was not at home—I wrote a note for the check, and sent it by my man—while the prisoner was under examination at the Insolvent Court I asked him if he had received a check for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a person named William Chardin—he said he never did—I asked him if he knew such a person—he said he did not—I then handed this check across to him, and asked him if it was not in his writing—he said it was not—I asked him if he knew Mr. Dickenson, of Exeter Hotel, Strand—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had given that check to Mr. Dickenson—he said, "No, I tell you I have never seen it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you learn that Mr. Dickenson had the check? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Mr. Dickenson—on my oath it was not from the pri<lb></lb>soner; he never said anything to me about it—it is Mr. Dickenson of course who is defraying the expense of this prosecution, it is not me—Mr. Martin is the attorney, Mr. Dickenson has paid him; I went with Martin to Mr. Dickenson; I cannot tell you what passed—I do not intend to defray any of the expenses; he is not a friend of mine, he is a customer—he was in court just now, but I do not see him now—I have not offered to pay the expenses if Dickenson would come as the prosecutor, or said I would take care he should not be put to any expense, to my recollection—I never understood that there was any expense—I have not offered to hold Mr. Dickenson free from expense in this matter—Mr. Martin was introduced to me by the prisoner; he was not a cast-off clerk of his, that I am aware of—I never saw him in his office as clerk; I have seen him writing notes there of his own, as I suppose—I had some sherry and sandwiches; it was on a Sunday morning—I cannot tell whether it was this sherry and sandwiches—the prisoner owed me 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think it was—6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was money lent, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for clothes, and the rest for the lawyer; it</p>

On the 23d of May, I was called down, and missed this carpet from the window, and was told the thief was gone along the Strand. I ran out and took the prisoner in Catherine-street, about two hundred yards off, walking with it on his shoulder. Being a remnant it is only worth about 38 s. He said a man gave him 6 d. to carry it. I find he bears a good character.</p>

            . I was working at Mr. Hart's, and saw the prisoner pass the door about eleven o'clock in the morning; he came in at the door to look at a beautiful table which was there - I did not suspect him; he saw me and went away. I went behind a partition to remove some things, and in half a minute returned and missed the carpet from the window. A woman came to the door, and said a man had taken it. I called Mr. Hart, and we went in pursuit, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Catherine-street; he was taken with it. I asked how he could think of doing such a thing when I was so near; he said a man gave it him at the corner of Waterloo-street - I said I knew better, he then said it was his first offence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Beard, who is under sentence of transportation for having a letter concealed on his person. He was in the Post-office twenty years, and was transported for life—I live at No. 45, Gifford-street, Hoxton—the prisoner Allport came to my house to act as servant to Mr. Johnson, the other prisoner—he lodged with me about seven months, up to the 9th of May—Allport came to look at the lodging and engaged it—Johnson came the same evening and took possession—Johnson remained at the lodging—Allport brought a carpet bag, and fetched him some beer the first night—she came afterwards to light his fire and attend upon him every day—the room was furnished—I missed some things out of it on the 9th of May—but I had before that missed out of my own apartments a silver spoon in May, and I missed a table-cloth about two months after Mr. Johnson came to lodge there—since they have been given into custody I have missed a muslin dress, and before the 15th of April I missed a girl's shift and a bundle hand<lb></lb>kerchief—when their room was searched I found it was nearly stripped—the prisoners had not left the house till we gave them in custody—Johnson was still occupying the lodgings up to the 9th of May—I missed a counterpane, a tea-kettle, and a bolster, a saucepan, a looking-glass, a basin, a ewer, two plates, two knives, and two forks—it was property which belonged to my husband, and was in my custody—my first husband's name was Bailey—these are the articles—they were all my first husband's—none of them were my</p>

               <p>second husband's purchasing—they all belonged to my first husband, and to my second husband also—they were let with the lodging—on the 9th of May I accused Allport of stealing a silver spoon, she denied it—I said I had lost property before—she said it was very strange, but I did not accuse her till the 9th of May—I then gave her in charge—she was taken to the station—I returned to my house with the policeman and searched the room—Johnson then came home, and I told him Mrs. Allport was out, that she had taken a silver spoon out of my apartment and I had given her in custody, that I had found the duplicate between the bed and mattress—he said he knew nothing about it—I said the room was stripped—he seemed astonished—I said the feathers were all gone out of the bed—he said he knew nothing about the pledging at first, but he then said the feathers were all made into pillows—I gave him into custody—he said what could be done—I said I had given it into the officer's hands—he then said he had been to see a gentleman that day to make arrangements to get the things out, and that he had got them out again and again, but Mrs. Allport had put them away in his absence—he said he had got them out over and over.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he attempt to get away at all? - A. No, he did not: he persisted in it that he had not a guinea; the constable came, and upon my telling him that the prisoner had a guinea in his hand, he gave it him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you did not, in point of fact, take him into custody, then? - A. No, I did not.</p>

Yes; he begged very hard that I would let him at liberty; and I said, if the master would answer for his appearance the next day, and he would drive the constable home in his coach, I should have no objection; I understand himself the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about this half-guinea? - A. He said he had taken it on Christmas-day, as a fate.</p>

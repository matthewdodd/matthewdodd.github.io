            . My father kept this coffee-house; the prisoner came to lodge there on the 1st of June, and left on the 5th - he occupied the same room as Nicholson; I saw the portmanteau in the room on the Thursday, while the prisoner was there, as I was helping to make the bed- it was locked then; I examined it, as the prisoner was a stranger: the prisoner was at home almost all day on Friday, in the bed-room; he said, about five o'clock, he thought he should leave that night, and about eight he went - he brought nothing in when he came to the house- he brought in a shirt and handkerchief one day, and gave it me to carry up to the room; I saw him go out on Friday afternoon with a middling sized bundle - he might have come in and gone out again, when I was not in the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you any female servants in the house? A. Only one, at that time - how often he went out on Thursday I cannot say; he might have gone out when I was not in the bar, and brought in a bundle; I believe the prosecutor's was a military cloak - the bundle he took out was not so large as that; my father has since discharged a chamber maid, because she did not suit us - not on any suspicion.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged at my father's house; I saw him there frequently - I remember his going away; I saw him take a bundle out - it was large enough to contain a coat, but I think not a military cloak- it was tied in a red and black silk handkerchief; it was too large to contain only two shirts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether the servant discharged attended on the prisoner? A. She made the bed and cleaned the room - the bed room door was never locked; there was no other lodger - the prisoner could often have taken things in when I was not in the bar.</p>

            . I lived at Yeo's, and cleaned the boots - he does not keep the house now - I seldom went into the bed-rooms; I never went into the bed-room while the prisoner lodged there, nor when Mr. Nicholson did - I have seen the prisoner go out two or three times with bundles, but never saw him bring any thing in; I did not see him after he left, till the 1st of October, when I met him in Seymour-place, Bryanstone-square, and was certain of him- he went into the Prince Regent in Seymour-place; I went and staid at the bar a few minutes - the prisoner was looking through the blinds into the street; I asked him to step outside, as I wished to speak to him - he asked what I wanted; I asked him if he did not sleep a few nights at the Manchester coffee-house, near Manchester-square; he said No, he did not know such a place; he came out - he said he had been abroad eight months, and had just arrived in England - I asked him two or three times to go with me to master's, but he refused; he said he had got other business to do, and walked towards Edgware-road; I said he had better go with me if he was so confident he was not the man - he said he should not do any thing of the kind; that he should return in about an hour, if I would go back to the Prince Regent, for he had taken lodgings there; I saw two new Police-men, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was four months after the robbery? A. Yes; I never found the room door open when I took up the boots.</p>

            . I am an officer of the new Police. Strowger gave the prisoner into my charge; he at first refused to go with me - as we went along I asked if he had any knowledge of this Manchester coffee-house; he said No - when I turned the corner of the street, and got within sight of the house, he said, "Oh, if that is the house, I may have resided there - I believe I have;" I took him into the room, and Mr. Yeo said he was the person who robbed the house - he said he lived at Liverpool.</p>

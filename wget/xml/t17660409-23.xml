The prisoner was at my house on the Monday morning, I think the 3d of March; I know he was taken up the Thursday after, being the 6th; I hearing he was taken up I went to see him in prison, and they detained me there all night by order of Mr. Marsden, who sent three thief-catchers.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the 6th of March was he at your house?</p>
               <p>Nash. He was at my house, as near as I can tell, about a quarter after 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What house do you keep?</p>
               <p>Nash. I keep a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the place described where the robbery was committed, from your house?</p>
               <p>Nash. It is about three miles, he had no horse with him when at my house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. The prisoners wish to know how often you have been in custody within these two years? - I do not know that I was in custody.</p>
               <p>About four years ago you was not in custody for being concerned with a desperate gang of water-pirates? - Whether I was in custody; I was not in custody; I was taken, for they said they sold me things.</p>
               <p>Was you ever in custody about some Prussian blue? - Why that is the same affair.</p>
               <p>Was you ever committed from Litchfield-street for robbery, for which you at present stand indicted? - Was I committed for robbery, I never was committed for no robbery.</p>
               <p>You never was in Litchfield-street, perhaps? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear you was not? - That I was not committed; why there was something that somebody said.</p>
               <p>Is there, at this time, an indictment against you for it? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you was admitted a witness in Worship-street, about some callico; how long ago is that? - Mr. Garrow, if you will give me leave one thing, was I not to come here at all.</p>
               <p>Answer the question, how long is it since you was admitted a witness for the crown in Hog-lane or in Worship-street, for it bears both names, I believe about some callico? - I believe that is about eighteen months ago.</p>
               <p>How long is it? - Why how long do you think.</p>
               <p>How long do I think! - You never was charged for any thing of the archbishop's plate? - No, Sir, any thing more?</p>
               <p>Yes, a great deal more, master Moses? how long is it since you was taken for purchasing a chest of tea that had been stolen? - I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that; because though this is passing off pretty easily, there is a shorthand-writer taking down your answers? - I never purchased any.</p>
               <p>That is an answer to my question; have you never been charged with it? - I might have been charged with it, but I never bought any.</p>
               <p>Is Mrs. Moses at this time indicted? - I will tell you, gentlemen of the jury, if a man has been guilty once of a fault, he is always guilty; I can bring you sufficient housekeepers in our parish; I will take particular care if a man has been guilty once of a thing that he will never be guilty of again; I shall be very particular for the future.</p>
               <p>How long is it since your wife was apprehended and taken to Shadwell-office, and kept in Elby's house for a robbery? - I will tell you how that is: we keep a shop; a woman came to our house, and begged and prayed (her husband was pressed) that we would buy an article, and it had the misfortune to be stolen; we are very particular now, and have been for this long time past.</p>
               <p>Now I just read you the conclusion of what these poor men had been put in: they say they hope your Lordship will inspect your manner; for that since New South Wales has been established, you, Mr. Moses, have been the cause of sending more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040024"></xptr>young men to that place, than all the officers of justice put together, which can be proved by

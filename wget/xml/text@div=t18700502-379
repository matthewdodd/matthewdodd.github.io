                  </hi>. I am an eating-house keeper, of 87, Davies Street, Oxford Street—about 12 o'clock at night, on 13th April, I was going home along Brewer Street, when I arrived at a short street leading into Golden Square, two men rushed out and knocked me into the gutter, I instantly felt them a top of me, fumbling about my watch and chain—I lost it—I called out "Stop Thief!"—I afterwards went to the station and there saw the prisoners in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C R</hi> 30). About 12.45, on the morning of 13th April, I was in Glasshouse Street, which is near Brewer Street, I heard a cry of "Stop Thief!"—I saw the prisoner Cameron on the top of the prosecutor, and Bresley standing by the side, at the corner of Brewer Street—I pursued Bresley through Glasshouse Street, into Great Vine Street, across Regent Street, into Half Moon Passage, into Little Vine Street, when he turned into Swallow Street—I lost sight of him for a moment when I got into Swallow Street—I saw he was stopped in Piccadilly, and when I got into Piccadilly he was in custody of Detective Beechey and Sergeant Gould—Pickles after<lb></lb>wards brought Cameron to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How close were you to the prosecutor when you saw Cameron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twenty yards; Glasshouse Street runs from Sherwood Street into Regent Street—it is well lighted—I ran up and got within seven or eight yards of them—no one was with me—there was no one else there—Bresley ran nearest me, and I ran after the one I thought I could catch—he ran one way and Cameron another.</p>
               <p>

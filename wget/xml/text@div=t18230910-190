On the 7th of August, about noon, these boots lay on the shop-board; I was in the back parlour, and heard somebody come in; I looked, but could see nobody. In about five minutes, I heard somebody come in again, and saw Smith taking the boots and go out with them; I ran out, and only lost sight of him in turning the corner - I overtook him in Hanover-square; he had not got them then. I am certain of his person, I charged him with it; he said, he was going to meet a gentleman at Charing-cross, and was going by our shop at the time I ran out. Hunter was brought to the office the same day with the boots.</p>

            . I am an artificial flower-maker, and live in Blenheim-street. I was at the first floor window, opposite the prosecutor's shop, and saw a young man in a striped waistcoat, whom I believe to be Smith, come round the corner into Woodstock-street alone; he stood close by Skinner's door; he then came from the door and went down Blenheim-street, and spoke to Hunter. I am sure of him; he then went back, and I saw him go into Skinner's shop and come out without anything; he went down Blenheim-street, I did not see him speak to Hunter again; he returned and went into the shop again, and brought out a pair of boots; the shopman ran out, calling Stop thief! I saw him throw the boots under the shop window. I saw him again in half an hour, and will not positively swear to him; he had a striped waistcoat on when he was taken. I picked up the boots, and took them into the shop; then went into the square, and found him then in custody. I am sure Hunter is the man who Smith spoke to - I saw him at Marlborough-street, pointed him out, and he was taken.</p>

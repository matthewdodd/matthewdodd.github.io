On Thursday, the 4th of March, I observed the prisoner as he was going out with his bread. I stopped him, and told him he had got something of mine. He assured me he had not. I said, I shall see. He kept going forward. I said, you shall stop, and I see what you have got. I saw nothing in his hands, nor did he appear to have any thing in his pockets. He was still going forward to cross the street. I told him to stop. He came back at last, but very unwillingly. Then I laid hold of his hat. It was a high crowned hat. On my pulling it off, there was a bag of flour in it. I said, this is a pretty thing to rob me of my flour. He said, I am sorry; it is the first time I ever did it; he hoped I would forgive him. The bag I put upon the window, and when my back was turned be put the flour out of his bag into the bin in the shop. I sent for the constable. He came, and I gave him in charge. The flour is worth more than fourteen pence.</p>

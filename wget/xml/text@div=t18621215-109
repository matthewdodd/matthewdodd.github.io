                  </hi>. I am a tailor, at 6, Catherine-street, Stepney—on Wednesday, 12th November, I was at the York Minster public-house, before 8 o'clock in the evening—I had some refreshment there—after leaving there I proceeded on my way home, through Philpot-street—when I got a little way up Philpot-street I received a blow on my hat—I was then seized round the neck by somebody; I don't know who it was—I then felt a pull at my watch-chain—I found it gone—I turned round, and saw the watch in Buckley's hands—I am sure he is the man—I saw him distinctly—they all ran away—I saw Buckley again the same night, when he was taken up to the Thames police-court—he was with Mason, in custody—I recognised him again at once, and I am sure he is the man—I received no injury to hurt me—I was alarmed, and returned to the York Minster—whilst there police-constable Venables came to me, and I went with him towards Arbour-square station, when we met the two witnesses, Wilks and Stout—from what they said, I went back to the York Minster, and there I saw Mason playing at billiards or bagatelle, and gave him in charge—I went next morning to the York Minster with Legg, and saw a woman—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what she said, I went to the Bedford Arms—she said she was Buckley's wife—I was there introduced to some stranger, and afterwards went to 46, Baker-street, Stepney—that was Percival's house, so I was told—he said himself it was his house—at the Bedford Arms he said, "Come to my house and wait till the man Walter comes back with the watch"—I waited in the house about an hour and a half—the watch was then brought back by a man they called "Walter"—it was shown to me, and a woman, a stranger to me, who was down iu the kitchen, asked me to give them a sovereign for it, which I would not do—I did not get it—it was taken away again—they did not give it into my hand at all—I am sure it was my watch—I then left the house, and went to the Thames police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship-steward, and live at 6, Sydney-square, Stepney—on the night of 12th November, I was with the prosecutor in the York Minster—I remember his leaving there—I left immediately after—I saw him stopped in Philpot-street by his friend Wilford, who asked him to come back to the York Minster and pay for two pots of beer—he refused, and said he did not owe it—I then saw somebody's arms round his neck; whose they were I cannot say, and then saw his watch snapped by the prisoner Percival, who passed it to Buckley, and Buckley to another man—I saw that distinctly—I am most sure Percival is the man—I did not see his face distinctly, because his back wan to me—the prosecutor's face was towards me, and Percival's back was towards me, and his face was from me, so I could not see his face distinctly—I only saw his back.</p>

On 12th November, about 9 o'clock, I met Buckley in Storer-street, Stepney, in company with another young man—I said, "Hallo, <hi rend="italic">Ben,</hi> you are wanted at the station for being concerned with <hi rend="italic">Long Charley</hi> (that is Mason) in stealing a watch—he said, "I know nothing about it; where did it take place?"—I said, "In Philpot-street, near the York Minster; you had better go to the station-house with me"—in going along he said he was there at a row, or disturbance, but he knew nothing of the robbery—the prosecutor was at the station when we</p>

On the night of 12th November, about 8 o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to the York Minster—I saw the prosecutor there—I went with him into the billiard-room, where Mason was, and he was given into my charge—he goes by the nick<lb></lb>name of <hi rend="italic">Long Charley</hi>—I told him he was charged, with others with robbing the prosecutor of his watch—a man who was there said, "So help me God, he never went out of the house at all"—Mason said, "I was out<lb></lb>side there, but I know nothing of it"—I saw Buckley that night, within three or four minutes of the robbery being committed, coming from that direction, I believe, in company with Percival.</p>

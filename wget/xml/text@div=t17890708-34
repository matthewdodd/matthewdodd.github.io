             were at home, when I came home, I met the prisoner Parrot coming out of the house with the things in his apron; I asked who he had been to, and he said he had been to a lodger; I went in directly, and saw the parlour door open and the plate was gone, I came out again and made an alarm, but the prisoner was gone; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080034"></xptr>not see the other prisoner there; I have never seen my things since.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you lock your door, when you went out? - Yes, I locked the door of the back parlour, these things were lost from the front parlour; I put the key on a cupboard close by the back parlour door, there is a way from the back parlour to the front parlour; the key was not visible to any person.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come out of the parlour? - No, out of the street door, he had a brown apron on. He was taken three hours afterwards, and taken to Justice Wilmot's office, the door was not broke, nor the lock; it was opened with my key; it was in the door when I came back, and the door open, I knew him again directly, his hand was bound up; I observed it when he came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You was alarmed? - Yes, I trembled very much, I could hardly contain myself; I went to Justice Wilmot's, and saw Armstrong and Shakeshaft.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you they would not seek for the prisoners unless they had two guineas? - Yes, one of them did.</p>
               <p>How was the man dressed, when he came out of your house? - In a greenish striped great coat very long; he had a brown jacket on when he was taken; the officers sent for me, and said they had got the persons I wanted, and I must come and swear to them.</p>
               <p>When you went out you left Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Newman; did you leave any body else? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>How does your door open? - By a latch and a brass knob, the cupboard where I put the key, is a good way down the passage.</p>
               <p>Are your other lodgers here? - No.</p>

He stood at the door some time afterwards; I went away, and saw no more, till Mrs. Brookes came and told me the house was robbed; he was dressed in a striped green coat, and his hand bound up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know Shakeshaft and Armstrong? - Yes, I never spoke to them, till I saw them yesterday, since I saw them at the justices; I know nothing of the reward, they said nothing to me about it till yesterday, and one of them told me I was to come as a witness, and stick to my text; that was before we went to the Grand Jury.</p>

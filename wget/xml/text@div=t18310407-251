Yes, but I had not the least idea of this till the 24th of February - my daughter went to service after the marriage, unknown to me; I never said I suspected the prisoner was married before this marriage - I only saw him twice before this marriage; he told me he was an apprentice, and did not wish his friends to know it; I asked him to step into a house, that I might look at him, and I said, "I think you are rather an old apprentice, and if I thought you were about to take any advantage of a child of mine, I should no more mind blowing out your brains than looking at you:" this was only a few nights before the marriage - I asked him for a reference, and he sent me to a place in Wych-street; they would not tell me much of him; and when I saw him again, he said the reason was that he was a natural child; I was going to the church to forbid the banns, but I was too late - I met them coming back.</p>

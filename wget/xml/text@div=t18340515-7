               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you state before the magistrate that she offered you 1l.? A. Yes; I think I did; I am not sure of it - I think I did state it - I am sure of it - my eldest child is seventeen, the next is thirteen years of age; but the eldest was not at home - the youngest was at home - she knows nothing about it - my door opens by a latch, and so does the other door - my husband locked the door - he did not go out with me - I locked the door the night before, when I went out, between ten and eleven o'clock, and next morning I found it only on the latch - I pulled it after me when I went out - my husband bolted it after me - it locks without the key - it is a spring lock, which any body inside could open - I pulled the door to - the prisoner and I have never had any quarrel; not the slightest - I do not remember a word of quarrelling about a counterfeit shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she throw away a counterfeit shilling which you gave her? A. I did not give her the shilling - she asked me for money - I told her I had none, and she snatched a shilling out of my hand - that was on the 18th of April, before I charged her with this business - it was not a very bad one - I did not offer it to any body - she had no business to take it - I did not want her to take it - I was not angry with her for taking it - she snatched it out of my hand, and ran out with it - I never asked her to pass it - I did not go to her house for that - she never told me she would not try to pass it for me; but I never wanted her to pass it - my husband's master would take the shilling back, for he had worked for it - I had not quarrelled with her about the shilling - I said nothing to her about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she ever bought any thing of you - some of these very things you charge her with? A. She took several of my things before she left, and that is the reason I gave her notice to quit - she bought some of my property and thieved them too - my husband never takes notice of what I have got - I told him she had bought things of me - I never sent out for brandy with the money she gave me for the things - I cannot say I do not like a glass very well.</p>

             - I remember her going out between ten and eleven o'clock, she pulled the door after her; and I went and bolted it, and went to bed - and about two o'clock in the morning, I heard the prisoner knocking at my door - she was very much intoxicated - I could tell that from her voice, as I knew her from lodging with us - she asked me to let her in, for she was almost perishing with cold; but I did not answer her - and about three o'clock, I heard her again knocking at the door - she said, "Pray, Jones, let me in; I am almost perishing with cold" - but I did not let her in - I heard no more of her - I am quite certain it was her voice - I got up that morning about half-past five o'clock, and went down stairs, and undid the door, which was fast as I had left it, bolted inside - I left the house about a quarter before six o'clock, and put the door on the latch - I pulled the spring lock back - I am quite sure the door was latched, for I tried it - I returned about half-past eight o'clock to breakfast, and found my wife at home - about three weeks afterwards, when my wife returned from nursing, she brought me a piece of stocking, which had come off my waistcoat - it had been part of my waistcoat-sleeve - I went to Worship-street that day, the 18th of April, and went to the prisoner's house with two policemen, and found two caps, and many other things, which my wife owned - as soon as we found one article, Allen fell on her knees and begged me to go no further with it, and she would give me 1l. - I said I never took a bribe from any body, but if the magistrate thought proper, I was agreeable.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons had you left behind in the house when you went out in the morning? A. My two children, who are thirteen and ten years old - they were able to go down stairs - they go to school, and let themselves and out - the prisoner offered 1l. to me - my wife was present - she told me she had sold the prisoner some things when she lived with us - I did not see my wife sell her any thing - I do not remember the quarrel about the bad shilling - I was not present - I had received the shilling from my master - I left it on the table, and my wife took it up; but I know nothing of what passed between the prisoner and her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know she and your wife were in the habit of swapping, and getting brandy and gin? A. No; she is not in the habit of drinking like other people - I do not know that there were bargains between them about their different apparel - I heard of the prisoner buying caps of her.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I have two caps - I found one in a band-box, and another in a bag in the prisoner's room, in Thomas-street, Hackney-road, on the 18th of April - the prosecutor lives in York-row, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - the prisoner and her husband were both at home - the prosecutor and his wife went with me - the prisoner denied strongly knowing any thing of the robbery, and did not say how she came by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150011"></xptr>them - as I was taking her from her home to the station-house, she offered me 2l. to let her go - she said, "Do not take me to the station-house" - I said, "If you give me 5,000l. I dare not do it" - as I took her from the station-house to Worship-street she said, "I did take the property"- I had not said a word whatever to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was after you had refused 2l. to let her go home? A. Yes - I had asked her no question whatever about it - I did not make her any answer - she voluntarily said she did take it - she did not say, "I am sorry for it" - that was all that passed between us - we walked rather better than half or three quarters of a mile - during all that walk not a word passed besides - I cannot say that I have described all that took place in the room, for I was busy searching the room - nothing more took place, more than the prisoner stating she would make any recompense to the prosecutor not to bring it any further - that was what I heard - no sum was mentioned that I heard - the prisoner was sometimes standing up and sometimes sitting down - it was a good-sized room - there was a bed in it - I cannot say that she fell on her knees to either of them - she might have done it while I was searching on one side of the bed - she could not have spoken loud enough for them to hear and I not hear her in that room - I did not hear any sum mentioned.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your brother policeman there? A.

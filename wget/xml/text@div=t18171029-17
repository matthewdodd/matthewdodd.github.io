I have been on board the Newcastle frigate for two years, with the prisoners. On the 14th of October I met them together, in Rosemary-lane, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; I asked them how they got on-Thompson said they got on very poorly, and they had not broken their fast that day; I took them into a cook-shop in Rosemary-lane, and we had some beef and beer - We had seven or eight pots of porter, and staid there until about half-past six o'clock - We went into the house between two and three o'clock. I walked some way with them before we went in. I told Kelly as it was getting late, I must be going home, he asked where I lived, I told him at the Strong Man, in Lower East Smithfield. Thompson was present. Kelly said he would shew me a short cut to go home - I told him he knew the way better than me. He took me to a place called <placeName id="t18171029-17-crimeloc95">Cooper's-row</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18171029-17-crimeloc95" type="placeName" value="Cooper's-row"></interp>

They stopped behind talking - I was going forward, it was very dark, Kelly came up to me, put up his fist, and said, "D-n your eyes, let us see what you have got." He knocked me down, put his knee upon my breast, and his hand over my mouth-Thompson was by - I mumbled out, "for God's sake do not use me ill, take what I have got," being afraid of their ill using me. Thompson said he has got some notes about him, feel. He (Thompson) took my notes out of my pocket, with some papers, and a handkerchief - I had more than ten 1l. notes there, I had felt them in my pocket that day, they were all new notes. They ran away as fast as they could. I got up and called out "thieves, murder!" the people opened their doors, and told me to go for a constable-it was near a row of houses. I went to Nathan's, and then went in search of the prisoners, with the officers; we found Thompson about two hours afterwards in Nightingale-lane, with a woman; I told the officer there was Thompson; he seized him, and took him into a house, and found three or four 1l. notes upon him, my papers, and handkerchief - They are new notes. We then went to look for Kelly, and found him about an hour hour afterwards at a public-house, going down to Deptford-the officer found some cash and notes on him. As he was going with the constable, he said, "Is old George here? I would never have done it if Thompson had not encouraged me"-Thompson was not present. I was quite sober. I paid for every thing. I am positive the prisoners are the men.</p>

               <p>KELLY. Q. Did we not advise you to give the money to the landlord to take care of - A. No. We had a pint of gin first in the morning; I did not drink any myself; I took a note out to pay for it. I had not counted my money for a week before.</p>
               <p>KELLY. Q. Did you not give the money to Thompson to keep while you went into a bad house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did they knock you down - A. Kelly struck me on the head with his fist; my money was taken from me through fear.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL NATHAN. I am a headborough. On the 14th of October, about a quarter after seven o'clock, Curtis was brought to my house, he told me of the robbery. He said he knew the men; that one was a tall Irishman, and the other a stout man-the prisoners answered the description; he said they were his own shipmates. I got Morris and Fair; we went with the prosecutor to different houses, from half-past seven till nine o'clock. We called at several houses which seamen use. In Ratchiff-highway, Curtis said, "Here is the villian, Thompson, that robbed me!" we immediately secured him, and took him into a public-house; we searched him, and found 17s. in silver. and 1s. 2d. in copper in a new black silk handkerchief. Fair found two 1l. notes, and some papers in his bosom, and a silk handkerchief. We locked him up, and went to several houses, till we came to the King's Arms, in New Gravel-lane, where we found two or three men and a woman standing. Curtis said, "This is Kelly;" we secured him, took him into the house, and handcuffed him. He made a violent resistance - He threw three of us down on the floor. We found 1l. 3s. 6d. in silver, and 3d. in copper on him. He said, "George, I will tell you all about it. It was not me that took your money, it was Thompson; for I only received 2l. 10s. for my share." The prosecutor appeared perfectly sober, but rather agitated by the blows he had received; he had a swelling under his eye.</p>
               <p>JAMES FAIR. I am an officer of Shadwell. I accompanied 
               <persName id="t18171029-17-person171">Nathan.</persName>
             I searched the prisoner, Thompson, and found two 1l. notes on him. I also examined his shirt, and found three certificates and two handkerchiefs, which the prosecutor claimed. I searched Kelly, and found a 1l. note on him. He made a strong resistance, and said he only received 2l. 10s. for his share of the money.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I am an officer. I was present, and confirm what the witnesses have said.</p>
               <p>(Handkerchief and papers sworn to.)</p>
               <p>KELLY'S Defence. I met the prosecutor in Ship-alley; he kept shewing his money to the people - We got drunk. He gave 
               <persName id="t18171029-17-person172">Thompson</persName>
             the money to take care of, while he went to a bad house. He was to meet me the next morning.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON'S Defence. I say the same.</p>

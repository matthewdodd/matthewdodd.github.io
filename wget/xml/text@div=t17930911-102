               <p>Q. Was the property on her when she was brought in? - Yes, in her hand, and she put it down in the shop when she came in; I can swear it to be mine, being one of my own making, and by putting it out of doors not above two hours or two hours and a half before the woman took it.</p>


               <p>Q. Was there any marks at all about it by which you knew it? - I can positively swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the tea kettle after it was brought in? - I sent for a constable, and gave it into his possession; the constable is here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a tin plate worker; I was at work in the cellar of Mr. Peyton, and all of a sudden the window was dark, I looked up and I saw this woman with a large white cloak stoop down, and then she went into the adjoining passage, and she crossed over the way, I suspected she had stole something; I went to the door, and when I came to the door I saw her crossing the way, I followed her into Cree-church-lane, I stopped her and told her she had got what did not belong to her and brought her back again, and saw her put the kettle down in the presence of Mr. Peyton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there was one missed? - I know there was one missed out of the row that was put out of doors when I came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming along Leadenhall-street, I was going to see a cousin of mine in Fleet-market, and the soldiers were going to the Tower; and there was a great mob, and the tea kettle was in the middle of the highway with the lid off, and I picked it up and meant to carry it to the man, I do assure you I did, and that man had the impudence to say that I took the kettle, it is as false as God is true, upon my word I tell you the truth.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable; I have the tea kettle; I received it of Mr. Peyton and have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said if I would pay for the kettle he would let me go; I told him I did not want the kettle, I had no money to pay for the kettle, I had but eighteen-pence in my pocket. I have been out of my mind but I was not out of my mind then, I was then as sensible as ever I was in my life; nor was I drunk, I durst not drink a drop of gin ever since my head has been bad.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How did this woman appear when she was brought to you? - She appeared to be sober, and said she was very sorry for what she had done, and if I would let her go she would never come that way again. About two years back I had a shop in Surry-road and she served me just in the same way, and I did not prosecute her then because of the evpence of going to the Guilford assizes.</p>

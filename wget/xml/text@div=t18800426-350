                  </hi>. I live at 32, Gillingham Street, Pimlico, and am manager to Mr. Wadsworth—in January, 1879, I was in the back office at his place of business, 39, Lower Belgrave Street; to the best of my knowledge Mr. Wadsworth, senior, was there also—the defendant and a gentleman named Copsey came into the front office—they then came into the back office—Mr. Copsey said that he had been recommended by a friend; the manager to Mr. Overton, that his friend wanted some work done at a shop he had taken in the Wilton Road, one of the new shops of Pete's—I asked what they required to have done—he began to explain, and I said I had better come and see it, and I arranged with him to go next morning—he asked Mr. Wadsworth, senior, and I to go out and have some refresh<lb></lb>ment, which we did, at the Prince of Wales public-house—next day I went with Mr. Watts, the foreman of carpenters, and Mr. Howard, the foreman of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188004260004"></xptr>
               <p>painters, and saw Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Copsey at the shop in Wilton Road—nothing had been said in our office or in the public-house about six months' credit—it is not true that Copsey said "He can't pay cash for it, he will require six months' credit;" nor did I say "That will be all right, let us see what he wants done"—I never heard of the six months' credit until I heard it in the affidavit in the action—at the shop Copsey and Law<lb></lb>rence were there, and then gave orders for a small quantity of work to be done—it was commenced on the following day; that portion of the work was speedily completed, but there were fresh orders given almost daily, which increased the quantity of work, and lasted till about the 12th of March; after that the defendant occupied the premises—I made frequent applications to him for money—I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one occasion from a fair young man named Day, who was in the defendant's service; it was left by him for me, for Mr. Wadsworth—I did not borrow it on Mr. Wadsworth's account, or on my own—I signed a document when I got it, "Received of Mr. Law<lb></lb>rence, the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account," I signed it, it was written by Mr. Lawrence, at least it corresponded with the handwriting of a bill of exchange which I got subsequently—it is not true that I said I had borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a friend to pay the workmen, and that I wanted the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay my friend back—it is not true that the defendant handed me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that he said "I don't know why you want 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., considering my credit has not expired;" he was not there—I did not say "I shall not look upon it as a payment on account of work done, but I want to pay back to a friend the money which I have borrowed"—I called again on the following Saturday, saw the de<lb></lb>fendant, and asked him for money—he said he had had so much to pay for furniture for his house and shop and one thing or another, that he could not pay me just then; he must ask Mr. Wadsworth to wait a little—he sent his young man into the City to see what he could get for me if I would call a little later—I did call later, and the young man came back while I was there and said he had not succeeded in getting any—on 3rd May I made out a bill amounting to 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and delivered it to the defendant and asked for payment—he said if I would call on the following day he would give me a bill for a portion—I did call, and he wrote out this bill of exchange for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him to make it 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his wife was present and said "Be careful, don't make it for more than you can meet"—I made several applica<lb></lb>tions for payment—I believe the first application for money was some little time before the work was finished—on 29th May, in consequence of directions from Mr. Wadsworth, I went to. Messrs. Micklethwaite and Co., solicitors, 3, Long Acre, and made inquiries about the defendant—I communicated the result of those inquiries to Mr. Wadsworth—I did not at that time know that the prisoner had ever borne the name of Levy, or that he had a brother in Messrs. Micklethwaite's office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been employed by Mr. Wadsworth, jun., five or six years—I have frequently lent him money for wages when he has been out of town, and I believe I have borrowed money from a friend to pay wages—I was present at a trial at Kingston in which Mr. Wadsworth lost the verdict and became liable to pay 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a case of Ford and another against Wadsworth, and Dunn, and another against Wadsworth—I had nothing to say in it—I don't know whether 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ought to have been paid on 19th February—on that day Mr. Wadsworth filed a liquidation petition, and I was returned as a creditor for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for wages and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for</p>

               <p>money lent—when I first saw Mr. Copsey he told me the shop was one of the new shops of Peto's—I did not see a Mr. Coles there—Mr. Wadsworth, sen., was present—I believe so; I will not swear positively—Copsey did not mention at the first interview that the shop was to be fitted up as a tobacconist's—the first order was to put a partition across the shop and to put up certain shelves—no bill was made out till the 3rd of May—it was not only for work at the shop, but the whole of the house from top to bottom was done eventually—there were five floors, three above the ground—I floor—Day generally attended at the shop—the defendant held a situation as an accountant—he had recently been married—on Saturday, 29th March, when I called I saw Day—I might have said that I was short of money for wages, as Mr. Wadsworth had not come to town—it is quite possible that Day may have said that he would inform Mr. Lawrence, and that I said I would look in again—I do not recollect the conversation—I don't remember going again the same day, and Day saying that Mr. Lawrence had not come in—I believe I got the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday; my impression originally was that I got it on the Saturday—the defendant did not say to me in Day's presence, "I can't understand why you should be asking me for the money now, when the six months' credit has not nearly expired"—I did not then say I had run short of money for wages in Mr. Wadsworth's absence, and I had to borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a friend, which I was bound to repay that day—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lent Mr. Wadsworth was in a lump sum; that was quite independent of the little sums I lent him for paying wages—he always paid me that back; they were generally squared the next week when he came to town—the defendant never complained to me of the charges being very high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The charges were fair-and reasonable—it was soon after the work was commenced that he told me he was going to be married—it was when I asked him for money on account—he said he was going to marry a person with plenty of money, and he should be able to settle then—the two actions at Kingston were interpleader actions, Mr. Wadsworth having seized certain goods which had been removed from the defendant's premises; Ford and Dunn claimed them, and brought the action—Mrs. Dunn, I believe, is a widow lodging in his house, and Ford is his wife's father.</p>

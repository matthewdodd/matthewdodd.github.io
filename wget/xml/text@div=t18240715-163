            . I live Pound-place, in Fulham-road - I never saw the prisoner in my shop, but it was his wife that came to me - she said she was a housekeeper, at No. 19, Harford-street, and I went there to see an old bedstead - she asked a price for it that I could not give her - I saw two cabinet tops and a mahogany seat belonging to a hall - I said I would give her half a guinea for them - the prisoner was there at the time the bargain was made - I took the property home and put it in my shop to sell - I parted with the seat; that was all - the two cabinet tops I kept till they were seen by the gentleman - I had sold the flap, but I got it back again.</p>

            . I live at Kensington, Gravel Pits, I never went to any house in Harford-street - I bought a carpet of the prisoner and his wife for 5 s. - to the best of my recollection it was at Mr. Fielder's house - I have had it in my possession till to-day.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH - . I went into Harford-street on the 8th of June, and apprehended the prisoner. I saw these prints, which he said were given to him by Mr. Fielder, and a quantity of stained paper he said Mr. Fielder, gave him; but Mr. Fielder denied it. I then found this iron fender, this measuring chain, brass night bolt, two cabinet tops, a mahogany flap, and other things, all of which he said Mrs. Fielder had given him. I sent for her, and she denied it; he then said he was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say to Mrs. Fielder's face that she had given them to him - A. No; when she came, he said,</p>

               <p>"Ma'am, I am very sorry; I thought they were all old things."</p>
               <p>MR. FIELDER. Mrs. Fielder is not here. She said she had not given him the things; he said, I am very sorry; I hope master will not prosecute me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left Mr. Fielder through some words; the property was given to my wife; I was not there at the time; his own servants helped me off with them; I did not steal them.</p>

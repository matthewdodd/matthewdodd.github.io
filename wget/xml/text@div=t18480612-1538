                  </hi>. I live at New Peckham. About half-past threeo'clock on 23rd May, I went with my wife into a public-house in Stanhope-street, Clare-market—the prisoner was sitting in the tap-room, with one leg onthe table, smoking—the landlord brought me a pint of porter—I asked him tobring some salt—my wife put a shilling close to my hand, on the table—theprisoner reached over my wife, and said, "Excuse me, Sir, but there is avery large spider there"—I turned, and saw him take the shilling—I said, "You have <hi rend="italic">spidered</hi> my shilling"—I stood between him and the door, withmy stick, that he should not get out, and said, "Put my shilling on thetable"—he said, "I will give you a shilling"—the landlord sent for a police-man—the prisoner said, "Old gentleman, I want to speak to you"—I said, "I won't have anything to say to you"—he said, "Have patience; don'tlock me up; you have got your shilling, what more do you want? if you donot lock me up, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  </hi>. I belong to the band of the 20th regiment of Foot Guards—I had a bugle in my possession belonging to Colonel Henry Tho<lb></lb>mas, an officer of the regiment. On the 22nd of May, it wanted mending—the prisoner, who is a wheelwright, and is acquainted with most of our men, told me he could mend it, and I let him have it—it wanted soldering—he said he would bring it back between seven and eight o'clock the same evening, but I did not see him again till he was in custody—he could not be found.</p>

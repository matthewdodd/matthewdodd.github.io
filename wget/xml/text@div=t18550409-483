               <p>him if he was unwell, he said he was not; I then asked him if he had been badly treated—he said he had not—I believe the mate (Dunlop) was there at the time, the master (Kelland) had proceeded up to our office to report his vessel—I expect the mate was in the ship, but I have no knowledge of the mate whatever; the crew were shipped at Glasgow—I do not think the mate was by, so as to hear what the boy said—there were several persons about the deck at the time, but none taking particular notice of the con<lb></lb>versation; there were none within hearing—this conversation took place on the deck—I was speaking as loud as I am now, the Custom House officer might have been about a yard from us—I did not recognise the mate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a German. I was cook and steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Caroline</hi>—I joined the ship at Deme<lb></lb>rara—Kelland was master of the ship—Dunlop was not the mate when I joined—he only came the day before we left Demerara; I had been then three weeks on board—Dunlop sailed in the ship from Demerara, I think as second mate, and later, after the mate died, he became mate; the captain told me that the mate was drowned—the boy Sullock was on board the ship when we left Demerara—he was a boy on board—he was in very good health when we left Demerara—he was treated quite well by the captain and mate when we left Demerara—I did not see anything done to him until about three weeks previous to our arrival in London—as I came out of the cabin I saw the captain beating him over the head with a broom stick—I cannot say how many times he beat him at that time; he beat him till the stick broke, and then he took the handle of a scrubber, and beat him with that, and broke it—the boy's head was over blood, I cannot say how much it bled; but the blood came out of his head, and likewise from his hands—later that same day, the mate threw the boy down on the deck, near the cabin, and kicked him with his foot—the boy cried very much when this was done—I do not know why the captain beat him, or why the mate kicked him—that was the first time I had seen such cruel treatment—he had, per<lb></lb>haps, received a box on the ears now and then—the day after he was not beaten, and in the evening they gave him clean clothes; and the boy's head was very much swollen—after that, almost daily, he received boxes on the ears, or they beat him with ropes' ends—I made the captain understand that the boy was ill, that he might not beat him any more—I had to fetch the boy, who was sitting in the forecastle, and then he was dressed clean—I cannot say how often after this the boy was beaten before the ship arrived in London, but there passed not one day when he was not beaten; he was beaten by the captain as well as by the mate—he was only beaten once with the broom stick and scrubber; afterwards it was with the rope's end—one day when we were in St. Katherine's Dock, the mate threw the boy down in the forecastle, and kicked him with his foot—the boy slept on a box in the forecastle during the voyage—I did not see any other violence used to the boy than that which I have detailed.</p>

               <p>to prevent my striking the mate with a knife—the crew at last only consisted of the mate and myself; before, there were six persons altogether on board; at the time these injuries were inflicted, there were six, including the captain—at first there were seven, and when the first mate fell over<lb></lb>board, there were six, until we arrived in London—I did not mention this, until I was called before a court of justice; that might be about a week or eight days after our arrival in London—I do not know whether Dunlop was called as a witness on the first occasion; I did not hear him give evidence—I do not know what has become of the rest of the crew; the others left previously to me—I had never had any quarrel with the boy—I complained once to the captain that he made the galley dirty—I cannot say whether he was an idle boy; he was not a boy of dirty habits in the first part, but at the latter part he was—when; the captain ill treated him with the broom<lb></lb>stick, there was a man present steering besides me, and the mate stood close by—the man that was steering saw it—he said nothing to the captain in my hearing—I cannot say where the rest of the crew were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am surgeon at Guy's Hospital. On 21st March, the lad, Samuel Sullock, was brought to Guy's Hospital—Mr. Knight's partner, Mr. Barter, came to see him while he was in the hospital—I examined the boy—he was very dirty—he had several wounds on his legs, some on his body, others on his head, and some on his hands—the wound on the head I should call a small lacerated wound, with contusions around—he had a remarkably idiotio vacant stare—we had great difficulty in getting any information from him—I ordered his head to be shaved, that we might examine it more carefully—I first discovered two small wounds on the scalp, with the contusions I have described—on feeling one more attentively, I thought there might be some matter underneath; I therefore made an incision into the scalp, and there was a very little matter, not so much as I anticipated—I then found that the soft parts external to the skull were infiltrated as they are after contu<lb></lb>sion, and the membrane covering the external surface of the skull was detached, which was also the result of a contusion—I have no doubt that blows with a broom stick or scrubber, would have produced the appearances that I saw on the skull—a fall would produce they same result—one wound was on the left side of the head, in the frontal region, and one on the left temporal region—there were two wounds—on the legs we found some wounds healed, and some healing—they were peculiarly small wounds, which were said to have been the result of the bites of mosquitoes—I do not know whether that might be so; I never saw a mosquito bite—there were, I think, two wounds on the right leg, one nearer the groin than the other; it was a narrow wound, in great part healed; the other was a larger wound, not so much healed—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090108"></xptr>
               <p>was one on the abdomen quite healed—they were such injuries as might have been produced by kicks about the body—they were abraded surfaces; they might have been the result of a kick—if the clothes had been on, and it had occurred three weeks before, I think it could scarcely be attributed to a kick—all the wounds I saw were undergoing a healing process—they could not have been inflicted within a day or two—there was one wound on the anterior part of the right thigh, which must have been five inches long, but exceedingly narrow; I heard that that was the result of a rope's end, and I think it very likely—there was no contusion about the wounds on the extremities—I apprehend the effect of a severe blow from a rope's end, with the clothes on, would be merely to raise the cuticle, and contuse the part, produce a blister, which would break, and then there would be merely the abrasion of the skin, which would be very superficial indeed—the wound I saw was very superficial, and quite consistent with that species of injury—the wound on the abdomen was rather oval than long—I should not call it a wound; there was a scar; there had been a wound evidently—there was just a little scab in the centre, round the cuticle—the hands were very much contused; the back of the left hand particularly, and there was an abraded surface, either on the ring or index finger, and also an abraded surface on the nose—blows on the hand with a stick, I should say, would be very likely to produce that appearance—I should think a fall would easily produce the abrasions I saw on the face—the boy was in the hospital about four days; he died on the 25th—the cause of death was bronchitis—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem examination</hi>—I discovered nothing more with regard to the wounds on the body—I examined more attentively the wound on the skull—I found the scalp very much infiltrated from the result of the blow—the body was otherwise healthy; there was not a diseased organ, except the lungs—the brain was particularly healthy.</p>

               <p>I was standing in my warehouse upon the 22d of this month, about half after eleven o'clock, I was alarmed by Mr. Barnard's wife, that a man had been in their apartment and had stolen the watch; I ran out into Johnson-street, and into Old Gravel-lane. Mrs. Barnard ran after me. The prisoner was just at the bottom of Bostock-street, he cried stop thief! and ran up Old Gravel-lane as fast as he could. Mrs. Barnard said you are the thief. I made towards him, and he turned back again and ran up Bostock street. I ran up Bostock-street, and cried stop thief! he did the same; he ran into Broad-street, and into Johnson-street, where the robbery was committed, and a young man at my warehouse laid hold of him. We pulled him into the warehouse, and I saw him take the watch out and throw it into a bin, which was made for potatoes; I took the watch out of the bin, and kept it till we got to Mr. Sherwood's office.</p>
               <p>(It was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner as soon as you came out of the door? - When he went out of my house, he went out the other way, and came down Bostock-street; I did not see him till I saw him at the bottom of Bostock-street. Here is a little girl here saw him come out of the room.</p>

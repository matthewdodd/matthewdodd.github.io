                  </hi>, I am shopman to Mr. James Pearson, of East-street, Marylebone. About two or three o'clock, on the 28th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, a neighbour opposite came and told me something, in consequence of which I missed a cheese—I had seen it safe hall an hour before—the prisoner was pointed out to me by somebody—I went and brought him back—when the prisoner was in the shop, he said, "I do not want to have any bother about it, I know where the cheese is; I will return it, and make you a handsome present"—I said I could not it, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live opposite the prosecutor's shop. I was at the window of my first-floor, on the 21st of January, and saw the prisoner take the cheese—I am sure he is the man—I went and gave information to Mr. Pearson—I saw the prisoner again within five minutes—I caught him and took him into the shop—he positively denied it at first, and when I came to be positive with him, he wanted to com<lb></lb>promise with Johnson, and said he wanted to make it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-trimmer, and live at Holloway. On the 28th of last month I was in East-street, assisting an acquaintance of mine who lived there to move some goods—I saw the prisoner with the cheese in his hand, passing by—I was standing outside the door, about six doors from the prosecutor's nearer to Dorset-street than the shop—the person passed me with the cheese on his right arm—I did see what became of him—a crowd of twenty or thirty people were round the door afterwards, and I went to see what was the matter—the prisoner was in the shop—I went in and said I saw him go up the street with a cheese on his arm—the prisoner said to Johnson that he would make him a hand<lb></lb>some recompense and bring back the cheese, if he would say nothing about it—the lady belonging to the shop said, "No; it was only last night we had part of a ham stolen, and we will not put up with it any longer"—I am in employment as a coach-trimmer at the present time, and have so been for years—I have worked in one situation for fourteen years.</p>

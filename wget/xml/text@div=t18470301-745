                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 14.) One Monday, Feb. 9th, I was on duty in Britannia-street, Gray's-inn Lane—about one o'clock in the night, my attention was called to eight or nine men and one woman—the prisoners were amongst them—I did not say anything to them—Smyrk threw a snow ball, which hit me on the side of my head—I told them they had better drop that game, and keep themselves quiet before they got themselves into trouble—I did not know either of the prisoner before—in about a minute Smith also threw a snow ball—I went and took him into custody—the woman then came up, and took hold of my cape—I told her she had better keep quiet—she said I should not take Smith without taking her she turned out to be his wife—Smyrk came up, and desired me to let go of Smith—I told him he had better keep off, or I should call assistance—he said nothing—I took my tattle from my pocket and sprang it—Smith immediately struck me a blow on my arm with his first, and the rattle fell from my hand—Smith immediately caught me by the legs switch his hands, and threw me flat on my face—as soon as I was down, they kicked me on my head, and somebody jumped on me—I received three or four kicks on the back of my head while I was down—the prisoner and the woman were near me at that time—I was taken to the police-station insensible, and have been under the doctor's hands ever since.</p>

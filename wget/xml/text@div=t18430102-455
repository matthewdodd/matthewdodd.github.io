                  </hi>. I live in Pall Mall East, and did so in Dec. last, in the house of two ladies named Proctor—I keep an account at Messrs. Coutts'—the prisoner was servant in the house I live in for about two months before this happened—he waited on me occasionally—I was generally in, the habit of paying for my lodging and other little things, by cheques on Coutts—I have on several occasions given the prisoner cheques for Miss Proctor—I gave him the cheque produced for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated the 3rd of Dec., on the 5th of Dec., about breakfast time—I kept my blank cheque-book in a paper box, with a patent Bramah lock to it, on my sideboard, in my sitting-room—I always locked it when I went out, and took the key with me—when I was in the house the key was usually in the box—I have since examined my cheque<lb></lb>book, and miss one or two cheques—the cheque for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. produced is not my handwriting, nor was it written by my authority or knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house in Pall Mall East. The prisoner came into my service on the 17th of October last—he was in the habit of making out memorandums of disbursements on my account—he made out small bills and things—I never saw him write—I have settled with him on the accounts he has presented to me—I have had memorandums made out by him, which I have acted on—I have looked at this cheque for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is not like Mr. Hart's writing—the figures and the letters are certainly very much like the prisoner's, but I never saw the prisoner write—I should think it is very like the prisoner's handwriting—I believe under the circumstances that it is the prisoner's writing.</p>

On Sun<lb></lb>day, the 18th of Dec., in consequence of information I went to the house of Miss Proctor, and was shown into a room on the basement, next the kitchen, said to be the prisoner's room—I there found these two books—I produced these books before the prisoner at the station on Friday the 27th, and he said this with the yellow cover was his book, and the other was not his, but he was going to have some fresh leaves put into it—I saw the prisoner write this note—having seen him write this note, I can form a belief as to the hand<lb></lb>writing of this 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I believe the cheque to be the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing—there are several of the letters very remarkable as well as the figures—I have likewise a letter sent to his wife, which he acknowledged to be his handwriting—I got it from his wife—he told me he had written to her—I showed it to him, and said, "Is this the letter you wrote?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Is this your handwriting?"—he said, "Yes"—I have compared that and the cheque together, and have not the least doubt whatever that the cheque is his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Eagle-street. On the 28th of August I went to the Bricklayer's Arms, and borrowed six half-crowns, and one crown-piece, of the landlord—the prisoner was present, and another man, who has been tried—they came and assaulted me—they pulled my nose over my face—I got up to hit at them, and as I was going out of the door the prisoner snatched hold of my waistcoat-pocket, and pulled it off, with my money—there was a crown, six half-crowns, one sixpence, and a half-penny—this is the waistcoat—in about two hours after he brought the pocket back to the landlord, and said he had picked it up—when he took the pocket he knocked me about, and when he saw the policeman coming. he <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> away with the pocket, the money, and the tobacco-box.</p>

The prisoner was in the same service as myself—I was at the Bricklayers' Arms in the afternoon of the 28th of August—I saw the prosecutor there, and two women—a fight took place, and the landlord turned them out—the prosecutor took his waistcoat off, and threw it into the middle of the room—I saw a tobacco-box or snuff-box lying in the room—this is the box—I afterwards saw the box picked up by the prisoner—on the Wednesday morning the prosecutor was fined before the Magistrate—the next morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner was on the opposite side of the Bricklayers' Arms—he called to the prosecutor, and said, "Adams, I believe this is your box"—the prose<lb></lb>cutor took no notice of it—Samuel Perkins was not with me, but he saw the prisoner pick up the box.</p>

On the evening of the 23rd of January my man came, and told me that a person had taken a large leg of pork from a table at the back part of the house - I got the pork again; the man found it with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was it cooked? A. No, it was preparing to be made into a ham.</p>
               <p>THOMAS READ. On Saturday evening, the 23rd of January, I saw the prisoner go from the tap-room into the yard - he was gone a considerable time, and I waited to see if he would return; I then heard a noise, and went and saw him taking the leg of pork, as it appeared to me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180033"></xptr>between his teeth as he was creeping out - I took it from him, and he begged me to say nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know how long he had been there? A. From the morning, and this was about half-past six o'clock in the evening - I think he was sober; the pork was in front of him - it weighed 23 lbs.; he could get out that way - the door was not fast; after I took the pork he went into the tap, but did not remain there two minutes - he then went away; he did not call for any porter after that; I saw him go - I did not take him at that time, because my master was busy: as soon as he was at leisure I told him of it - it might be two hours after.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LAYTON. I went with the officer, and found the prisoner in bed at his lodgings, in Church-street, Staines - he came down in his shirt, and I said he must go with us; he said, "What for?" I said he knew what for - he then said he supposed it was about the leg of pork; he said he was sorry for it, and hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KING. I am a constable, and took him.</p>
               <p>MR. IVESON. He has frequented my house for some time, and I knew him as coming there frequently - I imagine he was sober; I had seen him two or three times in the day, and knowing him I sufferred him to lay on the settle.</p>

             sworn. - I took the lambs and sheep towards Smithfield; I put them into pens about ten minutes past two o'clock last Monday morning, behind the Angel at Islington; I found the tallest prisoner, Harris, there; he helped me to put them into the pen, and I called out for the salesman, Mr. Basleton; he said, there was ne'er a one of the men there; he said, they are all gone away, but I will take care of them till you come back, or the salesman sends for them; then I went to Smithfield, and delivered my note; I made the best of my way home.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060013"></xptr>Q. Have you seen them since? - A. Yes, Crisp and Smith shewed them to me; I knew them to be the same; there were twenty-nine lambs and one horned ewe.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you desire Harris to take them to Smithfield for you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN DAVIS sworn. - Q. You are a drover? - A. I am: On Monday morning I was at the Angel door, between two and three o'clock; I saw the two prisoners there, I knew them before, they came from the Red Lion door; the little one said, b-r your eyes, make haste, and turn them out, for somebody is coming; they turned out the lambs; I don't know how many there were, they turned them all out; then the little one turned them towards the corner of the City Road; then the big one drove them down the City Road; I immediately went to

            , the fieldkeeper, and called him up.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the lambs before? - A. No, I had not; I went with Smith as far as the river, and then I desired the watchman to go with him, and I saw Smith and the watchman bring them both back again in about a quarter of an hour; the lambs were left behind.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you see the lambs? - A.No, it was between light and dark, that I could not see them; they were brown lambs.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CRISP sworn. - Q.You are a watchman at the pens at Islington? - A. Yes, at Pentonville; I was going round my beat between the hours of two and three, and saw the two prisoners sitting at the Red Lion door, opposite the pens; I sat down by them upon the bench for five minutes; while I was sitting there, Williams said to Harris,(upon seeing a drover getting some sheep out of the pens) go and see that they do not mix with the others; then the drover went away with them; I went away directly; the little one said, be quick, let us go and turn them out; and then they went and turned the lambs out, and drove them down the Goswell-street Road.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you observe them particularly? - A. Not when they were driving them down; I did not apprehend but what they had a right.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the way to Smithfield? - A. Not the direct road; the direct road would be down St. John-street; Smith and I pursued them, and overtook them just by Goswell-street turnpike; Williams was in the road, and Harris was down in the field driving the sheep, I look upon it to avoid the gate; I laid hold of Harris, and told him he must go along with me; he did not make me any answer; Smith asked what they were going to do with them, and he said, they had no money, and were going to take them to the Green-yard; we took them to the watch-house, and then I went back, and fetched twenty-nine lambs and one ewe.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you since shewn them to Crace and to Tew? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH SMITH sworn. - Q. You are fieldkeeper we understand? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing said to you by Davis, did you follow the two prisoners? - A. Yes; I took hold of Williams, and asked him what he was doing with the sheep, and he said, they were going to take them to the Green-yard, because they had no money.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you present when they were examined before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know whether what Williams said was taken down in writing? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. EDMUNDS sworn. - Q.Were you present at the examination before the Magistrates? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Was what the prisoner said taken in writing? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Smith.) Do you remember what Williams said before the Magistrate? - A. He said he was going to take them to Mr. Baslington, at Smithfield; he said a countryman ordered him to take them there.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Tew.) Did you tell these boys to take them to Smithfield? - A. No; as for the little one, I never saw him at all; I told the other to take care of them while I went to Smithfield with my note.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Crisp.) What did the little one say about turning them out? - A. He told the other to make haste in turning them out, or they should be too late, or something of that fort.</p>

               <p>Harris's defence. This young man and I were sitting at the Red Lion door; one John Smith was taking some sheep out of the pens, and he called to somebody to help him, and I went and helped him; he went away towards Smithfield; I called out, shall I bring them after you, and he said, yes, and I took them down the Goswell-street Road, because they should not mix with the others.</p>

               <p>Williams's defence. This young man told me the countryman desired him to take them down to Smithfield, and I helped him.</p>

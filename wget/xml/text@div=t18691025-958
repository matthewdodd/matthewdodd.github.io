                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Business Direc<lb></lb>tory of London, and carry on business at 4, Moorgate Street Buildings—the prisoner has been in my employ as canvasser, for a little over two years—his wages were originally 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the shilling upon these class of payments—there was a similar commission upon all books and adver<lb></lb>tisements—the commissions upon advertisements were to be paid in a man<lb></lb>ner specially laid down, and one of the clauses in the form of application which the prisoner filled up is, "All amounts collected must be paid into the office upon the settlement after collection, and in cases where the canvasser has not brought enough money with him to square up completely, and correct</p>

               <p>any errors that may have been discovered in previous accounts, he will re<lb></lb>ceive no work and no pay until he does square up"—the prisoner came into my employ upon that understanding—afterwards I altered his salary to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for lodging-money, and no commission, and if I felt extra satisfied with him and felt inclined to make him a present, I might do so but there was to be no claim beyond, and he was to settle up every week in the same way as before—during that year I made him a present of about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., extra beyond the money that he was entitled to; but taking the whole body of canvassers, I found they had done about half the amount of work, and I thought it advisable to alter the terms again, which I did—I made a third arrange<lb></lb>ment, viz., that they should receive 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the shilling commission, and on all moneys they collected they were to take the commis<lb></lb>sion from it, and send me the difference—after that, on the 29th June, I put up, voluntarily, a memorandum, in my office, that the following can<lb></lb>vassers, on account of their long services, would receive 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—during the present year the prisoner has been receiving 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and a commission of from 16 to 25 per cent.—the moneys are accounted for in the manner set out in this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the numbers here ought to tally with the counterfoil of the receipt-book, consequently, it is impossible to miss a number if you look carefully into the receipt book—it was his duty, specially enjoined upon him, if he had any deductions of any sort or kind to make, to do so when he accounted to me—I made a communication to him in March, in consequence of his being behind hand in a sum of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me as a reason for that, his family difficulties—that the lady he called his wife, and his children were ill—he so worked upon my feeling that I accepted it as a civil debt, and he gave me an I O U for the amount, which from time to time he has paid off a portion of it—he has at times exerted himself rather more than was customary for men to do, and upon those occasions I have sent him, in one case, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he never, until this charge was preferred against him, made any claim against me for 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or of any other kind—he has never told me I owed him that amount for revising sheets—I have not received the sums mentioned in this indictment, viz., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have carefully examined the sheets, referring to the dates on which they were paid—he has never ac<lb></lb>counted to me for them—during the present year he has paid me large sums of money, but he has never made any counter charge against me—there was a settlement on the 28th July, 4th August, the 7th August, the 14th and 23rd, the 2nd and 10th September.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>It is the property of Coulson and Co. there is a bar of it to be produced, part of the seventeen, and it is marked with white lead; it is a very particular order we had, and had a mark C. upon it, it was marked in my presence.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any notion where it was taken from? - I believe it to be taken from Union stairs, because the lighter was carried on board a ship off Union stairs, on the 27th of February, and on the next Monday morning we found the bars had been taken away; it was iron we had shipped off to go on board at Union stairs.</p>
               <p>Where did the ship lay that the iron was to go on board of? - Off Union stairs.</p>
               <p>And where was the lighter on the 27th in the evening? - It was on board the ship; I found seventeen bars missing, and I was obliged to send seventeen more, and I could not obtain a receipt to my satisfaction, because seventeen bars were wanting, till I sent the other seventeen bars.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. When did you miss it? - Not till Monday morning the 28th.</p>
               <p>Was the whole of the foreign order put on board that lighter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the bar of iron from any other circumstance than that letter upon it? - Yes, it appeared to be part of a parcel which had been bought by the company a little while before, and it was pitched or tarred, as it was rather rusty.</p>
               <p>Is not it very usual for iron to be very rusty, and pitched too? - It is not very common, I have seen it once or twice.</p>
               <p>Why can you distinguish one parcel of iron from another by the degree of rust? - No, Sir, but from the marks I will.</p>
               <p>Is not it usual for other merchants and dealers to mark their iron and bars with devices as well as yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For ought you know other iron might be marked with the same letter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the whole alphabet might be marked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not draw that letter yourself? - No, but I saw it done.</p>
               <p>It is not like a hand writing, it is marked with a brush? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you saw a C upon another bar of iron similar to that, could you distinguish that from another? - I think I could from the size of the letter, and the mode of making that letter.</p>
               <p>What part of the bar is the letter upon? - Not quite in the middle.</p>
               <p>It might be two or three inches lower or higher for ought you know to the contrary? - It might.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found this iron in the boat I was in, which was the ship's boat.</p>
               <p>Court to Franks. Is not it usual for watermen to borrow each others boats, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060049"></xptr> to take them when they are pressed without permission? - I never did it, I cannot tell what others would do.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a very good character.</p>

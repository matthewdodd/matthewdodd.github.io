               <p>GEORGE MORRIS. On the 26th of June, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the office of the Morning Post; when I got home I missed my pocket-book from my breast pocket - it contained two 20 l., one 10 l., and three 5 l. notes, and a bill of exchange for 29 l. I knew the numbers of the notes and gave notice at the Bank.</p>

            . I went on the 29th of March, to search the prisoner's lodgings, No. 5, East-street, Manchester-square; in the two pair back-room I found her there, and told her I came about a 20 l. note - she said it was in this old pocket-book, which was on the table - I searched the book and did not find it - I said then,</p>
               <p>"If you don't produce the note I will strip you naked;" she then put her hand under her stays, and produced a note which she said she had picked up in the Strand.</p>

            . I was with Westwood, and began to search the prisoner - I could not find the property on her; she then stated that the note was in the old black book: I looked into one of her boxes - I saw she was putting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070020"></xptr>something behind her with her heel, but she said she had not; I said I would strip her - she then said would we go out of the room, and she would give the book to Mr. Morris; she put her hand under her gown, and pulled out the book, which had a 20 l. note in it; we found five sovereigns in her room, which she said was the change of a 20 l. note, which she had changed the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the book in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Jury to MR. MORRIS. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before? A. Not to my recollection. I took the book out at the office to pay for an advertisement - there was then 70 l. in it; my name and address is in the pocket book; it is mine, and so is the note.</p>

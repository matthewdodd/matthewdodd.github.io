                  </hi>. I am a beer-house keeper of Woolwich. On 4th November, about 6 in the evening, I was at the Ordnance Arms Hotel, Woolwich—the prisoner was there with a comrade, who asked me to drink, but the prisoner did not speak to me—when the pot was out, I paid for another pot of beer—I was there about twenty minutes, and the prisoner made a snatch at my watch with one band, as he held me down with the other—he laid hold of my watch guard; I laid hold of it also, and prevented his taking it, but he broke it from the watch; the chain broke—I had seen him before, and I asked his comrade what his name was—he told me, and I afterwards saw him on 29th November, in the barrack-room at the Marine barracks at Woolwich—I recognised him at once—a policeman was with me—I said, "I charge that man with attempting to steal my watch and guard"—he said, "It was not me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer residing at Woolwich. On the evening of the 4th November I was at the Ordnance Arms, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner—I stopped there a quarter of an hour, and saw the prisoner take the street door in his left hand, snatch the prosecutor's chain with his right, and run away—Moreland said, "My watch is gone!" but it was not, the chain only was broken—I went out to see if I could see the prisoner—I afterwards saw him on 3d December at Woolwich Police Court, and identified him.</p>

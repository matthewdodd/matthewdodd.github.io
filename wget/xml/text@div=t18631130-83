                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live in Sunderland—on Sunday morning, 15th November, about half-past 12 o'clock, I met the prisoner in the street, at Palmer's Folly, St. George-in-the-East—she asked me where I was going—I said, "To seek a bed"—she said, "Come along with me, and I will take you to where you can get a bed"—I accompanied her to a house in the Folly, and when I got in I found it was a brothel, and said</p>

               <p>that I wished to come out again as the place would not suit me, I wanted an apartment to myself—she said that I was all right, and told me to pull my clothes off, and go to bed—I said, "I will not stop," and then she began to haul my jacket off—I asked her to give it me back again, but she took it down stairs, and gave it to the mistress of the house—I followed her down, and said, "I want my jacket; I want to go"—I went towards the front door, but found it fastened—I wanted to call out "Police!"—while I was trying to get to the door, some weapon struck me on the neck—I do not know whether it was a knife or what it was, but I began to bleed fiercely, and then the mistress and the prisoner ran out—it was the prisoner that struck me—I became unconscious from the loss of blood—the mistress of the house called in the police—there was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my jacket pocket, and a tobacco-pouch and knife—I recovered my jacket, but not the money, knife, or pouch—I went to the station, where a surgeon dressed my wounds—I was nearly on the point of losing my senses there—I could not see the light that was burning—I had not struck the prisoner or given her any provocation.</p>

Early on the morning of 15th November, I was called to 14, Palmer's Folly, a brothel kept by Sarah Williams—I there found the prosecutor sitting on a chair, bleeding from a wound on the side of his neck, and a pail by his side, nearly full of blood—I got assistance and took him to the station, where he fainted away—the landlady detained the prisoner, and I took her into custody—she said that the prosecutor struck her and ill-used her, and she struck him on the mouth with a milk<lb></lb>jug—I picked up these pieces of a milk-jug (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which were on the floor covered with blood—they were under the chair and table, and not near the prosecutor—the blood could not have fallen from him upon them.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy two rooms at 14, Palmer's Folly—I am not the landlady of the house—the prisoner had lived with me for three days on 14th November—I came in-doors with a friend, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner, sitting by the fire in the kitchen—she asked him to treat her; he said that he had no money, only threepence—I went up stairs, and just as I was getting into bed, she knocked at the door, and paid, "Here is the man's jacket; he is going to leave it"—presently I heard a disturbance, and went down, and saw the prisoner going to hit him with a glass tumbler—I said, "Do not do that Kitty; go in to bed—they were leaving the kitchen with the intention, as I thought, of going to bed, and I went up stairs, and went to bed—I then heard her and the man having a disturbance, and heard her say, "I will mark you"—I went down again, and saw her take a jug, and strike him on the neck—he hallooed out, "Murder"—I opened the door, and sent a young man for a policeman, who fetched the prisoner back—the jug smashed all to pieces; he fell on one side, and bled very badly—the</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at Commercial-place—on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, 15th November, about 2 o'clock, I found the prosecutor at the police-station, bleeding from an incised wound on the left side of the neck—the flow of blood had been copious—the wound commenced at the upper part of the lobe of the left ear, passing downwards just over the jugular vein, which would have been divided by a little more force—it would not then have fetal, but he would have lost an enormous quantity of blood—they told me he had fainted—he had been drinking—it was a clean-cut wound, about two inches and a half long, such as a milk-jug would make if it was smashed with the blow—if the blow fractured the jug, the part that remained in the hand might produce the cut—it might also have been done with a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I met him and took him home—I asked to pay the landlady two shillings for the bed—he said he had no money, and gave me his coat to keep till next day, when he said he would get some—it was very old, and I should not like to take it—I took it up to the landlady, who told me to let him go. He cruelly ill-used me, and gave me no money, and I own I took the jug, and struck him. He scratched my face, of which I have the marks now, and hit me in the nose and mouth. I struck him in my own defence.</p>

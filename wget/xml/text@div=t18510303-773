                  </hi>. I am single, and live at the Garrick Tavern, in Leman-street. I am a native of Ireland—I arrived in London the second time on 3rd Feb.—I came from Cork to get a situation—when I arrived at Plymouth, a woman came on board as a passenger—we were talking during the passage up—when the boat arrived at Irongate-wharf, she spoke to a young man, and he carried my box through a great many streets, to the house of Mrs. Fisgary, in Mill-yard, Whitechapel, or Rose<lb></lb>mary-lane,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185103030108"></xptr>
               <p>I am not sure which—I saw all the prisoners there except Wallis—the man put the box down, and some of the women rushed out of the room to speak to him, and Mrs. Fisgary <hi rend="italic">hushed.</hi> them—the man was beginning to speak to one of the girls, and Mrs. Fisgary told her to hold her tongue—the man left the box, and went away—there was in my box a black silk visite, two cashmere dresses, four night-shifts, a satin bonnet, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and a variety of small articles not worth men<lb></lb>tioning—Mrs. Fisgary told me to come into the house and make myself comfortable, and asked whether I wanted anything out; I told her I did not, it being early in the day—it was about half-past three o'clock when I arrived at her house—there was a looking-glass and a black brooch in my box—I wanted to go to a register-office, and I asked Mrs. Fisgary for a card of her house; she said she had not a card, but she would send one of her wenches with me, and she sent Kelly—I left my box in charge of Mrs. Fisgary—she said, "Make yourself comfortable; I will take care of you and the things"—I asked Kelly if she knew where the register-office was; she said she did well—we were a couple of hours walking, and she left me at the Paddington Railway-station—I spoke to a policeman near the station—I thought I would find where the house was, and I could not—I saw an Irishwoman, and I spoke to her—I at last got to the police-station without finding the house—I have been to the house since; I did not find my box there—this is my brooch and looking-glass, and veil (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)—they were in the box when it was left at Mrs. Fis<lb></lb>gary's—I am sure that the house to which I was afterwards taken by the policeman, was the house I left my box at.</p>

               <p>of the persons—I never learned French—I did not pass through London to go there; I went to Jersey—I do not know whether "Paris" is written on this looking-glass—I know what is inside it—I do not know what else is on it; it was not such an ornament as I took much notice of—I bought it at a hardware-shop in Cork—I do not know the name of the people—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—this brooch is mine—I got it from a young woman who is now in America; her name is Riley—I have no doubt about this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has it ever happened to you to lose a box before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in March, 1850—I charged somebody before the Lord Mayor with having stolen a box and all that it contained—I bad just come from Cork then—I landed, and some man carried my box, and went away with it—I never saw the man again, and I never will, I dare say—the result of it was, they considered I might be mistaken in the person, and he was dis<lb></lb>charged—I do not know whether a man swore that I was in a public-house at the very time that I said I lost my box—he might have said that unknown to me—the matter was dismissed—the Lord Mayor asked me if I wanted a situation, and he gave me assistance; but he did not give me assistance till I got to Cork—I suppose he thought I was a fool—somebody was sent to the steam-boat, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to the stewardess to give me when I got to Cork—that was in consequence of my destitute situation—I have been here every day since last Monday—I went into some office here—I was asked by one of the gentlemen whether I had ever been in London before, and I denied it; but I was not sworn then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Mansion-house—I was in the Indictment-office on Wednesday, when the prosecutrix came in to pass her indictment—I had a difficulty in preparing the indictment, and I spoke to her, and the moment she spoke I recognized her—I said, "This is not the first time you have been in London—"Indeed it is," she said, "I never was out of Cork in my life"—I did not tease her, nor did I allow a single officer to do so—I recollect her making the charge in March last year—on her denying it so positively I sent for our principal officer, and the one that went down to Gravesend.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and take in needlework—I have known Wallis for the last nine months—I can prove her wearing a veil, and having a bonnet with a veil, and a tippet and fur with it—I do not think this is the veil (<hi rend="italic">the witness here put the veil over her own face.</hi>)—there were two holes in the veil, but the holes appeared to be larger than these are.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Albert-street, and am a nurse at the London Hospital. On Monday, 3rd Feb., I went to Margaret Fisgary's house, about eleven o'clock in the morning—I went to Cable-street to ask if they would take my security for some money—I left her at two—I then went home, and went to bed—I did not see her again till seven.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Adams, of George-street, Spitalfields. On the 25th of September, about ten o'clock at night, I was in Brick lane with my master's cart—there were two coats in the cart—I saw the prisoner on the pavement—he dropped two halfpence against me—he told me he had dropped 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he found 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said, "If you will find the sixpence, you shall have half"—he at first said it was a shilling—I said, "I don't believe you bad one"—he walked round the cart, whipped the coat off, and ran down Wentworth-street with it—I am certain he is the man—he got off with it—I knew him before by sight.</p>

On the 25th of September I was in Wentworth-street—Frazer was coming down to speak to me—I went with him down the street, about 300 yards from the spot—I turned my light on—three men stood in a dark place, and he pointed the prisoner out as the man who took the coat—I secured him—he resisted very much, and threw a handkerchief away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was standing still—he came up to me with another police<lb></lb>man—he said, "Is either of these the lad that was in Brick-lane?"—he said, "I think that is him," and at the station-house he said, "I am sure it is him"—the policeman knocked my hat off my head—my handkerchief fell into the kennel, and he took it up. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not knock his hat off—it might have fallen off his head—it was wrapped up in another hand<lb></lb>kerchief.</p>

I have been in the police seven years—I have had the district of Brick-lane since February last—I am subpoenaed here by the prisoner—on the night the coat was stolen, the witness Frazer came and told me it was stolen from his master's cart—I asked him what sort of a person stole the coat—he said it was a Jew—a <hi rend="italic">low-sized</hi> fellow.</p>

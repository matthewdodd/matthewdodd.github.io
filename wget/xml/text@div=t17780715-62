            , a headborough, came to me on the 11th of June, and asked me if I had lost any sheets, stockings, and shirts; upon examining, I missed several things. He took me to London Wall, then to another place, where some of my goods were; my suspicion falling upon the prisoner who was my servant, I took her up; I had before seen the ferreting concealed under the stairs; I told her to take the ferreting from under the stairs; at first, she denied she knew any thing of it; I repeated my command, and then she went down on her knees and begged forgiveness, and said, she it did at the instigation of a mantua-maker, who said she would make her clothes for nothing if she would bring some of her master's goods.</p>

In January last the prisoner was in my employ, and had been so for three or four years - he left me on the 7th or 8th of January. He handed me over his cash-book some days afterwards. He <rs id="t18240603-204-deflabel1064" type="occupation">had the management of the butcher's-shop</rs>

I saw an order entered in the book from Mr. Charlton, on the 3d of January, and I think it was for three quarters of a hundred weight of beef; he probably ordered it of me, and of Birket also. On Monday, the 5th, or Tuesday, the 6th of January I asked the prisoner if the Leander's bill was paid; he said No - here is an entry of it in his writing in the day-book, but there is no credit given for it in the cash-book. In consequence of what he said I wrote down to the North.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he leave you, and open a shop in the neighbourhood - A. Yes; he was a clever man in business. He remained with me till the Wednesday after, as Law, who succeeded him, requested he might be there; he had a bed-room in my house, but had not slept there for some time - my son slept with him; he did not enter it for several days afterwards - I did not know for a fortnight or three weeks after, that Mr. Charlton had paid him. He did not tell me at the door of the Green Dragon, that 7 l. 10 s. of it was his own, and he would give me the remainder, when I let him have a cistern and some other things belonging to him. There are some other things belonging to him, but I do not know what they are. He said</p>
               <p>"Will it suit you to have a settlement with me to-day, for I am a small trifle in your debt, having received Captain Charlton's money."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it after he was gone, before he said that - A. A few days afterwards.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030073"></xptr>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you several account-books - A. Yes; a cash-book, and several others. The whole of the items are in Birket's own writing - the book is made up to the 3d of January, at which time I appear to be a debtor to him 7 l. 6 s. 9 d., and at that time he gave me up his books, except his private cash-book; this account was always in my possession. I cannot tell exactly when it was made up. I have never said that he was great annoyance to me, and if I could remove him I would, nor anything to that effect; or that he has taken several of my customers away. He had managed my business for some years, but I did not then know of his conduct. I never said that I would have him hanged for signing a receipt - I cannot tell how long it was before I knew this money had been received; it must have been about three weeks. I wrote to Captain Charlton, and he wrote to say he should be in town in a few days. I think it must have been in February.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When Captain Charlton arrived, did you charge the prisoner with this - A. Yes; he could have had his things at any time if he had sent for them. The amount of Captain Charlton's bill was 8 l. 6 s. 9 d. Birket has made a balance due to him of 7 l. 6 s. 9 d., admitting this cash-book to be correct, but it is incorrect; there is a balance due to me; it has been examined by an accountant. I do not know when the prisoner made it up. He took this book away with him, but he let me have it again after some time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did the prisoner cease to be your servant - A. His week ended on Saturday; he was hired by the week, and paid by the week.</p>

            . I dealt with Mr. Battershy, and knew the prisoner. I was in the River in January last, and went to get three quarters of a hundred weight of beef - I ordered it on Saturday, but did not take it till Sunday, the 4th of January. I do not think I saw Birket at all on Saturday, but I saw him on Sunday, when the other man called him down to cut the beef for me; he cut it out, made the bill, and gave it to me. I went down to the ship with it, and in the afternoon I came to the house next door to Mr. Battersby's, and gave Birket a 5 l. Bank note, and four sovereigns - he gave me change. When Birket was called to cut the beef he came from the next door, the public-house.</p>

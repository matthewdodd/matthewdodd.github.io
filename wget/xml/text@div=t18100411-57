On Friday the 9th of March, about half after ten in the evening, I and my wife were going home. We met the prisoner; she asked us to let her have a lodging for that night; we permitted her to come for that night; we got home about twenty minutes before eleven. I went to bed first, and did not awake till the morning, and then the prisoner was gone. On the Thursday following I found her, I charged her with taking away a cloak, apron and a pair of shoes, she had the shoes on her feet.</p>

            . Q. You had known this young woman before this matter happened, had not you. - A. Yes, I consented to her staying in our apartment on Friday night, the 9th of March. We all of us went to bed as soon as we went home; the prisoner laid down in her cloaths; I locked the door myself; between twelve and one she begged to go down to the privy, she went down and left my room door open; I expected her coming up again, she did not return. I went out in the morning before it was light, she was not in the room, then I missed my cloak apron and shoes. On the Thursday following my husband found her; I was fetched, she had my shoes on her feet, I knew they were mine, I had only bought them the day before; the cloak and apron had been pawned. I saw the duplicates of them, the cloak was worth sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the prisoner bore a good character, or else you would not have taken her in. - A. I had not seen her for three or four years, her husband is at sea.</p>

               <p>How long was you down staias before you thought of the watch? - About five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in the house at the time? - I cannot tell; he has owned that he took the watch off the stairs; I did not see him till eight o'clock at night; this was between twelve and one; he was there in the morning; I cannot tell what time; I believe he went out about eight or nine o'clock. (The watch was produced.) That is my husband's watch; his name was on the dial-plate; it is scratched out.</p>

               <p>Where? - Before the Justice; when I taxed him about it, I said I would give him half a guinea if he could tell where it was, and if he had pawned it, I would redeem it; he said he knew nothing of it; he told my chairwoman so; I did not hear it myself.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of May I had been to Kentish Wells; coming back over the fields, I met the prisoner; we called in at a publick-house, and had a pint of beer; he told me he had had a misfortune, that he had lost two guineas in Wapping the night before. He then put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and pulled out a watch; he said he would sell it to make up the money; he said it was his own; he had had it seven years. I cannot swear to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070025"></xptr> the watch. As he was determined to sell it, I told him I would endeavour to help him to a customer. We went to a stable-house, and asked some of the post-boys to buy it; they would not. We took it to a pawnbrokers; he asked twenty-five shillings upon it; the man hesitated a little, and then said he must go to the Rotation-Office; and a constable came in and took him; I went with him to the Rotation-Office.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Berwick-street, Oxford-street. On the 25th of May, the prisoner brought this watch, and asked twenty-five shillings upon it. I looked in the book, and saw it was advertised the day before. I asked him how he came by it; he said it was his own; that he bought it at Manchester, and gave five guineas and five shillings for it eight years before; I said it was very surprising that he should have had it eight years, and yet it was exactly described in the paper the day before; he said he did not know as to that. Upon that I said he must go to the Rotation-Office; it answered the advertisement in the christian name, sirname, place where it was made, and silver watch cock and steel chain.</p>

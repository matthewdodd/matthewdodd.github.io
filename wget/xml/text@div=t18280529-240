            . I am in Hugh McIntosh's employ. I had to drive the horses from St. James's-park to Richmond, to fetch turf to beautify the gardens; the ostler puts the horse corn out in sacks every morning at the stable-yard at Westminster; I was employed for eight days going to Richmond, till the 14th of May - we had about three bushels of chaff and corn every morning to feed fourteen horses. On the 8th of May Hale and Kent gave a sack of corn to Haynes, at the Old George public-house, Brompton; he gave him all that the ostler had given out for the horses; Haynes was at the stable - I saw him give Hale half-a-crown, and Kent told me he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290103"></xptr>had another; I should think it was worth about 5s.; Mr. McIntosh's name was on the cart - Haynes took the corn into the stable and stowed it; he returned the sack directly, and they went away; when Kent heard that Mr. McIntosh had heard of it, he came to me and said he would give me three sovereigns if I would say nothing about it - I told of it last Saturday week, not before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you mention the three sovereigns at Bow-street? A. Yes - I do not know whether my evidence was read over to me; I believe it was; I did not see what was in the sack - it was given out to us as corn; I abused Kent, because the corn was not given to the horses - I had no money; they offered me beer several times, but I refused it - I had one pint with them; I did not like to make a disturbance about it, as I had only been there a few days - I had no quarrel with them about a jacket, it was with another servant; I did not mention it till after that - we had the nose-bag full for the horses to eat.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any quarrel with them? A. No; the horses had nothing more than was in the corn-bin - Colopy was with me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the sacks filled? A. Yes - 5s. 6d each would be a fair price for them; I knew it was for the horses - I did not like to tell master, but I did three days after; I only see the foreman once a week - I had part of the beer which was bought with the money - I cannot say how much I drank; they were taken up about a week after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Wilkinson Kershaw and John Lowe; they are linendrapers, and live in London-street, Greenwich. On Saturday night, the 7th of Dec., the prisoner came to the shop about half-past nine o'clock—she asked to look at calico, ribbon, and different articles, which I served her with—when I put the ribbons before her she said, "Are these all you have got; they will not suit me"—I went and got another box—I had sold her some calico and some rib<lb></lb>bon—there was a bill made out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Kershaw and Lowe. On the 7th of Dec. I saw Walker serving the prisoner—he placed a box of ribbons before her—she said none would suit her—while he went for another box, she put her hand into the box that was on the counter, took some ribbon, and placed it under her cloak and down her bosom—the policeman was sent for, and just as she got outside the door, leaving the shop, I went up to her and said, "I give you in charge for taking some ribbons out of the shop, and you have got them down your bosom"—the policeman said, "Now, give them up"—she hesitated, put her hand up, took two lengths of ribbon out, and attempted to drop them behind her—the policeman caught hold of her hand—she was taken to the station, and I there charged her with taking the piece that I first saw her take out of the box, which was a light green ribbon—she was searched, and it was found on her—this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of a shop is your employer's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is one of the largest in Greenwich; there are fourteen young men and apprentices in it—there were not above half a dozen other persons in the shop at that time—I was three or four yards from Walker—I only saw the prisoner take one piece of ribbon, the green—she was then going out—I told her I saw her take a piece of ribbon, and she produced two remnants—this green piece measures thirty-one yards, at 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I swear this is the piece I saw her take—there is no shop-mark on this—these other two have a mark—I saw her put her hand in, and apparently take some<lb></lb>thing out of the box where ribbon was—I could not distinguish the colour of this by gaslight.</p>

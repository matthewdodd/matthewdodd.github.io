                  </hi>. My master lives at No. 55, Aldgate—I was standing near his door, on Friday, the 2nd of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way at a linen-draper's shop—I saw the prosecutrix looking in at the window—I saw the prisoner take from the prosecutrix's pocket a red purse, and show it to two young men, who were in her company—the instant she took it she walked slowly away—the young men walked with her—I ran after Bourn, and told her—the prisoner was pursued and taken.</p>

I was standing at the door of Mr. Wright with Lamb, who called my attention to the prisoner—I saw her take the purse from her cloak, and show it to the two young men who were walking with her—Lamb went after the prosecutrix—I was attending to a customer, and when I had done I went towards Aldgate, and saw her secured in Houndsditch—I am certain of her—I have seen her before—she was taken about two hundred yards off.</p>

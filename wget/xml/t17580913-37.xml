I asked them the way to St. John's-street; she directed me through an alley, which I have heard since is called <placeName id="t17580913-37-crimeloc195">Thatch'd-alley</placeName>

I had 2 s. 6 d. in one pocket, and 3 d. in half-pence, in another; I did not feel them take the half-pence, though I missed them afterwards, the silver they did not take. When she had her hand in my coat pocket, I cried out murder, and was going to call murder again, and Spencer clapt his hand upon my mouth, and almost strangled me.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you distinguish their faces?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light ?</p>
               <p>Hart. It was not moon light, but I had seen the woman in Chick lane before I went into the alley; I had hold of her hand when she had the watch in her hand: she said you bloody thief, let my hand go; I had given myself over, and did not expect I should live another minute, then the old woman, that is my witness, was coming by she saw the whole thing; she got a light, and came with it, then they made off; I am certain they were the two prisoners that are now at the bar. I was left all over of a gone blood. (He produced two handkerchief's, one he had about his neck at the time, and the other he whiped himself with, both very bloody.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Hart. No, I never did; they were both taken up the next day, and carried before Mr. Alderman Bethell, who committed them both to the Compter, she would not own that she took the watch from me, but said that one

               <p>Hart. She tried, and I believe felt my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hart. This was as I was striving to go back; she damn'd my eyes and limbs, and began to pull me about; she was endeavouring to take my watch from me, while it was in my breeches pocket, and she had hold of me when he came up; some had hold of my hands, and some my cloaths; there were four concerned, two men and two women; I could not describe the other man and woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to distinguish the man at the bar?</p>
               <p>Hart. There was a lamp in the place, just by Chick-lane, by which I could see him, as he came up to me.</p>

               <p>Hart. He struck me over the head.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. I go out a washing and scowering; as I was coming along Mary Bulger and this young man were together, (meaning the prosecutor) she said d - n your eyes stand up, presently came Richard Spencer, and said you bloody thief what do you do here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Bulger before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did very well, she liv'd just opposite me; Spencer with his stick knocked the young man down, that was the first thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Spencer before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did, when I lived near Clerkenwell-green, he used to come by with droves.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was the person?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I am, I saw his face very well, by the light of the lamp, which was as light as a candle.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the name of the alley.</p>
               <p>Potts. It is called Thatched-alley; his mouth was full of blood, and his lips were swelled, and he wiping himself, and crying; he related to me how he had been robbed of his watch and some money, and I think he asked for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had lost a handkerchief?</p>

               <p>Seargood. I live in great Ormond-yard, near Queen's-square, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was this?</p>
               <p>Seargood. It was a quarter before nine o'clock, he came before the bellman came, and the bell-man generally comes by nine, or at half an hour after nine the second time, he comes twice. I carried my letter down to the bellman, and paid fourpence for the letter, and a penny for the bell-man; I left him in the room while I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain as to the time ?</p>
               <p>Seargood. I am sure it could not be ten o'clock, because the bellman always comes twice before ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go away?</p>
               <p>Seargood. When I returned from the bellman he was in my room, and I fetched him a pot of beer, and got him some bread and cheese, and he staid in my room all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie alone, or with any body?</p>
               <p>Seargood. He laid with my two children, and I lay below with my landlady; he has laid so many a night at my house.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you there. - A. I called there to have a pint of beer to refresh myself; I went out after a few more things and left them in the house; when I came back my parcel was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for charging the prisoner. - A. There was no one in the house but the prisoner and a shoemaker; I saw the goods about two hours after they were found in his house; the landlord of the public house found them.</p>

            . Q. You are the landlord of the public house. - A. Yes. Mr. Johnson when he came back enquired for the parcel he had left; I then enquired who had left the tap room; my wife said an old man that was drinking along with the shoemaker; I suspected it was the prisoner. I went for a constable and brought him to find the prisoner, and Mr. Johnson and the constable were sitting in the parlour; this man came in as if he had not done any thing. I charged him with it, he made slight of it, and said he did not mean to keep it; I took him into the parlour and searched him; I told him it would be best to tell me where the bundle was, and I would endeavour to make it up with Mr. Johnson and him. He took me to his room, and there was the parcel; I brought him back to Mr. Johnson, and the constable took charge of him.</p>

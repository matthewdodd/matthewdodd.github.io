                  </hi>. I am an optician of 93, Fleet-street—about four years and a half ago the prisoner was in my employment—on 24th July, about half-past 4, I saw him come in at the shop door—I had not seen him that day before—Mr. Graham, who is in my employ, was at the time behind the counter in the shop—the prisoner was without a hat—I did not hear what he asked for—he appeared intoxicated—he seized hold of Mr. Graham, and a scuffle ensued—he fell down, and Mr. Graham said, "My God, he has broken my leg"—I saw him on his knees near the door—about two years ago Mr. Graham had occasion to remove him for coming in intoxicated, and he then said, "If it is twenty years to come I will have you; you are Mr. West's bully"—who had no instruments belonging to the prisoner; nothing at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. West's employment—on 24th July, about 9 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in—I had known him between three and four years, by sight—he produced some Brazilian pebbles, and asked if Mr. West would buy them—he came again about mid<lb></lb>day, I think he was sober then, and then again about 4 o'clock—he was not sober on that occasion; he came without a hat, and in a great state of excitement from drink—Mr. West was in the counting-house—I had had a communication from him about the prisoner—he asked to see Mr. West—I told him Mr. West would have nothing to say to him—I opened the door and asked him to go out—he did not go—I said, "You had better go," or "leave the premises"—I then laid hold of his arm to induce him to leave the shop; he held back and resisted—I let go of him to move some in<lb></lb>struments that were in the way, to get a clear passage to induce him to go out, and he seized hold of me and threw me down—I felt great pain immediately I was down, and found my right leg was entirely useless—I was assisted up and conveyed to the hospital—I was there forty-six days; the knee joint was put out, and there was laceration of the lateral tendons; it is still in a splinter—I walk with crutches—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—I had no tools of his—I have been in Mr. West's employ between three and four years—I do not remember the prisoner working for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—Graham was brought there on 24th July, and remained till 8th September—the internal lateral ligament of his knee joint was lacerated, and the joint in consequence became inflamed; it was not dislocated—the injuries are not likely to be of a permanent character—I think he will recover from them—such injuries could have been caused by violently throwing a man down; the leg got twisted under—I should think it would be three months before the one leg is as well as the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you aware what was entered in the hospital book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I entered it myself; it was not entered as a supposed sprain, that would indicate nothing.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">BARROW</hi>. I was in Mr. West's counting-house, heard a scuffle, looked up, and saw the heads of the prisoner and Mr. Graham, and then heard a great blow or fall—I rushed into the front of the shop, and found Mr. Graham on one knee, and the prisoner had just recovered himself from a fall, I presume, close to him—I heard nothing said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did Mr. West order you to go for a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gave me no order, but I said to him, "Give the rascal into custody imme<lb></lb>diately," and to my astonishment he demurred to that—I being an invalid could not go, or I should most certainly have done so—I went to the shop door, but I could not cross to the Police-station; the traffic was so great—I called out for Mr. West's foreman, and I believe Mr. West did too—we raised Mr. Graham between us—you did not say you had come for your instruments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> T he only thing I can say is that Mr. Graham and I were on perfectly good terms. I went to the shop on that day, and offered him some pebbles, and he said Mr. West was not there then; they were good samples, and he would very likely buy them. It is very easy to say a man is drunk when he comes in without his hat. Mr. West came out and said, "Chuck the b—b—out of the shop;" that is his regular language. Mr. Graham laid hold of me, and fell on me; he is much bigger than I am; it is not likely I should take hold of him. Mr. West prevented me being bailed at the station-house, which shows the animus he has against me. <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner called</hi>

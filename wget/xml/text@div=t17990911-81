             sworn. - I live in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's; I met with the the prisoner about half past ten on Sunday, the 7th of July last, in Broad-street, St. Giles's; she asked me if I wanted a lodging, and she went with me to shew me a lodging in <placeName id="t17990911-81-crimeloc436">Dyot-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Why did not you stop her? - A. She was too quick for me and she knew the stairs better than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes; I only took a share of a couple of pots of beer with another.</p>
               <p>Q. Your own lodging was in Buckridge-street? - A. Yes; I went home and they were gone to bed, and I had rather pay for my lodging than disturb them; I had lodged in that house going on five years.</p>

               <p>Q. It was a common lodging house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they always go to bed so early? - A. Yes; the pawnbroker has got my handkerchief, but the watch was never found.</p>
               <p>Q.Was she not to sleep with you? - A. Yes; I agreed at last to give her a shilling in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not agree to give her the handkerchief? - A. No, nothing but the shilling; I found her out the next day and took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure you did not give her the handkerchief? - A. Yes; I would not give it her, any more than I would cut my head off.</p>
               <p>The pawnbroker produced the handkerchief, stating, that he took it in of the prisoner on the 8th of July, and which was deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

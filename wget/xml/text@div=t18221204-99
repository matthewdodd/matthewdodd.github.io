I was about five minutes attending to him, and noticed him, as I suspected him, as he redeemed something pawned in a different name. I saw him at the office on Monday, and was positive to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and took him on Monday to the building, where the opening had been made, and fitted his shoes to the foot marks on the ground; there were three impressions particularly deep, and all of the same size. I told him to put his foot into them, and it fitted exactly. There were no nails in the shoe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why not take his shoe off and compare it - A. I thought it fairer for him to put his foot in, as he might say I disturbed the mark. He did not object to it. They were right and left marks, and of a common size. I said it was very odd your shoes fit this mark exactly. He made no reply. It was a stiff clay soil.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left work about six o'clock as usual, and took the keys to my master's house, and staid there till twenty minutes past eight; then went and had a glass of gin, and went to Little Coram-street; remained there till half-past eleven. I had a swollen face, and a handkerchief over it. I then went to the Marquis of Cornwallis public-house, and then to bed; and on Monday morning about eleven, when I was at work, a man came, and said Scott and the officer had been after me. I went over to Scott, but he was not there. I returned to work, and between two and three o'clock the officer came. He took me to the building, and put my feet into the marks; they did not fit by half an inch at the toe, but he said they were a good fit. I said they did not by half an inch.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Whitby, in Yorkshire, and am captain of the <hi rend="italic">John Murray</hi> brig—I know a woman named McCarthy—on 12th November, I was in London, and met her about 4 o'clock, in Tooley-street—we went to a public-house there, and had a pint of beer, or half-and-half; we had one or two more pints along the Borough till we came to the George public-house, in Mint-street—I then had 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a leather purse, in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, in my left-hand pocket—I changed a half-sovereign at the George, and the silver was in my right-hand pocket—I took that half-sovereign out of my watch-pocket—it was not in the purse with the other gold—I am certain I had the purse containing the gold in my pocket when I was at the George—there were about five or six people in front of the bar at the time—I suppose I treated them all—I called for a pot of beer—I have no doubt they would all take a drink of it—a short time elapsed, and I was knocked down on the floor, my nose broken, and the money taken out of my pocket—I called out to the landlord to assist me—I had no assistance, and the men who had done this got away—there were one or two on top of me—they unbuttoned my trousers, and took my money out—I felt some one take it out of my pocket—I will take my oath the prisoner was there; but I will not say he got the purse; I cannot tell who got it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the George beershop, Mint-street, Southwark Bridge-road—on 12th November, I saw the prosecutor in front of my bar—there was a disturbance when he came in—he asked for a glass of ale—while he was calling for it, some parties came into the place, and they wanted a pint of ale, and the prosecutor said he would fill a pint of ale, and would pay for it—he gave me sixpence, and I gave him threepence</p>

I live at 23, White-street, Southwark—on the afternoon of 12th November I met the prosecutor, and went with him into one or two public-houses in the Borough, and afterwards to the George, in Mint-street—I had some beer there with him—the prisoner and two more men, and five females were in front of the bar at the time—the prosecutor was rather drunk—I had advised him to go home—when we went into the public-house, he said he would treat us to a glass before we parted—he called for two pints of ale, one after the other—he drank to all of them round—the prisoner then came and stood at his left-hand side, and a man with one eye, at his right-hand side—I turned round to give Robert Dower a glass of ale, and I saw the prisoner catch hold of the captain, hold up his left arm, and put his hand into his left trouser's pocket and pull out a purse—the man with one eye held him by the right hand, and turned his right hand backwards—the captain tried to pull his purse back from the prisoner, but the prisoner pulled him towards the door, on the ground, and the man with the one eye gave the captain a violent blow on the face, and they both ran away—the captain screamed for the landlord's assistance, who was standing inside the bar—the landlord never came to assist us—I ran and caught the prisoner, by a white linen jacket which he wore—he turned back, called me a very bad name, and struck me on the forehead, and knocked me backwards—I screamed for "Police," and returned back to the beershop—I afterwards went to the station to give information of the prisoner, and the publican, Mr. Hester, gave me into custody—I was after<lb></lb>wards discharged, and I gave the police some information, and the prisoner was apprehended at Shad well—he said he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would say no more about it—I went to Shad well with the female he lives with, and Dower, to the house where the prisoner lives—I stayed at the Jolly Sailors,</p>

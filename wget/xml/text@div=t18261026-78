On the 14th of October, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down stairs for a light, and heard the first-floor room door shut - when I came down I saw the prisoner; she turned her back, and knocked at the back-room door - I asked what she wanted - she said a straw bonnet-maker; I said if she would go down stairs I would ask my mistress - she said, "Very well;" I went and told my mistress; she was then gone; I ran out, and saw her running across Barbican; I got up to her, and told her to come back; she said she could not, for she had made a mistake - I pulled her back; she said she had got nothing, but this gown was found under her shawl.</p>

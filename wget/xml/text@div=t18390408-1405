                  </hi>. I am a potato-salesman, in Spitalfields market. Between seven and eight o'clock, on the 12th of April, I was opposite the Mint, and as I entered the Minories I saw a van, and the prisoner walking behind it, trying to get a box from it—I suspected him, as the van was going along, and</p>

               <p>watched him—he kept trying to get it at different turnings, and opposite Rosemary-lane he tried again, without effect—opposite the Mint he took the box out of the tail of the van—I let him go about ten yards with it—I ran immediately, caught hold of him, and charged him with stealing it from the van—he said, "You did not see me"—I called the policeman, who came and took him.</p>

On the 11th of January, about eleven o'clock at night, I was going home, and saw the prisoner in Broad-street; I had known her for two years, as a girl of the town - I took her home to my master's stables, and while I was asleep she ran off with my watch, which she took from my fob. I awoke about half-past six o'clock, and she was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long is it since you seduced this girl from her friends, brought her to London, and deserted her - A. I do not know that. I did come to town with her - she did come to town at my solicitation; I gave her money occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not tell you she had not a shoe to her feet, and you gave her the watch to pawn, to get shoes - A. No; I was never at her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave her when you brought her to town - A. In Little Shepherd-street, in the street - I met her this night by accident; I gave her no money.</p>

            . The prosecutor brought the prisoner to the watch-house, on the 12th of January; she positively denied it - I was going to enter the charge, and she called Cadman aside; he then came to me, and said the property was at her lodgings. She took me to a room in Westminster, where a man and two women were; she said</p>
               <p>"Mary, will you go to my room, and bring me something in a silk handkerchief," she refused - one of the men went, and brought her a handkerchief, containing the brooch and watch.</p>

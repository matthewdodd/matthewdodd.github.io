On Monday, the 20th of March, he was from home, and I was minding the house for him—about six o'clock in the evening I observed in the till a crown piece, three sixpences, and a fourpenny piece—I left the bar for about ten minutes, leaving my wife there—when I came back I directly went to the till, and missed the crown piece and three shillings—it was my son's money—this is the crown now produced—I can swear to it by a mark across the back of the head—I had taken it about an hour before, and took particular notice of it.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I was with him, mind<lb></lb>ing my son's house—about six o'clock that evening my husband went away from the bar for a short time—while he was away the prisoner came in, and asked if my son was at home—I said, "No"—he said he wanted to borrow 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had a slight knowledge of him—I told him I could not lend it him, but my husband was in the yard—he went into the yard, returned, and said Mr. Smith was not there—I went into the kitchen, leaving him in front of the bar—he said he could not wait any longer, and went out—my husband afterwards came in, and missed the money—I had not been to the till—no one had come in or gone out but the prisoner, while my husband was absent.</p>

On Monday, the 20th of March, I went out, leaving my father and mother in care of the house—I know the prisoner—after being informed what had happened, I went after him with a policeman, and gave him into custody—my till is just under the counter—it could easily be got at from the front of the bar, by reaching over the counter.</p>

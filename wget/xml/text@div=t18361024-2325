                  </hi>. I reside at Sunbury. The prisoner was in my employ for a long time as carter—on the 6th of October I sent him with a cart of straw to Fulham—the cart left my premises about two o'clock in the morning—I followed him till it came to the Castle at Isleworth—there I saw him put down a truss of straw—I got there a little before five o'clock—I had followed him all the way, sometimes on my pony and sometimes on foot—he pursued his journey—I waited some time to see if any one came to take it—there was no one up—I then went to Brentford; after a policeman—they would not come off their beat—I came back and saw the straw in the same place, at the yard where I left it—I took off the band of it, and put it into my pocket—I then went to Hounslow, called up a constable, and took him to the place, and the straw was gone—I called the ostler, and asked him to give my horse a feed of corn—I went into the stable and saw the straw there—I said to him, "You have only got one</p>

               <p>band to it"—I knew it directly—the bands were made with wheat-straw and rye, with a machine, not as they generally are—all the straw loaded on that cart was from my farm, and the bundles were made in a particular manner.</p>

On the 6th of October I was called at five o'clock in the morning, and apprehended the prisoner and his little brother—I accompanied them to the Magistrate—I put them in the cage—the prisoner said at first that he found he had got one truss too many, and wished to take it back; but afterwards he said he had taken the truss to sell it, and his little brother knew nothing about it.</p>

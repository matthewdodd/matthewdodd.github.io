            . I live in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. On the 6th of December, between five and six o'clock, I was by Bass's house, on the same side of the way, two or three steps from his shop door, and saw a man come out of the private door. I cannot exactly say who it was. I have seen the prisoner at the office; but I have seen a man since, so much like him, that I cannot say whether he was the man. It was dark - the man had a bundle under his arm, and the tail of a coat hung out. He went to two persons who were waiting at the corner of the street - he joined them - they walked away together. The one who came out of the house carried the bundle. I returned and told Bass the private door was open. Tegg and I went in pursuit. The one who came out of the house, was dressed in a blue or black coat; one of the others, in a fustian jacket and trowsers, and white apron. We found two men together at the corner of the street, and one of them was putting a great coat on - he had a black coat on. I pointed him out to Tegg, who asked him to give him the coat. He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! you are mistaken." Tegg asked me if that was the person that came out of the house. I said, Yes. I thought him the man at that time He walked away. I do not know what became of the great coat. The same two were with him whom I had seen at the corner; they walked away with him; he turned round to one of them, and said,</p>
               <p>"Harry, don't leave me." He still went on with the coat on; the other two ran away, and he struck Tegg several times, before he attempted to take him. He was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You were merely passing by - Yes; I had not observed whether the street door was open before he came out. I do not now believe the prisoner to be the man, because I have seen another like him.</p>

            , and is worth above 30 s. It hung in the passage with the pelisses, by the private door. I cannot say the door was not left open. Westwood alarmed me. I followed with him - and in Golden-square, about ten yards off, I saw a man putting on the great coat; he pointed him out; another person in a fustian jacket, was by his side. I charged the man with having the coat on - he was walking on, and struck me, and ran away. I only saw one of his companions. The man who was putting the coat on, had a dark coat; I think it was blue. He struck me three times, and ran away. I pursued, I followed, crying Stop thief! but could not overtake him - he got away with the coat on. I saw the prisoner on that night at the Sun, public-house, Bedfordbury, and believed him to be the man - I am not positive. I think that it was a taller man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your belief now - A. I think he is not the man.</p>

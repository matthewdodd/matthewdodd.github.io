                  </hi>. I am station-master at the Stratford station on the Eastern Counties Railway—there is an unoccupied house belonging to the Company there—I had the charge of it—I saw a copper safe there at half-past two o'clock on Wednesday, the 13th of the Jan., and missed it about the same time the next day—it had been taken away from the brick-work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stratford. On the 13th of Jan. I was in a field called Piper's-field, at Stratford, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the two prisoners—I had known them before—they were carrying something in a bag—I know the empty house belonging to the Railway Company—the prisoners were coming in a direction from there—Howard asked what they had got there—M'Cleod said it was an iron sauce<lb></lb>pan he then said it was a copper—Howard asked him how he had got into the empty house—M'Cleod said there was a pane of glass broken, that he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it in, and they got in at the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in company with Mahoney in Piper's-field on the 13th of Jan.—I saw the prisoners coming with a bag, with something in it—I asked what they had got—they said an iron saucepan—I felt round it, and said, "It is more like a large copper"—they said it was, and told me not to say anything at all about it—I walked away, and never said anything more to them—Gentry said they had got it out of a house—I asked him how they got in—he said there was a pane of glass out, and he opened the shutters and got in—they took us to the station, because they found us in a house, and we told them it was not us, but we told who were the persons.</p>

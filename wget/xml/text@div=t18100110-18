On the 4th of December last, my son had occasion to go in the City on business; he came home and told me, that he had seen a pair of shoes of mine in Mr. Atterbury's window; he is a pawnbroker, in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. I went there and saw eight pair of my shoes. On the 6th, I found two pair at Mr. Wright's, a pawnbroker, in White Cross-street, and two pair at Mr. Williams's, pawnbroker, Barbican. On Tuesday the 4th, I went to the house of the female prisoner, she was at home; there were two young women at home, and I think another of her sons was at home; her husband was not at home. The officer searched her, he took four duplicates out of her pocket, one of which was for a pair of shoes. He afterwards searched the room, and found a quantity of leather, some whole skins and some in pieces. Her other son, who was a shoemaker, was at work in his father's house; he separated his from mine. I found there twelve pair of shoes. The female prisoner said, she was very sorry for what had happened. She fell on her knees and said, what happened I am the cause of this; she asked, if I would forgive her; I told her I did not wish to hurt the hair of her head, but I wished to have my property back again. I told her my daughter had lost a pair of scissars; she gave me the silver part of a pair of scissars. The boy prisoner was at my shop when the officer took the female prisoner; he came to my house. I said to the boy Walter, put on your hat and go with that gentleman: he went with the officer. I never found any thing upon the boy. I had the most unbounded confidence in him, nor do I know of any thing done by him.</p>

            . I am an officer. After I had been to the house of the woman prisoner, and had taken her in custody, I went to Mr. Wood's house; the lad was there, and he gave charge of him to me. In going to the office, I told him his mother was in custody; he asked me for what; I told him, for stealing some shoes: and I shewed him a pair of silver bows belonging to a pair of scissars. I asked him, if he knew any thing about them; he said, he found them in his master's yard. He was very much alarmed when he found his mother was in custody.</p>

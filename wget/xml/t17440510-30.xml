               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Were you to satisfy her for her risque.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. No; she was to run the risque herself. I showed her to Mr. Alexander's door, and she went and proved the will. I went home, and sent Aickin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100035"></xptr> and the Prisoner to Mr. Parr's in Crutched Friers, but they could not dispose of it there. He asked her some questions, and she said three ways two years: he asked her how long her husband had been on board, and she said two years: he asked how long he had been dead, and she said two years; and she said two years to another question: he said he believed she did not come honestly by it. Then I went to Gulliland in St. Catharine's, and he could not get it sold directly; Gulliland, Aickin, and I, went to the Ticket Office, and had it cast up - it was about 30 l. Some time afterwards Gulliland, the Prisoner, and I, went to a notary publick not a great way off, and who should come in while we were there but Mr. Tarver a merchant, and the bill of sale was made over to Mr. Tarver, (Aickin waited at the Woolpack in Birchin Lane.) After it was filled up, Mr. Tarver asked her to write her name, and she said she could not write, but she would set her mark; and Mr. Tarver said it is no matter whether you can write or no, for your mark will hang you as well as your hand writing. Gulliland, the Prisoner, and I, went into the Woolpack, Gulliland had a 20 l. note of Alderman Hankey's, which was payable to Mr. Tarver, and Gulliland brought the money; it was part in Portugal gold, and part in guineas; then Gulliland, the Prisoner, and I, went to the King's Arms Tavern in Lombard Street, and there he gave me the money, I think it was 15 l. or 16 l. - He said he knew the name as well as I, and that he had as much right to it as I, and he had three or four pound gratis besides 3 s. 6 d. in the pound, which he kept for the discount of the ticket; and I was not willing to make words about it, because I knew how it was, and the last day of January I put all of them in my information voluntarily before any body else, - I gave the Prisoner two guineas for her trouble, and I gave Aickin two guineas and a half; the Prisoner grumbled, and thought she had not enough, and I told her I would satisfy her, and I believe I gave her some silver to buy some fish.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Oh you wicked rogue to draw so many poor innocent people in!</p>
               <p>Sherlock. You drew yourselves in, as well as I drew you in; I think I did very well to bring you all to justice, or else you would have brought me to it, I only catched you first. She has been with me several times since to ask me if I had any more business for her to do.</p>

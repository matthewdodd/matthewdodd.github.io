                  </hi>. I am a reporter, living at 6, Red Lion-street, Woolwich. I recollect on 8th Jan. making an inquiry of Lee with respect to a certain debt dut to Lee by Crawford—I asked him whether he had got any not of hand, or any acknowledgement against Crawford relative to the debt—he said he had not, and that Crawford knew well enough that he had no acknow<lb></lb>edgement—he said that he could not read or write—I asked him if he would give me an account of how he lent him the money—he said he had lent 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Crawford, and he paid back 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by instalments; that the first payment was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the second 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the third 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the last 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he after<lb></lb>wards borrowed another soverign from him—I told him that Crawford was summonmed for a debt of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said nothing more then with regard to it—on the 14th Jan., before the cause was called on, I asked Lee, in the presence of his son-in-law, in the Court, if he had got any document from Crawford acknowledging the debt, and he said he had not—I said, if he had any document I would be much obliged to him if he would let me know, as it would save a great deal of trouble, and he declared to me he had not—the cause was called on, and I appeared for Crawford—after Lee had made his complaint, I sai, before the Judge in the Court, if there were any docu<lb></lb>ments I should like them to be produced—Lee then produced a paper to the Usher, which was handed to the Judge; and in reply to the Judge, Lee stated that it was written by a lad, and that Crawford signed it in the presence of his wife—I do not know whether he meant Crawford's wife or his own wife—the Judge made an order for the amount of the debt.</p>

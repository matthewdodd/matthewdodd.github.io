            . I am a watchman in St. John street. I was crying half past two up St. John-street, these three men came opposite of me on the same side that Mr. Cooper lives; one said, you go of the other side, you will see. I suspected them; I pulled off my shoes, and watched them down the street; two of them got to Mr. Cooper's yard, they opened the door and went in, they gave a whistle, and the other crossed over to them. I went over to the gate with my shoes in my hand, and listened at the gate, I heard one of the coach doors open, one of them said, let that alone, come on I then put on my shoes and sprang my rattle, directly the gate opened, and out ran one of them. I shut the gate to, and shut the others in; I halloaed out stop thief, he is gone towards St. Johns-lane. One of the patrols stopped him, I kept at the gate and sprang my rattle again for my other partners to come up to my assistance; a man that lived facing of the gate asked what was the matter, and said he had got the key of the gate. I told him to make haste down with it, there were two others inside. When he came down with the key we went in with a light; we searched about, we found one in a coach, and the other in the harness room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that ran away - A. Harwood.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was in St. John-street; I heard the rattle spring about a quarter before three; I ran to Carliste's assistance, he said there were some persons in the gate; I entered the yard, the first thing I saw was a large blue coat laying on a splinter bar of a carriage, I went further down the yard, I found Moore pretending<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180051"></xptr>to be asleep in one of the coaches; I hit him and he made as if he was awaking; I took hold of him and pulled him out; I took him to the watchhouse, I returned, and then my partner had got Knight. We took him to the watchhouse,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You found Moore in the coach, you struck him with your cutlass - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to say he was not asleep - A. His eyes were shut, as far as his being asleep I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are not asleep when you know there is forty pounds reward upon each of their convictions - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>NEHEMIAH BRICKNELL. I am a coachman, I drive for Mr. Cooper. I came home about half-past twelve, and left the yard about one, on the night of the robbery; I am sure I left my coat in the stable; I saw it the next morning at the magistrate's.</p>

            . I am a constable, I was along with the watchman, I saw Knight taken out of the harness room; I took this latch key from him, which opens Mr. Cooper's gate; Knight acknowledged it to be Mr. Cooper's.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SEAGRAVE. I am a patrol, I heard the rattle springing; Carlisle said, that is him running towards St. John's-lane; I saw Harwood, and stopped him in Peter's-lane. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Knight's Defence. When I was taken to the watch-house, I stated that the key was my own which I bought when I went into Mr. Cooper's service.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How is this connected with your house - A. We have no other way to go to the house, but into the house, the dwelling house is in the yard. All the men have a key to let themselves in.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Knight behave when he was with you - A. Very well, I never know any dishonesty of him except taking away the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do not you know it is a common thing for them to sleep in coaches - A. Not my men, I never had one of my men to sleep in the coaches in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bricknell. You are a hackney coachman, are you not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not an unusual thing for hackney coachmen when they are drunk, to go into coaches to sleep - A. It is an usual thing.</p>
               <p>Knight called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Moore called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

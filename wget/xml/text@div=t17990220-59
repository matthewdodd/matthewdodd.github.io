On the 24th of January, in the night, or early in the morning of the 25th, the horse was gone; my servant called me up about six o'clock, as near as I can guess, and told me of it; I said, which horse is it; and he said, Prince; and that very day, the 25th, I found my horse in Smithfield, tied up to the rail; I looked at him, and said to a man, of the name of Duffield, who is here, what is this horse to fell; he said, yes; I said, what do you ask for him; he said, thirteen guineas; says I, I should like to see him go a little, is he a found one; he said, he did not know; I said, is he a good drawer; he answered me, yes; pray how long have you had him; he said, sir, I had him this morning; says I, it is my horse, pray how came you by him this morning; he said, it was not his horse, but he was a servant to Mr. Life; I said, where is Mr. Life; he said, he would fetch him, but I would not let him go without me; I went with him to Mr. Life, at the King's-head, in Smithfield; he called to his master, and said, master, this is a stolen horse we have got here, this gentleman owns it; I had told the man, it was stolen from me, and I would swear to him; Life said immediately, I changed for him this morning, and I gave the man three guineas and a half, and a poney; I said, that is nothing to me, for if you do not find the man, I will keep you and your man both in custody; I sent the horse to the Rose and Crown, in Smithfield; and going across Smithfield with Life's man, he saw the prisoner at the bar upon a poney; Life's man went up to him, and said, that was a stolen horse Mr. Life had of you; I said, get off the poney, for the horse that you have been changing for him, belonged to me; says I, how came you by this horse; why, says he, I bought it yesterday in the afternoon, about three o'clock, at Epping; I said, who did you by it of, at Epping; he said, he did not know; says I, pray what might you give for it; he said, five guineas and a half. I then sent from the Rose and Crown, for an officer from Hatton-garden, and he was taken away. I never saw the prisoner before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your horse? - A. Yes, it was a bay gelding, about sixteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was on your premises, on the 24th of January? - A. I am not sure, for I have another farm; and I cannot say that I had seen my horse for three or four days; my servant is here, who looked after the horses.</p>

             sworn. - I am a butcher, I work for Mr. Life, he deals in different kinds of stock, he buys horses, or any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with him? - A. About three months; I went down to the Bull, at Kingstand.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses had you at the Bull? - A. Only two, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the rest? - A. We lend them to neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Let them, you mean? - A. No, we never take any thing for them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did his stock consist of? - A. Five or six; he lent them for their victuals, as the weather was bad.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the prisoner? - A. He told me he dealt in horses, and my master used to buy dog-horses of him; he deals in horses as he does in any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not slaughtered any thing for Life a good while? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you done any act, as a butcher, since you have been with him? - A. No; he does not keep a shop now, he kills pigs for people, but does not keep a shop of his own.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about this horse? - A. On the 25th of January, in the morning, I went to the Bull, to our stables, and the prisoner said, he had a horse in the stable to sell; I went into the stable and looked at it, while he was in the public-house; I said, I think Mr. Life will buy this horse of you, if you do not set too long a price; Mr. Life came down to the stables, and I told him there was a horse to sell; he went and spoke to the prisoner, and they agreed for it; he gave the prisoner three guineas and a half and a poney.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a poney? - A. A very good poney, worth about three pounds, or three guineas, thirteen hands and a half high; he was blind of one eye.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had him? - A. I think about three weeks or a month, I cannot speak to a week; we came to Smithfield in the afternoon with three horses; Mr. Stevens came up and asked me to shew him this horse out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are either of the other horses claimed? - A.No, only that one.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the horse that Stevens claimed, the same that your master bought of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell Mr. Stevens it was a good drawer? - A. Only from thoughts; he was chased in the shoulder, and looked like a good drawing-horse, only he was lame.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Stevens). Was your horse lame? - A. Yes; it is a little tender before, otherwise a very fine horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The horse that I sold to Mr. Life, I bought at Epping on Thursday evening.</p>

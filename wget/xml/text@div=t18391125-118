I am in the employ of Mr. Lowden, a linen<lb></lb>draper, in Crawford-street I met the prisoner in Oxford-street about two o'clock in the morning, on the 3rd of November—she put her hands into my trowsers—she first put one hand in, and then the other—the pockets of my trowsers are inside the flap—on her withdrawing her hands, I missed my purse—I taxed her with it—she denied it, and produced a purse, which appeared to be empty, and some keys—she crossed the road, and went away—I afterwards found her at a public-house—as she was going to the station-house, the officer asked herabout some keys, and she said a gentle<lb></lb>man had taken them from her an hour before—I was sober.</p>

The prisoner lived with us more than twelve months - I was informed of this, and called her into the bar, and asked if she had taken the money - she asked who told me; Mr. Brown said, "The bar-maid" - I then went up-stairs, looked into her box, and found the copper, the silver, the rum, and the cigars; the value of the whole was £3 or £4 - she acknowledged it was mine, and said she was very sorry.</p>

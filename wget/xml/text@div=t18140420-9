He has a shed in Catherine Wheel yard, in which he deposits candles. On Sunday, the 27th of March, in the morning, between nine and eleven, I went to the shed for the purpose of feeding the dog, I observed every thing was safe then. I did not go again to the shed until Monday morning, about seven o'clock; I found the doors had been broken open; I stopped until my master came. The dog seemed stupid and half dead. When my master came I gave him the information. I then found a quantity of candles gone.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen of the City of London. I saw the prisoner about half past eight, on Tuesday morning, I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200010"></xptr>going up Golden-lane I met the prisoner with this basket, which I afterwards saw contained candles. I suspected him. I saw him go into a shop kept by one Donney. Matthews peeped throw the window. Donney took them off the counter, and put them underneath. I went into the shop, told Donney he must put that basket on the counter again. He seemed very much agitated. He said to the prisoner, take it away; I will not have it here. I begged he would not take it away. I said, you must let me know something about it. I told him he must give me an account where he got them. He said he was carrying them for Bunney. I then told him I must find out Bunney before I let him go. He gave me a direction for Bunney. I then said, that was not the first lot of candles that he brought there that morning; he said, it was; there was another lot then at home. I left the prisoner in the custody of Matthews, and I went to the prisoner's house; he keeps a small chandler's shop. I brought away two hundred pounds weight of sugar, tobacco, and Spanish liquorice. I put the prisoner into the counter. He was taken before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not he say he had the basket from Bunney - A. I am positive he said he had the candles from Bunney. Bunney came before the magistrate, and owned the basket. The prisoner said he was carrying the basket for Bunney, and he said he had another basket of candles at home.</p>
               <p>REDBURN CLARK. Q. Do you know these to be your candles - A. I do, by the make of them, and this shed is mine in Catherine-wheel-yard. From information, I went there, and found the shed broken open. I know the candles by the shape, the bottom, and by the threads. They are about seven weeks old. There were ten threads in the candles.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. He keeps a chandler's shop in Golden-lane. That is a mile and a quarter from my premises.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The property is my own. I had them of Mr. Howard in Whitecross-street, a gentleman with whom I do a deal of business.</p>
               <p>- MATTHEWS. I am an officer. I heard the prisoner say that Bunney left the candles at his house, with an order for him to carry them to this man's house.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler. The prisoner is a chandler, and dealer in candles. On the 19th of March, the prisoner had thirty-six dozen pounds of candles of me; on the 16th of February he had thirty-six pounds. They were all sorts of candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell him any that had ten threads in them - A. Yes; they sell for five farthings. I sold him three dozen and six pounds on the 19th of March, and within a month before that I sold him twelve dozen pounds. Some of them were candles of that kind. I have known the prisoner upwards of a twelvemonth. I am a tallow chandler in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there was seventy pounds weight of ten threads bought of you. Do you know Mr. Bunney - A. There is no tallow chandler of the name of Bunney.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is ten threads to my candles. The same evening the prisoner was committed I sent to Mr. Howard for half a pound of ten threads; there was only eight threads to them. I know these candles to be mine by the colour and shape. I have not the least doubt they are my candles; they all correspond with the cotton I have to them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

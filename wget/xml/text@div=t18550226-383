On Sunday morning, 14th Jan., I was out with Charles Adams—we went up to Mr. Egerton's fields, and walked round till we came to Mr. Duncan's, near the wood—we had a dog with us, a little bit of a puppy—when we were near the wood the dog drove a rabbit out of the hedge into the wood—it went into a hole, which was between four and five yards in the wood—Adams and I went down a little way by the side of the wood, and Adams said to me, "Stop a minute; hearken if you can hear any one"—we could not hear anything, and we got over into the wood, and, with a little stick that I had, I began <hi rend="italic">spudding</hi> in a hole—I went down on my right knee; my right hand was in the hole, and Adams was stooping down, looking—we had not been there more than a minute before we were shot—I was shot in my right thigh and right arm—we got out of the wood, and as soon as I got over the hedge I fell down—what made me fall was the wound of the shot numbing my leg so—I got up, and walked a little further, and fell down again—the prisoner appeared on the bank—he had a gun, holding it in his hand—I cried, "O Hampshire, I know you; you have shot us"—he said, "You are shot, and I don't care a d—; I will shoot any other man that comes on the premises"—we then made our way home as well as we could—Adams said to the prisoner, "I shall go down to the police station"—I was so full of pain that I do not know what the prisoner said—he did not come up to us—he never assisted us in the least—I cannot say how far the gun was from us when it was fired—I looked round, but I could see but a very little distance, for the smoke from the gun—the smoke looked to be but a very little distance, such a thing, as nine or ten yards—I should think, by the report, that the gun was about twenty yards off—. Buxton came up and helped me—I was lying down—I have since been in the hospital and in the Union—I am still under medical care.</p>

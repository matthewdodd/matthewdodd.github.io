The female prisoner was in my service - she came on the 17th of October; I missed property, but did not suspect her - she staid with me six weeks; I found fault with her for going out and stopping late - she said if I did not allow her to go out she would leave me; I said she might, - she said she was going to Lady Montague, with whom she said she had lived - she then went away; I missed a number of articles, and suspected the milk woman, whom the prisoner used to speak a long while to in the morning - I told the woman not to come in the morning, but in the afternoon; on Christmas-day I had occasion for some silver spoons - I looked for them, and missed them; some metal ones were put in their place - the knives and forks were taken away; I had a faithful dog, and he was poisoned the day after she left my service - still I had no suspicion of her, but thought it was some person who had a design on the house; I afterwards found that she was married to the male prisoner - he was one night in my house, and when I went down in the kitchen she put him under the table; this is my property, and these are my spoons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COLLIER. Q. You must have been very careless not to miss these things before she went away? A. I missed the tea-spoons and salt-spoons, but still I let her stay; I know my other things were safe when I missed the spoons - that was when I was packing up my clothes; I had a dozen and a half of white-handled knives, which I gave her to clean - I did not examine the articles when she came, and give them into her care; I missed the spoons within a week after she came.</p>

               <p>JAMES LEA. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 29th of December the prosecutrix came and told me what she had lost; I went to Phillips-street, but they had removed from there - I found them at a house in Anthony-street, St. George's; they were at dinner - the prosecutor said, "They are my spoons, knives and forks;" I found these other knives and forks in this leather, in a box which the male prisoner said was his - he gave me the key to open it, but it was open; I found several duplicates - here is one of this table-cloth, in the name of John Rawlins, and another of a bed-wrench, and a brass cock; I found this table-cloth under the bed up stairs, with the mark M. L., No. 3, upon it, which the prosecutor claimed - the man said his mother gave him that, and it was her mark; I found this salt-cellar there - the prisoner said she purchased some of these things in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man made no resistance? A. No - he did not oppose my searching.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 523, New Oxford-street—I live on the premises—the prisoner was in my service as errand-boy—while he was with me I have missed portions of my stock—on 6th August I met him with a silk handkerchief of mine round his neck—I should have discharged him at the time, but my foreman was absent, I gave him notice to leave on the following Saturday—on the Tuesday morning I put a bill in the window for another boy—within half-an-hour of doing so I noticed a strong smell of burning—I went down stairs to see, and asked the prisoner if anything was burning—he said, "No"—I went into the kitchen, and saw that a portion of the dresser had been burnt, some five or six inches square, the edge was still in a burning state; red, not in a flame but smouldering—it had burnt right into the wood; he had evidently extinguished the flame, hearing me coming down—I said, "You have been attempting to set fire to the house"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You must leave at once; just finish your window"—when be bad finished his window-cleaning, he came down stairs and was going into the back kitchen; I said, "What are you going there for?"—he said, "I am going to get my coat and hat to leave"—I said, "I don't think I shall let you go until I know something more about this fire; you know you did it out of malice, because I gave you notice to leave"—he said, "I know I did"—I said, "How did you do it?"—he said, "With a piece of paper."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 42.) On 8th August I took the prisoner into custody at the prosecutor's house—I saw a dresser in the basement, and saw a place in it about six inches in diameter that had evidently been burnt—it was out when I saw it, but quite hot—the prosecutor charged the prisoner with setting fire to it—he said, "Yes, I did; I did it because you were going to send me away and get another boy."</p>

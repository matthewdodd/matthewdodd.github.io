               <p>What time of the day? - About seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was the glass broke? - There was two panes broke at once, and another cracked.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the crash of it? - Yes; we were at tea; I was much alarmed at the noise; I jumped up directly, and made to the door; and called the apprentice to mind the watches; before I got the door open, I missed one of the watches, and I immediately ran out and enquired of the neighbours which way the man had gone; I could hardly hear, the people called out so; at last I understood he had taken up the Orchard; it is a near turning; but little frequented of nights; I ran up there as hard as I could, and in the middle I met two women; I asked them if they met a man running that way; they said, he had just passed on; I still run on, and took hold of the prisoner by the collar; says I, it is you that broke my window and robbed my shop; says he, you are mistaken, it is not me; says I, it is; he said, he was going home, he lived at Hoxton; says he, I have some business in Rosemary-lane, and from thence to Hoxton; says I, come along with me, I will see whether you are the man or no; and I brought him round, and asked him where he had been, and he said, he had been to Deptford, and he walked there; I brought him into the shop; there was a crowd of people; says I, it is you, I am positive; have you got the watch about you? he said, no, it was not him; but he did not care, I might send him on board a man of war, he had no objections; so I sent for an officer; my apprentice had ran out after me, and missed me; I had the prisoner in the house; when he came home again, I opened the door to let him in; and my apprentice said, that is the man that broke the window and stole the watch; the man fell a crying; the officer came, and he was searched; we could not find the watch, or any thing, but a piece of a razor; we got a lanthorn to look for the watch, but could not find any such thing; I came back again, and said to the officer, what can we do about this affair, the apprence still persists in it; he was taken to the watch-house, and was locked up; and in about three or four minutes there came a girl of the town to him, and called him out, and said to him, Dick, have you got in the Watch-house! he said, yes; he told her to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250212"></xptr> go to the Blue Anchot, in the Back lane, and tell somebody to come to him; he asked her, if she had any money, he said, he was very dry; so we took in the woman and searched the outside of her clothes, and found nothing on her; as I was sitting at supper, my wife said, there was the watchman's rattle; says she, get up, it may be one of the thieves that stole your watch; it was a man was taken up for stealing some iron; I told the officer to be sure to search them before he put them in; he told me he had searched one and should search the other; and I said, I wish you would let me have my prisoner out again; I took the candle and looked all round the lock-up room, there I found this pistol laying under the prisoner, loaded, cocked, and primed; he told us that he had no money.</p>

               <p>Could you be sure that the man you saw in your master's custody was the same man that you saw at the shew glass? - Yes, Sir, indeed; I was about three feet from the window, but could see through the window clearly; there was a light about this far from the glass; he came and looked into the shop; it is a glass bow window, and this shew glass lays withinside the glazed window.</p>
               <p>Then could you see enough to see through the glass to distinguish this man's person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, very sure.</p>

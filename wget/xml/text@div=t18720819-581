I am the wife of Edwin Giles, and lodged with the pri<lb></lb>soner, at No. 67, Roman Road, Barnsbuty—she lived there six or eight weeks with a man named Chatterton and his child—she was a widow, and had a child of three years, named Eliza—about 7.15 on the evening of 13th August, I heard Chatterton go out, after tea, and he remained away about an hour and a half—he then returned, but did not stay long—the</p>

               <p>prisoner soon afterwards fetched some beer, and then shut the door of her own room—I was going to bed, about 9.20, when I heard Chatterton's little girl, of eight, crying out "Oh, mother! don't, mother!" and the prisoner replied "I will"—I thought she was going to correct the children by beat<lb></lb>ing them—I listened, and whilst so doing, the prisoner opened the door, and said "I have done it, I have done it; no one has done it but me; come in and see"—I thought she was alluding to something about the weather, and I observed "Yes, ma'am, it has been a beautiful day; are you better?" when she again said "I have done it; come in and see"—I went into her room, and saw her standing with her left hand over her child's mouth, and her right hand was on the door—the child was on the bed, bed just behind the door—I saw it breathe two or three times, and there was a large carving-knife on the pillow—the prisoner then took up the knife, and said "This is the knife I did it with; didn't you hear me sharpen it on the poker?"—I saw that the child's throat was cut, and I said "Oh, you base, wicked woman; what have you done it for?"—she replied "It is my child, and I have done it"—I ran to Chatterton's child, which was in another bed, and took it away, saying "I will see that you shan't harm this one"—she observed "I shall not touch her, she is his child, but this is mine"—the child's throat was cut from ear to ear—I had not heard any quarrelling between her and Chatterton previously.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>, There were two children in the room, one being the prisoner's, and the other the daughter of the man Chatterton—the prisoner was uniformly very kind to them—she was always singing to them, and paid them every attention and care—she treated them both equally kind—the man's child used to call her mother, just the same as her own child did—she used to be at home a good deal with them, and always conducted herself properly—I never saw anything wrong with her.</p>

I am the landlady of the house—about 10 o'clock on the night in question I heard persons screaming upstairs, and, going up, found Mrs. Venables holding the door with her right hand, whilst the other was on the head of her child—she said "Mrs. Simpson, I have done it; she is happy now; is she quite dead? I have separated the beds; that is his child and this is mine"—the child's throat was cut, and an alarm was given—'had not observed anything peculiar about her—she had lodged in my house for about seven weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. She was always very kind to both of the children—she appeared to be a very fond and affectionate mother, and always did her domestic duties in a proper manner—the man Chatterton and a fellow-cabman were summoned for furious driving, and that, I think, led to some unhappiness between him (<hi rend="italic">Chatterton</hi>) and the prisoner—he was fined heavily—that led to some unfriendliness and unhappiness, as the woman became short of money in consequence—the man had pawned the things off his back, the woman her boots from her feet, and the children's shoes were taken in order to provide them with something for their Sunday's dinner.</p>

I was called into the house about 9.80, and on going upstairs to the second floor I found lying on a bed the body of a child, with its throat cut—it was quite dead—the prisoner was standing at the foot of the bed, and said "I have done it; I have killed my child; I will go with you; I will not run away"—she then pointed to the knife, and said "That is what I done it with; is my child dead?—said "Yes," and</p>

               <p>she observed "Thank God! she is better off; T have done it, and shall have to suffer for it"—I then sent for a surgeon, and took the prisoner down stairs, when she told me that her husband died about three years ago, that for sixteen months she had lived with a cabman named Alfred Chatterton as his wife; that he had ill-treated her occasionally; that they had quarrelled that evening, and he had slapped her in the face and gone out; that she said to him "I suppose you will not expect to find me here when you return;" when he answered "Go, and it will be a very good job too; take your child with you;" that preyed on her mind, and, knowing that she had no shelter for herself and child, caused her to do it—when she saw the knife she said "That is what I did it with; I sharpened it on the poker"—she was taken to the police-station, when I observed blood upon her hands, and there she repeated what she had previously said at the house—the man Chatterton was called as a witness before the Coroner.</p>

I am a married man, but my wife has deserted me—I have had a great deal of trouble in my time—my wife left me with two children to brine up—I met with the prisoner, who is a widow, and she has. lived with me lately—she has always been a steady, good woman, and attended to me when I was laid up with the rheumatic fever; she nursed me all through my illness as my wife—one of my children I put out to nurse at Kensington, but it died of scarlet fever, and, as I was afraid the other one would fall ill too, I had it home again; she is about eight years old, and the prisoner took every care of her, as if she was her own child—she had one child of her own, a little girl aged three years, and she was doatingly fond of them both; and a day scarcely passed but she bought them toys or something—I have had enough trouble to send a man mad; I gave way to it, arid it has all been through drink—lately I was fined by the Magistrate for furious driving, and I offered to help another man the next day who was fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the same offence—I and my mistress were three days on the loose; we were drinking from the Wednesday until the Saturday night—we had no money then, and she took her boots off for a friend, and the children's boots, too, and pledged them, in order that they might have some victuals on the Sunday; but all the day she and the children had only a bit of bread and butter, and I had to do as well as I could elsewhere—I had myself pledged my whip and cape for food and rent—on the day of the occurrence I came home and found she was out—I left word with the child to tell her mother that she ought to have stayed at home—I had heard that she was out with a cabman's wife whose company was objectionable, and I was very angry about it—I went out to look after her, and proceeded to the cab-rank—about 6.15 I came back and made the children some tea, and stopped at home till 7.15, when I left word that I was very angry indeed at her being out drinking with the woman—when I returned again I found her at home, and we had a fearful <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and I knocked her about a good deal then—I had ill-used her previously, and about four months before, I threatened to sell the furniture</p>

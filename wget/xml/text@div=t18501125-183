                  </hi>. I live in Brook-street, Lambeth. The prisoner was in my employ two months—on Saturday, 16th Nov., I missed the key of a cupboard, had it forced open, and missed my watch and guard, which I had put there on the Thursday—I went to the workshop where the prisoner was, told her I had lost them, and sent for Goff; he came, and asked her if she knew anything of my missing my watch—she said she had heard of it but she did not take it; she had never seen it—she afterwards said it was all false what she had said, she had taken the watch and given it to the young man she was keeping company with.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 8). I went to the house and asked the prisoner if she had seen the watch in the cupboard—she said she had not—I asked what time she left on the Friday evening—she said she left at five and returned at half-past—I asked where she had been—she said she had been home to tea, and her mother sent her to the doctor's as her sister was ill—I went to her mother's, found that was not correct, and then she said she had given the watch to her young man—I then went to 135, Broad wall, where Plumb resides—he was not at home—I afterwards saw him, and received this watch and chain from him—(<hi rend="italic">produced).</hi>

I took the prisoner—as we went to the station she said, "When Mr. Garland went to the back par<lb></lb>lour for the lucifers, I saw a tall man there; he looked at me and gave me the watch, and said, 'I shall see you again outside;' I was not to say anything to anybody; I took the watch, and not seeing him again, I kept it and gave it to the young man; he asked me how I became possessed of and I told him I found it."</p>

On the Friday I saw the prisoner in Brook-street, and she gave me the watch—I asked her how she came by it; she said she found it in Kennington-lane, under a lamp-post, wrapped in a piece of paper—I showed it to my master the next day—I saw Goff the same day and gave it to him.</p>

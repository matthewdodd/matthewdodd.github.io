               <p>Q. Was he running when you took him? - A. No; it was a very narrow path, where he could not well run; there were two men with him.(Mr. Corrock was called, but did not appear).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not take the hats out of the shop; I was coming by the shop, and two men came up to me with the hats; they asked me if I would carry the hats for them, and they said they would give me something, but did not tell me where to carry them; they walked behind me till this gentleman came up and said they were stolen.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister. I was attending the bar on the 25th of June - I looked into the till and saw a bad crown-piece - my brother was gone into the cellar - when he came up, I showed it to him, and while I was telling him of it, the prisoner came and called for some liquor, he laid down a crown-piece, which I took up and gave to my brother - I bit it before I parted with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I called for nothing of you. Witness. I was standing there - I said, "The crown is a bad one," and asked how you came to offer it - you said you had taken it at the Red Cow for half-a-sovereign - I do not know whether he used the house, for I had only been there one day.</p>

            . I have examined both the crowns - they are both counterfeit, and both impressed from the same mould.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent. I used the house some years. I had only one crown in my possession that night, which I gave to the lady for a quartern of gin; I had paid all the small money I had before for what I had. When he said the crown was bad, I took it and looked at it, and saw it was bad - any person in London is liable to have bad money. I was not at all conscious of its being bad. When they said it was bad, I borrowed money from a person in there to pay for the liquor. I had no intention to run away; I stopped there till the watchman came.</p>
               <p>HENRY CHURCHILL LOVEGROVE re-examined. I am quite certain he gave me the first crown-piece - I only went into the house the day before - I did not know him previous, only from seeing him backwards and forwards for the two days.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor and live at No. 17, Argyle-street, in the parish of St. James, Westminster. On the night of the 10th of Au<lb></lb>gust I went to bed at eleven o'clock precisely and was the last person up—I make it my business every night before going to bed to see all the doors and windows, safe and I saw the house fastened up in every way that night—I was disturbed about a quarter after twelve o'clock—my wife made an observation to me about the creaking of the street-door—she got out of bed, came back to me, and alarmed me—I ran down stairs in my shirt, and on the first fight of stairs I noticed that the street-door was about a quarter of a yard open—I ran to the street-door and opened it quite, and saw a lad running round the corner of Argyle-street into Ox<lb></lb>ford-street—I</p>

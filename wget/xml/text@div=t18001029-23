             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am an officer belonging to Shadwell-office, (produces two seven-shilling pieces); I received them from Parker, they are base metal gilt over, I have tried them with a pen-knife.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Is there nobody here from the Mint?</p>

               <p>Mr. Watson. A monier was expected, but is not come.</p>

               <p>Rogers. On the 25th of September I went with Richardson and Parker to a Public-house near St. James's-street, Clerkenwell, and there, with a penknife. I marked a good half-crown and a good shilling, and gave it into the hands of Parker; Richardson and he went away together; Eibe and I went to a street leading to St. John's Gate, and waited till Parker came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290018"></xptr>to us, and told us he had made a purchase; I do not think it was more than from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after I went to the Red Lion, and saw Richardson and the prisoner sitting in a box in the tap-room; I instantly secured the prisoner, I told him I had a warrant against him; I searched him, and in his breeches pocket I found this half-crown and this shilling, (producing them); they are the same which I had marked and given to Parker, they are good money; I found in his fob these two seven-shilling pieces.

               <p>Q. Your's, I suppose, was a new one? - A. Yes; and so was her's; there was a visible difference in the appearance, both in substance and in size.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the ring she left? A. About two-pence or three-pence; the value of the ring I shewed her was 5s.; I challenged her with having the ring, but I could not find it; I immediately sent to Marlborough-street for a constable, but we could find no property about her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I returned him his ring, and I never had any other; I turned out my pockets and shewed him I had no other; I had a pattern of a gown with me, which he took from me, and refused to return me; he told me to go along about my business, and I told him I would not till I had my gown pattern; he knows that I returned him his ring.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The gown pattern was lost by a neighbour of mine three doors off, just before she came in to me, but he could not swear to it positively.</p>

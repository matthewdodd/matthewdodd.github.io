                  <hi rend="largeCaps">RACHEL JACOBS</hi>. I am the wife of Robert Jacobs, of No. 7, Dock Street, Whitechapel. On Tuesday evening, 11th Aug., I was going to the Sydney Smith public house, in Dock Street, between 6 and 7 o'clock. I do not think the prisoner is the man I saw there; I think it was a taller man—I have never seen the prisoner before to-day—it was a taller man that I saw at the station house—he is the man I saw before the Magistrate—I made a statement before the Magistrate—it was read over to me, and I signed it—the prisoner is not the man who assaulted me—I think it was a taller man—after I was knocked down I was carried home—I did not come to my senses until 10 o'clock at night—I went to the station house, and made a complaint to the police—I afterwards learned from the police that a young man had been taken up—I went to the police office, and gave my evidence—the person standing before the Magistrate on the charge at the time looked like that young man—I was asked some questions, and my answers were taken down in writing—I made my mark—this is it—I stated what is written in the deposition—I never missed my ring until 10 o'clock at night—I have said that the prisoner was the man, but since that I have heard that a woman has got my ring—I do not know whether the prisoner is the man or not that took it—he is the man I saw at the station house—the boy that was kicked told me he was the man—I was too much in liquor to know—I was very much in liquor—it was not because I knew it myself that I said he was the man, but because somebody told me so.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 11th Aug., about half past 6 o'clock, I was close to her in Dock Street, Whitechapel—I saw the prisoner there—I saw that young man ill using her; he was pulling her hair—I was close by, and he struck at me—there were a good many round him.</p>

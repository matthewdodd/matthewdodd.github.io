            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. On the 1st of March, at seven in the morning, I observed Trueman appeared bulky. He was cleaning out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170017"></xptr>the warehouse. I allowed him to leave the warehouse at eight o'clock, for breakfast. He passed out of the warehouse into the cellar of the private house; and when he had been there about ten minutes I called him back; he still appeared bulky. I said, he had something about him. He denied it. I told him he must satisfy me what he had got in the paper, which I saw under his coat. - He answered nothing. I took this satin, fourteen yards, from him; it has our private mark on it; he seemed confused. I told him to follow me up into the warehouse. He said he would tell me all about it. I told him to say nothing to me; he said something which I paid no attention to, but told him to return to the cellar till Mr. Leaf came to town. He was taken in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not his duty lead him to where the satin was kept - A. He swept part of the warehouse, but not where the satin was; the paper was not visible till after I spoke to him. He said he found it on the staircase under suspicious circumstances, and meant to tell his employers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written). After eight weeks imprisonment, I am brought here for an offence I never committed, but did what I considered my duty. In sweeping the warehouse I frequently found goods where they ought not to be, and determined to acquaint Mr. Leaf of it, and in March I found these goods on the stairs and put it carefully in my pocket; it was visible to every one; the end of the paper hanging out. Is this the conduct of a theif; would any man in his senses place stolen goods in such a situation.</p>

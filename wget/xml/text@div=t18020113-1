               <p>Q. What colour was it? - A. Dark brown, almost the colour of my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you then able to see him, so as to know him? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-1-person29">A. </persName>
            It was as he passed me; if I was never to draw another breath, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was there to enable you to see him? - A. There was a light in the passage, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>JAMES MASH sworn. - Q. Do you know any thing about this transaction? - A. Yes, I saw the whole of it; I was standing at my own door; I live at No.39, Eagle-street, the same door where the accident happened; I was within five yards, or five yards and a half of the woman, when she was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-1-person30">A. </persName>
            Ten minutes after nine, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man who fired? - A. Yes; it was a pistol fired by a man unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. He had on either a white or a light jacket, I am not sure, like a pastry-cook or baker; I was not more than three yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do after he had fired the pistol? - A. He walked for a little way as men generally do, and then ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I never saw him till after he was a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that like the man? - A. No, no more than I am, nor yet a bit like the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you happen to know the time to be ten minutes after nine? - A. The watch did not set till nine o'clock; there are at least thirty watchmen to call over, and they do not call the roll over till nine, and the watch was then set.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other men in the street? - A. No; no man standing near, nor woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the woman at the time? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-1-person31">A. </persName>
            Standing upon the step.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pistol which this man had? - A. He seemed to carry it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman wounded - did she fall down? - A. No, she stood equally the same, only she held her silence, before that, she was singing and swearing, and intoxicated, as she had been all day.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FELLOWS sworn. - I am a watchman in Eagle-street: On the 6th of October, I saw the woman about a quarter before nine, as I was going to the watch-house, at her own door; she was upon the top step but one of the cellar; she was very much intoxicated, and had a great mob of men, women, and children about her; she had a pint of beer three parts full, and I begged her to go into the cellar; she sells oysters, and garden stuff, and fruit; I have known the woman for some time about ten minutes after nine, or a quarter of an hour, I had lit my candle, and was going upon my beat; I was called, and saw the woman had been shot; between ten minutes and a quarter after nine, I helped her into a coach; it was the night before the general illumination; there were a great many guns and pistols firing about in all directions.</p>

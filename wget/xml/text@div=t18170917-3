On the 26th of July, I went out about eight o'clock in the evening, and left him at home, I returned between eleven and twelve, found part of the family up, and my desk broken open - I had left about 80l. in it; among which there were two Nuneaton notes for 5l. or 5l. 5s. each, the rest were Bank of England notes of 10l. and 5l.; they were all gone, and the prisoner also. The next time I saw him was at Bow-street, about a year afterwards.</p>

            . I lived in the same house in July 1816; on that evening I went out about a quarter before nine o'clock, leaving the prisoner and Sarah, the servant, there, and returned about ten minutes after ten; I went into the parlour and found the drawers and desk open-the hammer laid on the table by the desk; the prisoner was not in the house. Letitia Jane Green was in bed, I went into her room.</p>

            . I am twelve years of age. On the 26th of July, 1816, the prisoner came into my bedroom after I had been in bed about an hour (he was Mr. Jones's servant, and lived in the house), he said he would kill me if I did not tell him where my mother kept her money; I said I did not know; he then said he would force the drawers open. I said nothing to him about drawers - He had a hammer and a chisel in his hand; I saw him open one of the drawers with them, in my room, and take a piece of paper out of my mother's purse, which I thought was a 1l. note; I also saw him take two watches out of my mother's drawers, I saw him do it as I laid in bed; he took the drawer out, put it on a chair, and took my mother's keys out into Mr. Jones's room, which was the next room. Before he went out of my room, I said I knew there were some persons about the house - He said he had killed my brother. I had a little brother in the house. He went into the next room, which was Mr. Jones's, and I immediately heard a hammering, as if he was breaking open something, after that he went to the door, I heard somebody talking, but I heard no more of him. There is a door that leads out of my room into Mr. Jones's. When Houghton came home, I told her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I was frightened, I did not attempt to get under the clothes, I screamed out. The drawers fronted my bed. I told my mother when she came home; when I got up I saw the keys which he took out of the drawers lying on the table by the desk. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I used to see him every day.</p>

I think he is the man. Dillon stopped at the shop window, and began, as I thought, to use very abusive language. I heard him swearing at the prisoner, who was at the back part of his shop, and seemed to wish to avoid him - he did not come forward. Dillon put his feet towards the shop door, as if to go in, but his feet did not touch the step - the prisoner then rushed out, and put himself in a fighting attitude. Dillon had been menacing, lifting up his arms, and saying, "D-n you," before that. Dobie struck him several blows, and he fell - he did not strike Dobie, he did not seem to have power - he fell on the back of his head in the road on the stones - he attempted to raise himself up, but fell back again. I did not see Dobie strike him any more - I saw him at his shop door afterwards. Dillon was an old man, and used to be a good deal with the prisoner in his shop at one time, assisting him in unloading coals - he kept a coal and potatoe warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You at first saw Dillon at the door of his own house? A. I have heard since that it is his house - he seemed in a passion, and his face was all over blood when I first saw him.</p>

            . I have known the deceased six or seven years - he was a plasterer's labourer - he was rather in liquor at this time - he came to my door - took me by the hand, and asked how I did - his face was all over blood - I never knew him quarrelsome. I told him he had better go home than be in the street; I went with him to his own door - the door was shut, and before it was opened he loosed from me, and went to the prisoner's door. I called him back, got him into the passage, and shut the door; he came out before I could get to my own door, which is two houses off, and went to the corner of Dobie's house - he said something. Dobie came out, seeming in a great passion with him, wiping his own face with a towel, and struck Dillon on his side, with his double fist. Dillon lifted up his arms to strike again, but was too weak. Dobie struck him several blows in his body - and Dobie's mother called out "Give it him well;" then he struck him on the temple; he fell and never arose any more - he tried to arise but could not; the prisoner tried to kick him, and then went away - they carried Dillon into the kitchen of his own house - he died that evening between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. When he stood at the prisoner's door, could you hear what he said? A. No; his manner appeared agitated.</p>
               <p>MR. BRYANT. I am a surgeon. On the 21st of July I was visiting a patient in this neighbourhood and saw a crowd; I saw the deceased lying on his face - I went away to my patient, and on returning saw two persons raising him - I saw a slight contused wound above, and over his left eye; I felt his pulse and considered him labouring under symptoms of a compressed brain; I had him taken home, and directed such treatment as I thought proper, and that the person who had given the blow should be secured, as I thought it a dangerous case. Two days after his death I opened his body, and found from four to six ounces of extravasted blood over the surface of the right hemisphere of the brain - that I consider the immediate cause of his death. I do not conceive the slight confusion to have caused his death; but that the concussion given to the vessels by falling with violence on the stones, produced the rupture of the vessels and caused his death. The vessels might be ruptured by intoxication, and his falling produce the same appearances.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had before fallen down from intoxication, and his face bled, should you attribute the rupture to that or the latter fall, produced by this fight? A. The latter, for I think a man could not stand on his legs after such a rupture as this: he was laying on his face - vessels will very readily give way when a man is in a very high state of excitement from intoxication or anger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Suppose him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080011"></xptr>have been fighting, and his passion to be violently excited, would he not be more likely to have a rupture of the vessels? A. Certainly; a concussion might have been caused by fighting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he had been fighting an hour before, and received a blow which caused coagulated blood upon the brain then, he could not have walked? A. No, nor stood. If it had been the effect of liquor it might not be produced immediately - if his brain got in that state by intoxication he could not have walked about.</p>

            . On the 21st of July I saw Dillon - he was in liquor, but not drunk - he seemed vexed in his mind. I remember his coming up to Dobie's window - he said "I have come for recompence for the injuries you have done me." Words passed on both sides, which I took no notice of; Dobie was washing himself, and when he had dried himself he came out, took him by the collar, and flung him on the pavement - knocked him down with his face in the middle of the kennel - he never groaned - I set him up and got a woman to bring a basin and wash his face - the blood gushed out of his mouth, nose and all parts of his face, very freely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not use very bad and shocking expressions to the prisoner? A. There was rough language on both sides - I did not see Dobie try to kick him.</p>

            . On the day this happened, about two o'clock, I saw Dillon come to Dobie's house - he conducted himself very improper, abusing Dobie very much, calling him a bl-y b-r. Mrs. Dobie was in the parlour- he called her an old convicted bawd, come out of Newgate for robbing a gentleman - he was on the step of the door; Dobie desired him to go about his business - Dillon said he would knock him down - Dobie walked to the door to wipe his hands - Dillon walked into the shop - angry words were still going on - Dobie told him to go about his business - he then came into the shop and struck Dobie; he had been abusing him for two or three minutes before any blow was given. Dillon did not appear drunk - he walked across the road steady enough; he once worked for Dobie, who lent him both money and provisions, and was very kind to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There were bad words on both sides? A. Dobie used no bad words - he took his abuse without returning any. I am positively sure that Dillon struck him first.</p>

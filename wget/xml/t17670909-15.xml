            . I am a victualler at Feltham; the prosecutor called for assistance, I got a candle and lanthorn, and went to him; he unlocked a padlock that was on the door of his house; we went in and searched the house; I saw a hole broke in the cieling on the top of the house; I went down, and left the prosecutor above in the room; I got a ladder, and went up and broke a hole through at the top of the house, and found the prisoner between the cieling and the thatch, near the chimney, in his waistcoat; I hawled him out, he had eight-pence three-farthings in one of his waistcoat-pockets; I asked him how he got it; he said he took it out of a little pot in the window; I asked him if he ever had robbed him before; he said he had once before, of thirty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark night?</p>
               <p>Hillier. It was very dark when I took him.</p>

               <p>Hillier. There was a hole fresh made in the thatch, by which he could get into the room below that, where the cieling was broke, and he had left his coat and hat near the place.</p>

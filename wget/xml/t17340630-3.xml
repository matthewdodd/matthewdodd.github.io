The Deceas'd took the part of him who lost the Bett, a fourth Man began to quarrel with the Deceas'd, but was call'd away. Then the Deceas'd said, he'd fight any Man for a Crown. The Prisoner, who was a Stranger to him, began to strip; but said he had not a Crown to venture, and so the Deceas'd and he agreed to fight for Love, as they call'd it. They boxt fairly; the Deceas'd had the better, and the Prisoner said he would fight no more, in the Nine-pin-Ground among Black-guards; but would fight it out in a Room. The Deceas'd was for having it out in the Ground. Then the Prisoner clapp'd him on the Back, and call'd him a good Lad. They shook Hand three times very lovingly, and went to boxing again. The Prisoner struck the Deceas'd upon the Temples, which made him stagger, and as he was falling the Prisoner kick'd him on the Breast and the Groin, and he fell down, and lay for dead; but he was brought a little to himself in about half an Hour. This was on a Wednesday, and he dyed on the Saturday following.</p>

I gave him a knock on the Head which made him reel, and then I went to kick up his Heels, but with no Design to kick him on the Breast or the Groin.</p>

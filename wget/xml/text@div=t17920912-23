               <p>I am licensed for slaughtering; I am a widow; on Tuesday night of the 5th of September, the horse was brought by the prisoner; to the best of my knowledge he is the lad; if I said he was not I should perjure myself; I am positive sure it was him; I detained the horse and boy; I thought he did not come honestly by it; it was a bay horse, and blind, his knees were broke, and lame withal.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, in such a case, to see such a boy brought into such a situation, for such a horse, must give pain to your minds as well as to ours; but my brother Gould, whose humanity is as large as his knowledge, has suggested to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179209120016"></xptr>me, that there have been cases in which a jury have fixed the value of the horse at 10 d. now, if ever there was a case of that kind, this is that very case, therefore, if you think fit to find him guilty value 10 d it will of course save him from the punishment attendant on the crime of horsestealing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Matthew Moriarty, we live in the stable-yard at Greenwich. The prisoner was my servant—she worked about the house, and slept there—she did not pay for her lodging—I missed some bed-clothes—here is one sheet, that I know is mine by my work on it—and here is one which is the fellow to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never was her servant—I lodged in her house—I was coming down the street to get a lodging in Deptford, and she said I stole the sheet. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She was my servant for two months—I gave her victuals and lodging.</p>

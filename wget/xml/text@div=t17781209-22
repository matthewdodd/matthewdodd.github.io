I lost three live sows and eleven live pigs, on the 8th of November; they were in the yard over night, I served them at seven o'clock at night; they were gone in the morning. I had one of the sows three years: they were three white sows. I keep a house which I rent of Mr. Selby. I live near the New-bar, just by Mr. Selby's house.</p>
               <p>- LEWIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman. I was upon duty at the Belvidere, near White-Conduit House; I saw the prisoner a little before three in the morning, driving these sows and pigs. I took him near the Small-pox-hospital . He was coming towards Turnmill-street, from the Edgware road .</p>
               <p>You are one of the road watchmen? - I belong to St. James's, Clerkenwell. He was driving the pigs before him; there were three white sows and eleven pigs. I charged him with stealing them; he said he had not; he said they belonged to Mr. Ward, who is a farmer at Paddington, but the prisoner is not servant to Mr. Ward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he asked me where I was going with these pigs, I said I was going to pound them, which was by my master's orders .</p>
               <p>Lewis. He said he was going home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I was going to pound them, by Mr. Robinson, my master's order.</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, he said they were Mr. Ward's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said they went into Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090023"></xptr> Ward's field; and I told him I worked for Mr. Robinson.</p>
               <p>To Halley. Was there room for the pigs to creep out any way? - No, the gates were shut.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>What I did was by my master's orders. They were found upon my master's premises. I was ordered to watch his house that night, it was a house just covered in, the scaffold was not struck; he bid me take any thing I found upon his premises to the pound; I have done so by several cows and hogs besides.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is your master Captain Robinson? - Yes. He promised to come here. He ordered me to wait till twelve at night, till the men were gone from the pay-table. I staid till twelve o'clock When I was going away at twelve o'clock, I found these sows and eleven pigs upon the dunghill in the brick-field; I went down, took a hurdle stake, and drove them up to Mary-la bone pound; the keeper of the pound was gone to bed; he said he would not take them in till the morrow-morning.</p>

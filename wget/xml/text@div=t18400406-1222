Late on Friday night the 4th of April, or early on Saturday morning, I was in Bishopsgate-street, walking home—I was sober—I was ac<lb></lb>costed by two women who importuned me to go with them—they took hold of my arm, and after some difficulty I shook them off and got rid of them—I said I would have nothing to do with them—my purse was in my trowsers pocket—it contained a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, about five sovereigns, and four or five shillings—I lost it, but before I discovered it, the girls had gone away—I told a policeman—I then went home, and about five o'clock was called up, and saw the prisoner in custody—I cannot swear that she was one of the persons with me.</p>

I recollect her bringing a bank post bill and a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi> note to me, that they might he put with my own money—I do not exactly recollect taking hold of the post bill or the note, but I found the post bill in my purse—I recollect distinctly seeing the note in her hand, and she offered it to me—I recollect that the bill was cut in two, and either I or my sister sewed the pieces together—one threaded the needle and the other sewed it—I found the bank post bill in the purse a week afterwards, but no note—I was very much surprised at not finding the note, as the impression on my mind was that I had it there—I did not change any 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi> note from the time that I saw the post bill till the time I did not see the note</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Smith—on the morning of 16th November, about 2 o'clock, I was in the Wellington Road with him—the prisoner ran out of a street and made a kick at my hand, and knockedmy parcel out of my hand, picked it up, and ran away—I called to myhusband and he ran after him—the officer brought him up to me, and Icharged him with kicking me and robbing me of the parcel, which containeda petticoat and a shawl—it was rather a dark place—I felt the kick on myhand, and the blood was flowing from it at the station—there was no onethere but the prisoner, and I did not lose sight of him.</p>

On Saturday I had a customer come into the shop, a woman that I had served for a great many years, and wanted a pair of stockings; I from the habit of serving her pretty nearly judged what sort of stockings she wanted; I went to the part of the shop where I expected to find the stockings I wanted, and I missed the bundle; I found them again on the Monday following previous to going to Bow-street; I saw them in Mr. Heather's hands, the pawnbroker's; I saw four pair in his hands; I did not miss the needles, nor knew any thing of them till I saw them at Mr. Heather's; the needles were not my daughter's property, they were only sent into the shop to be sold. The prisoner had lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100088"></xptr>with me two months; I had a very good character with her.

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; a little child about six or seven years old brought the Stockings into my shop, on the 2d of March, about eight o'clock in the evening; two pair of womens cotton, and two pair of childrens, I told her I could not take them in of children, she must send her mamma, with that she went into the passage, and brought the prisoner at the bar; I seeing them new stockings, I asked her how she got them? she said, they were her sister's stockings, and she lived in Moorfields with her mother; I seeing her without a hat, I said, you have come along way off from Moorfields to pawn the stockings in my shop; I suspected she had stole them, so I stopped her and sent for an officer, and took her into custody, and found the needles on her when I came to search her; I have kept them till now. (The stockings deposed to by Mr. Bagshaw having such in the shop, and by the eylet holes.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You said there were only three pair you missed? - The two pair of womens stockings are two of the three pair that I missed; I did not know that I lost any of the small kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Then not missing them can you swear them to be your's? - Only by having the same in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Mr. Heather's? - She sent for me on Sunday evening, and I found her in Covent-garden watch-house, she was full of contrition, when I saw her she voluntarily confessed that she had taken the stockings, and she begged I would be merciful, I promised I would not aggravate the circumstances, and I would be as favourable as possibly I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her before she confessed that you would be favourable to her? - She confessed to me before I said any thing.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor and three more gave her a good character, and observed that she was week in her intellects.</p>

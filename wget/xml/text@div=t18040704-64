            's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Harris.) You secured him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Hyde. I immediately went down to the officers, and Mr. Limerick and the other officers came up, and then we were all taken together to a public-house, the next but one, and there we were searched, and Limerick took out of my pocket the metal I had bought of the prisoner; and after they had searched me they searched the prisoner in my presence, and on him they found a vast quantity of silver and gold and Bank notes, and amongst the silver they found one of the shillings I had given him for the metal; we were taken from there and brought to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all are you quite sure you had no more money when you went to the public-house than that they gave you? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And after you had given the prisoner that money, you had only that metal? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have been some time acquainted with the prisoner? - A. Not some time, I have seen him once before.</p>
               <p>Q. With your friend? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So you were searched by the officer before you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040066"></xptr>went into the public-house? - A. Yes; and one of the officers gave me the 8 s. which I gave the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you searched, by rubbing down your small clothes? - A. Yes; they searched the pockets, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the same hat that you have now, it has a draw-in lining? - A. Mr. Limerick searched that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell me this moment they only searched your pockets, they did not search the sleeve of your coat; there are strange things done in the sleeve of a coat; where was it you went for the officers? - A. Close by.</p>
               <p>Q. What, were they within sight; what distance might they be; were there many people in the street? - A. Not far, I did not meet many people.</p>
               <p>Q. It was noon day? - A. It was; I met the officers directly I got out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the public-house; it was a busy day there I am told? - A. There were a good many people there, as far as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You were drinking rum and water there; the landlord and other people came in occasionally? - A. Nobody came in but the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the door open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a glass door; is it not? - A. I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The door came into the tap-room? - A. No, the door is out from the tap; it is a private parlour; it joins the bar in which the wife of the landlord sits.</p>
               <p>Q. So then the officers searched you before you went into the public-house - do you know the reason why they searched you? - A. To find the coin I had bought of the Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose, before you went into the house, did they search you - they searched you at Bow-street -</p>
               <p>Court. I will give you the reason why they searched him: because they supposed it necessary for your examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a slight character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Had not you a misfortune befall you in the country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what that misfortune was? - A. I suppose you know as well as I do; I would wish you to tell the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you taken up for passing bad money? - A. I gave information of a person who passed bad money there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they so uncivil as to take you up for giving information of a person passing bad money - you were taken into custody yourself - do you mean to say that you were taken into custody for giving information of another person? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you were not taken up for passing bad money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the officer to take you up? - A. I came forward to the Magistrate at High Wickham; he was an acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. So then one of your acquaintances had the misfortune to fall in a bad thing of this kind - after you came from High Wickham, you came to Bow-street? - A. I was taken to Bow-street; they kept me in custody, perhaps, because I could not give security.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your friend at High Wickham? - A. He was sent on board a man of war.</p>
               <p>Q. This Harris, where did he sit, he was in the parlour all the time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he go to the window? - A. Not all the time; the prisoner, when he came, asked me if my friend wanted to buy a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that your acquaintance was looking on all the time? - A. He was looking on some of the time, when the prisoner was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was searched afterwards, and no bad money found on him? - A. I do not know whether it was good or bad.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal in these articles, you ought to know? - A. One of the officers had it.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you nineteen shillings of what you call capital good? - A. I do not call it capital good.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the nineteen shillings? - A. The officers have got it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never examined the silver you got from him? - A. I counted it over in the room before my friend.</p>
               <p>Q. This was transacted all before his face, and he quite a stranger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one of the marked shillings was found in the prisoner's possession - what became of the others? - A. I do not know; he was not immediately taken into custody, because he pulled the door after him; he then was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You never told him you were going to inform? - A. I have reason to believe that he had suspicions, by seeing

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have been a servant; I am out of place at present.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you directed by the officers to go with the last witness to a public-house? - A. I was, on Saturday, the 30th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the officers give Hyde any money? - A. I did, I saw it marked; I believe there were two half-crowns and three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you acquainted with Hyde before? - A. No acquaintance at all of Hyde's; I went by the desire of the officers, we got out of a coach before we went there; Hyde and me went into the public-house, the officers were on the outside waiting; we went into a back room behind the bar, we did not go through the bar; after we got into the room, the prisoner came in about ten minutes, and Hyde told him he wanted to speak to him; the prisoner took him out, and what they said I cannot say; Hyde came in again, and he said, he is gone to fetch it; the prisoner went out of the house, he returned, and went the opposite side of the room, the prisoner's back was towards me, I heard the money pass; the prisoner seemed rather shy.</p>
               <p>Q. On his appearing rather shy, do you recollect Hyde saying any thing to him? - A. He said, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040067"></xptr>need not be afraid of him, he is a friend of mine, he wants readers.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know what was the meaning of readers? - A. No, I did not then; I was informed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you said the prisoner's back was towards you? - A. Yes; and I heard some money pass; I turned round, and saw Hyde have some blue paper in his hand, the prisoner was going out immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation that took place between the prisoner and Hyde? - A. I did not hear the words that passed; I then asked him to stay and drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. Rum and water; he drank, and went out, and pulled the door after him; and Hyde looked at me, I took the notice, I followed after him immediately; and just as he got out of the door, I laid hold of the prisoner with my left-hand, and I said, stay; I called to

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adey. Q. You have been a gentleman's servant? - A. I have been a gentleman's servant; I once lived with Mr. Garrow.</p>

               <p>Q Did you never know that a reader was a pocketbook; you are not acquainted with pick pockets, you thought by readers Bank-notes were meant? - A. I did not know then, I was told afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q I suppose your common good manners would not let you stay in the room; did any body desire you to go out of the room? - A. Nobody desired me to go out of the room, I was looking at a geranium that was in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. And what passed in the room you could not hear? - A. Not all; I saw the paper in Hyde's hand, and I heard the money pass.</p>

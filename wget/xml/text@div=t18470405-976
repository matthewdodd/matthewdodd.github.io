                  </hi> I am a timber-merchant, in partnership with three others, at Waterloo-bridge-wharf, Bridge-road, Lambeth. on the 27th of Feb. the prisoner came and purchased some deals—I had seen Froud some years before, but knew nothing of him—I went into the counting-house to make out the invoice, which was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, which I was requested to do in in the name of Williamson—I did so, and he tendered me this check—I gave him. 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi> out of it—it is signed "Charles Kinnear"—I asked him for his address—he wrote on the back of the check." I. Williamson, No. 10, Mar<lb></lb>garet-street, Cavendish-square"—Froud was present, saw the check tendered, and saw Williamson write the address—I do not know that he could see what he wrote—he was quite near enough to see what was going on—he did not read the check—I paid it into my banker's, and had it returned, as forged—on the Tuesday following I went to Williamson's address, found that no such person lived there, and gave the check to the officer at Bow-street—I read what was on the back of it while Froud was there—I did not read it aloud—I put no question to Williamson afterwards—nobody else was present.</p>

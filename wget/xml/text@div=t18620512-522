                  </hi>. I am a detective City-officer—on 26th April, at a quarter to 9 in the morning, I was sent for to Messrs. Pritchard and Burton's, and found that an entrance had been effected by the removal of a pane of glass, after which a hand had been put through to remove the sash, by which means a person had got in—there is a high wall in St. John's-court, adjoining the premises, from that to the window is a wall with iron spikes at the top—they had got on to the palisades, tied a rope to them, and let themselves down to the window—three desks had been broken open, one in the private counting-house, and two in the clerks counting-house—I found in the yard two pairs of socks, and a bit of a lucifer-match under the kitchen window—these two pieces of matches were handed to me in the counting-house—they have been lighted—I cut the rope from the railings, and took it to the station—I received this chisel from Mr. Burton—Inspector Leonard examined the floor with me, he was then going to Camomile-street, and on my way to the station I accompanied him to Jewin-street, and when we were at the Fore-street end, I saw the prisoners and another person on the other side of the way—it was then about 10 o'clock—they had new boots on, and I thought new caps as well—I followed them into Aldersgate-street, to the end of Edmund's-place, where there is a pawnbroker's shop—Giss went in at the side door, and Johnson and the other man stood at the end of the place; I passed them and then went into the lobby of the pawnbroker's, and saw Giss present a duplicate to the pawn-broker's assistant—I went in front of the shop to look what the duplicate related to, and found it related to a coat—I went back to the box where Giss was, and beckoned him out into the passage—I told him I was an officer and should like to know where he got the money from to buy those boots with which he was wearing—he said, "I worked for it and saved it"—I said, "Where do you work?"—he said Taylor and Greenings, of Grey-stock-place—I said, "You have got some parties waiting outside for you at the end of the place"—he said, "I have not"—I said "You have, for I saw you come together along Jewin-street"—he said, "I have never been near Jewin-street this morning"—I said, "Go in and get your coat"—he went into the box, and I stepped aside and beckoned to Johnson, who came up to me—I told him I was an officer, and should like to know where he got the money from, to buy the new boots he was wearing?—he said, "Worked for it and saved it, to be sure"—I said, "You are waiting for some one here"—he said, "I am not"—I said, "You are, for I saw you come along Jewin-street together"—he said, "I am not waiting for any<lb></lb>body"—I caught hold of his collar, and we commenced struggling, he lifted up his fist but I stopped the blow—while the struggle was going on, Giss came out with the coat under his arm, and I then noticed that his left<lb></lb>hand trousers pocket was very bulky, I put my hand on it and it appeared to contain money—the assisant came to my assistance, and ultimately Gale, No. 670, seeing the struggle, came up, and we took the prisoners; Johnson endeavoured to put his hand into his pocket—I told him, on the way to the station, that I should charge them on suspicion of committing a burglary, at Messrs, Pritchard's, King-street, Snow-hill—they both said "We will make you prove it, and you shall pay for this"—I searched Giss at the station, and found, in the watch-pocket of his trousers, this bag con<lb></lb>taining 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and in his pocket I found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver</p>

               <p>and copper—I also found this key on him—they were asked at the station where they got the money, they said that they had saved it—I saw Johnson searched, and 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I think, found on him, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it was in gold—Mr. Burton said that he thought the bag found on Johnson was his, but that some of his clerks would be able to identify it no doubt, when Johnson said "That is my aunt's bag"—the prisoners both refused to give their addresses—the fourpenny and threepenny <hi rend="italic">bits</hi> found on them both, amounted to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this one with a hole in the centre was found on Giss—I have ascertained Giss' address, but could hear nothing of him at the place he said that he worked at; I met Mr. Taylor—I know him personally.</p>

               <p>is not likely that I cut it, or saw it done—I know it corresponds with the waistcoats—I brought it myself from the drawer the patterns are kept in—here is our mark on the piece of goods at the time it came in, and this remnant, it appears, is the last of the piece—it corresponds exactly in qua<lb></lb>lity, and if not cut from the same piece it could not—it would be a great chance—I speak to it from the exact similarity—it is white quilting—every draper keeps the article—we have a great many pieces of quilting.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know where he is now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I could have detained him at the time—when the quilting came, we cut off a strip like this—we have other patterns in the drawer, but if the piece had been sold the pattern would be thrown away—this corresponds with the waistcoats and is marked with the same price as the remnant missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, in Sackville-street. I lodged at Ball's for nine months—the prisoner lodged there—in Jan. 1844, a friend of mine was about to have new clothes, and the prisoner produced a lot of goods to him on the parlour table, there was cloth, kerseymere, summer trowsers, waistcoat-pieces, and various articles—it was long before he went to the prosecutor's—I have a faint recollection of this white quilting.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. Martins-le-Grand—I am proprietor of an office and wine-cellars in William-street, Blackfriars, which I let to the prisoner. Here is the agreement on which I let them—it was stamped after it was made—I allowed him to enter on this agreement—at that time there were twelve iron plates there—they were used for the purpose of making tem<lb></lb>porary wine-bins—they were let with the premises, and had no right to be taken off the premises—they were not fixtures—they were not intended to be fixed—they are more generally used than other things now—they are peculi<lb></lb>arly for the purpose of the trade—I do not know the day of the month on which I gave the prisoner permission to enter—the agreement is dated 4th March, and I think he entered the next day afterwards—on the 9th of March the policeman made a communication to me—I went to Mr. Clark's</p>

On the 9th of March the prisoner came and asked if I were a buyer of iron—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Can you send for it?"—I said, "Yes, if there is a quantity"—he said there was—I said, "Do you want it away this evening?"—he said, "Yes; the men are coming to work in the morning, and it will obstruct them"—I sent the men to bring the iron to my place—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt. for it—that is the value of old iron—the prisoner gave the name of Williams.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 6th of January I was with Waddington at the corner of Wilderness-row, and saw the prisoner going up there. We went up to him and said</p>
               <p>"What have you got there?" He said glass, which he was going to take to Mr. Abel's, in Baldwin's-gardens, to repair some lamps for Mr. Wood, the contractor of St. Luke's. I left him with Waddington, and went to Mr. Abel's.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. John Brander - the prisoner was his lamp-lighter. When a lamp was broken it was his duty to bring it in, and have fresh glasses put in their places. On Thursday, the 6th of January, he brought in four lamps only, all the glass had been cut out of them by some instrument. I have seen the glass which the officer has, and it seems to correspond with the sides of the lamps. I cautioned the prisoner and the other men, and told them the glass must not be cut out, and I would inform my employer. Last Monday week I gave the prisoner six broken lamps to replace, he brought me but four, and said the other two were stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear to these lamps? A. Yes; I put them in a separate place, to shew them to my employer.</p>

            . I never sent the prisoner to any such person as Mr. Abel, in Baldwin's-gardens - nor do I know the man. I have not sent him with any lamps for five or six weeks past.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the glass of a man who came to me while I was lighting the lamps, and was going to sell it again. I was timid when the officer came, and do not know what I said to him.</p>

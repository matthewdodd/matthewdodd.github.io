                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, of 136, Salmon's Lane, Limehouse—on Saturday previous to 28th December, about 5.30 p.m., I had alighted from an omnibus in Cannon Street Road—it was raining, and I had an umbrella up—five persons and the prisoner crossed from the oppo<lb></lb>site side and walked behind me—the prisoner dodged me three times—first he went before me, and stood with his back to me, so that I might run against him—I avoided him, and passed him—he did it again, and I passed him again—he did it a third time, and faced me, flew at my neck like a tiger, and tried to throw me down—he made a signal for the rest, and they all pounced on me with great force—this is my coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is torn—the prisoner held me round the neck and I held him round the body—I had rather have suffered death than let him go—I could not make a noise, be<lb></lb>cause he choked me—two women came up and beat off the others with umbrellas, and cried, "Murder!" and "Police!" very lustily, saying, "You villains! you will kill the old gentleman"—I heard that as I lay on the pave<lb></lb>ment—Charles Cook and another man came up, and as I would not leave go of the prisoner, they lifted us both up—a constable came at last, and I charged the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live at 7, Sun-street, Old-street-road; the prisoner is my sister. On 30th April, between one and two o'clock in the morning, a young woman brought a man to my place, and because they could not agree my sister took up the poker and struck the man several times with it—I tried to get it from her, and she threw it down—I told her I would not have a man murdered in my place—she said that I deserved the blow instead of him, and with that she struck me with the poker across the nose, with all her force, and cut it right through; I was obliged to go outside, or she would have murdered me—it caused me two black eyes—a doctor was sent for at the station.</p>

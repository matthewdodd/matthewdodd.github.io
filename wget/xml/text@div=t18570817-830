                  </hi>. I live at Cowley Manor Farm, and am foreman to Mr. Charles Webster, a farmer, there. On a farm at Hillingdon he had a rick of clover hay—on Friday, the 24th, I saw Baker come after a load of hay—he took a load, and paid me the money, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Can I have a load on Monday morning?"—I said, "I can't give any answer before I see Medler, and I will let you know on Saturday night by one of the men;" I forgot it then, and sent word on Sunday afternoon—I did not speak to Baker himself with regard to it—on Saturday evening I told Medler we wanted a load of hay cut for Baker on Monday morning, and asked him what time he would get it ready; he said it should be ready by half past 9 or 10 o'clock—I said, "Very well, I will send word to him that it shall be ready by 10;" he said, "By 10 it shall be all ready"—on Mon­day morning, about 7 o'clock, I went to the clover hayrick—Medler was there, and his two brothers with him—they were not engaged by me—I said, "Has any one been here this morning?"—he said, "Oh, yes, he has been here"—I said, "Has he taken any hay away with him?"—he said, "No"—"Well," I said, "where has he gone to"—he said, "To one of the mills; either Mr. Randall's or Mr. Austin's"—I said, "The track of the cart went the other way"—"Well," he said, "I do not know where he has gone to, but he told me he was going to one of the mills"—I understood him to be speaking of Baker—he said, "He will be here again between 9 and 10, but I do not know whether he will have one load or two this morning"—I went and looked round the rick—I asked him whether any hay had been taken away that morning—he said, "No"—after this conver<lb></lb>sation I went out into the road, and made inquiries—I fancied I could trace Baker's cart—I went down to West Drayton—that was quite a con<lb></lb>trary way to Mr. Austin's or Mr. Randall's mills—when I got to West</p>

               <p>Drayton, I went to a barn there, about fifty or sixty yards from Baker's house, on the opposite side of the road—I found his cart standing by the side of the barn door, backed in, and a load of hay on it—I do not know whether Baker's name was on the cart; I know it was his horse and cart—it was clover hay—I looked round it—I fancied it was our hay, by its being made lighter than hay in general—I believe it to be my master's—it looked as if it had not been cut long—I went back to the hayrick about half past 9 o'clock, Medler and his brothers were still there—"Now," I said, "Medler, has any one been here this morning, and fetched any hay away?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I know they have"—he said, "Yes, they have had half a load away"—I said, "Yes, Medler, and a load; for I have been down to Drayton, and seen a load standing on Baker's cart"—he made some reply; I do not justly know what—I went away down the road, and met Baker coming up from Drayton with the cart and horse—I said, "Halloo! what, are you coming after your load of hay?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you seen any reapers about this morning?"—he said, "No, I have not seen any countrymen at all"—I got up into his eart, which was empty; I rode along in it towards the rick; "Now," I said, "Mr. Baker, you may as well pay me for this load of hay, for I want to go to Uxbridge, and this is my nearest way"—he said, "Yes," stopped his horse, and pulled out the money, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave it to me—I said, "Now, Mr. Baker, this is for this load of hay you are going now to fetch from the rick"—he said, "Yes"—"Well," I said, "let us see, how many loads have you had before?"—he said, "Three loads and three quarters"—I said, "You have paid for all you have had before?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have not fetched a load before this morning?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Nor yet your horse and cart?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Now, Mr. Baker, I know you have; for I have been down to Drayton, and seen a load stand<lb></lb>ing on your cart"—he said, "Yes, I have; and I would sooner pay for it than have any bother about it"—I said, "No, I can't do that; you must go to Mr. Webster, my master"—he had paid me for the three loads and three quarters—the price was agreed upon before—he was to have ten loads out of the rick, at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per load—I took him to Mr. Webster's, and told Mr. Webster, in his presence, what had occurred—Mr. Webster said he should not have anything to do with it; he should see the Magistrate—Baker said, "I hope you will look over it, Sir, for I have a wife and three little children at home"—he was given into custody—I afterwards went back to Medler, and took him to the policeman—he said he would go with me; he did not know anything that he was going for—I afterwards examined the hay that had been on Baker's cart—there were thirty-six trusses there—we weighed them all—the proper weight of a truss is 56 lbs.—they were over weight—I did not keep an account of the weight; that was left to the policeman—I saw them weighed—there were two the right weight, and all the others were over—there were two or three that weighed 64 lbs.—Medler binds all Mr. Webster's hay; he is an experienced man; he keeps a weighing machine of his own, and brings it with him—it was there on the morning of 27th July.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live on a farm adjoining Cowley Manor Farm. On Monday, 27th July, Tinson brought Baker to me, at the public room at Uxbridge—he had been to my house with him, but I was not there—after Tinson had related what he has stated, I said to Baker that it was a very bad case; I considered it a felony—he replied, that it would make no difference to me; he had the money in his pocket to pay me, and offered to pay me for it—I declined to receive it, and said it was a case I could not compromise; the Magistrate must settle it—he was taken before the Magistrate—Tinson afterwards showed me some hay, which I have no doubt was mine—I had sold ten loads to Baker, on condition that every load was paid for before it left the field—it was to be 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load—there were eighteen or nineteen loads in the rick—he said he would fetch the ten loads away in three weeks.</p>

All my family were absent from home from the 14th to the 21st of February, except Shannon and myself—I kept the key of my wine-cellar on a ledge of my sideboard, and locked up—on the 21st of February I had left the door of that sideboard unlocked, and the key in it, while I had my breakfast in another room—on that day my wife came home, and Shannon was given into custody—I lost these articles.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 116.) On the 21st of February I was sent for to the prosecutor's. I went down stairs, and found Shannon sitting on a chair, leaning on a table, and Scott lying on the floor drunk—they were given into my custody—I took them to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and found in Scott's pocket a knife, a fork, a towel, and two handkerchiefs with the name of Field on them—she pointed to Shan<lb></lb>non, and said, "She gave them to me"—Shannon said, "If you say any<lb></lb>thing, speak the truth; don't bring me into disgrace"—Scott then said that she had got another knife and fork at home that Shannon had gives her, and she lived at No. 8, Oxford-buildings—I went there, and found three knives, two forks, eight plates, a dish, and a sugar-basin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Shannon.</hi> I gave her the plates and dish to take care of—I had them from a friend—I thought this month I should be going oat of town, and I left them with her—I know nothing about the towel and handkerchief, or how she got them, unless she took them out of the clothes-basket in my mistress's bed-room.</p>

Venney was my <rs id="t18231203-118-viclabel641" type="occupation">journeyman</rs>, and Simcock my <rs id="t18231203-118-viclabel642" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>. On the 24th of November, Venney brought home a pair of boots - I found fault with them - he felt offended, because I would not give him more work - words occurred, and I said I was told that he came to me for no good. He said if I would go out with him, he would tell me something. I went backwards for my hat, and Simcock was at work in the next room. I said, "John, let us go and clear this matter up." We went to Mr. Sheath's, and found a pair of my boots. Venney said Simcock got them out of the shop, gave them to him, and he sold them to Sheath, and took two pairs to London. Simcock made no answer to it all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that he denied it - A. No; at that moment he did not deny it - I never heard him deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. You state in your deposition "Venney accused John of taking two pairs to London, which he denied" - A. Yes; that was a week afterwards. I said, if he returned to work and behaved well, I would take no notice of it, and the matter rested for a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not Simcock insist on going before the Magistrate - A. He did not insist. I offered to give up his time - he said he would not take it, for he would make me pay for it yet. We were always quarrelling - I never heard him deny it. He said I had not learnt him his business. Venney was never in the shop without my being present.</p>

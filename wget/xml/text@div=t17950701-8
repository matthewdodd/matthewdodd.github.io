The constable who first took him into custody, I don't know who it was; it was on the other side of Blackstairs Bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this cotton? - About six or seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you stopped him? - I do not recollect, he appeared very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect him? - I was told that he had been seen carrying cotton from our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me in your warehouse? - No, I never see you in it, but I see you stand at the door and put your hand in and take the cotton out.</p>
               <p>JOHN WAINWRIGHT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable of Dowgate ward, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner.(The cotton produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked at the water side, I have done so these twenty years, and I get a job where I can; here is a gentleman here, Mr. Miller, has known me these twenty-nine years about the water side; as I was coming down the street I was called to work by a man, a soldier, says he, will you earn sixpence? yes, says I; and he gives me a bag of cotton, or something, I suppose it may be cotton; and he says, if you will carry this to the White Horse, at the bottom of Wood-street, and leave it with the book-keeper, I will give you sixpence, and he gave me the sixpence first, and that gentleman stopped me with it, and said it was his, and he charged me with a constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Where is the warehouse situated-In Queen-street.</p>

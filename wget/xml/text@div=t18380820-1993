                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the Royal Adelaide steam vessel.

R."—I said there was something going on wrong—I went down into the hold, and saw M'Cormack with something, and asked what he had—he said he had nothing—I said he had something he ought not to have—he put it in his pocket—I took it out of his right-hand pocket, and it was half a dozen silver spoons—I called the mate and found a tea-pot lying by two cases, by M'Cormack's feet-Smith was on deck at that time, at his duty-Coyle and I examined the hold, and found a chest which had been broken—I did not observe any thing on the top of the chest—there appeared to have been things taken out—there was a space in the chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Islington—I was with the last witness when the chaise broke down at Tottenham-cross—Cox drove us to the Fountain, and I went in there, and shortly after that I missed my friend—I was then inside the house—I went outside and looked—the prisoners And the cart were still outside then, and a third man—I then proceeded alone on my way towards Hackney Church—when I had got a little distance the two prisoners ran after me; the other man remained a short distance behind—Cox took hold of my arm, and forcibly detained me; they made use of very abusive language—Cox said, "Come back and ride, we will take you where you want to go"—I said I wanted to have nothing to do with them, as I was quite satisfied they were blackguards—I then called the aid of a police-constable, 46 N, and said, "Protect me against these men"—the policeman said, "Have you any claim against this gentleman?"—I think he used the words "this gentleman"—Cox said, "No"—as near as I can tell, the constable said, "Now, my lads, you had better go back the other way, and not interfere with the gentleman; he does not want anything to say to you"—he then said to me, "If you walk on, sir, I will see they don't follow you"—I walked on—they had not moved, but were still in the same place—when I had got some distance the same men drove up in a cart, and stopped behind me—they all three got out of the cart, and hustled against me, and pushed me about—I received a blow on the back of the head; from whom I do not know—it rendered me insensible, and I fell—when I next became conscious I was being forcibly held down in the cart, and was being driven rapidly down a lane—I cannot say whether it was one of the prisoners or the third man that held me; it was very dark—they stripped off my top coat, my body coat, waistcoat, and hat—I was conscious then—they took a ring off my finger, and about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money from my trousers' pocket, and some other trifling articles—they had great difficulty in getting the ring off, and one of the prisoners said, "Oh, cut the finger off"—one of them, Blackin I think, tried to take my boots off—I kicked him, and after that I had a severe struggle, and threw myself over the back of the cart, and injured myself very much, as we were going rather quick, though not very—I called out "Police," and ran after the cart—policeman K 32 came up, and joined in the pursuit—he ran After the cart, and stopped the horse—Cox was then wearing my overcoat and hat—he took the coat off and threw it in the road, and threw the hat at me—the constable then took the two prisoners in custody—the third man ran away, and escaped—this hat and waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, N</hi> 46). About half-past 7 on this evening, I was on duty in Lower Clapton, and heard a cry of "Police"—I ran to the spot, and saw Cox holding the prosecutor by the arm—he was trying to get him to go back and ride with him; he said he promised to take him to Shoreditch, and not to leave him halfway at the Fountain—the prosecutor would not go, and asked me to protect him from these men—he said, "I wish to get away from them;" I said, "Very well, you can get away, and if you go away they won't follow you now"—he went on his way, and they turned back—I told them they must go away from him—that was about 200 yards from the public-house—I saw Cox back to the public-house, and when I got there I saw the two other men with him for the first time—I stood about there for more than five minutes, and saw that they appeared to be settled, and with no intention of following him—I went about fifty yards further on, and presently I saw the cart going on with the three men—they were all dressed something like they are now—they followed in the direction which the prosecutor had taken, and I took a short cut down Clarence-road towards Hackney, and thought I should arrive there in time, but I saw no more of them till at the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cox's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor's friend hired me to fetch a hone and cart.</p>
               <p>I ran to Stamford-hill-gate as fast as I could go, and got them out of the stable; and when I came back he bad hired another man to take his trap, and gave him the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said, "You have hired some one else;" he said, "Yes, you won't have anything to do with it now, you may take your horse and cart back again." He went into the parlour of the public-house, and the landlord said he would not draw him any thing; he said to roe, "That man will have to pay you 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going for the horse and cart." I went into the parlour, and asked him if he would give me the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said he was not going to give any 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said, "You will have to pay the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>" I did not abuse him; I spoke very civilly. After a great deal of persuasion, a gentleman said, "You had better pay him;" and at last he pulled out about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his hand, and the gentleman gave me a half-crown, a shilling and a sixpence, from it, and said, "Now Cox, you see about getting home and out of the way, away from him." The prosecutor was very tipsy. On going outride he said, "I have paid you the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you will have to take me part of the way home, down to the Fountain at Clapton." I drove him there, and we all had some beer there, which I paid for. The prosecutor came out of the bar and ran off, and Rowsell came into the parlour. I asked him where the other one was gone; he said, "Oh, he is outside." I went out, and asked him if he was not going to ride home; he said, "No," The policeman came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050110"></xptr>
               <p>up, and asked if I had been insulting him, and he said, "No." He then shook hands, said "Good night," and walked on. Rowsell afterwards came out, and said, "Where is the gentleman?" I mid, "I do not know." I got up in the cart, drove on, and overtook him; I asked him if he would like to ride; he got up in the cart himself, and said, yes. he would. He sat on the other side of Blackin, who was in the cart. I drove the horse as properly as I could. Blackin was intoxicated, the same as the prosecutor. The pro<lb></lb>secutor said, "You drive me to Wick-lane;" and when going along Wick-lane, he pulled off his things in such a way and stared at me, that I thought he was mad, and then he pitched out of the cart; he and Blackin both went out of the cart together. The prosecutor hallooed "Police;" the policeman came up and said, "You stop." I had pulled the reins up very quickly. I stopped, got down, and told the policeman what he had done. This constable took us all to the station; the other policeman held the prosecutor, as he was so very much intoxicated. On getting there, he locked him up till Sunday, because he was not capable of taking care of himself; and they locked us up as well. I am as innocent as any baby.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Blackin's Defence.</hi> I was going towards Tottenham, and saw the accident; the prosecutor asked me to lend him a horse; he said he would give me a shilling when he got to Old Ford.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Richard Attenborough, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Crown-street, Finsbury. About half-past six o'clock on Mon<lb></lb>day evening, the 11th of April, the prisoner came to our shop with another man—they wished to look at a pair of trowsers, which were taken down and shown them—they did not purchase them, and left the shop—shortly afterwards I heard an altercation between the shopman and the prisoner at the door—I went out, and saw a roll of silk waistcoating sticking partly out of the prisoner's pocket and partly under his coat—it had been hanging up inside the shop pinned to a piece of cotton—I collared the prisoner, and took him behind the counter—he was very violent, resisted, and tried to make his escape over the counter—I charged him with stealing the silk—he said he did not take it—we sent for a policeman—when he found he could not get away, he took a pair of shears out of his pocket, and said the first person that offered to take him he would stab them—I and three fel<lb></lb>low-shopmen closed it on him, and held him till an officer came and took him.</p>

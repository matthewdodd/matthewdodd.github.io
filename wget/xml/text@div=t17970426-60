               <p>Q.What does your family consist of? - A. Six small children, a niece, a wife, and myself; we all went out together; I barred the windows and locked the doors myself; we all returned together exactly at eight o'clock the same evening; I had seen the property not a minute before I left the house, I had been to the bureau for some papers, it was all safe then, and I locked the bureau, I never do leave it open, nobody has the key but myself; about ten minutes after I returned, I went up stairs, and saw a pocket-book lying upon the bureau open in the bed-room up one pair of stairs; all my papers were tumbled and thrown about in a most terrible manner, and the property was gone; there was a five pound Bank note, and ten guineas, tied up in a bag that was missing, bag and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon the bag? - A.None at all; there was in another bag a ten pound Bank note with my name upon the bag, the note was gone, and the bag left; in another bag were five guineas in silver, and in another bag about five or six shillings worth of halfpence, a crown-piece, a half-crown-piece, and several pieces of coin, a silver coral, and two silver tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you suppose the persons had got the bureau open? - A. I do not know whether it was by a false key, or a picklock, there was no violence upon the wood work.</p>
               <p>Q. How did your house appear to be entered, by violence? - A. None that I could perceive.</p>
               <p>Q.Nothing has been traced but this five pound Bank note? - A. No; I did not recollect the number of the note at the time I missed it, but I recollected that I had taken it with another five pound note at Messrs. Masters's, the bankers, in Chancery-lane, on the 31st of January; I had paid the other five pound Bank note into the General-Post-Office, on Friday the 10th of February; I paid it to Mr. Cock.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way of business are you? - A. A letter-carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the habit of receiving money in that prossesion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the Bank note that you paid to Mr. Cock? - A. Yes; I have both of them. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you know that you have indicted this lady at the bar for a capital offence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, also, that she comes here, having been admitted to bail, and surrendered to take her trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not recollect the number of the note at the time you missed it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many five pound notes had you in the house at that time? - A. Only two.</p>
               <p>Q. The number of neither of them did you happen to know? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you yourself did not know whether the note you paid to Mr. Cock was the one number or the other? - A. No; one I had signed, and the other I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any servants in your house? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any servants? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any lodgers in your house? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never found any of your property, excepting, as you suppose, this Bank note? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never known the prisoner at the bar before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. She had never been, in the course of her business, backwards and forwards at your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She is a perfect stranger to you, and your house, as far as you know? - A. Yes.</p>

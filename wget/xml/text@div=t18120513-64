            . On the 25th of last March, in Great Wild-street, I met the prisoner. I was going from my master, Mr. Smith, a <rs id="t18120513-64-viclabel361" type="occupation">boot-maker</rs>

A young man who was with the prisoner, asked me if I did not come from Mr. Smith's. I replied, yes. He said, he knew Mr. Smith very well; he lived at a linen-drapers a few doors further. The prisoner then told me, that he was Mr. Mason's apprentice, and had not long to serve. He walked with me; he took the boots from me. He then walked to Symond's Inn; and when we came to Mr. Mason's, he said, you had better take them in; and I insisted upon him taking them in, as he had carried them so far. When he found that I wanted to see them delivered he tried to run past me. I catched hold of him, and in the scuffle I got the boots from him. He gave me a push, and ran away. I pursued him. I suspected him to be a swindler.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Are you sure he got the boots from you - A. Yes. He took them from me. I did not give them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you consent to his carrying them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was three weeks after he took the boots from you before you saw him again - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take him then - A. No. He ran down a court. I then accused him of it. He used improper language.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Samuel Hewitt, a fish salesman at Billingsgate. On 15th April, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner standing staring about—he was near my master's form, which had fish on it—I watched him, and saw him lifting the baskets, and shuffling them about, feeling the weight of them in his hand—he then crossed over to Mr. Hewitt's, sen., form, and he had not been there above a minute before he took a basket of soles off Mr. Hewitt's form, and walked away with it—I called to my fellow servant, Bishop, and we watched the prisoner—he walked round the market, and he got almost out of the market, and then he threw the basket or pad over his head, and ran away—my fellow servant stopped, and picked up the soles—I ran after the prisoner, took him, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Samuel Hewitt, the younger, a fish salesman at Billingsgate. On 15th April, Morrison pointed the prisoner out to me, and in consequence of what he said I watched him—I saw him go from Mr. Hewitt's, jun., form to the form of Mr. Hewitt the elder—Morrison spoke to me again, and we both went after the prisoner—I saw him carry a basket or pad of fish before him in his hands, and walk away with it—we went towards him, and he put the pad on his head—he walked to the bottom of the market, he there made a pause—he then went to Dark House-lane, and began to <hi rend="italic">sing out</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi>—he then made a pause, and went some distance towards Thames-street—he threw the pad off his head, and made a run of it—Morrison ran after him, and I stopped and picked up the fish—the prisoner could see me when he threw the basket off his head—I was close to him, so close that the pad nearly caught me in its fall.</p>

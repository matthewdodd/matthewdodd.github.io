                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isaac Williams, who keeps the Duke of Sussex, Clifton-street, Notting-hill—on 20th April, soon after 9 at night the prisoner came in there with two or three others—he asked for a pot of beer, and handed it round to those who were with him—he did not drink any him<lb></lb>self—he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till—there was no other shilling there at that time—I gave him sixpence and twopence change—he then called for two pennyworth of gin, and gave me another shilling—I looked at it, tried it with my teeth, and found it was bad—I then took the other shilling from the till, and found that was bad too—I told him he had given me two bad shillings—he said he had not, and went out—his companions went out soon after—I called my husband and he followed the prisoner—after that some one came in and gave me a half-crown—that was not one of the men who had been in with the prisoner—he asked what was the matter—I told him, and he said, "I will pay for the beer and the change," and he gave me the money—I gave him eighteen pence out of the half-crown—I did not give him the bad shillings—he did not go away directly—he stopped some little time—I saw no more of the prisoner or his companions—I wrapped the two bad shillings in a paper, and gave them to the policeman a fortnight afterwards—I kept them in my desk, which was locked all that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is your house frequented by working men chiefly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we very seldom hare much cash in the till—I generally keep it in my pocket—my husband attends to the business—we have no barmaid—it was not a minute after I took the first shilling that the second was given me—I did not put that in the till—I kept it in my hand—the bar was full of people at the time—I did not give any change for the second shilling—I gave the man eighteen pence change out of the half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Boot and Slipper beer-shop, St. Ann's-road, Notting-hill—I remember seeing the prisoner and two other men at our house in the latter part of April—one of the other men called for a pot of beer, and gave me fourpence in coppers for it—then the prisoner called for another pot, and gave me a shilling—I said, "I have not change"—I looked at the shilling and found it was a bad one, and sent my little girl to get change—she came back in two or three minutes and said it was bad—I went and told my husband about it—he was ill at the time, and he said, "Don't say anything about it now, because he is a desperate character"—in consequence of that I gave the prisoner eightpence change—I kept the shilling about three weeks, and afterwards gave it to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you keep it all that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my purse, and kept the purse in my pocket—I put no money into the purse, and took none out all that time; not out of that compartment—our place is frequented by poor working men—I don't often take bad money—I took a bad coin a few weeks before this—I did not see the prisoner in my house during the three weeks before he was taken—I saw him over the road opposite—I believe he is a hard-working man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—I recollect somewhere about 20th April, seeing the prisoner in my mother's house—my mother gave me a shilling to change—I went next door—I did not get change—I brought it back, and gave it to my mother—I did not let the shilling go out of my hand—it was bad.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you break the bad shilling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the centre of the till—good shillings will break in that way, I believe—I received this other bad shilling on 29th April, from a woman who was with the prisoner and the others, when they carne in the last time—after they were gone, she came in and gave it to me, and said that they had given it to her—I broke it—that makes four.</p>

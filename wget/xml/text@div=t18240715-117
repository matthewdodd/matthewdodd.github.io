            . I live in Jackson's-court, Blackfriars. I know the prisoner by sight. I lost this property by the side of <placeName id="t18240715-117-crimeloc628">Fleet-market</placeName>

I am quite sure she was one of them; I knew her before. I have seen none of the property since. I was sober.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What she says is very false; she was very tipsy, and so was I - Witness. She appeared quite sober.</p>

            . I live in Fleet-market; my master keeps the wine-vaults. I saw Harding at our shop, between ten and eleven o'clock - the prisoner and several other persons were there: I did not hear of the robbery till the next morning, when the prosecutrix came, and complained of having been robbed - I am sure that the prisoner and another young woman, and a young man had been there together: the prisoner had been there before but very seldom. The officer brought her in next morning.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutrix came on the Monday morning to my house in Fleet-lane, and said she had lost 29 s., an apron, and some things in Fleet-market: I went down to Mr. Wood's wine-vaults, and found who the parties were, who had gone home with her. I found the prisoner in George-alley, Fleet-market, and told her the charge - she denied it. Harding complained of some hurt in her legs, and had a bandage on it. I searched the prisoner, and found 1 s. 6 d. in her mouth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about the loss: there was a young man and woman with me - the old lady was in company with a man, like a pensioner. I came down the market, and went home.</p>

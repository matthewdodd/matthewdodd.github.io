               <p>On Friday was a week, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was walking down East-Smithfield: I saw the two prisoners standing at the King's-Arms. Spencer came up to my right-side, and wanted to lay hold of my arm. She asked me to go along with her. I desired her to desist; she went a few steps a-head, and turning the corner of <placeName id="t17811017-36-crimeloc173">Nightingale-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17811017-36-crimeloc173" type="placeName" value="Nightingale-lane"></interp>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t17811017-36-off171 t17811017-36-crimeloc173"></join>, she came on my left-side: she got into the street before me: there was an opening on the right-hand side that goes into an alley. She asked me to walk up. I told her I would not: I was going home about my business. Coming down a little farther, she walked along side of me. About half way down the lane, she desired me to stop, and go home with her. We crossed over the way, and I stood four or five minutes in a dark entry, talking with her. She asked me to go home. I told her, I would not, I had got no money: she said, Yes, I had. I said, I had money, but not for her use: it was two large pieces; I had no change. Oh my dear, she said, never mind that, and put her hand down to my pocket. It rattled, being loose: I desired her to keep her hands off my pocket. She asked me to go home, and see her room. I went, but I do not know the name of the place: it was in a court. Murphy followed us all the way. I asked her the reason of that girl following us. When she came up to the door, she called to her for the key, as the door was locked. She brought the key, and opened the door, and Spencer and I went in. She did not shut the door. I shoved it to with my stick. She took the candle, and put it in the chimney: it was a room on the first floor. I took the candle out of the chimney, and looked in her face, and set it there again. She got her hand somehow into my pocket, and called the other girl in, and Spencer ran out, and slapped the door to, and left me in the room. I was in the room, about five minutes. I clapped my hand to my pocket, and cried out, I was robbed. Murphy said she knew nothing about it; it was Spencer, and not her. I got between Murphy and the door, and stopped her, till I got my cane and hat, and then took hold of her by the hand, and brought her to the door of the entry. She rather resisted a little, but came quietly at last. I called the watch, and in ten or twelve minutes, the Bow-street officers came down. They took Murphy in charge, and took her to the watch-house. Spencer was taken two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>What money had you in your pocket? - I had three thirty-six shilling pieces, and four guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>When had that money been in your pocket before, to your certain knowledge? - When I was standing in the dark passage with her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170033"></xptr> I shoved a piece of paper close down upon it. I had three half Joes, I suppose eightteen months, in one pocket or the other.</p>
               <p>You missed it just after this girl went out of the room? - Yes, directly, before I lost sight of the tail of her gown.</p>
               <p>Had you been on the bed with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you search, to see if the money had fell out of your pocket? - Yes; I felt on the bed, immediately as I missed it. I took the candle in my hand, and looked all over the bed.</p>
               <p>Had you been in such a situation with her in the entry, that the money might drop out of your pocket? - No. I put my hand to my pocket, to keep it in. Murphy was never near enough to me, to take any thing from me.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing pass between them? - No.</p>

               <p>I never was with the gentleman in my life.</p>
               <p>(There being no evidence to affect Murphy, she was not put upon her defence.)</p>

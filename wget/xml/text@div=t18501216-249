                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 227). On Saturday morning, 30th Nov., I was stationed in the Northumberland Hotel, oppo<lb></lb>site the shop of Mr. Cooper. About a quarter before seven o'clock I saw Turnbull leave the side-door with a basket—the front-door was closed—I followed him into Hungerford-market, and then into Scotland-yard—he went into a public-house, came out again, and went into the Horse Guards Canteen—he then went to Mr. Painter's, a butcher, in Hungerford-market—he left four half-quartern loaves there on a bench, and spoke to a person in the shop—he came out again, and went home to his master's—I kept my watch, and about half-past eight o'clock I saw him come out again with a basket—he went to Hungerford-market, stopped at Mr. Punter's shop, and took the four half-quartern loaves and put them into his basket—he then went and delivered some bread in Hungerford-market, at Long staff's public-house—he then went to the Strand, and to King William-street—he was joined by M'Donald—they went to a public-house in King William-street—M'Donald then carried the basket—they went down the Strand, and to Cecil-street, and delivered bread at several places—they then went into James-street, Adelphi—Turnbull was then carrying the basket, and he put it on the ground, and took out two loaves and gave them to M'Donald, who took them, and walked towards the Strand—I followed, and asked what he had—he said he had two loaves, which were given him by a young man he knew—I said, "Are you certain they are the young man's property?"—he said, "I don't know"—I took him into custody, and handed him over to Harris—I went to Mr. Cooper's shop, found Turnbull there, told him I was an officer of police, and asked him who the young man was that I saw with him in the Strand—he said his name was Donald; he did not know his other name—I asked him if he left any loaves at the butcher's shop—he said, yes, he left two—I told him I should take him into custody, and I did—I said I saw him give two loaves to the man in the Strand—(I did not know his name at that time)—he made no reply—while I was taking him to the station, he said, "I will confess; I have been led into it"—he said, "Is he up?"—I told him he was—he said, "That is right"—I produce these two loaves, which I got from M'Donald, when I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>he did not know his other name—I marked the loaves that were left in the shop; these are not two of them—I cannot say whether the loaves that were left at Mr. Painter's were not delivered to the customers—they were mixed with the loaves that Turnbull had in his basket—I saw him deliver bread afterwards at I suppose a dozen places.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at No. 12, Northumber-land-street, in the Strand. Turnbull was in my employ on 30th Nov., and had been so for six or eight months—it was part of his duty to take bread out for me to the Horse Guards, and other places—he had to go to the Horse Guards at half-past six or a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, because the men had to go to stable—he had no right to employ any one else, and he had no necessity for it—he had never made any com<lb></lb>plaint to me of having more than he could do—he had no right to give my bread away—these loaves are mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have not the shadow of a doubt about these loaves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the slightest—Turnbull has not been in the habit of selling bread to strangers, and accounting for it; I never remember his doing so—he takes a quantity of bread out, but I know all the customers—if he were to sell a loaf or two he might account to me for the money if he could not make up the number which he took out—when he came back that morning, I borrowed a shilling of him to make up change—his wages were as much bread and flour as be could consume, his lodging and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I never reckoned how many quartern loaves he consumed; I never looked so closely after him—I do not think I returned the shilling I borrowed of him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 59). On the morning of 30th Nov. I took M'Donald in charge from Manwaring—On the road to the station, he said that he had been in the habit of carrying the basket for Mr. Cooper's man, and he had given him the loaves—he said, "I have not stolen them, I have earned them"—when at the station I saw the prisoner Turnbull—he said, "If you will tell me what M'Donald said to you, I will <hi rend="italic">mind</hi> you afterward"—I said, "I can't tell you here, I will tell you somewhere else."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statements before the Magistrate were here read, as fol<lb></lb>lows</hi>: Turnbull says, "I confess the case; I took the loaves this morning, and it is about the fifth time I left the loaves; I know it was not right to give my friend two loaves to help me, but 1 could not get round the walk without some one to help me."—M'Donald says, "He asked me to give him a hand on Saturday morning, and I did so; you see how I have been brought into it."</p>

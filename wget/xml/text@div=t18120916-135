            . I am foreman to Messrs. Baldy and Watson, coal-merchants, Bell-alley, Coleman-street. On the 5th of August, I was at 24, in the Poultry. I saw the prisoner and another person with him go into Mr. Butler's shop. I saw the lad handle a parcel of black stockings on the counter to shew them to the prisoner; and the other man went to the window where there were some white silk stockings: and during the time he was at the window, the lad had his back to the prisoner. The prisoner took a pair of black stockings from off the counter, and put them into his hat before the lad could turn round. He put his hat on his head. I went to the Compter to get some person to take him; I saw nobody. I waited until the prisoner came out; I then went into the shop, and asked the youth, whether they had bought any property.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the shop when you went in - A. Only the youth. I told him what I had seen. I went and stopped the two men. The prisoner made use of terrible language, and offered to knock me down. He said, d - n your eyes, I have no property. The two men separated, and the one that I had no suspicion of, he delivered up a pair of white stockings to the shop-boy. I knew the other had black ones. I had not seen the other man take the white ones. I suppose he got them while I was gone to the Compter. They both went away into Grocer's-hall-court, and then into Grocer's-hall-yard. I knew the place, and then I thought they were secure. I bolted them in the yard. The beadle came to assist me; the other man made his escape after being let out. I traced the prisoner for ten minutes after that, and when I got into Basinghall-court, I saw a ticket porter. I knocked the prisoner's hat off. The stockings were in the hat; I gave them to Ward, the constable.</p>

            . I am shop-boy to Mr. Butler. On the 5th of August, the prisoner and another man came into my master's shop; he asked to look at some black and white stockings. I opened them several parcels, and while I was shewing them black stockings on the counter, he desired to look at some white stockings in the window. I went to the window to get them to shew him them. They looked out two pair of stockings; but when I told them the price, they said, they were too dear. They went out of the shop without buying any thing. They had scarce left the shop, when

When they stopped me, I told them I bought them of that man; to lay hold of him. They would not.</p>

            , I saw the other servant, she said she was up stairs, and laid on the bed; I examined the house; I found no person had broken any part of it; I desired the other maid to call her down, I wanted to speak to her; she answered me she was in fits, she could not come down; I desired Mr. Phillips, the master of the house, to go up stairs with me to her; after some conversation with Mr. Phillips and the prisoner, she said she knew nothing about it. The prosecutor told her he did not mean to hurt her, if she told him the truth. Through what past we went down stairs; I desired Mr. Phillips to send for a coach, which he did; and a lad that was in the house, a brother to the prisoner; we took him with us to find out the mother's house; we found out the place, and went into the room where she was. I asked her for the plate that she had brought away from Mr. Phillips's, she said she knew nothing of any plate; I asked her what she meaned by that, as her own daughter had sent me there for it, she had gave it to her; she blamed the girl for saying so; called her a wicked hussy, or something similar; I desired her to give me the plate immediately, if not give me up the duplicates if she had pledged them; she pulled out the duplicates from her pocket, wrapped up in a bit of paper, and delivered them to me; when I saw the duplicates, and what she had pledged them for; I asked her where the money was that she had pledged all them things for; she put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out the most part of it. I received in notes and money, nine pounds seventeen shillings and six-pence, which she said was the money that she had pledged them for. I then took her in custody; brought her to the office in Whitechapel, and put them in the watchhouse that night. It was late the next day before they were examined; the things were produced from the pawnbrokers by the duplicates; two of the pawnbrokers were bound over to appear here; three in Surry gave up the property, and the two in Middlesex are here. They were all pawned by

               <p>Q. Now tell me what the young woman said before you went to this house - A. She said she had taken them; I asked her whether she kept company with any man that she gave them to at the door, or in the street, she told me no; I told her I was certain that she did. Then she told me that she gave them to her own mother at the door; and she told me where she lived; and she hoped that we would have mercy on her mother. I asked the mother how she came to go there, she said that her daughter had sent for her over, that she wanted to see her very particular; that she had no thought what it was for, nor did not know; and when she went there she gave her all them things and desired her to go away as soon as she could; I asked her why she had not delivered them to her again, and made her take them into her master's house, as being her own daughter, she said she was afraid of doing so, I asked her why she had not packed them up the next morning, her answer was, that she was afraid to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the promise made to the daughter by the prosecutor - A. He would have conversation with her; I saw it was of no use of my talking; I believe he is quite ignorant of any thing of the kind; I believe he was never in a court before; he is a man of good character; he told the girl that if she would tell where the whole of the property was, that he would not hurt her.</p>

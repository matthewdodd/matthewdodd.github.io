                  </hi>. I remember playing cribbage on Monday, 8th April, a fortnight before the prisoner was taken—in consequence of our not having money to buy anything we stopped at home and smoked our pipes, and drank tome beer—I played first, and then Green played three or four games, and then I played again—the prisoner came between five and six o'clock, and left between one and two in the morning.</p>

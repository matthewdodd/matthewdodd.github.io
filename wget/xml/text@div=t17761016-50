            's on Saturday, was one of those stones you sent home on Friday? - Very well; I knew it by the colour of the clouds and the size, and there was a piece slit off, which I have here.</p>
               <p>Are those marks which enable you as a man of skill in your own business to know perfectly that stone again? - I should; the stone was too thick, it is usual to grind a stone down that is too thick, but my instruments were in order for it, and therefore I slit a piece off; here is the piece I slit off (producing it; the pieces matched exactly).</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>That is an operation that I suppose happens in the cutting of every thick stone? - Not very common; I had some work that was harder than this to do, and I slit them off; the general operation is to grind them down.</p>
               <p>I suppose there are other cornelians that are of the same colour? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>And as to the clouds, they are, I believe, in all cornelians? - Some make no appearance of any clouds.</p>
               <p>The generality of cornelians have clouds? - In general they have.</p>
               <p>And they are very similar? - They might to people that are no judges; but to people that are, they are very easily distinguished; I could pick this cornelian out of a thousand.</p>
               <p>As to the size, I suppose that is a common size? - No; the prosecutrix is very particular in having them cut to this size; this is a very particular shape, and you see it fits the pattern it is made to go into exactly.</p>

                  </hi>I live at No. 31, Broad-street, St. Giles's. On the 6th of May I was with Phillips in Grafton-street, Beater and English came up and said they had been and stolen some handkerchiefs out of Stagg's shop in Leicester-square, and they were going to sell them at Mr. O'Brien's—they showed them to me in their bosom, they looked like these—they asked me to go round with them—I went as far as the top of the court in Monmouth-street, where O'Brien lives—they went in, I waited till they came out again—I did not see who they saw in the house—when they came out they said they had sold them for a half-sovereign and eight shillings, and I saw a half-sovereign and eight shillings—I believe these to be the handkerchiefs they showed me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How old are you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Nine<lb></lb>teen—I have known Phillips about eight years; I knew him by going to school with him, he is a respectable boy—I have known him intimately for eight years—I know nothing wrong of him myself—I consider him respectable—I consider myself so—it is about eighteen months since I was at the Refuge—I was sent there for disobedience, for doing that I ought not to have done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What was it you ought not to have done, that you did? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Why, stealing—I have not been respectable, but I am now—I was in prison six months ago—there has been no charge against me since that, except on suspicion through Mr. O'Brien's friends—that was for some knives; the same knives that Phillips was taken up about—we were both taken to<lb></lb>gether last Saturday I believe—I was accused wrongfully—I was never in custody except on those two occasions—yes, for some cigars once about ten weeks ago, but I was innocent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Are those the only three times you have been in custody during your life? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Oh no, not during my life—I cannot tell how often I have been in jail—I have a very fair memory, but that is a thing I do not recollect—I might have been twenty times in jail—it was partly through such people as the O'Briens—I do not bear them any very good will—I know the archway in Monmouth-street—I was there about three weeks ago—there is a public<lb></lb>house on one side and an iron shop on the other—I know Thornton by being in the police, that is all—I have known him about six or eight weeks, not on this business, on other business—I am not one of his regular <hi rend="italic">cads</hi>—I</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. I went to No. 8, Monmouth<lb></lb>court, on the 7th of May, about two o'clock in the day, and saw Mrs. O'Brien there washing—I said I had received information that she had bought two pieces of handkerchiefs the day before—she denied having done so—I then asked if Mr. O'Brien was in—she said, "No"—I said, "What time will he be in? "—she said, "In the course of twenty minutes or half an hour"—he came in at that moment, and I asked him, is her presence, if he had bought any handkerchiefs—he said no, he did not buy such things—I said, "Are you positive? "—he laid, yes, if any thing of the sort had been bought it must have been when he was out, for he never bought anything of the sort, what he bought was furniture and metal—I said, "You had better be positive, and look about, for I believe the information I have received is correct"—O'Brien replied, "You can search my place if you like"—I said, "I am come prepared to search your place, I have a warrant to do so; and since you have denied buying any handkerchiefs, I shall search your place"—he then said to his wife, "Have you bought any handkerchiefs? "—she said, "Yes, four"—I said, "Where are they? Pro<lb></lb>duce them"—she hesitated some time, went to the back of the shop, took this basket from the wall, and took these six handkerchiefs from it—I then searched the room, and in a drawer I found three others, and a half one, and several other articles.</p>

I do not know as to that, they had a good deal of trouble in coming after me—I do not think paying them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time would be paying them for informa<lb></lb>tion they might give me—I considered both the trouble they had, and the distress they were in—I first heard they were thieves at Bow-street, at the second or third examination—I would not undertake to swear when it was—I gave them a shilling apiece yesterday, in the prosecutor's presence, as they said they had had no dinner, and they asked me for something to eat—I had given money to Thorpe on a former occasion—after I got the handkerchiefs I went again to O'Brien's house in plain clothes, with another officer in disguise—I believe Thorpe and Phillips were outside the door on that occasion, but I did not see them—I heard them outside—I believe they were outside—I did not hear them call us <hi rend="italic">cads</hi>—I believe that it a term thieves use for men in plain clothes—I swear I did not hear them call us <hi rend="italic">cads</hi>—I do not know whether any one did—there were two or three hundred persons in the court—the expression "<hi rend="italic">b</hi>——<hi rend="italic">cads</hi>" might have been made use of—I will not swear I did not hear it—I took 7lbs. weight of lead, a ladle, and a letter out of O'Brien's house that night—nothing else that I recollect—what was taken was entered in the sheet—some money was taken on a previous occasion—that has been returned to</p>

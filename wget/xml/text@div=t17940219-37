             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with John Fieldsend. On Tues<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190097"></xptr>day the 28th of January, I observed a man with some printed cottons on his shoulder, (I was in <placeName id="t17940219-37-crimeloc210">Oxford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17940219-37-crimeloc210" type="placeName" value="Oxford-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. You did not see the man come out of the shop? - No. Mr. Fieldsend answered me in the negative; from that I pursued the prisoner into Dean-street; I see him go down Dean-street, when he looked back, and, I suppose, seeing me pursuing him he let the goods fall and ran away; when I called stop thief, several people pursued him, amongst the rest a soldier of the name of Nicholls, who will appear; he was taken in Soho-square; I stopped with the goods till a person of the name of Foster, who lives with Mr. Fieldsend, came and took him. The prisoner had turned the corner of Carlisle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that the prisoner was the man that had the things on his back? - I cannot positively say that; I followed him when Mr. Foster had the care of the gods, and came up with him in Soho-square; when I came up with him he was taken to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you take him up if he was not the man that had the goods? - It was not me that stopped him, he was stopped by other people.</p>
               <p>- FOSTER sworn.</p>
               <p>There was an alarm in the shop of a man taking away some printed cotton; they were not laying in the shop, they were out at the door; I am in the shop of Mr. Fieldsend. I went to the door, and the people told me that the man was gone down Dean-street, and I pursued, and I saw the printed cottons thrown down on the ground, and our man standing by them, the other man had gone first. I know nothing, only that these are the very goods.</p>

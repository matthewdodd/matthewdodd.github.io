                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Locke, a confectioner, living at 106, High-street, Shoreditch—on Friday night, 13th December, the prisoner came about 10 o'clock, and asked for some baking-powder—I told her I had none—she then asked for some tope and bottoms—I said I had not any; she went away—a little time after she tame again and asked for a peany<lb></lb>worth of biscuits for a baby—I gave her thorn and she gave me a shilling—I gave her a sixpence and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and she went away—I put the shilling aside in the till till my husband came home—there was a sixpence or two there, but no shillings—a little time afterwards I took that shilling out of the till, and discovered that it was bad—I showed it to my husband when he came home—no one had been to the till meanwhile—I marked it, and my husband, in my presence, wrapped it in paper and put it at the back of the till—on Saturday, 14th December, the prisoner came again, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for a pennyworth of biscuits—she said they agreed with the baby—I served her, and she put down a sixpence—I tried it in my teeth; it was bad—it was soft, and bent—I gave it to my husband—I recognised her when she came in—I said, "You came yesterday and gave me a shilling; it was bad"—she said she had not been in the shop before—my husband was placing some goods in the window when she came in—he was near—he tried the sixpence and told the prisoner he should give her in charge—he then handed back the sixpence to me, and she snatched it out of my hand and put it to her mouth—my husband then called a con<lb></lb>stable; and I told the constable in the prisoner's presence that the sixpence was</p>

                  </hi>. I was arranging some things in the window on this Saturday—I remember my wife giving me a bad sixpence; she had bent it—it was very soft—I gave it back to my wife, and the woman snatched it out of her hand and put it to her mouth—she was asked to open her mouth, and she said she would not do so till she got to the station—I called a con<lb></lb>stable and gave her in charge—there was no constable in the shop before—he was ten or fifteen yards from the shop—when I came back from the police-station I looked everywhere for the sixpence, but could not find it—I am sure she must have swallowed it—her eyes watered as if she had made an effort—I made the remark to the policeman in her presence.</p>

On 14th December, I wait called into Mr. Locke's shop; the prisoner was given into my custody, and I received this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mrs. Locke—I asked the prisoner to open her mouth—she said she would not do so; if she was going to be charged she would wait till she got to the station—the female searcher searched her at the station, and on her was found a farthing, a key, and a duplicate—no bad sixpences.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of March, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning, I stood at Tyburn-gate, and a cart drawn by two horses came up the Uxbridge-road - the prisoners were with it, and another person was about twenty yards behind. Hewett led the first horse, which was blind; Higgins drove the other; Hewett stopped to pay the toll, and went on - the third person came up and objected to the toll; the load appeared heavy, and was covered with straw and hay very closely - I suspected something, and followed the cart a quarter of a mile down Oxford-street, opposite to Mary-le-bone watch-house - I then went up, and said to Higgins,"If it is a fair question, what have you in that cart?" he said, "I don't know how many cwt. I have got;" I said,"I asked what it was;" he said lead. I produced my staff, said I was an officer, and considered myself right in stopping them - the horses were stopped. I pulled up the cover, and saw it was lead; the third man turned down a street, and got away - "Thomas Minter, Hammersmith," was painted on the cart in white paint; there was 18 cwt. of lead - I asked Higgins where he brought it from - he said from Hammersmith, but he had come the Acton road; Hewett was by, and I suppose heard this. I asked who he bought it from; he mentioned a name, which I have forgotten - he said the man bought old iron, rags, and such things - I said, "I suppose he employed you to move it;" he said, "No, we were sent by our master, whose name is on the cart." Minter was taken at Hammersmith, but discharged - he keeps a horse and cart, and carries turf for sale; he was not the man behind the cart - it was a lad, about eighteen years old. Higgins said they set off about a quarter past five o'clock - they were nearly four miles from Acton; he said he was taking it to the bottom of the Haymarket. I said, "You have come two miles out of your way, and have come a very hilly road." I took the prisoners into the office - I went to them again, and told them I had forgotten who they said they had it from. Higgins then said, "I know nothing at all about it." I went to Acton on the Wednesday following, and found this house which had been robbed of a quantity of lead; and appeared to be fresh cut. I have brought some pieces, which corresponds with that in the cart.</p>

            . I am a plumber, and live in Seymour-place. I went to Acton with Webster - the house appeared to have two tons of lead taken from it. I have no doubt but that in the cart was part of it - the damage done to the house exceeds 200l.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper. I was over the roof of this house the Saturday before the prisoners were stopped - it was then quite safe - one of the prisoners lives at Turnham-green, and the other at Hammersmith.</p>
               <p>HIGGINS Defence. I went to ask Minter to lend me his cart to fetch a load of mould - he said he could not till Saturday; I then got it, and met a man, who asked if I could take a load of goods to the Haymarket, and he would give me 20s. I went to Shepherd's-bush for the load, and it was this lead - he gave me money for the toll, and said he would meet me at the bottom of the Haymarket.</p>

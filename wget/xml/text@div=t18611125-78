                  </hi>. I am a salesman to Messrs. Sowdon and Woledge, of Commercial-place, Old kent-road—they are upholsterers, in a considerable way of business—in the month of July last the male prisoner called at the warehouse—he wished us to send to 5, Grove-terrace, Hill-street, Peckham, to measure for carpets—he said he wanted them laid down at once, as he was about to get married—I inquired of him whether he wanted any furni<lb></lb>ture, he said, "Yes; a little," and I showed him some drawing-room furni<lb></lb>ture, and he selected some chairs, &amp;c.—I then inquired if there was anything more—he said, "Not to-day," but the lady would call—I also showed him carpets for dining and drawing-rooms—as he was about leaving I inquired his name and address—he said his name was Edward Low, at the address he had given, Grove-terrace, cattle salesman, banking at Hill and Son's, Smithfield—he then left—he did not say anything about the place of busi<lb></lb>ness of Mr. Low; no more than that he was a cattle salesman, and that the family had been cattle salesmen for a century—he said they carried on their business at Bank-buildings, Cattle-market—I afterwards spoke to Mr. Sowdon about it, and, after making some inquiries to ascertain the truth of what the prisoner told me, Mr. Sowdon told me. to Supply the furniture—I waited until the lady came—she came either the same day or the next—she called with a person who represented herself to be the servant—the female prisoner</p>

               <p>was the lady who called—she inquired if Mr. Low had called at oar esta<lb></lb>blishment—I said that a gentleman representing himself as Mr. Low had called, and ordered some carpets and furniture, and said a lady would call; and they represented to me that this was to be the future Mrs. Low—she then asked to see some drapery goods—I showed them some, and they selected some furniture for a dining-room—after that, from time to time, we sent off goods which had been selected by both the prisoners—the servant called afterwards, and, in consequence of what she said, I went to 5, Grove<lb></lb>terrace—I there saw the female prisoner, and she said she wished to see me about the dining-room furniture—we had sent some at that time; being too small for the room, she thought it would suit the breakfast-room better, and she should like to have dining-tables, six chairs, a couch, and a sideboard for that room—I came back again, represented it to Mr. Sowdon, and he said, "Very well"—I inquired if Mr. Low was in, and she said, "No"; he was out of town—I went there again several times, but I could see no one but the servant—in consequence of what she said, I sent some chimney-glasses to the same place, and also some more carpet, and some fenders, and tire-irons for the breakfast room—the things were sent up from time to time as we got them ready, and they amounted altogether ultimately to 158<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then I took the account—I saw the servant, and she said that Mr. Low had gone to be married—I never saw Mr. Low again—I went from time to time to the house, and ultimately, on Monday, 29th of July I think, I found it shut up—that was two days after we had sent in the last goods I think—we traced the van which had taken the goods away—we found one van loaded with the goods, and we took possession of it, and we traced a quantity of others to Mr. Best in Rochester-row—we ultimately recovered the greater part of them—Mr. Best is a furniture dealer; he deals in second-hand furniture—on 16th October, we found the prisoners in custody—I recognised them as the man I had seen, and the intended Mrs. Low—I never up to that time knew of any other name—on that day I went with the police to 2, Elizabeth-place, Wyndbam-road—I saw the prisoners in custody at the station—I also saw there a pair of curtains, a curtain-holder, and some anti-macassars, which I had sold to the prisoners—if I had not believed that the prisoner was Mr. Low, and that he had a banking account, I should not have parted with the goods.</p>

I went to 5, Grove-terrace, and found the house shut up—I then went to Charlotte-street, Old Kent-road, and there found a van loaded with our goods, which I took possession of—next morning I found some more of our furniture at Best's, in Rochester-row—that has also been returned.</p>

Best, 5, Rochester-terrace—on the following morning the prisoner told me that his name was Thomas Henry Tapley, and that he was married to Elisa, October, 1853; and the reason he gave the name of Jackson, was that he had taken the house in Wyndham-road in that name—I do not know of my own knowledge whether any of the tickets relate to the property.</p>

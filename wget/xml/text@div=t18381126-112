The prisoner was in their employ—some silver was weighed out to me—on the 29th of October, I went to breakfast, and in the evening I received information—I had the silver weighed and 15 dwts. were missing—this now produced is similar to what I missed—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

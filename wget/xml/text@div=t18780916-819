                  </hi>. I am a publican out of business, and live at 38, Cambridge Street, Camberwell—in 1859 I married Mrs. Mary Lovett, who was possessed of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was in the hands of Huggins's, the brewers—prior to the marriage, this settlement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was duly drawn up and executed—this is the prisoner's signature, this is mine, and this is my wife's—her property was invested in two trustees; the prisoner was one of them—there was power to them to advance me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was advanced, and I still hold it—I gave my note of hand for it, which the prisoner holds—the other 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken out of Huggins's hands, and advanced to Mr. Sea<lb></lb>brook on two freehold houses at Forest Hill—Seabrook died in 1868—I received the interest until September 1875, and always got it from the prisoner—I believe he is one of Seabrook's executors—Seabrook's affairs were put in Chancery, and while the proceedings were going on Mr. Lovett died, and I mentioned a fresh trustee to the prisoner several times, and so did my wife, and one was appointed, but the deed was never executed—the last cheque we received was on 19th September, 1875; that was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less property tax—we have not received a farthing since—I have spoken to the prisoner about different investments, and he has said "As soon as you can find anything suitable there is the money in the Court of Chancery, where I have left it—in 1876 five houses at Peckham were advertised for sale—I saw the defendant about it, and he said if there was a good title he had no objection, and about November, 1876, I arranged with the agent to send the draft contract to the defendant, and heard from the defendant afterwards that he had received it; he said that he could not entertain it, as there was only a two-years' title—I said that we were pur<lb></lb> chasing of Mr. Strong, one of the Surrey Magistrates, who was too much a man of business to buy anything that had not got a good title; he said "Well, I will see into it, and you had better see me again in the course of two or three days"—when I saw him again he said that he had investigated the matter and found it was quite right, as Mr. Strong fell back on his old forty-years' title, and that he had put the matter into Mr. Watson's hands, and pulled out his purse and showed me a note which I believe was a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he said he was going to give Mr. Watson to pay the deposit with—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187809160081"></xptr>
               <p>then left him—a communication was afterwards made to me, and I came up and saw the defendant; he said "Watson will be here presently; you had better wait till he comes"—I waited from 11 to 3, but he did not come—I never saw any person named Watson—the property was sold because the prisoner never signed the contract—the endorsement on the cheque is the defendant's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 20th August</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 530<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on account of the Court of Chancery, and endorsed by A.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I never asked you for the money, but I applied to you for an investment—I had no right to ask you for the money; you led me to believe it was still in the Court of Chancery, and that you were getting no interest—there is a stamped envelope attached to the depositions. (<hi rend="italic">Stamped</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1876)—I never read the contents—I did not object to the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being invested in Consols because I never read the document—it was always understood that it was to be invested in something else—you showed me the draft at a public-house; you pulled out your pocket-book, as you pretended, promiscuously, and showed me a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>; I said "What a dangerous "thing to carry about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; "you said" It is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the old man has paid me for <hi rend="italic">salary</hi>"—you generally paid me by cheque on the Union Bank—I have never been called upon to pay interest, or I should have paid it to my wife—she and I have spent the interest; the settlement was for her own private use—her daughter lived with us and assisted us in business—she left to get married—I saw you three days before Christmas 1876, and did not see you again till you were at the police-court, Greenwich.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I had not the slightest doubt that the money was in the Court of Chancery, and I expressed no objection—I did not contemplate or authorise his investing it in Consols—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was shown me 12 months or more before Leonard went away, and he was not heard of again even at his home, for four months—my solicitor made an effort to get his address, but could get no reply—I had several business transactions with him afterwards—I saw him up to 1876, and he always told me that the money was left in the Court of Chancery; he told me so several times after the 12th August, 1875.</p>

Mason and Addley, the solicitors, last year, and on 9th or 10th January this year I called on the prisoner at Brookley Villas, Lewisham—I said "I have come to inquire what you have done with my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also to know where the note of hand is"—my husband had given him the note of hand and the settlement—he said he would send a letter that night or next morning to exonerate my husband; and he did not know whether the note of hand was at Forest Hill or at another place—he did not reply to my question about the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we got this letter next day. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the defendant, declaring that he had no personal interest in the money</hi>.) I heard nothing more, and went the end of April, or early in May, and put the same three questions—he said he did not know whether the settlement was at Forest Hill or at the office, and he could not give up the note of hand as he was the trustee; he said "As to the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I get well enough to go to work I will pay the money back"—I did not know at that time that he had had</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">gave judgment as follows: It appears to me that the statute of Victoria is an answer to the application. I forbear going into the other answer offered, on the authority of the decision in the Exchequer. I should not like to adopt hastily, and without much more consideration, the decision there given, as applicable to the present case; and if it rested upon that alone, I should certainly desire further time to consider; but it appears to me that the statute of Victoria is a complete answer to the application. By that statute, the wife of a natural-born subject becomes naturalized. The expression of the statute is, 'any woman married,' that is, already married, or 'who shall be married to a natural-born subject, or person naturalized, shall be deemed and taken to be herself naturalized, and have all the rights and privileges of a natural-born subject.' The obvious, plain, and natural inference from that, appears to me to be, that she should be considered exactly as if she had been naturalized by Act of Parlia<lb></lb>ment, or as if she had been a natural-born subject; and the question then is, whether she can now claim a Jury</hi> de medietate linguae <hi rend="italic">for herself, it being clear that her husband, who is a natural-born subject, cannot be tried by a Jury so constituted. The reason of the Court pausing for the moment, was for the purpose of obtaining what appeared to be a precise authority upon that point. There is, in Bacon's Abridgment, an authority to this extent: 'It hath been holden that denizens, so made by letters patent, are denizens within the meaning of this statute.' If that case had been before us, with that authority, it appears to me</hi> a fortiori <hi rend="italic">a person made a denizen, or rather naturalized by Act of Parliament, would be, within the intent of the statute, a natural-born subject. The language of the Statute of Edward</hi> (<hi rend="italic">and all that the modern statute does, is to leave the rights created under that statute unimpaired</hi>) <hi rend="italic">is,"that in all manner of inquests and proofs to be taken or made among aliens and denizens, although</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">the King be party. "Well, now the question is, whether this be an issue to be taken between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and two persons, one of whom is a denizen, or natural-born subject, and the other an alien? The statute says, that Maria Manning is a natural-born subject, is to be deemed and taken to be naturalized; and I find it laid down in Hawkins in these words: 'It is holden that by denizens in this state, are meant not only those that are born within the King's dominions, but also those that are made denizens by the King's letters patent.' It is said that the statute intended to confer privileges, and to create new rights, but not to take away any privilege which existed before; and that was the whole scope of Mr. Parry's argument, not unentitled to some attention; but it appears to me that the answer to it is this, the status of the party is altered; all the privileges that were intended to be preserved are personal, as the learned Attorney-General pointed out with reference to the 14th section of the statute; there, all the personal privileges belonging to an individual are pre-served, but the privilege of being tried by a Jury</hi> de medietate linguae <hi rend="italic">is not the individual personal privilege of the prisoner; it is the privilege of the status to which the prisoner belongs</hi>,—<hi rend="italic">it is being an alien: ceasing to be an alien, she ceases to have that privilege, and it is not necessary to take that privilege away by express words; it is sufficient to alter her status: the moment she ceases to be an alien, the inquest to be taken, ceases to be an inquest between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and an alien; it is now an inquest between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and two persons, her natural subjects, and therefore the trial must be conducted in the ordinary way by a Jury of the country."</hi>

In consequence of information I received on Friday, 17th Aug. last, I went with Burton to No. 3, Miniver-place, Bermondsey—the house was empty—I examined and searched it—Burton had opened the door with a key which he had in his possession—in the back kitchen my attention was attracted by a damp mark be<lb></lb>tween the edges of two of the flag<lb></lb>stones—I had heard that O'Connor was missing at that time—with Burton's assistance I removed the stones—there was mortar first under the stones, and then earth—the two stones appeared to have been recently removed—I proceeded to remove a portion of the earth—when I had got down about a foot, 1 discovered the toe of a man, and when I got about eighteen inches down, I discovered the loins of a man, the back of a man—at that time I had sufficiently removed the earth to ascertain the position in which the body was lying—it was lying on the belly, and the legs were brought back and tied up round the haunches with a strong cord, such as I should think was used as a clothes-line, about the size of a clothes-line—it was quite naked—I proceeded to remove more earth, and at length found the head and other parts forming the entire body—the body was embedded in slack lime—whilst I was doing this, Mr. Lock-wood, a surgeon, came in—I had then removed sufficient earth to show him the loins of the man—whilst the body was lying on the earth, Mr. Lockwood removed from the head a set of false teeth—the head was lower in the ground than the other parts of the body—I did not examine the bead closely, and did not see whether anything had happened to it—I removed the body from the hole, and removed it into the front kitchen—it was then examined in my presence by Mr. Lock wood and Mr. Odling, another surgeon—a person named Flynn came in before the body was removed from the hole; he also had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of examining the body—the body remained in the front kitchen on the night of the 17th and the day of the 18th, until an inquest was held—on the same day, the 17th, I went with Mr. Flynn to 21, Greenwood-street, Mile End-road—I there saw a box—it was sealed, but not locked—it had</p>

               <p>together some time, Mrs. Manning asked O'Connor why he did not come to dinner that day, saying, "We kept dinner waiting an hour; did you not get my note?"—O'Connor said he did not—I then remarked, perhaps it may have been late when you posted the letter, and he could not have received it at the hour he left the Docks, which was four o'clock, and she then said it was two, and he would get it to-morrow—O'Connor then said, "Mr. Walsh has got the balance of the bill to-day"—he said it was Mr. Pitt's bill, for which execution had been taken out by the officers of the Court in Charles-square, Hoxton—Mrs. Manning then asked, would he proceed against Pitt for the other three bills?—O'Connor said he would—nothing had been said before about these three bills—O'Connor and Mr. Manning then commenced smoking a pipe and talking on different subjects, and after O'Connor had smoked some time he became faint, and sat on the sofa, and then Mr. and Mrs. Manning got some brandy and water—he got the brandy, and she went for the water—O'Connor did not take any—after a short time he recovered from the fainting, and he and I left about a quarter past eleven—I went with him as far as Leman-street, Commercial-street, Whitechapel, on his way home, and we parted there at nearly twelve—he was in very good health then—I never saw him again till I saw his body on 18th Aug., as I have described—as far as I had an opportunity of observing, the Mannings were as friendly with him as brothers could be—his conversation could not have been addressed to Manning, because she spoke and he was listening.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> say it must have been under ground a week or more, from what appearances do you come to that conclusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was quite in a state of decomposition—I speak of the exterior—I take into account the fact of the lime being there—the skin becomes decomposed earlier when lime is poured on it—taking into account the lime, and all that I saw, I formed an opinion that the body had been there at least a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that conclusion partly founded upon the history of the case, or from what you saw with your own eyes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I formed my opinion on it the very day the body was taken out of the ground—I then mentioned that it must have been there more than a week—I had before heard that the body had been missing—the effect of lime would be to destroy the features very rapidly,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the external application of the lime make any difference in the decomposition of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The lime, I believe, might have been absorbed through the fractures, and so have caused the decomposition of the brain—the fractures were large enough for portions to go through—I examined the intestines with Mr. Olding, they were not so much decomposed as you would have thought, from the external state of the body.</p>

I went with a Mr. Dobson to Leith-wharf, in Edinburgh—I there saw the female prisoner—I left Mr. Dobson outside the door, and went into the room, accompanied by a police-officer—I said, as I entered the room, "Mrs. Smith, I presume"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "I beg pardon for intruding; if you are really Mrs. Smith, you are not the person I am in search of; may I request to ask, are you a married lady?"—she said she was—I said, "And your husband's name, is it Smith?"—"Yes"—"Where does he reside?"—"Oh, he is dead"—I said, "When did you come to Edinburgh?"—she said, "Well, I came a few days ago, I think on Tuesday or Wednesday last"—I said, "Is there any person in town to whom you can make reference?"—she said that the only individual to whom she could refer was a Mr. Shaw, over the way, who had recommended her to the lodging in which I found her—I said, "Where did you last come from, and what is the object of your visit to Edinburgh?"—she said, "I last came from New-castle, and the occasion of my visit is for the benefit of my health; "and she made allusion to Porto Bello, which is about three miles from Edinburgh, where she said she had been bathing, or meant to bathe, I forget which—I then made some inquiries into the state of her money matters, and inquired whether she had any scrip—she said, "Scrip! what do you mean by scrip?"—I said, "Any railway shares?"—she said she had not—I said, "Have you not been offering railway-shares for sale?"—she said she had not—at that moment I looked very intently at her, and said, rather in an under tone," My impression is, that you are the wife of Frederick George Manning; "and at the same moment I said to the officer behind me," Just ask Mr. Dobson to come in for one moment"—Mr. Dobson came in, and in answer to a question which I put to him, he said, "That is the lady who offered me scrip."</p>

G. Manning (some hotel), Taunton"—I then said, "My suspicions are confirmed; put all these up"—I turned round to her, and said, "Now, Mrs. Manning, it is right I should let you know that I am superintendent of the Edinburgh police; you are charged with the murder of Mr. Patrick O'Connor; you are not bound to answer any questions I may put to you unless you think proper; you are at perfect liberty to give such answers as you like, but in the event of your being brought to trial, the answers you give may be used in evidence against you"—I then said, following up that caution," Now tell me, have you got scrip?"—"Oh yes, scrip of my own; oh yes, scrip of my own"—I said, "Well, oblige me by producing it"—she said, "Oh certainly, you will find it in the trunk"—the trunk was unlocked, if it was locked, but I cannot recollect whether it was or not—it was opened, and in the trunk, near the top, I found</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> say the stains on the dress are stains of blood; state how you come to that conclusion <hi rend="italic">? A</hi>, I cut out the stained portion of the dress and cut it into several slips, which I suspended one after another in a small quantity of distilled water; they imparted their colour to the water—it was a smoky red colour, from which I afterwards obtained a precipitate indi<lb></lb>cating albumen, one of the constituents of the blood—the colouring matter was not affected by the materials I used; it was not any colouring matter with which I am acquainted—there is no direct chemical process which will identify blood stains—my chemical process included a very large number of sources of stains, but I cannot swear it was blood—I did not examine it by the microscope; it did not appear to me to be a case suitable for micro-scopic observation—it is stated that the globules of blood can be detected long after.</p>

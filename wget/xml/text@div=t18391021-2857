                  </hi>. I am a plasterer. On Sunday morning, the 5th of October, between one and two o'clock, I met the prisoner in Barbican—I had been to a little society that I belong to—I was quite sober—the pri<lb></lb>soner came up, and asked how I did—I said I was pretty well—she took bold of my coat, and began to pull me about—I pushed her away, and I felt her hand in my right-hand waistcoat pocket—I endeavoured to get hold of her hand, but she concealed it in her pocket-hole—I missed out of my pocket, three half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence—I accused her of it, caught hold of her hand, and took out of it two shil<lb></lb>lings and one sixpence—I asked her to give me the half-crowns—she denied having them—a policeman was passing, and I gave her in charge—she then dropped two half-crowns—I picked them up, and a gentleman picked up another in Bunhill-row—they were all given to the officer.</p>

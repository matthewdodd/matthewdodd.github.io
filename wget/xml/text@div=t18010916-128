               <p>JOHN CARLISLE sworn. - I am a constable; About half past three o'clock in the morning, the 23d of July, I was coming down West-street, West-Smithfield, I met the patrole; they had stopped the prisoner with the property just before I came up; the prisoner told me they were his own; he said, there were two side pockets in the great coat; that his father had it made for him to drive a waggon; I looked, and found there were no pockets; then I secured him, and took him to the Compter; I asked him where he lodged; he told me a number of different places; I went to a great number of places; at last I heard of Mr. Good's livery-stables, where the property was taken from, and there I found Mr. Wright.</p>

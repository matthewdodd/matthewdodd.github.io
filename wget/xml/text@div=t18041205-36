                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050039"></xptr>Q. Was Hewit with you when you apprehended him? - A. Yes, the 22d of November, about ten o'clock at night, I and Hewit were out on our duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received directions from the Magistrates to take up persons that might be found with property suspected to be stolen from ships or vessels in the river? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your duty did you and Hewit see the prisoner? - A. Yes, near the entrance of Leading-street, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. That is close to the river Thames? - A. About 120 yards from the river we saw the prisoner in a boat; he had a bag of coals on his back; I asked him how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him they were coals? - A. No, we did not know at that time; he said, in the first place, the captain gave them to him; afterwards he said they belonged to different men that had been working on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any ship? - A. Not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any ship he had been on board of? - A. Not at all; he said the men had given them to him, upon which we took him into custody; then we told him we were Officers of the Shadwell Police-Office.</p>
               <p>Q. On what suspicion? - A. On suspicion of the coals being stolen from some ship or vessel in the river Thames.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the prisoner coming from at the time? - A. From the bottom of Shadwell market.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near to the river? - A. About 120 yards from it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him you were Officers of the Police, what then? - A.He came with us as far as the middle of the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him why you apprehended him? - A. Yes, on suspicion of the coals being stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him from where you suspected they were stolen? - A. Yes, from the river Thames; after we told him we were Police-Officers he came as far as the middle of Shadwell market with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come along with you quietly? - A. Yes, as far as the middle of the market; when we first took him into custody he put the coals off his back; we helped them on his back again, and he carried them to the middle of Shadwell market; he then threw the coals from off his back, and said he would carry them no farther; I took the prisoner by the arm to take him to the lock-up house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him by the arm to take him to the lock-up house, what was Hewit doing? - A.- A. I desired him to stay behind to take care of the property; the prisoner and I proceeded on to near the top of the market-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that market hill lead to the river? - A. No, to the Highway; when we got pretty near the top of the hill the prisoner turned round, caught me by the collar, and said he would go no farther with me; he struggled a good deal, and I threw him; he held me fast by the collar, and dragged me down with him; while I was in that situation, upon him upon the grounds, I felt myself to be wounded in the face, and I bled a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel when you found the blood in your face what kind of instrument it was? - A. No, I found I was cut in the face; a person came by at that time, of the name of Morgan, and assisted me.</p>
               <p>Q. How assisted you? - A. Helped me to get up, and the prisoner got up and I laid hold of him again; when we got quite to the top of the hill he laid hold of me by the collar again, and struggled with me, and I threw him again; while I was falling he cut me on the leg, and stabbed at my body in several places.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you received this wound in the leg, did you perceive it was with a sharp instrument? - A. Yes, it cut through my stocking very plainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is your present illness the cause of that? - A. Yes, I have been confined ever since; my clothes were cut in various parts of the body; I caught hold of the prisoner, and got him up.</p>

               <p>Q. Morgan was with you at this time? - A. Yes, and I proceeded to the lock-up house with him, and delivered him to the jailor and other officers present; I went to the surgeon, Mr. Pater, to get my wounds dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day you appeared before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner appeared there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was convicted there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave this account, and he was detained for this offence? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>(The conviction read.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Harris.) Upon that occasion, before the Magistrate, did he give any account from whom he received the coals, or where he got them? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then committed upon the charge you have now given evidence of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any defence to that charge? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. He understood perfectly well what was going forward? - A. Perfectly well; the Magistrate asked him what he had to say, but he had nothing to say.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner? - A. Yes, very near the top of Leading-street, Shadwell market; I stopped him, and asked him how he came in possession of those coals on his back; he said a captain belonging to the ship where he had been at work had given them to him; we then told him we thought the captain would not give him so many as that; he then said they belonged to different men, and they had given them all to him, and he had given them some beer for them; we told him we did not think it a satisfactory account, and he must go with us; he said he would go with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him you were officers? - A. We told him before, as we were bringing him along, that he must go with us; we came together to the middle of Shadwell market; the prisoner, Harris, and me; he then threw the coals off his back, and said he would take them no farther; Harris then took hold of him, and desired me to stay by the coals, which I did, and Harris and the prisoner went on together without me; I was to stay there till he came back; I thought he staid a long while, and got a strange man to help me up with them; I took them to the lock-up house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the witness Harris there? - A. I did not; we locked the coals up, and produced them before the Magistrate the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Harris afterwards? - A. I went over to the doctor's, and saw him there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the witness Harris in Shadwell on the 22d of November? - A. I saw Harris having a scuffle with some man, about ten at night; I saw them fall together, Harris was uppermost; on their getting up again, Harris requested I would assist him; on that I laid hold of the man by the collar; after that he did not make much resistance; I walked a little way with him and then let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not observe any thing the matter with Harris? - A. As he was going to the lock-up room I perceived his cheek bleed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect which cheek it was? - A. The left cheek; I mentioned it to him; I asked him how he came by it; he said he imagined he cut it in the fall by some glass, or something that might be about there; then he observed he had lost his hat, and I said I would go back for it; I found the hat and took it to him in the tap-room where the lock-up room was kept, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that his leg was cut? - A. No, not then; he was advised to go to the doctor's, and I went soon after; they say the wounds are both in the leg and the cheek; they appeared to be cut by a sharp instrument, as I observed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear as if they could have been done by glass? - A. No, I said I would go over the way, and shew them where the scuffle was, to see if there was any instrument; I went to the place where the first scuffle was, with some officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found in your presence? - A. No, I returned to the surgeon's, and saw him dressed.</p>

Very much cut, the side of his cheek was bleeding very much; I went and searched the prisoner, stripped him naked, but found nothing upon him; after I had done that, I locked him up; then I went with three officers, with flambeaux's, to see if I could find any instrument that he was cut with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing? - A. Yes; about fourteen yards from where the scuffle was, I found a knife, (produces it); it was dirty on one side when I took it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see his leg? - A. Yes; it was not so formidable in the appearance as that on the cheek; his cheek is now well, his leg is not well yet; his leg might have healed as soon as his cheek, but the first two or three days he walked about, and that might inflame it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the leg that night, did it appear to have been inflicted with a sharp instrument? - A. It was a simple division of the skin, without injuring any of the parts beneath.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the wound in the leg be inflicted by glass, or an oyster-shell? - A. No; it appeared to be by an instrument.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Oliver.) You said you went to the spot, and found a knife? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any oyster-shells, or glass there? - A. There were none.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never had a knife, nor any weapon in the world, I did not know he was cut, I did not know any thing about it; when he searched me, I told him I had no knife.</p>

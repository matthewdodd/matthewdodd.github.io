            . Last Monday was se'nnight, the prisoner's own sister's husband lay dead in her house; there was a dispute betwixt the prisoner and her husband, about who should wear a cloak to the burial, which was just about going out, she thought it more proper for him to have a cloak, rather than the man that had it, and told him if he would not, she would mob him to the ground : he said, G - d blast you out of the world, and hit her a back-handed blow on the face; then she flew to the fire, took up an iron holdfast about nine inches long which they used to stir the fire with, and being about three yards from him flung it, it stuck in his side, he doubled himself together, and said, I am stabbed! I am stabbed! it is in my ribs! her sister took it out, he lived a week after this.</p>

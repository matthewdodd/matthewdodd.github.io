On 31st Jan., about half-past three o'clock, I was in a tap-room, at Woodford Wells—Bunce spoke to me, and asked me if I knew anybody that would take a quarter of pork with the hair on—I told him I thought it was a very awkward thing to get rid of—he told me I could have the head for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I had not any money to purchase it, and he said he would trust me till Saturday night—I agreed to meet him in the Forest—I afterwards saw the prosecutor, and told him—I then met Bunce in the Forest about four—I gave him a gun—when we returned home at dark, he told me the pork was in a small bag, and it would not tie—I gave him a bag to put some pork in to bring to me—in about three-quarters of an hour afterwards, I saw the two prisoners with the bag in their possession—they were about fifteen yards from where they had placed the bag on some bricks of some ruins, and they walked away from it—I went and told the police<lb></lb>man—before I went to the Forest, Bunce told me he was very much afraid it was Mr. Patten's pig, and he asked if I had heard anything about</p>

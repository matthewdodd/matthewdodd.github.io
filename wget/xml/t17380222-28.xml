I heard the Rogues at Work and got up, and call'd out, - Who's there ! - what are you at! for I thought at first it had been our Maid got up so early, but looking down Stairs and neither hearing nor seeing any Body, I went up Stairs again, and was afraid Thieves had got in, and that they would shoot me; so after I had look'd out of my Chamber Window and saw no Body, I went to Bed again, and in a quarter or half an Hours Time I heard the Bolts clink, upon which, I got out of Bed, and call'd out, - Who's there! Then I went to Bed again, and lay till Morning.

He and I went out to get something to maintain us in the Christmas Hollidays, from this Mr. Ward's House. The Prisoner got into the Garden on the back of the House, and I staid on the Outside; I saw him break; Boards from the Back of the House; then he got in and open'd the back Door for me to get in to him We look'd about the House, and took 2 Pewter Plates and a Dish, and 2 Mugs. Afterwards he went among the Fowls, and got hold of one, which he kill'd, and bid me put it into the Bag while he fetch'd more; then he got 2 live ones, which we put into the Bag, and he was going again to get something else, but the Man of the House calling out, we push'd off.</p>
               <p>Ward. The Noise of the Fowls wak'd me the first Time.</p>
               <p>Eadon. We went again to the House in a quarter of an Hour's Time, and found the Sack, (which we had thrown under the Hedge, when we ran away) safe, where we left it, with all the Things in it, and hearing no Body stirring in the House, the Prisoner went in again, and brought out a Pan, with some boil'd Meat and Broth the Meat he put in his Pocket, and the Broth he left in the Yard. When we had got what we could, we came about 3 o'Clock in the Morning to our Lodgings at Mr. Allen's, where we kill'd another of the Fowls, and had the two bak'd in a Pye for our Christmas Dinner. The other five Fowl the Prisoner sold to a Woman in Shoreditch for a 1 s. The Pewter we sold at a Pewterer's Shop, - the first Shop in Houndsditch, on the left Hand side of the Way, and we shar'd the Money between us. I have been an honest Man before, - but the Prisoner has been the Ruin of me.</p>

               <p>Whitemore Wilson. I have known the Prisoner from an Infant his Character is, that he work'd with his Father to get an honest Livelihood, - he's a Cobler by Trade, as we may express it in the Tongue. I never knew he was call'd in Question before, - but only once for a Childish Thing, - for taking a little Fruit. When he's in Liquor he'll be a little out of the Way indeed.</p>

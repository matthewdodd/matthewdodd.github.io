                  </hi>. I am a hawker of toys—on 22d April, about a quarter to 1 in the morning, I was in Golden-lane, going home, and saw five or six men standing at the corner of a court—one of them said, <hi rend="italic">"Hallo,</hi> old fellow, what have you got in that box?"—I had a box of toys, with a strap round my neck—I went across the road to avoid them, but four of them followed me—one put his arm round my throat, and clasped it tight, and I fell on my knees, and lost my senses for a few minutes, and when I recovered I heard them rummaging my box—they loosened my throat to rummage my box, and I drew one of the sticks out of my box, and tried to hit them—they ran away, and I walked to the middle of the road, and said, "If any of you come here I will knock you down; you have robbed me of</p>

               <p>my few halfpence; you ought to be ashamed of yourselves"—they ran towards Barbican, and I followed, shouting "Police"—one of then came back, put his arm round my neck, and said, "I will silence you, you b—," or "I will quiet you"—that man was the prisoner—he went up to Barbi<lb></lb>can, and I followed him till the police took him—the other three got away—I did not lose sight of the prisoner at all, but cannot say that he is one of the men who took my money—I felt their hands in my pockets, but I kept two sixpence in my hand all the white they were assaulting me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 116) About twenty minutes to 2, on the morning of 22d, I saw Rochford, who described a person to me—I went with him up Golden-lane, and saw the prisoner with three others—the prosecutor said, "I will swear to the one with the white cap, he put his hand on my throat, and robbed me of my money; these four are the men"—I said, "I shall take them"—I took the prisoner, and the others ran up in the direction of Barbican—when I got hold of the prisoner he got his head under my arm, and his leg behind me, and tried to throw me down and get away—he said, "I won't go with you"—I searched him, and found fourpence in copper—he gave his mother's address, 11, George-yard, Golden-lane—that is about a hundred yards from where I took him in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where did the prosecutor come to me first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the end of Barbican, up Golden-lane; you were leaning Against a post, about twenty yards up—three men ran away—a man you called Peter came down to the station—they let him in; not in your presence—he was not standing with you when I came up—I did not see him speaking to you—you had nothing in your possession belonging to the prosecutor that I know of—that is the cap, but it had lime on it at the time; you have wished it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the night in question I was up at Fanner's, a place of amusement, and we walked round with my friends to Barbican, and the prosecutor came down and said, "I give this man in charge for robbing me." I said, "Where did I rob you?" He said, "Up the lane," I have got a witness here who will give the same account of it.</p>

And also, her Elbow was broken, and her Wrists, one Knee, and both her Ancles, were hurt. She had a Scratch upon her Thigh, two Inches and a half long, and a Contusion, like a Blow, on her Breast. Upon opening her he found her first five Ribs broke, and bent out wards towards the Thorax, and a Pint of Coagulated Blood in the Thorax. Her fourth Rib was broke in the vertebra of the Back, and the End had pressed the Pleura, and the Lungs. And being ask'd, How he thought this might be done he said it might be done by stamping upon, or some such Violence, but could not believe that it was by the Wheel of a Waggon, because, if it had run over her Stomach it would not have broken so many of her Ribs, and there would have been the Impression of the Wheel; and if a loaded Waggon, it must have broke her to Pieces almost, whereas there was no outward manifest Signs of any such Accident. And if a Waggon had run over her Breast length ways, it must also have broken the Collar Bone, which was whole, and in no part of the Body so much as the Scarf Skin broke. That if it had been done by the Stamping of an Horse on her Breast, where her Clothes were not, he was of Opinion, there would have been some sign of the Nails. And that her Pudenda were of a livid unnatural Colour.

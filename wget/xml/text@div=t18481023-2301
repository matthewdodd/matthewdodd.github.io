                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William Samuel Burton, of Ox<lb></lb>ford-street—the prisoner was a clerk in his employ. On Thursday, 21st Sept., the prisoner sent me to Dr. Manley's, in Great Ormond-street, for some money—I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—amongst it there were two sovereigns—I gave it to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier, in Mr. Burton's employ—when any money came into the prisoner's possession, it was his duty to give a check for the amount, and send the porter to pay it to me—I did not receive a check for this money on the night of 21st Sept—the prisoner has never paid me that sum.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. How long have you been cashier there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About fourteen months—the prisoner has got cash from me for his own purposes, cash belonging to the firm, when he has wanted it—not more than 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has always returned it—he has sometimes given me a memorandum, and at other times has had it without.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother to the prosecutor. In consequence of what Way said to me on Saturday, 23rd Sept., I asked the prisoner what he had done with the money that Way paid him on Thursday evening—he said he wanted money, he had appropriated it to his own use, and intended to return it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Do you mean to swear that those were the words he used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the substance of what he said—I do not know whether he used the word "appropriate"—he did not say that being rather pressed for money, and wanting to pay it, he had not paid it over, but he was going to do so with another check for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he had then received; nothing of the kind—he did not say he was going to pay it that morning—he was searched—he had been into the City, and had received a check at that time—it was a crossed check—he had just returned, and was wet, but I think he had been down stairs and changed his things—when be came up, he was given into custody—he was searched—I believe there was more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him—I have the book here, with these items in it—the prisoner had access to this book, it was entirely under his control—if he had done his duty he would have put "paid" against these items, and crossed them off—he ought to have given the porter, who brought him the money, a check, and sent it to the cashier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he had no right to have this money at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Way ought to have kept the money till he received a check from the prisoner, and taken the money to the cashier; but Way did not get the check from the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Was he given into your custody by Mr. Burton, for robbing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not say of what he had robbed him—in going along, the prisoner said it was a mere song—I believed that—I did not know what it was—I thought at first he had stolen a song—I thought Mr. Burton gave him in charge for stealing a song—I offered to pay for the song out of kindness to the man—I did not ascertain the value of the song before I offered to pay for it—I mean to swear that he said he had stolen 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remembered that when I was before the Magistrate.</p>

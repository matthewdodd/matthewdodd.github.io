We had five or six half Pints of Wine. She put one Hand under my Chin, and said, Come, my Dear, fill my Glass for me; and so I did, but putting my Hand in my Pocket soon after, I mist my Money, among which was a French Half Crown. I charged her with picking my Pocket, but she denied it. The Landlord came in; I told him I had been robb'd, but he only laugh'd at me. Then she offer'd me the French Half Crown to be easy, but I would not take it, and so she threw it upon the Table. At last, upon my making a Noise, a Constable came, and I desired him to search her, but the Landlord pushed her aside and would not let him. The Constable then said he must carry us both to the Counter. - I thought it was very hard to lose my Money and go to the Counter too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He laid the Half Crown under the Candlestick, and said I should have it if I would humour him in his Way so and so, which is very unheathenly to mention; whereof when I refused, he charged me with picking his Pocket. <rs id="t17351015-15-verdict61" type="verdictDescription">

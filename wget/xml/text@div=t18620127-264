                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 54, New-cut, Lambeth—on Tuesday, 7th January, the prisoner came, picked up the pieces of meat off the board, and tendered me a shilling—I detected it in a moment, and said it was had—he said that he knew where he took it, and wanted me to give it him back—I refused, and he left—I instantly followed him to Mr. Schraders, who lives two doors from me—I had seen him leave their shop previous to coming to mine—he passed into Mr. Schrader's with something in a paper; then he went to a public-house at the corner, and from there came to my shop—I made a communication to Mrs. Schrader, and afterwards gave Mr. Schrader the shilling, which had never been out of my sight.</p>

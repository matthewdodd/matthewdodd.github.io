                  </hi>. I am in the service of Harry Robert Sorrell. He is a hosier, and lives at No. 80 in the Strand, which is about sixty doors from Mr. Whitelock's—on the 11th of Nov. the prisoner came, and looked out goods to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she desired them to be sent to No. 31, Queen-street, Holborn—she said, "You know where Queen-street is, it is not far from here"—I said, "Yes"—she gave the name of Mrs. Parker—she desired me to send change for a 51. note about five o'clock, and the goods should be paid for—I had shown her some purses in a box, and amongst them was one brown beaded pune, with steel rings—I took the goods she ordered at the time appointed, and found no such person lived there—I went to Little Queen-street, Great Queen-street, and Queen-square, and could not find her—I did not see her again till the 29th of Nov., when I saw her in the shop of Mr. Palmer, to whom I had given information—she was searched at Bow-street—the officer showed me a brown beaded silk purse—it was the one I had in the box and had shown the pri<lb></lb>soner, and the one I had missed—I have no doubt in my own mind it wai that one—we had but one brown silk purse beaded, and there is a deficiency of that one from our stock—I have no doubt the purse the officer showed me was the one we lost.</p>

I got up again, and saw the other Prisoner, Robert Flood, who stood by, and bide Nichols beat me within an Inch of my Life. Nichols threw me down again: I got up a second time; and then he catch'd hold of my Hand, and pull'd my Ring off my Finger, threw me a third time, and tore my Turnover off. Several People were by this time got about us; but Flood bade them stand off, so that no body assisted me: However, I made shift to drag Nichols by the Collar to an Alehouse about 200 Yards off. We were follow'd in by Robert Flood, and I had them both secured.</p>

             thus deposed: Hearing a Noise in the Street, I went out and saw the Prosecutor holding Nichols by the Collar. Flood bade the Prosecutor let Nichols go; but the Prosecutor answer'd, No, - I won't, for he has robb'd me. Then Flood endeavour'd to rescue Nichols, and bade him beat the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners then made their Defence. We had been (says Nichols) at Supper at Mr. Adams's in Whitegate-Alley, and going home along the Minories, the Prosecutor stood up at a Cutler's Door, and struck at me. I ask'd him what he meant by it? and so we fell to fighting. I was a little fuddled, and can't say whether I took hold of his Hand or no. Several Witnesses appear'd to the Reputation of both the Prisoners, and the Jury <rs id="t17251013-4-verdict18" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I was on some of my barges that lay near the Old Barge-house: On Saturday the 18th, about eight o'clock in the evening, I observed two boats coming down the river, one light, the other loaded; they made towards some sailing-boats belonging to Mr. Doe, at the Old Barge-house; I went to my boat, and rowed directly to them; there were three persons in the light boat towing the loaded one; before I made the last pull to get into the loaded boat, I saw something like a great coat in it, it was very dark, I could not see whether it was a man or not; I stepped into the boat, and found it was not a man; I then stepped into the other boat, and laid hold of the prisoner, who was standing close by the side of the loaded boat, but in the sailing-boat; I said, I have got you, where are the others? they were then running over the boats towards the shore; he said, the boat does not belong to me, Mr. Rowen; I stepped into another boat, laying along-side of the boat the prisoner was in, for the purpose of pursuing the other men, but found it useless; and, on my return, the prisoner stepped into a light boat, and made for the Old Barge-house stairs; I called stop thief, but he got away; I have known him some time, and am sure he is the man; I examined the boat they were towing, and saw nine pigs of lead, which I delivered to Mr. Gotty, the Police officer; the name of Butcher was on the boat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was dark, was it not? - A. Yes; I could-hardly see the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up to the prisoner, you saw he was in a boat, but not either of the two first you saw? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where he was to be found? - A. Yes.</p>

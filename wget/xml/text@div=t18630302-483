                  </hi>. I carry on business at Bradford, in Yorkshire, as a manufacturer—I knew the prisoner from the 3d June, 1862—up to 29th August, I sold him goods to the amount of about 1, 328<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he was indebted to me at that time rather better than 1, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods were sent to, and I always knew him as living at, No. 6, Noble-street, City—about the middle of July I told the prisoner that he was not coming forward, according to promise, with his money—he said, "Well, I have a man along with me at the present time; I am very sorry for it, but I have no money for you; this man owes me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he is a very large shipper, a man of great means, but does not happen to have his remittances coming forward as they ought to do; his money has not come in according to his anticipation"—we were in a small room at the Bowling Green Hotel, at Bradford, and he called in a man named Newman, and said to him, "I have been telling Walton that you owe me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Newman said, "Yes, that is so, and as soon as I get it you shall have it"—with that understanding from Newman I sold the prisoner more goods, and continued to serve him with goods till the middle of August—he said the goods were for shipping—I afterwards got a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not give that up—I gave up a cheque to the prisoner for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was dishonoured—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was</p>

               <p>about 17th or 18th July, from London—the bills he sent me first were destroyed with the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, which was not paid; that was a cheque of his own, drawn by himself, I believe—it was a cheque of his own as far as I know—it was not drawn by a person named Dumont—it was dis<lb></lb>honoured and returned to me—the two bills which I received in July were towards the account; those two bills and this cheque happened to come back within a day or two of each other—he sent them within two months of each other—the bills were sent first; they were dishonoured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk and manager to Mr. Alcock, a packer, of 26, Old Change—on 30th August, I received eleven bales of blanket from the country; I do not know from whom—we receive goods from the carriers—they are consigned to us, and then we deliver them to any one who applies for them—it is a rule of the trade to deliver goods up without an order, because we know that no one knosubpœnaed what is coming up—we know our own customers—we should not let a stranger have them—we received the eleven bales about 30th August; I can't tell to a day—we delivered them to Mr. Pearson's order, which I have here—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "6, Noble-street Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am living at 12, King-street, Cornwall-road, Lambeth—in the summer of last year, I was in the service of Newman, at Fenchurch-street—I went there between May and June, and was there until he was taken into custody—I believe he was pressed for money at that time—people made applications for money at the office repeatedly—a sheriff's officer came amongst others—I remember on one occasion, when the sheriff's officer came when Newman was there, he got under the desk—I told the sheriff's officer that he was out; that was by his direction—he played hide-and-seek in that way on several occasions—I put off creditors in the best way I could—a great many goods came to the office from Mr. Pearson's, Noble-street—we used to have to go to Pearson's for them, and they were then sold to different persons—some were taken to Mr. Christy's, in Water-line, shipping agent—I did not receive any money from Mr. Christy—Mr. Newman was generally there to receive the money himself—I have seen Pearson at Newman's several times, two or three times a-week—he was not there at any time when there were applications for money—I never saw them go out together—Mr. Pearson used generally to come there in the middle of the day, and used to go out by himself generally.</p>

               <p>Pearson say to Newman, "If you will send me up the goods, I will get you the money"—I have heard them frequently angry with one another, high words sometimes—they used to send me out of the office—I think the last time I heard them having high words was in October—I believe after that Newman went down to Bradford and came back again—Pearson was at Newman's after that, late of an evening—I went away at 5—I cannot speak about the conversations—goods were fetched from Pearson's to New<lb></lb>man's after October.</p>

I am a woollen manufacturer, living at Dewbury, about nine miles from Bradford—in August, 1862, I became acquainted with the prisoner—he came with a man named Johnson the first time—I cannot speak accurately as to whether Newman was with him the first time or not—I did not see him many times—Johnson told me he was buying goods for Newman and Pearson—he came by himself first, before I saw Pearson or Newman—I had several conversations with Pearson about Newman—he spoke very highly of him as a respectable man—they were together several times—I supplied goods which were sent to Pearson—I got an acceptance from him—I did not afterwards see Pearson at Mr. Newman's solicitor's office—I don't know where Mr. Holmes' office is—Mr. Holmes wrote to me and we entered into an arrangement, which was not carried out—I never saw Mr. Holmes; it was through my solicitor—I received one of these letters by post, and the other was brought by Newman himself; they came from Pearson—I saw Pearson and Newman together, perhaps, two or three times at Desubpœnaedbury—I don't know exactly when I first came to London—(<hi rend="italic">A letter was here read from Pearson to Mr. Tolson, dated</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1862, 48, <hi rend="italic">Fenchurch-street, stating that he had spoken to Newman and reckoned upon coming to an arrangement, and that Newman was just the man to carry out Mr. Tolson's ideas; that he would come down to Desubpœnaedbury on the monday night if it would suit him. Another letter was ready, dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1862, 6, <hi rend="italic">Noble-street, Foster-lane, Cheapside, from Pearson to Tolson, stating that if Newman looked out any goods suitable for any of his markets, he would allow Mr. Tolson to invoice them to him, and that he had every confidence us Mr. Newman, from what he knew of him and his family connexions.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Bills read</hi>: "London, July 10th, 1862.

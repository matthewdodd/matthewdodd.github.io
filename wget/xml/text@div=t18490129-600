                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper and milkman of Wandsworth-road. Champion was in my service about two months—it was part of his duty to carry out milk—he carried out seventeen quarts on Friday, 12th Jan.—he measured it out in my presence—I directed Hodges to follow him—he came back to me before Champion did, and from what he laid I after<lb></lb>wards asked Champion to give an account of what he had done with the milk—I did not then know anything about what had been made over to Burrows—I have been given to understand that Burrows is a cow-keeper and milk<lb></lb>man—I had forbidden Champion to serve any dealers with milk—on that day there were nine quarts of milk deficient—Champion did not say anything about having let Burrows have any—it was his duty to give the names of the</p>

                  </hi>. On 12th Jan. I followed Champion—I saw him serve milk to several customers—he came to the Priory Arms, in Priory-road, and went into the house—Burrows came in his cart about ten minutes afterwards, and he went in—there were four or five other milkmen there—Champion and Burrows came out together, they put their cans into Burrows' cart, and rode to the Stag public-house—Burrows went in there, and came out and put his can down outside; Champion put his can down by the side of it—he then opened the lids of both cans, and put nine half-pint measures of milk out of his own can into Burrows' can—Burrows stood at the door, he saw the first three or four pots put in; I do not think he saw all—I then saw Champion and Burrows drinking in the public-house—they came out, and Burrows took up the can that the milk had been put into, and Champion took away the other—on that evening I went with the prosecutor's brother to Burrows' house—the brother said, "My name is Reeves, from Wandsworth-road; I want to know how much milk you took from my brother's man this morning"—he said, "I took a pot" (that is two quarts) "I was to give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, but had not change for half-a-crown"—he said, "Were there any of your customers he served"—he said, "Yes, Dr. Hare a pennyworth; that makes 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I owe him; I shall pay him to-morrow morning"—he said, "I had a pot of him last week; I shall pay him for that"—the other said, "My brother has given him in charge; he has not accounted for his milk"—Burrows said, "Well, if he has not accounted for his milk, it is very proper that he should be punished; any information that I can give I shall with pleasure"—I heard him say the next day that this man had borrowed some milk of him, and he was paying him back again.</p>

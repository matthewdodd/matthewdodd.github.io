I left nobody with the cart, it stood against the end of the court; when I came back to the cart the box was gone; Maynard was gone to look after somebody. In about a minute I saw Maynard returning with the prisoner in custody; we took the prisoner home to the yard; he begged to go home to his mother.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Brown and Wallington. I went from the inn yard with the cart; the cart left me in Cheapside, I delivered two parcels there. In going down Milk I observed the prisoner get upon the near wheel of the cart, I saw him take the box out and get down again and walk towards Cheapside; I met him; he put the box under his coat; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said nothing; he threw the box in the cart and ran down Milk street.</p>
               <p>COURT. I thought he had left the cart when you saw him - A. He was about ten yards from the cart when I first met him; when I spoke to him he turned round towards the cart and threw the box in immediately and ran towards Aldermanbury; I pursued him and catched him in Aldermanbury, by the Baptist's Head; he desired us to take him to his father and mother. I delivered him to Mr. Frost the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you see the box that he had throwed into the cart - A. Yes; it was the box that I had seen before to be delivered in Houndsditch; I am sure of the person of the boy; I never lost sight of him; I was nearly within an arm's length of him all the way.</p>

No; he told me his father lived in Black Eagle street; I went there; I could not find him; the next day he said his mother was dead; he still persisted his father lived there. I searched him at the inn; I found a knife, a penny, and a letter; the letter he said he picked up in the street.</p>

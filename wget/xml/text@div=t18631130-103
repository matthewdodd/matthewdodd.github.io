               <p>on 13th October, the prisoner came for two penny pies, and tendered a half-crown—I told her it was bad, and I thought she had something to do with a bad half-crown I had taken the night previous—she said that a man gave it her outside—I said I should lock her up—she begged my wife not to allow me to do so, as she was a respectable woman and had a family; but when she found I was determined to do so, she began using bad language.</p>

I said they were to be sent to 116, Cornwall-road, and went home and said so. The husband said, "This is King-street, Cornwall-road," and I went back and said so. I paid with the five-shilling piece they gave me.</p>

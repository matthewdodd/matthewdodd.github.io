On the 4th of June about twelve o'clock, the two prisoners came from Mr. Bowyer, plumber, Shoe Lane, to take away some old lead, the whole parcel of lead was between four and five hundred weight, they put it in parcels to take it away, I shewed them the lead. They had a truck at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were they to take it away, were Messrs. Leech and Dallimore to be allowed for it. - A. Yes, I gave it to them for that purpose only. When the first piece, which was about ninety pound was missed, we stopped the other lead from going. The prisoners were only permitted to take the lead to be conveyed to Mr. Bowyer's in Shoe Lane, Mr. Bowyer was to account to Messrs. Leech and Dallimore for it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 4th of June I was standing in Ludgate Street about four yards from Messrs. Leech's and Dallimore's, I saw the prisoners bring the truck to the door, the truck was outside of the coffee-house, they both assisted in putting the lead upon the truck, they went the second time to fetch some more. When they put the second parcel on Leverett went round to the front of the truck and Wright behind, Leverett leaned his right shoulder towards the truck and Wright put the lead upon him, then Wright went into the coffee-house and Leverett went away with the lead on his shoulder and left the truck there. Leverett went on to the top of the Old Bailey and turned the right hand of Newgate Street, I followed him all the way, after he had got into Warwick Lane about an hundred yards I stopped him, I told him that he had taken the lead from Mr. Leech's out of the truck, that he should take it back, he said very well, I asked him where he meaned to take it, he said he was going to take it to his master's in Shoe Lane, I told him that was the wrong way to Shoe Lane, he must take it back again. The lead weighs exactly ninety four pounds. I brought him back and took him before Mr. Dallimore, he ordered me to take him before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Wright into custody. - A. I did, Wright said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Do you happen to know where Wright's wife lodged. - A. In Warwick Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Leverett tell you that Wright desired him to call on his wife in his way home. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the lead worth. - A. I should suppose twenty shillings. This is the lead.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 4th of March, I lost two pigs - a person could easily climb over a gate and get them; one of them had two brown spots down the face, on the forehead - they reached to the eye; that was a barrow pig. The prisoner was a stranger to me - I have not seen them since.</p>

            . I live in Prince's-street, Barbican, and am an officer. On the 5th of March I met the prisoner with a bag tied to his back like a knapsack - another person was with him. I stopped him, and asked him what he had got in the bag? he said they were rabbits, but I found they were two dead pigs; they were sold by the order of the Alderman, as we could find no owner - one was a brown pig, and that was marked; the heads of the pigs appeared to have been broken with a hammer, and the prisoner had a hammer - they appeared warm; they had been stuck also. I found a bloody knife on him.</p>

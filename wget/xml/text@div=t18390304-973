On the 13th of February I was in the Strand, and felt a tug at my pocket—I felt, and my handkerchief was gone—I turned, and caught the prisoner with it in his hand—I took hold of him—he threw the handkerchief down, cried, and begged of me to let him go, and he would never do so any more—I kept him till the officer took him—this is my handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)</p>

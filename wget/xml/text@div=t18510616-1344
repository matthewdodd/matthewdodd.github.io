                  </hi>. I live at 7, Mill-yard, Whitechapel, which is a brothel. On Monday, 26th May, about 12 o'clock at night, the prisoner came there with a woman, and went to a room on the second-floor—after they had been there a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner coming down again—the woman I live with was in the middle room; I saw her come sliding down-stairs—I got between the prisoner, who was at the bottom of the stairs, and the street-door (the stairs come into the lower room)—I found I had a knife put into my right side, without my saying a word—after I felt it, I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand, and I called out that he had a knife in his hand, and that I was stabbed—I got out at the street-door, held it by the knocker, and called "Police!"—the prisoner pulled the door off its hinges, and ran away—I followed him, calling, "Police!" and Button, who was in my house, followed also—after following him about 100 yards, Astbury stopped him—I said he bad stabbed me, and Astbury said to the prisoner, "Have you a knife?"—he laid he had not one, and that he had not stabbed any one—he spoke good English—I afterwards heard a knife drop, which Astbury picked up—I was taken to the London Hospital, and remained there a week, and I feel the effects of the wound now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor. I was lodging at 7, Mill-yard—on the last Monday in May I saw the prisoner there, about 12 o'clock at night, coming down-stairs from the top room with a young woman—I never saw either of them before—I saw the woman who keeps the house, in the middle room; and as the prisoner came down, she asked him if he was going to pay for the use of the room; he said, "No; I have got plenty of money, but I shan't give you any"—he then went down-stairs; the landlady followed him, said, "You had better pay me for the use of the place!" and he laid hold of her, and pushed her half-way down-stairs—that was upon the first-floor—Farrell then came out of the lower room, and asked the prisoner what he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> his wife down-stairs for—saw the prisoner put his hand to his pocket, and take out something, I cannot say what—Farrell <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to me, <hi rend="italic">"Fred,</hi> he has got a knife, I am stabbed!"—Farrell went outside the door, and <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out "Police!"—the prisoner then laid hold of the door by the bottom, lifted it right off the hinges, and ran away—before he went out, he tried to stab the prosecutor's wife—I went up, and knocked his hand on one side, he dropped something, <hi rend="italic">grappled</hi> it up again, and ran out directly—I saw something glitter in his hand—I and Farrell followed him; and when we came up, the policeman had him in charge; Farrell was bleeding, and was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the station.</p>

On Friday, 14th Feb., about a quarter past 9 o'clock, I was serving at the bar—the prisoner came and asked me for a quartern of gin; I served her; she paid me with a shilling—while I was giving her change, she showed me a small brass piece, and told me she had picked it up, and thought it was half a sovereign—I gave her change for the shilling, and she left—I directly gave the same shilling-in change for half a crown, and it was returned to me as bad; I gave it to my mother—the prisoner came again about 2 o'clock, and asked for half a quartern of gin; I told my mother she was the same person—I took the shilling; it was bent—we sent for a policeman, and gave it to him with the other.</p>

            . I live in Boar's Head-yard, Petticoat-lane. On the 20th of November, about nine o'clock, in consequence of a conversation with Lee and Foster, I went to the Flying Horse public-house, Lambeth-street; Foster searched me in Lee's presence - I had no money - Foster then gave me two half-crowns, and one shilling to stand something to drink - I had seen the prisoners before - they lived in Cobb's-yard, Petticoat-lane. I went there directly with Miles - I found the prisoners and a little boy there at tea - they sent the boy out of the way, and both prisoners said that I should be cocked for passing bad money - they said some person had been to Lambeth-street about it, and laid information against me, and I should get six months if I was found out - I said there was no fear of that, they could not find me out - they asked if I wanted any more - I said, "Yes, a score of shillings." I gave the two half-crowns to Cummings - he gave them to Fuller, who left the room for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; while she was gone, Cummings was talking to Miles; when Fuller came back she gave me this paper, containing twenty counterfeit shillings - I put them into my pocket - we had two pots of beer, which I paid for with the shilling - they had asked me, on the 17th of November, to stand some beer - I said I had no money, but would the next time. I then went straight to Lambeth-street, and saw Foster and Lee - Foster took the shillings from me, marked every one of them, and handed them to Lee in my presence. On the 27th I saw Cummings at the Coach and Horses public-house at night - he said I had given information of him - I denied it - I went to Lambeth-street, and left word for the officers to come - they came about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock; I went with them to Cobb's-yard and found Cummings - I entered into conversation with him - Fuller came in, touched me on the shoulder, and told me to get out of the house, for I had brought the Lambeth-street traps down - the officers then came in, and took them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 20th of November, I saw Newton at the Flying-horse, Lambeth-street - Foster (who is since dead) was there; he searched Newton, and gave him two half-crowns and a shilling - Newton brought me twenty counterfeit shillings in a paper, in about an hour; Foster marked them in my presence; here they are. In consequence of information, on the 27th of December, I went to the prisoners' house, and apprehended Cummings, who was just coming out of the room; Fortune was with me - Cummings said, "I know all this is Ben Miles' doings." On the following day I went into the lock-up-room - he said, "I shall only get a twelvemonth for it;" I had followed the witnesses from the Flying-horse to the prisoner's house, and saw them go in.</p>

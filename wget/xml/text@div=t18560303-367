                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live at No. 3, Ship-alley, Wellclose<lb></lb>square. On 23rd Feb. I was walking in Ship-alley, about half-past 12 o'clock in the morning—I had four half crowns and a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, which I was putting into my pocket—I had taken it from one pocket, and was putting it into another pocket—while so doing I saw the prisoner in com<lb></lb>pany with three low women—I had no sooner passed them than I received a violent blow on my back—the prisoner put his leg out, and I fell—the prisoner struck me several times—with his fist while I was down, and kicked me violently on the chin and under the jaw, and the women also—the women exclaimed two or three times, "Have it from him or choke the b—"—the prisoner took my hand, which was still in my pocket, and had the four half crowns in it—he took the money, and put my thumb into his mouth, and bit it severely to the bone—it is not now recovered—the prisoner then made a way to get up—I laid hold of him by the leg, and he kicked me again violently in the chest—he took my money out of my hand at the time he bit me—he ran away, and I ran after him—I caught hold of him by his coat in Wellclose-square—he turned round, and gave me a severe kick, and struck me two blows in the face—he ran on—I was after him—he ran into Well-street—before I got into Well-street I called out, "Stop thief!"—when I got into Well-street, I saw a con<lb></lb>stable, and said, "Stop that thief! that man has robbed me of four half crowns, and used me violently"—I never lost sight of him for one moment—I was perfectly sober—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to change the half sovereign? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> While I was taking my ale in this public house, a woman came in, and she required a half sovereign for four half-crowns, and I gave it her—she appeared to be a respectable servant maid—she came in without a bonnet, so I complied with her request—I did not tell my wife about that—I did not mention it—my wife did not ask me how it came to pass that I lost the half crown instead of the half sovereign—she did not ask me till afterwards—I had never before come home, and told my wife that I had been robbed of any money—the money was given me to pay this person at Limehouse—I could not leave the money for him, because there was nobody at home—the house was shut up—I could not make any one hear—on my oath I went to that house—I had to pay that money which I owed—it had been lent to me—I am living on my property—the man's name is Mr. Jeremy—I owed him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he lent it six or seven weeks ago—I gave him no I O U for it—I went to him at that time of night because I could not conveniently go earlier.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had no business, why did you not go with her? the answer, "I had other business," is the same as saying, "I won't tell you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The reason I did not accompany my wife was, I had to go as far as the Borough after a situation—I wanted to see a person concerned in it—I had gone about 7 o'clock—I then came home, and went to this other place.</p>

               <p>—there is no one here who saw it—not the young lady that I gave the change to—I have never sold anything in the street, nor at Whitechapel toll bar—I know Whitechapel toll bar—I lived as a chemist, in St. George's in the East, seven years ago—I have never done anything the last two years—I am very seldom out in the evening—my thumb was bitten to the bone, and I was so much injured about the chest that I felt it for two or three days afterwards—I never wore a wig—I am not a counsel—I never wore a barrister's wig and gown near Whitechapel toll bar—I am a respectable man—I never have worn a wig and gown—I would swear it on a dozen oaths, if it were required—my wife is a shoe binder.</p>

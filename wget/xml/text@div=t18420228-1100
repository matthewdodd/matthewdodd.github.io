On Sunday week I heard a quarrelling on the deck of the vessel soon after eight o'clock—I went up on deck, and met the cook, who showed me his arm, and said, "I am stabbed by Oscar"—the prisoner was standings is the fore part of the vessel with a knife in his hand—I asked him how he could do so—he did not answer—I took the cook to the Hospital-ship after winding a towel round his arm—I took the knife out of the prisoner's hand, and gave it to the doctor at the Hospital-ship.</p>

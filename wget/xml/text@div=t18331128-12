             (policeman). On the 29th of October, I went to the prosecutor's house, about five o'clock in the morning; I went to the slaughter-house, and saw a piece of beef on the block under the loft; it was dirty, and appeared to have been carried; there were marks of soot on it; I then got up into the loft, and saw saw-dust strewed about the loft - I looked out of the loft window, and saw saw-dust and foot-marks on the tiles; I then told Avery of it - and we went and entered at the first street door, which is a sweep's; I saw the prisoner Charles Moore, lying on the first floor; I did not notice whether he was asleep or awake, he was the only person in that room; I found the door open - I found nothing there; I then went up stairs to a room over that Charles Moore was in, and there Avery went through a partition where the lath and plaster were broken down; it divided the room from a room in the next house; he there found a bundle - I saw him pick it up; I then returned down stairs, and Avery came down with another bundle afterwards; I came through the room Charles Moore was in, and came down stairs to the ground floor, and I saw

             and his family down stairs, all except Charles Moore; we then took the three prisoners into custody, and a little boy, who has been discharged; I and my brother officer, went back again and went up stairs, and saw a large hole through the ceiling and through the tiles of the top room, which was one story above where Charles Moore was; the tiles appeared to have been taken off, and put in between the ceiling and the tiling, so that anybody might get out of the hole and into the slaughter-house, by going along the tiling and down to the loft window over the slaughter-house; there was no other way by which the loft could be entered; the door of the next house was strongly nailed up; it is beyond the prisoner's house - the prisoner's house is next to the slaughter-house; there was no back door to the prisoner's house that I could see; I saw a hole covered with a piece of wood, in a cupboard on the second floor or the attic; I am not sure which; it was about six inches wide, and had a piece of string at one end; when that wood was taken out of the hole, I could see into the slaughter-house through the hole; I saw saw-dust on the top of the tiles, and traced foot-marks and saw-dust from the slaughter-house loft window, along the top of the tiles for about four yards, and there was saw-dust all over the gutter - I could not see whether it was the foot-marks of one or more persons.</p>
               <p>Charles Moore. Q. When you pulled the door down, did I not shew you where the people had got in? A. You did not; I broke the door down; nobody could have got in there - there was a small place over the door, but it was impossible anybody could get through it.</p>

             (police-constable). On the morning of the 29th of October, I went into the loft and saw some saw-dust spread about, and in the roof of the house was a trap-door; I looked through that, and saw the tracks of saw-dust on the parapet; I got out and traced the footsteps along the leaden gutter, to the roof of Moore's house, which was covered with tiles; I discovered, I suppose, about twenty tiles removed and placed inside the roof of Moore's house, they were under the roof inside; I returned to the slaughter-house, and saw a piece of beef on the block with several marks of soot on it, as if it had been rubbed against a person; I placed an officer at the outside door - and took Hudson to the first floor of Moore's house, and I went right up stairs, as the door where Edward Moore was sleeping, was fast; I saw Charles Moore sleeping on some straw in the first floor as I passed; I left my brother officer there with directions to allow nobody to go out, while I went to the second floor, which is next to the roof - and after searching for some time, about ten yards from where the hole was made through the roof, I found a smock-frock containing the fat, two other smock-frocks, a cloth, and an apron; a little distance from that, I found an apron containing necks and breasts of mutton; these were all in the room over the room Charles Moore was sleeping; I then went down, and Charles Moore was below in Edward's room; the three prisoners were together in that room; we took them into custody, and took them to the station-house; after locking them up, we went back, and I discovered in a recess in the room where Charles Moore was sleeping, this trap-door hanging by a string; it is a peep-hole made through the partition between their house and the prosecutor's slaughter-house; the wood hung by a string, and worked on a nail as a pivot, and by lifting it up, they could have a full view of the proceedings in Ware's slaughter-house.</p>

               <p>Edward Moore. Q. Was not I in bed when you came? A. Yes; and you said you were innocent of it. Q. Did not I tell you I was a sweep by trade, and had been upwards of thirty miles beyond Waltham Abbey? A. I believe you did say so - I was not there at the first search - they had no furniture in the room they were sleeping in - I know the whole family are sweeps.</p>

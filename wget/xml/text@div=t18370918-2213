                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in York-square, Regent's Park. The prisoner was in my service—on the 12th of August I missed quantity of things, and she left me without notice—there was a satin dress which is mine, a veil, some shirts belonging to my children, a blanket and other things—the blanket belonged to her bed—I found her after wards in Franklyn's-row, Chelsea, and charged her with taking my property—I have since seen the veil and petticoat—she laughed at me when I charged her with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It is a house of ill-fame—the property does not belong to her—she made me a present of the petticoat and a pair of stay—the night before I left her she was drunk, and told me as soon as possible to leave her—I wanted to leave her that night—she said, "No; go to bed and leave in the morning;" and in the morning she was so drunk when I told her I was going that she could make no answer. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I keeps lodging-house, but she exaggerates very much—I only keep a lodging house for two females—they have no visitors—I believe they change their acquaintances, but not daily—very seldom, I believe—the satin dress I was myself—it is mine—I was never intoxicated in my life.</p>

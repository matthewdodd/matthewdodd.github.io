                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father—we are booksellers and stationers—the prisoner was our binder's apprentice, and for the convenience of business, he lived in our second house, No. 36—in consequence of suspicion, on the night of the 15th I watched, and about half-past five, on the morning of the 16th, I heard a door, which leads into the lobby of the shop, open—he moved various things on the counter, lifted them up, and put them down again in the same place, as near as I could see, till he came up to where I was, he then saw me, and started back very much frightened—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "Oh my!"—I went with a policeman to his mother's house, and found a purse, pencil-case, some books, and all these thing produced—they are my father's and mine, I had missed them—I missed this pencil-case from a card which had five others on it, about a month before, on taking stock—I know these three books, and other things, which were found in his box, at the binders, they belong to my father and myself—this is the key of the till—this bunch of keys belongs to the premises—they open everything on the premises—I had had a new lock put on the till, as I suspected another lad who was taken up, and the next night the new key was missing.</p>

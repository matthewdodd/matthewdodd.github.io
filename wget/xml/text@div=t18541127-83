                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Stratford. In the beginning of Oct. the prisoners took a room in my house; I had an oak chest in the back room upstairs, and the prisoners occupied the front room—the chest was locked, but not the room—in the chest I had a gown, some petticoats, and other articles—on Thursday, 10th Nov., they left the house; the female prisoner came down and asked me if I wanted any shop things, as she was going shopping—I told her I wanted a few things, and gave her a shilling—she never returned—next morning I, went to the chest for a pair of stock<lb></lb>ings, and there was only one pair left out of three; I also missed two under petticoats, one white petticoat, a gown, and a pair of silver spectacles—the chest was broken open; the hinges were taken off—out of the prisoners' room I missed two pillow cases, some china cups, a bolster, a blanket, a pillow, two sheets, and the feathers out of the bed, which I found cut open—I had a lodger named Henry Johnson, but he was absent—my husband is not alive.</p>

When the prisoners left I missed a coat, which bung on a nail behind the door of the room they occupied—it bad been hanging there some time—I could not wear it, because the weather was too cold; it was too light for me; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not give it to the prisoners.</p>

From information I received, I went after the prisoners, and found them inmates of the City of London Union on 13th Nov.—I told the male prisoner I should apprehend him on a charge of robbing Mrs. Johnson, at Stratford—he said he had lived there, but he had not robbed her of anything—the porter brought me the clothes he had on when he went to the Union, and I found this coat—he said that a lodger named Johnson had given it to him—I took him into custody, but did not take the female prisoner, as she was in the sick ward.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Philip Maidment's Defence.</hi> About three weeks before I left, I came home with a dirty jacket; I washed it, and on Sunday morning went down below where the prosecutrix and Johnson was; Johnson said, "Have not you got a coat?" I said, "No, I have washed it;" he said to Mrs. Johnson, "Go and give him that old coat to put on" I wore it for a day or two, it was very greasy; I asked him what I should give him for it; he said, "The old rag is worth nothing, you can do as you like with it;" I got my wife to mend it, and I wore it for three weeks in his presence; about a fortnight after I had worn it, I went into his bedroom when he was in bed, and said, "I have got a few halfpence in my pocket; what shall I give you for it?" he said, "I am in too much pain now to talk about it;" it is only done to get his expenses; he never pays any rent; would sot he have said, "You have got my coat on," but he never said a single word; any gentle-man who looks at it will say that it is not worth 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

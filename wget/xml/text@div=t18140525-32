I immediately charged him with having picked my pocket; he asked me what I meaned, and said, he had not. I then said, your accomplice has; meaning the prisoner Wells. I had seen them together before, when they passed and repassed me. I searched Williams first. While I was searching Williams, the patrol came up. When I said to Williams, if it is not you it is your accomplice; the patrol laid hold of Wells. As Wells turned, I observed a handkerchief hanging out of his pocket; I could not observe whether it was mine or not; it was a silk pocket handkerchief. At that time three or four persons came up, and somebody picked up a handkerchief, and said, is this your handkerchief; I took it in my hand, and said, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him pick it up - A. No, I did not. We took him to the watchhouse. I cannot say the handkerchief that was picked up was the handkerchief that I saw hang out of Wells pocket. The handkerchief that was recovered was mine.</p>

            . I am one of the patrols of St. Giles's. On the 28th, I was coming up Holborn; the prosecutor was charging the prisoner Williams with picking his pocket; he denied it. The prosecutor searched him, and he said the prisoner Wells was with him, and if it was not him, it was one of the two; by which means I laid hold of both of them. I perceived Wells throw something away; a bye stander picked up a handkerchief, and said sir, is this yours; the prosecutor said it was his handkerchief. I took them both to the watchhouse. The prosecutor delivered the handkerchief to me; I gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250021"></xptr>it to the constable.

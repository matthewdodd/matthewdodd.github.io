I wish there was an officer here, I would have you both punished"—the deceased had a stick with him—he lifted it up to Coving<lb></lb>ton's head—he did not strike her—he was prevented striking her, by Long, who rushed round on the other side, and bit him a blow in the face, in about the same place as Covington had struck him—the deceased then turned back again, to go down the street—the prisoners both followed, abusing him, with their tongues, not with blows—I did not see Covington do any thing then—I saw the deceased up against the corner of the house—he was taken into Mrs. Harvey's—I saw them both <hi rend="italic">pegging</hi> at him, but I could not see which it was, one from the other; and I saw his hat knocked off—I saw Long take up her apron, or something, to wipe the blood off his face—I then saw him taken into Mrs. Harvey's house—I did not see any thing more after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and live in Rateliffe-highway. I was called to a house in Bluegate-fields, on the 25th of June, a little after seven o'clock—I saw the deceased there lying on the floor on his back, supported by two policemen—he was quite dead—he had a severe bruise over the right eye and temple—blood was oozing from his nostrils, and his face was very livid—he had all the appearance of a person having died of apoplexy—the livid appearance of the face led me to suppose so—the livid appearance proceeded from disorder—I afterwards examined his body externally at the workhouse—the scrotum was very much discoloured—there was a small wound on his right side covered with a piece of plaster—it was an old wound—there was a recent bruise at the back part of his head—on the following morning I made an examination of his head in company with another medical man—on removing the scalp a vast quantity of extra<lb></lb>vasated blood escaped, more particularly from the parts which had received the injury externally—I removed the scull cap, and there was an immense escape of blood on the brain, a pint at least—I never inspected a head where there was so great an effusion—the nose was broken—the cause of death was the effusion of blood on the brain—that would be produced by blows on the head and face—violent blows on the head and face would bring on apoplexy in a person who had a tendency to it—there was disco<lb></lb>loration of the scrotum—that was quite recent—that could have nothing to do with the effusion of blood on the head—his brain showed a predisposi<lb></lb>tion to apoplexy—he did not die of apoplexy, but of effusion of blood on the brain—the appearances of apoplexy are very different to those appear<lb></lb>ances, you have not so much extravasation, and death is more sudden generally—knocking his head against the wall created perhaps the com<lb></lb>mencement of the mischief, and the blood was oozing all the way probably till he got to Mrs. Harvey's, and when put on the chair he dropped down dead—the effusion of blood was the result of violence—the vessels were so gorged with blood they gave way—it was not from natural apoplexy, but from external violence that he died—I think so from the appearance of the brain on opening the head, the immense effusion—the effusion in apoplexy is not so great by a twentieth part—it varies—it depends on the nature of the vessel ruptured—there was no fracture of the skull, nor any injury to it—Mr. Pretty inspected the deceased with me.</p>

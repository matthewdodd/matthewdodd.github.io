On the night of the 1st Sep<lb></lb>tember I was on duty in Brummeirs Buildings, High Street, Clapham, and in consequence of a communication made to me I went into the High Street—I saw the four prisoners there, with a lot more—it was a quarter-past eleven—they were singing and making a noise—Reasy, another police constable, was there—I told them we wanted them to go away quietly, and not have any disturbance at that time of night—we followed them down the street; Taylor said something I could not understand—when we got to Nelson's Row they all stopped; I again said, "I want you to go away quietly"—Gear turned round and said, "What the b----h—is the matter?"—Reasy then took a man into custody, and I went into the road to assist in taking him to the station; as soon as I had got to the prisoner Till rushed upon me and knocked me down with his fist—Gear and Taylor then rushed upon me, and I was up and down five or six times; I drew my truncheon, and we had a tussle—an omnibus came up from London, and several gentlemen came to our assistance—the prisoners all went towards White's Square—Reasy still had the man in custody, and we were taking him towards the station; we had got about 200 yards, and when near Manor Street I turned round and saw fifteen or twenty people coming after us, and among them were the prisoners—some of them were picking up stones—Gear was in his shirt-sleeves—I went to Taylor and said, "Soldier, you are a man different from the rest, you ought to assist us, and not act in the way you are doing"—at that time some one knocked my helmet off—I turned round and Taylor said, "Yes, you b—, I will;" and he struck me on the side of the head with the buckle end of his belt—that staggered me—I stepped back to avoid another blow, and slipped down on the pavement—when on my back Taylor, Gear, and Till rushed upon me—Taylor said, "Kill the b----now he is down"—I was turned over on my belly, and I became insensible—I received several kicks on my back—Taylor had the belt twisted round his hand, it was about three feet long—I distinctly saw it in bis hand—when I recovered from my insensi<lb></lb>bility I was at the station; Mr. Parrott, the surgeon, was sent for—I have known Till and Martin for years—the whole affair lasted about a quarter of an hour—I had an opportunity of seeing Taylor as this occurred under a lamp—there was only one soldier there, and he had a cap on when in the High Street, but in Manor Street he had no cap.</p>

On Sunday night, the 1st Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was on duty in Clapham—I saw Taylor, Gear, and John Martin standing on the pavement, using very abusive language—they went towards the Plough, where they commenced hallooing, shouting, and singing—I cautioned them not to make such a noise at that hour of the night—Gear and Taylor said they should do as they liked for all me, they were not insulting any one, and they should not make any difference for me—they again commenced shouting, singing, and using very abusive language—I again cautioned them not to make such a noise, and if they continued I must certainly take one or two into custody; the sailor (Gear) turned round and said, "Put your hand on me; touch me if you dare, and I will soon let you know who you are putting your hand on"—as there was not another constable near then, I did not interfere with them—they went to the top of Park Road, where they stopped several minutes, using very abusive language, loud enough to disturb the people in the street—they then went on towards White's Square, where I saw Stone on the other side of the street—I called him and then I took one man into custody—we went about twenty yards to opposite Nelson's Row, where three of the prisoners were standing; the man I had in custody called out, "Come and help me"—Taylor and Gear came at me—a man with a white slop crossed the road and struck Stone, and they fell together in the road—I cannot say whether that man is here—I was struggling with the man I had in custody—at that time an omnibus came up and several passengers came to our assistance—I was going to the station, and had got about 200 yards down the Manor Road, nearly opposite the Manor Arms, where from fifteen to twenty men came after us—Gear, Taylor, and Martin were there—I can positively swear to them—I heard Stone say to Taylor, "Soldier, you are a different man from any of the rest, you ought to assist us rather than fight against us"—Taylor made use of a very foul expression, and said, "Yes, I will"—he had something in his hand which appeared to me like a belt, with which he struck Stone over the head, and staggered him—Martin was near me with his arm up, and appeared to be throwing stones—some one seized me by the hair of my head, dragged me from one side of the road to the other, struck me violently in my face several times, and I received a kick which rendered me quite insensible, and my prisoner escaped—Martin I have known three or four years, and Taylor I saw iu Brummets Passage on Sunday morning, between four and five, with a female—I haw seen him several times—I had seen Gear several times—I did not see any other soldier there but Taylor.</p>

I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—I was called to the station-house on the night of the 1st September—I found Reasy and Stone there, very much injured—I ex<lb></lb>amined Stone first; he had a very severe incised wound on the back of the head, from which had been excessive bleeding; he was also bruised about the face, and complained of some pain in the arm—the wound at the back of the head might have been inflicted with a buckle attached to a strap—the blow must have been given with great violence—he has been about three weeks under my care, but is now tolerably convalescent—I examined Reasy, and found on the right side of the head a contused wound of the scalp; the right eye was completely closed, and the eyelid incised transversely—those wounds were not so serious as Stone's—he is not yet strong enough to resume duty.</p>

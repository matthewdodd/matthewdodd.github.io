                  </hi>. I reside in Back Church-lane, Whitechapel. On 11th August, I went into Petticoat-lane to sell a bag of clothes—I was not able to sell them—I then went into a public-house in Houndsditch to get some<lb></lb>thing—I had not seen the prisoner then, but he came in with two others—they talked about knocking up a game of skittles; and they said to me, "Coun<lb></lb>tryman, you may as well go and see it fair"—they took me to another public-house—I went into the skittle-ground attached to it, with my bag of clothes with me—there were one or two games played—I am not able to say how much I drank, but it was not much—we had three pints, perhaps I might have had a pint—I afterwards felt quite stupid, I don't know that it was the drink made me so—I missed my clothes, and inquired about them—I could not find them—I walked away to go home, and the prisoner came behind me, put his arm round me, and took from my waistcoat pocket a silver watch—I had a coat on then, not a smock—my watch had a metal guard, which went round my neck—he broke the chain when he took the watch—I did not see him again till he was in custody—the value of the clothes was about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the watch 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am confident the prisoner was one of the persons, and he was the one who took my watch—I never saw him again till about a fortnight afterwards—I then saw him in Bishopsgate Station—he was alone—the officer was with him—I am sure he is the person.</p>

From information I received, I went in search of the prisoner—the prosecutor described him to me on the day after the robbery; and I found the prisoner on 25th August—I had been looking for him during that fortnight—When he saw me, he turned round and ran away into the Catharine-wheel public house—I followed him, and took him. I told him the charge, and he said "Not me"—I found on him some thimbles and some peas.</p>

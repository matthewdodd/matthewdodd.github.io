On Sunday, the 30th of March, at five o'clock, I was sent for, and found my shop broken open, the skylight was forced up. I missed about two pounds of sugar, and a prayer-book. I had left them safe the day before; we do not open on Sunday. I found my umbrella on the tiles. I saw the prayer-book the next day; the two blank leaves had been cut out of it, but I know it to be mine.</p>

            . At five o'clock on Sunday, the prisoner and Michael Alley climbed up to the top of the place-the prisoner had a pair of pinchers, and a chisel - They wanted me to get up, but I would not. I did not see where they went. I was asked if I had seen any boys about, and I told of it - I have told the truth. I was going to get some beer, and the prisoner shewed me some sugar and the prayer-book; he said he had just come from chapel. I asked him where he had got the book-he said from the Coffee-shop, in Newgate-market. He said he had also got a bad 3s. token and two old halfpence, and that he could get a leg of beef and an umbrella. - Alley is six years old.</p>

In consequence of what he said, I apprehended the prisoner, between six and seven o'clock, in Field-lane; he said he had been at home all day. The next morning, I found the prayer-book up the chimney in an empty room, adjoining the prisoner's father's.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any of them marked with red ochre across the loins - A. Yes, some of them were marked with a line of red ochre across the loins.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these sheep any other mark - A. A pitch bran mark, the letter S on the rump, and an ochre dot on the hip.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of sheep were these that were so marked - A. Between a Lincoln and a Leicester, they were large sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen the skin of the sheep that is to be produced - A. Yes, I believe that to be the skin of one of the sheep which I left in the field. The skin was shewn me by my master, he is a <rs id="t18111030-3-viclabel11" type="occupation">butcher</rs>

               <p>Q. Last Wednesday evening, in consequence of in- of something else, did you and other inha- - A. Yes, a little after seven we went that joins Duvoll's-lane, I met a man his back, the sack appeared full.</p>
               <p>was the prisoner - A. Yes, and the sack appearing full made me make up to him. When I went up to him I asked him what he had got there. I asked him if he had got a pig; he said, no, mutton. Then I asked him where he came from, he answered Holloway; I asked him where he was going to, he said Holloway; I said, it was very strange that he should come from Holloway, and going there again; I then rubbed him down of both sides to feel if he had any fire arms about him; I did not say any more to him until we got him over the gate. I had four more with me. I ordered two of the men to go over the the gate, which they did. I told the man to put the sheep over to them, which he did; he then said, I think one of you had better take a turn now; no, I said, you had better take it up, we are going your road. He asked the men to help him up with it; they did. We went on the road until we came to Mr. Crosses, and there we opened the bag; we found the carcase of a sheep in the sack, no head to it; the skin was taken off, the entrails were all gone, but the heart and lights, and part of the liver were left. It was quite warm, it was killed and fleyed in the regular way, and was dressed very nicely. We took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and returned to the field where we first found him. We there found the skin of a sheep with the head on it; we found the entrails, and all the remainder of the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you find that in the field from where you first found the prisoner - A. Near about an hundred yards in the same field.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things warm when you first found them - A. Quite warm. It being dark we did not observe the sheep in the field that night, the next morning I saw that there were sheep there. I afterwards delivered the skin to Mr.

               <p>COURT. You have said a man, who was that man - A. The prisoner at the bar. I have seen him many times before, he is a butcher.</p>

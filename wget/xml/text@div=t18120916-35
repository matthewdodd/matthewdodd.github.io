               <p>Q. Did you lose any of this property on the 1st of August last - A. I did, a bed quilt, a shirt, a pair of breeches, and a petticoat. I lost them out of my room; they were all in my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner near your house on the 1st of August - A. No. I did not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM STROUD. I live within two doors of Mrs. Arnold. I saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Arnold's house, with a sack or bag on his back, and when he came out of the house, there was something in the bag. It was empty when he went in; this was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again after this - A. Not till I went up to his house on the Tuesday evening I am sure the prisoner is the person I saw on the Saturday.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went with Mrs. Arnold to the prisoner's room. On Tuesday, the 4th of August, the prisoner was at home and his wife with him. I found this quilt, it was hanging over a turn-up bedstead on which the prisoner said he slept. I took the prisoner in custody, and the quilt I brought away. I have had it ever since. This is it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my quilt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a chimney-sweeper. On Tuesday the 4th of August, I had been out the whole day; on my return home I found a man and a woman had been there. The prosecutrix went towards my bed and took off my quilt, which she threw on the floor, my wife having purchased the article at Rosemary-lane, for eighteen pence and which, if it was stolen, I am sorry as we has astonished. My room was searched and no other property found. I am an honest industrious young lad, who lives honest on the produce of my labour, and never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160021"></xptr> did an act of dishonesty, and hope to prove the same in court. I am perfectly innocent of any felony, and hope to be restored to my wife by an acquittal.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did the prisoner say how he got that quilt - A. He said he bought it in Rag-fair for eighteen pence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

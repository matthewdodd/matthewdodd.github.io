This action was upon this promissory-note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), alleged to have been signed by the then defendant's mark—it was produced in the case—there were counts for money lent—the pleas were, that he did not make the note, and did not promise—I was present at the trial—the prisoner was examined as a witness—I saw him take the book, and heard the form of oath administered by the proper officer—I heard him give his evidence—Mr. Justice Erle presided, and the oath was taken in his presence—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

William Sanderson, the rector of the place where the prisoner had lived for some years, were called for the defence—on the cross-examination of Mr. Sanderson, Mr. Bovill, who was for the plaintiff, surrendered his brief, aban<lb></lb>doned his case, and would not proceed with it any longer—Sir William Erle immediately directed the tipstaff to take the prisoner into custody, and ordered him to be taken to the Queen's Bench Prison for a week; and, addressing the Counsel for the defendant, said that he did so to afford the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of ulterior proceedings against him—I think those were the words he used—he was then taken, and he threw himself upon his knees, and said something which I was not near enough to hear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at New Timber, in Sussex. In 1847, and for some years before, I occupied a farm called Homestead Farm, in the parish of Cuckfield—I then had a slight knowledge of the prisoner—in the</p>

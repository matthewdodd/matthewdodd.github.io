                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hogg, a pieman, of 15, Mile End Road—on 27th May the prisoner and another person came in between 8.0 and 9.0 at night—the prisoner asked for two pennyworth of eels and two pennyworth of bread, and gave me a half-crown—I put it on a board by itself, and after he had gone I found it was bad—it was placed on the top of a looking-glass in the sitting-room—I noticed that the prisoner had lost one finger—on 12th June he came again alone for one pennyworth of eels—I recognized him—he first offered me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and then took a look and gave me a florin—I bent it with my teeth, and Mr. Hogg gave it to the constable, and I gave him the half-crown from the top of the glass.</p>

My husband is a pastry cook, at 15, Mile End Road—on 28th May, between 8 and 9 o'clock, the prisoner came in with a short stout man, who called for a veal pie, and paid for it with a half-crown—I told him it was bad—he said that he took it in selling pots of flowers—I told my husband—they both ran away, and I gave the coin to a constable—the last witness is in our service.</p>

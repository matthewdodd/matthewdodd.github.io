             (Police-constable G 134). I took the prisoner; she denied all knowledge of it - I found on her a purse with four shillings and sixpence in it, a silver thimble, and a small stone.</p>

               <p>Cros-examined. Q. Was the prisoner with the prosecutor? A. Yes, the purse was in her pocket, not in her hand.</p>

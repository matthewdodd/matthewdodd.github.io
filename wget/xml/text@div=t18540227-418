                  </hi>. I keep a public house in Thayer-street, next door to where the fire occurred. A little after 10 o'clock that night I heard a knocking next door, and ran out to see what it was, and saw the flames coming out from the shutters underneath; I could distinctly see that they were flames—as soon as I saw the flames, I and one or two others went and broke open the door to see what was the matter—we found the door fast—we broke it open, and found a lot of shavings all in flames—they were strewed about the shop—the shop had been used lately as a carpenter's and trunk maker's; the prisoner carried on that business—they were new shavings—when I went in, they were all in flames; there was an old carpenter's bench there, and the flames were coming up underneath that from the shavings—the flames were in different parts; they appeared just set alight to—I was there before it became one body of flame—I noticed the gas—the main pipe comes in just alongside the story post, or door post—there was a main cock there; that was turned on full—there was no other pipe—all the other pipe, the lead pipe, appeared to have been taken down, I mean all the gas fittings—the main cock was turned on full, and the gas was alight, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270102"></xptr>
               <p>protruding out, I should say, two or three feet—the flames came in contact with the doorpost—they were close to it; they had caught the doorpost, and the doorpost was in flames—I should say that the shavings had been set on fire in different parts; I do not think it could have happened from the gas burning from the main cock—the furthest patch of burning shavings was about three or four feet from the gas; there were other shavings about the shop—directly I saw what it was, I ran back and got some water, and we got a cork and put in the gas pipe and stopped it—I threw some water on the shavings, and turned the bench upside down and trampled on the shavings, before the firemen came—I could not turn the cock, so I got a cork, and the fire escape man put it in—the prisoner has lived there about two or three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say anything to you some time ago about insuring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was something said about it—that was two or three days previous to the fire—he wanted me to purchase the lease of his house, that was how it came out—he came in and asked me if I liked to purchase the lease of his house—I said no, I did not want it—he pressed me very hard—he said the lease was lying at another neighbour's—he said if I would lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and get the lease away from Mr. Howland's, it would be very handy for the lease to be at my house for persons to come and look at it—he showed me his policy of insurance, and said it would make no differ<lb></lb>ence to him if the house was burnt down; he had insured it—lie was vexed at my not buying the lease.</p>

Q.</hi> How far is the fire station where the engine is from this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five minutes' walk; there was no crowd when I arrived at the house—there was a female knocking at the door; I think it was Mrs. Bubb—she continued knocking when I went out—I did not see the prisoner that night; but he was about there all the evening—I went into the shop before the flames were extinguished, before the engine arrived—I suppose it was five or ten minutes before the engine arrived; it was not burning for that time, we had put it out—we put out part of it before the engine arrived; but a person came in with a candle and the gas caught alight again, and we had to put it out again, and to put a cork in—there was a flood of light from the main pipe—the shavings looked as if they had been lighted in different parts of the shop—the carpenter's bench was not a good deal burnt, we put it out too quick—all the windows were broken; the sashes were getting on nicely, if we had let them alone—the panes were broken by the fire, and the fire had reached the frames—there were sixteen or seventeen panes broken; I did not count them, I only speak from the appearance—I know they were broken by the fire, because I had seen them previously, about 12 o'clock in the daytime, and they were not broken then—I heard them breaking as the flames went up—I have known the prisoner ever since he has been there; I have not had any quarrels with him, more than if he has come into my place drunk I would not serve him—there was a bit of a quarrel about a bill—he came one day and asked me to lend him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would bring it back next day—I lent it him; and when I asked him for it again, be told me be would pay it me when it suited him—I sent him in a bill for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>next day, and put a new one in—the prisoner used to live in the house—he did not come home that night—I know that, because I was afraid he would come back again, and I sat up all night in my own house, and there was a policeman in his house to watch whether he did come back—I do not know whether that policeman is here—I saw a policeman there—I went back<lb></lb>wards and forwards to the house; I did not go to bed till 5 o'clock in the morning, when the house opened—it was about two or three days previous to the fire that I had this conversation with the prisoner; there was no one else present; it was in my parlour, about 11 o'clock in the day—the quarrel I speak of is the only quarrel we have had, except when he has been drunk, and I would not serve him—we had a few words about the money he bor<lb></lb>rowed; it was twelve months before he paid me—I said I would summons him—I never said I would serve him out—I swear that.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 17th Jan., a little after 10 o'clock, I was called to the fire in Thayer-street; it was about two and a half or three minutes' run from the fire escape—the shop door had been broken open when I got there—I found the shop all in flames—there was a great quan<lb></lb>tity of shavings alight; they were partly burnt when I got there—there were some in one part, and some in another—the fire might have gone from one to the other—there might have been a good sized basket full of shavings, I mean those that were alight.</p>

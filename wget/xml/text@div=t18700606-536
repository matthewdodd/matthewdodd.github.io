                  </hi>. I have been for five years paymaster of the London and South Western Railway Company, and since 5th January this year I have been paymaster of the men employed on the permanent way—the labourers are employed once a fortnight, and are separated into gangs—over every gang there is a ganger, and over a certain number of gangers to inspector—it is the ganger's duty to know the names of the men in a parti<lb></lb>cular gang, and to report the time which the men severally worked to the inspector, who, from time to time, in the discharge of his duties, would have to go down and see the men at work and communicate with the ganger—the inspector made a report in writing to the superintendent of the permanent way—from the inspector's report, pay-sheets are issued and sent to me for the purpose of payment—the prisoner Steele was the ganger of a travelling gang stationed at Hounslow, which was one of the gangs under the charge and direction of Inspector Henry Wood—from the 21st April something had attracted my attention in respect to the pay-sheets of Steele's gang, in consequence of which on 21st April I went down to Brent<lb></lb>ford, where Steele's gang was at work, and took with me this copy of a pay-sheet of the fortnight previously, dated 13th April—I saw nine men there, including Steele, and from the paper I had I called over the names of the gang—I made this copy, but the original is in Court—several of the men answered to their names—I called out the name of Simmouds, which is not on this sheet: there was a pause, and Steele then said, pointing to a man who I afterwards ascertained was Hatton, "This is Simmonds"—I proceeded to call the rest of the names in the list, and then proceeded to Hounslow—on my return I counted the gang again, and found only eight men—I said to Steele "There is one man missing, where is hat"—he made no answer—I said "I am sure there is something wrong with this gang, and I will not leave till I find it out, if it takes me a twelvemonth"—I called over the men's names, as before, and all who were there answered, but no one answered to the name of Simmonds—I said "Where is Simmonds?"—Steele said "He has gone for a lever," that is an instrument to lift the rails with—I said, "Are you quite sure the man's name is Simmonds, is not it Hatton?—he said "I knows him as Simmonds"—I had during my previous inquiries received information—I then went away from the gang and met Hatton carrying a lever on his shoulder—I had a conversation with him—nothing passed between me and Steele after that, I went away—on 23th April, which was the neit fortnightly payment, I went to Nine Elms with this pay-sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), from which I called over the names of the gang and paid them their wages—on my calling the name of Simmonds the prisoner Simmonds stepped forward, in Steele's presence, and said "I was at Acton on that day with my brother, drinking—I said to Simmonds "Then your ganger told me an untnith, for he pointed out to me another man, Simmonds; I shall not pay you till I am sure of your identity"—the pay.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it on the 21st that you had the first conversa<lb></lb>tion with Steele? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, And he continued working on the railway down to the time he was taken in custody—he could bear everything at the interview at Nine Elms—Potter was not present then—I am not aware that there has been a good deal of worry and annoyance in the traffic manager's office about this—Superintendent Bond has been discharged from the secre<lb></lb>tary's office—he is superintendent of the district of which Steele is one of the gangers—under him would be Inspector Woods, who would on a rough estimate have to superintend fifty gangs, and it may be considerably more—his duties would extend over a large district—Claxton would be under Mr. Bond, erne of his clerks; Bond comes first and in his office Claxton next, then Inspector Woods, and next to him the ganger—before money was paid in London all those persons would have to handle the account—Claxton would not have to pay money to the men—he would manipulate the accounts and documents sent to him—he has been suspended, and is I believe awaiting the result of this inquiry—at the end of every other fort-night it was the clerk's duty to go down and pay the men—that is not part of my regular duty in that district—I am aware now that the pay<lb></lb>clerks were in the habit of going down and banding the money, and not paying the men individually; I was not aware of it at the time—in some instances they handed it out of a railway carriage window—I am a chief pay<lb></lb>clerk, and when I discovered it I complained of one of my subordinates having been lax and not paying the men by the sheets individually—it has come to my knowledge since that that was also done in the district in which</p>

               <p>Steele was—as to hiring men, the inspector should submit any appointing he wishes to make to his superintendent—I have been told that Inspector Wood was in the habit of hiring and discharging men himself—as a role there is a fixed number of men in a gang, but Steele's was a travelling gang, and men were taken on a a they were required, some from one gang and some from another in the vicinity; it was a scratch lot—they might be called in for a day, from different gangs—they would travel about to all parts of the line within that particular district—if they are lent to another gang, some would be in one spot and some two or three miles away; but that is not the rule, it is a very rare case indeed—when I first went down and called over the names, I found men working two miles off, Gregory and Smith, who did not belong to the gang, and who ought not to have been entered—whether they belonged to the gang or not they were working for the Company—they were with Steele's gang on the pay-sheet—the ganger was the person who would give the times of the men to the inspector—I should have the pay-sheet after the superintendent, and on that pay-sheeet the money would ultimately be paid—they make mistakes on the London and South Western Railway, as they do in every other quarter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the London and South Western Railway police—on Friday, 29th April, I was at Mr. Scott's, the traffic manager's office, with Mr. Patten—Mr. Scott asked Simmonds his name, he said "John Simmonds, and gave his address at some beer-hop a Battersea—he was then asked how long he had been at work for the com<lb></lb>pany with Steele's gang, he said "Seven or eight weeks"—he was asked if he knew the names of the men he had been employed with, he said that he did not; but he knew their faces—he was asked if he had been working with any other gang but Steele's, he said that he had not—Hatton was then called in and asked if he knew Simmonds, he said that he never saw him in his life till the day after Mr. Patten came—after that I went to the embankment, near Clapham Junction, with Mr. Patten, and there saw Steele at work, with his gang—I beckoned to him and said "Steele, I want some information respecting the time of Simmonds; he said "All I know about it is that he was at work with me seven or eight weeks"—I said "Are you sure he was at work a month with you?"he said "Yes, longer than that"—I said "Will you be positive that he was at work three weeks under you?" he said "Oh yes, a great deal longer than that," and turned away and laughed, and walked away—nothing more passed at that time—on the following Monday, May 2nd, I went again to the embankment—the gang was working near the same place—I found Simmonds at dinner, and asked him where Steele was—he said "Gone to dinner"—we then well down the embankment, and I asked Simmonds to go on to Clapham Junction with Mr. Patten, which he did, and I remained on the embank-ment till 12.50, when I saw Steele—I took out a warrant and said "Steele, you must consider yourself in custody, for conspiring with Simmonds to defraud the South Western Railway Company; you will be charged on this warrant"—he said "Simmonds, d—Simmonds; I know nothing about Simmonds"—I said "You had better go with me quietly to Waterloo Station"—he said "I will see you b—first"—I advised him again to go quietly—he said "I will see you at hell first," and rushed towards a large iron sledge hammer, which he took up—one of my private inquiry officers stepped up, caught hold of him, and advised him to put it down—he then went quietly to Waterloo Station, and he and Simmonds were charged at Tower Street Station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When he took up the sledge hammer did he say he would go quietly, if you would set someone to take charge of his gang? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but after a great deal of persuasion he said "If you will fetch a ganger I will go with you"—I cannot tell you whether it is the traffic manager's practice, when he is going to prosecute a person, to have him into his private office and cross-question him; I only know it was done in this case—I did not want to make a case; but I was instructed to investigate it—it was after my conversation with Steele that I applied for the warrant—I did not tell him I had a warrant in my pocket when I told him to go to Clapham Junction—Inspector Bond did not disappear, he has been dismissed by the Company; but he is about—Wood has absconded; at least, I have not been able to find him.</p>

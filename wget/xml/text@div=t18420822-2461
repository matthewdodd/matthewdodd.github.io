                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. John Gurney, who keeps a brewery at Lambeth—Durdan was his servant, and it was his duty to take out nose-bags of food for his horses. On the 17th of August he went out with one horse, and if he took any corn out, it was his duty to give it to the horse, or to bring it back—the food consisted of oats, chaff, and beans—I received information, and sent for him into the room, and Mr. Gurney asked him if he did not go <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Baker's, in Hamilton-row, Bagnigge-wells-road—he said "Yes"—Mr. Gurney said, "Was all right there?"—be said, "Yes, sir"—he said, "Did you take your nose-bag?"—he said, "Yes, sir"—he said, "Did you give the horse the food?"—he said, "Yes, sir"—the policeman who was present then questioned him as to the contents</p>

               <p>of the nose-bag, and asked him whether he gave it to the horse, or sold it—he replied, "I am too fond of horses to give away their food, the horse had it"—the policeman said he had been informed he had sold the con<lb></lb>tents of the nose-bag to another man—he said he had not—the policeman said he should take him on the charge—he said he was quite innocent, he had certainly given some away, but no money passed.</p>

On the 17th of August, Durdan agreed with me to help him, and he gave me some beer for my work—when we came from the house be went over and spoke to Day—he then came back to the dray, and unbuckled the nose-bag from the shaft, took it, and emp<lb></lb>tied it into Day's cart—he brought the nose-bag back empty—the pri<lb></lb>soner and another man then went into a public-house and drank—I saw Day change a shilling at the bar.</p>

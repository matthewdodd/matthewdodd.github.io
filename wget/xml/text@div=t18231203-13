I got up about seven o'clock next morning, and it was missing; the stable was locked over night. I went home, and told my father, and then came to Smithfield - I got to Smithfield on the 7th, about two o'clock in the afternoon, and found her in the market, with a bridle on; the saddle was left in the stable. A chimney sweeper was in possession of the mare; it is worth 17 l. I got an officer - the prisoner came out of a public-house, and the officer took him. I had seen him at Burnham the day before; he examined the mare's mouth as she stood in the stable. He asked where the mare came from I think, but am sure he said something about her. I am certain of him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 7th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I saw Dancer in Smithfield - he pointed the mare out; a chimney sweeper had possession of her. I went up and stopped him - he said it belonged to a person in the public-house. I sent Harker to the public-house with him while I held the mare - the prisoner was brought out, and caught hold of the mare, and said, "This is my property, take it from me who dare." I secured him. Dancer swore positively to it - the prisoner said something about it. I searched him, and found a spur in his pocket.</p>

On a Friday afternoon, between two and three o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the Old Bailey, with the mare, and asked if he was going to sell her - he said Yes, I asked if I might ride it - he said Yes, and I rode her into Smithfield; he followed me. I rode it up and down; Turnpenny came and asked how I came by it - I told him who gave me leave to ride it, and went with Harker to the public-house; the prisoner was brought out - he put his hand on the mare, and said it was his property. I did not know him before.</p>

I brought him out to the mare, and asked how he came by it; he said he had it from St. Alban's, and swapped two donkies and a 1 l. note for it. Dancer claimed it, and it was returned to him.</p>

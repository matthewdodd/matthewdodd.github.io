             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: On Saturday the 11th of this month, between ten and eleven, the prisoner came to my shop to fell this spoon. (Produces a silver table spoon).</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - A. I do not recollect her myself, my servant has seen her; I asked her how she came by it; she said she found it two years ago; she had the appearance of a milk-girl, with a blue apron on; I asked her where she had her milk from; she said, from Wellings's farm, and that she had found it in Bond-street, with some other things; I asked her how she came to scrape the mark out; and she said, it was done by a boy she had sent it to; I did not believe the story, and I took her to Marlborough-street office; she told the same story at the office; and they went to enquire at the Milk-house; and they sent to this Mr. Wilson, where this girl lived; Mr. Wilson is M'Dow's master.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Applegarh. This is my spoon, this is the fellow to it; it is marked with my own name, which is not quite obliterated.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she there the day the spoon was missed? - A. Yes, she was.</p>

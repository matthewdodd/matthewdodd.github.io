               <p>I was come to put a <hi rend="italic">spoke</hi> in what he had to say, nor call him a black, guard name, to the best of my recollection—I never called him a b—; it is a word I never make use of—I cannot swear that I have not spoken to him in a public-house about this matter—I might say I was coming here—I did not say to swear against him.</p>

On 15th Sept. the two prisoner were brought to the station on a charge of attempting to enter a house—Payne had a basket with her, and in it was this key, which she said was the key of her room—the landlady was sent for, and she said the prisoner lodged in her house, in a second floor back room—I went with the land<lb></lb>lady and an officer to that room—the door was locked, and I opened it by means of the key which I had found in the basket—I saw this piece of white metal on the mantel shelf—there were several pieces of white metal under the stove, as if they had been melted—I made further search, and in a recess I found this mould, and on searching further I found this tobacco pipe, which appeared to have been used to take out metal—I found this frame and this plaster of Paris, this saucepan, which has white metal in it now, and a file with white metal in its teeth.</p>

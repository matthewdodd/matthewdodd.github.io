                  </hi>. I am a light porter. On the Monday before 24th March I went to a lodging-house in Golden-lane to sleep—I put my trowsers on the bed—there was 10 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in them and my handkerchief—my brother slept with me—two men slept at the foot of the bed, and a butcher slept in another bed—when I awoke in the morning I found the prisoner there in bed—I dressed and went out—I felt in my pocket to pay for some coffee, and missed my money—I went back and got a policeman, who searched the prisoner, and found the money on him—he said he had not got 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his pocket, but 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found, among which was this farthing of mine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by its being burnt—he said he changed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a pie-shop, on 17th March, and bought 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pie—my money was sixpence, two pence, four halfpence, and this farthing.</p>

The prisoner came on the third of June to our shop, and asked the price of a piece of lace that hung in the window; I told her the price; she thought it too dear; I said I had several others that would come lower. Being engaged with a customer, I put down a box, and called a young man lately come to the shop to attend the prisoner. He turned his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070013"></xptr> back upon the woman; and at the same time I saw her take a piece of lace and put it under her cloak; I went immediately to her and asked her if there was any lace that would suit her; she said no; she went out; I followed her and brought her back. The lace was concealed under her clock under her arm. She had a child in her arms.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. How could you see me take it? - I had my eyes on her all the time the young man was serving her. As she was a stranger I thought it was possible she might attempt something of the kind.</p>

He said he had been robbed of a great deal, and he would punish me for the rest.</p>

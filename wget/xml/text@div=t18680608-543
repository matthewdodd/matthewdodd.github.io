                  </hi>. I carry on business at Chard, in Somersetshire, and among other branches of business have been since 1866 a manufacturer of cider—in 1866 I employed the prisoner as my agent for the sale of cider in London—I consigned it to him, and the invoices generally bore his name, but there were some exceptions—that arrangement was found to work not quite satisfactorily, and in February or March, 1867, I entered into a new arrangement with him—the goods were to be delivered to various customers and credited to me—the prisoner was to obtain the orders and send them to me at Chard, and I had to deliver the goods—I had new invoices pre<lb></lb>pared, and this of Mr. Hickman's is one of them—I call the prisoner my agent—there is a notification that the accounts are to be paid on and after 15th October—the prisoner had to obtain the orders, see to the return of the empties, and to collect the money in October—his remuneration was 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per gallon for the cider sold—he was to receive from me duplicates of the invoices I had sent in, and apply to the various customers from 15th October to December for the money, and on receiving it to remit it to me—in the commencement of 1867, I received orders from him and executed them—one of them was from Mr. Laurence—besides the orders he sent me during 1867, I had an order direct from Mr. Hickman, which I executed, and on the approach of 15th October I directed the prisoner to call for the money, and afterwards received from him this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1867, <hi rend="italic">and signed C. Mayle, requesting Mr. Payne to send him copies of the accounts, including Mr. Hickman's</hi>)—no money was sent me after 15th October—I therefore made inquiries of the customers, and saw the prisoner at various times from October 21 to 24—I asked him if he was ready to pay me any amounts—he said that he had not collected any—I have never received the amounts due from Laurence or Hickman.</p>

Slade, the vinegar merchants, that he had many hundred customers and was likely to increase my business considerably—he has received no money from me, he would receive his money when the accounts were made up—he received a penny a gallon commission in 1866, and was to receive the same in 1867, but we did not call it a commission then because it was under a different head—I do not think anybody was present when the new arrangement was made, it took place at Hank's Hotel, where I used to meet him—as he had no salary I had no right to command him to go anywhere to collect orders—on</p>

               <p>this bill here is "Mr. Mayle, London Agent"—I have had transactions direct from the customers without his having any share in it—I have had a very large number of transactions through him—after February or March, 1867, he was my London Manager, not "Agent," but the bills have London agent on them down to the present time—he obtains a customer named Brown in London, writes to me to say that Mr. Brown wants a barrel of cider, I send the barrel direct to Mr. Brown, and presuming my clerk to act correctly, he would send the invoice to Mayle, to deliver to the customer, and the money would be paid to Mayle on that invoice at the end of the season and not as each came in—in 1866, he gave me a bill of exchange on account, which was dishonoured, and I sent the money for him to take it up, but he kept both—he paid me the amount 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. two months afterwards, January 3rd—I sent him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take it up on 23rd October, and he kept that, it was perfectly at his option in 1866, whether he got orders for me or not—the second arrangement was in March, 1867, he then had to communicate with me—I sent Mr. Brown the cider and the invoice, and sent the prisoner an invoice as well at the end of the season—I sent them all in a lump for collection—the invoices were from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upwards—if Mr. Brown had three or four quantities of cider it would all be put in one total—he had three months to collect the money in, he was not to collect it on any particular day—15th October is the end of the season—I am in London very often; I did not always see him when I came up—I believe an agent is a person employed to do anything for another person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Payne's book-keeper, and manager—in 1866, Mayle used to send down the orders, and we supplied the cider and sent the invoices to him—no cider was consigned to him—in 1867 ledger accounts were opened in the name of each customer, and an invoice bill heading was prepared—this of Hickman's is one of them—I remember an order being sent through the prisoner to Mr. Laurence, dated June 11th, 1867, for twenty-eight gallons—the first order of Mr. Hickman was on June 22nd, there are others, the amounts are 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—those orders were duly executed, they did not come through the prisoner—we send invoices direct to the customer with the goods, and when 15th October arrived we sent the prisoner dup<lb></lb>licates of the invoices for him to go round and collect the money—duplicates of Hickman's and Laurence's accounts were sent to him, but I had not sent them when the letter which has been produced arrived—after that letter I made them out and sent them on the 23rd, but money did not arrive; I there<lb></lb>fore went to London on 26th December to see the customers—I also saw the prisoner and asked him for a statement of the accounts he had received—he made an appointment to meet me in the city and bring his books—I went to the place, he brought no books, and did not say whether he had collected the monies—I saw him again and asked him if he had received any money, he did not say whether he had or had not—he did not go into the accounts with me, and did not hand me any money—I have not received the amount due from Mr. Hickman or Mr. Laurence.</p>

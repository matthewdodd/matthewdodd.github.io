             mariner, on board that ship?</p>
               <p>Readman. There was due from the first of July 46, to the 13 of April 49, about 39 l. 15 s. he was set down able seaman, the ship was lost the 13 of April 49, and he was supposed to be lost in her at fort St. David's in the East-Indies, and these books are the best that can be made out, by the captain and officers, her books being lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hughes. I was present about 3 weeks ago when the prisoner was before my Lord Mayor, she at first denied she knew any thing of the forgery, but said she was the cousin of the man: she went out and I followed her; she said if she might be allowed an evidence she could make a discovery of the persons that forged it; after that she declared before my Lord Mayor one Dunn had wrote the will, and gave it to her in order to go to Doctors Commons; but she wanted to accuse the wife of Dunn who was in custody, on suspicion of being concerned in this affair; the reason she was taken into custody was, that after the prisoner was taken she came to our office to enquire for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I can neither write nor read, I did not know any thing about it, I did not carry it to the Commons at all, I said it was made by one Dunn, he lived in Ratcliff High Way at one Newman's, I came to receive my brother's effects, and he and my husband made me go to administer upon this will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hughes. She told me she was present when Dunn forged it, and that he had forged a great many more, and was coming to Doctors Commons with them.</p>

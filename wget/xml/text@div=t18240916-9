            . I lodge at Mr. Slater's. The prisoner lodged with me for about a month, and was absent two months, then returned - she had part of my bed. On the 7th of September I went out, leaving her in my room about twelve o'clock, returned between three and four, and she was gone out; she came in soon after, and asked if I had sent a person for my watch: I said No - she said a woman had been for it, and she had given it to her; I said I was ruined for ever, for she had stolen my valuable property, and told her that before I went to bed I would know who she had given it to. I went out, returned between eight and nine, and said if she did not tell me who she gave it to I would have her taken up, and take her oath - she then said she had taken it, and was very sorry for it. I said nothing else to induce her to confess. My sister came in; she told her she had pawned it, and was sorry for it.</p>

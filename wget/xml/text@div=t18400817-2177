                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, and live in Church-street, Dept<lb></lb>ford. On the 10th of July I was at Mr. Ive's—I took notice of what was doing by Wolledge and Whitewood—I saw White Wood's cart come into the yard, and draw up to a quarter of a frame of wood—Whitewood was with the cart, and they began to load the cart, and had taken the whole of the wood that was in the frame—it was from top to bottom—Whitewood <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it into the cart, and Wolledge <hi rend="italic">stowed</hi> it—this division is a quarter of a frame—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to the model</hi>)—it is called six feet—the cart was driven out of the yard by Whitewood—I did not observe any money pass between him and Wolledge—I heard Mr. Ive say to Whitewood about some other wood he had purchased, the particulars of which I do not recollect, and he asked him about the wood in the cart, how much he had, he distinctly said, "Five feet"—Mr. Ive, I think, said, "No more," but the answer was so indistinct I could not hear—I was touching Mr. Ive, and Whitewood was not more than two feet from me—when I saw the wood thrown into the cart I sent Miller to Mr. Ive to tell him what I had seen—no conversation passed in my presence between Ive and Wolledge—Wolledge put up a foot of wood immediately after the frame was emptied—the wood was in a large stack previous to being framed.</p>

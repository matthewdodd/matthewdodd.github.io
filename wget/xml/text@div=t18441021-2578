                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Smith, of Fore-street, Cripplegate. On the 12th of Aug. I returned from Tonbridge Wells—about six o'clock that evening I was walking along the Borough, and the prisoner walked by the side of me, and said, could I direct him to Covent-garden—he said he had not been in London before for five years—he asked me to have a glass of ale, and we went into a house and had it—an old man came in, and wished to take us to the play—I declined that—the prisoner and I then went back to a beer-shop near the Elephant and Castle—that was at the prisoner's suggestion—when we got there, the prisoner shook hands with Mr. Abinger, the landlord, and we went up stairs—the prisoner had previous to that told me that the landlord had had dealings with his father—after we had been in the room some time, an Irishman came in, and said his grandfather had left him a great deal of money, and he said he had been to a party last night and won half-a-crown, and the man had not got half-a-crown to give him, and he gave him a pack of cards—I said, "Let me look at them"—he showed me them, and be began to bet, and talked about play—I said I did not know how to play at cards—the prisoner then said he wished me to let him have some money for him to play with the other man—they played at "Cutting up"—I let the prisoner have altogether at different times 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw him play all the time with the other man—he was sometimes losing, and sometimes gaining—the money I let the prisoner have was four sovereigns, four half-sovereigns,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210167"></xptr>
               <p>and the rest in silver—he said lie would pay me again If I let him have the money, as he had money to receive—he did not say then from whom, but on the way he told me he had money to receive from Mr. Abinger, who keeps the beer-shop—he went away, and I did not see him again till he was in custody—I went for a policeman that night, after I found the prisoner did not come back—I went and asked Mr. Abinger if he knew him—he said, no, he had never seen him but once before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After you left the first public-house, where something took place about the man speaking to you, did the prisoner make any remark about his own property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said he hoped he bad not lost his money—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a green purse with steel slides, which appeared to contain gold and some notes—I saw it for about a minute—he took it out, and I heard something rattle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever seen this man before in your life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am twenty-three years old—I am shopman to Mr. Smith, a grocer—my wages are 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I had received money of my master the last week before I left—I had been to Tonbridge Wells, to see my friends—I took 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I went from London—I have lived in my present place six weeks—I had before that lived at Mr. Hutton's in the Borough for nine months, where I had 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I did not stake this money as my own part of the wager—I did not go shares with the prisoner in his portion of the wager.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had previously seen in his possession a puree which you sup<lb></lb>posed contained gold and notes, why did you not say, "Take your own money, you have some?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He bad lost some of his money before that, but I cannot say how much—he lost some gold, not notes—I cannot say why I did not tell him to take money out of has own purse—I was in his company from about six o'clock till eight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did you not tell the policeman that you had been playing at cards, and had been cheated out of your money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I said I lost my money with men who were playing at cards—I came out, saw the policeman, and told him the circumstances—one of the men came out of a court opposite, and I said, "That man and another man robbed me of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I did not tell the policeman that I had been playing at cards, and had lost my money—I had seen the prisoner with a purse—I saw notes and gold in it—he did not tell me how much it contained—he said he had to receive a large sum—though he had notes and gold of his own, I let him have my money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 12th of Sept.—it was on the 12th of Aug. that I first saw him—my master knows of this—the policeman came to our house, and asked if I had been robbed—my master knew this on the 11th of Sept., but this is a fresh situa<lb></lb>tion—I was not in a situation at that time—I had left my situation, and went to my friends to get another—I slept that night in a house on the other side London-bridge—my money was gone—I got into a situation about a fortnight after—I never mentioned it to my master till the day before the policeman came—I have a father, who lives near Tonbridge Wells—I sent word down to him three or four days afterwards, during the fortnight I was looking for a situation—I have a brother-in-law in London, who is a cheese<lb></lb>monger—I let him know the next evening—I am not married—I do not visit any female in Kent-street—I have never been living with any woman, and do not keep a woman.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody for assaulting a female—on the way to the station he put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and took something out, and threw it behind him, which sounded like money—I looked, but could not find it then—I went afterwards and found this purse and in it three <hi rend="italic">flash</hi> notes, and fourteen pieces of <hi rend="italic">flash</hi> coin—I am satisfied that he threw it down.</p>

               <p>dined at two o'clock that day, and the plate had not come up—I saw it in the dinner-room and told him I was surprised he had not brought it up—I had told him of it between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and at ten o'clock—I mentioned it to him again at tea-time, at servant o'clock and said I was extremely surprised I had had to repeat the order so often—he made no answer—I desired him to bring it up immediately; I was going to put it in the plate-chest—I did not see him any more until I heard the plate was gone—that was about five minutes to eight o'clock the same evening—I heard it through one of the servant-maids, who is here—I saw the prisoner again after hearing this—I passed him on the stairs, as I went down, and asked him whether the silver tea-pot and eream-jug were gone not supposing there had been time for them to go as it was not more than thirty-five minutes after he had taken the tea-things away—he said it was all gone—he asked me if he should go to call the police—(I did not suspect him at all at that time)—I told him to go to the station house—he went out and returned in about two minutes saying there was no po<lb></lb>liceman there—the station-house is near my mother's in Marylebone-street—I inquired how it was—he said he had found a door leading to the back of the house open—the street-door was shut when I went down—the back-door opens into the yard—there is no outlet from that yard—he said he found that door open, and somebody must have come in that way, and taken the place—I went to look if it was open but it was quite safe, as I had seen it at half-past five o'clock that evening—it was bolted and shut up, and a tell on the window—it is a window-door a double door—I told him I found it as I had seen it at half-past five o'clock—he then was in such a dreadful state of agitation he could scarcely speak at all—but he said it was open—he persisted in that—he said he had found the area-gate open, and a closet under the stairs open—we never had the area-gate open—the key of it was always kept in the sideboard-drawer—that drawer was always kept locked and we kept the key ourselves—the gales was found locked; all the plate was gone—it was kept in a basket, and brought up every night—the basket was also gone—the place consisted of the articles stated in the indictment (<hi rend="italic">enumerating them</hi>)—every evening there are two tea-spoons left out, in order to bring up on the tray at eleven o'clock at night with water but they were also gone—I asked the prisoner where the tea-leaves were—he said they were thrown into a sink in the panty—I and another person looked to see if there were any, but there were none—they could not have passed through the hole of the sink.</p>

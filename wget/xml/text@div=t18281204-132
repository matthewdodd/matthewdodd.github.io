I was near Mr. Fox's shop, be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040059"></xptr>tween six and seven o'clock on the 15th of November; I saw the prisoner take one cheese and walk away with it, he then put it into his right-hand coat-pocket - Mr. Fox and his son were lighting the gas; I told them of it - the son ran after him and told him to come back, that his father wanted him; he said he did not want his father, and turned down Riley-court - the son called Stop thief! he crossed the road and turned down a dark passage; I saw him taken by Mr. Fox - I lost sight of him in the passage, because it was dark, but am quite sure he is the man.</p>

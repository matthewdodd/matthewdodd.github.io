               <p>Was it locked? - No; it was not. I had been in the city about some business. I came home between ten and eleven o'clock. I ate my supper, and went to bed; Mrs . Pye can give a better account of it.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 12th of November I saw the money in the bureau at nine o'clock at night. I went to the bureau between twelve and one the same night, when I was just going to bed, and missed it all; there was nothing left in the drawer. The prisoner had been in our service nine months .</p>
               <p>Was he at home that night during that time? - Yes; in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Might he have gone into the place where the bureau was kept without your seeing him? - He might.</p>
               <p>What induced you to suspect him? - I did not suspect him till Sunday evening the 22d of September, when a new silver watch was found upon him.</p>
               <p>What wages did you give him? - He never received any from me. I laid it out in clothes for him as it became due.</p>
               <p>Jury. He had vales from the people that use the house I suppose? - Yes; now and then a six-pence, or a shilling. He ran away on the Monday morning. I sent a person after him as far as Reading, who brought him back.</p>
               <p>How did you trace him to Reading? - A person who came to town told us he saw him on the Reading coach box.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find out who he bought the watch of? - Yes; the watch-maker is here. When the prisoner was taken to Litchfield-street, he confessed he took the money.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - I did not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was brought before me, and was rather obstinate; in the course of his examination being hard pressed, he did acknowledge the fact; there was this sort of promise made him, that it should not affect his life; that was the only promise that was made him.</p>
               <p>Pye. I took up upon suspicion a person that had been in the room; who was kept in Bridewell near a week. The prisoner said, that person was quite innocent, and that he alone was guilty.</p>

I took it up, and asked him how he came by it; he said he had it to save for George the wheelwright till the next morning; I said, if it was George the wheelwright's, I would give it to my mistress, and she should keep it and give it to George the wheelwright in the morning. He wanted to get it from me, and said, hush, hush, do not say any thing to my mistress, for I do not want her to know any thing about it. I took it, and gave it to my mistress.</p>

            . I live at No. 72, Cow-cross, and am a patrol. On the 5th of October, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner coming along Sharp's-alley, Cowcross. I went and asked him what he had got under his coat - he said</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you have," and found two pairs of shoes on him; he then said it was his own work. I took him to Hatton-garden the same evening - the Magistrate let him go, because he said he could bring a person to prove that he made the shoes were detained; and were claimed three days afterwards by Mrs. Arthur. He was taken last Monday when I met him in the street; he had said he lived in White Horse-court, Chick-lane, but we could not find him there.</p>

I had seen them at three o'clock, and missed them a little after seven. The officer brought one shoe, and asked me if I knew it. I went afterwards to Hatton-garden, and saw two pairs of shoes, which I could swear to - there is the mark of P. A. on them, which are the initials of my husband's name, which was Philip.</p>

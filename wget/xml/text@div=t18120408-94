On Thursday the 2d of April I was informed that some lead was secreted in a part of the shop, I took it up and marked it, and secreted myself in a part of the premises to see what became of it. The prisoner worked for me, he came in and brought a bag of tools in with him, he immediately went to the spot where this piece of lead was deposited, took it and put it into a narrower compass than it was, and drove a nail through it and put it under his waistcoat, and secured it from tumbling down by putting the nail into a button-hole, he immediately went off the premises with it, I followed him and brought him back and gave him into custody. This is the lead, it was in my charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The lead did not belong to Mr. Sewell, I am an old man with a family, I am very sorry I should be brought into all this trouble, it is the first time and I hope it will be the last.</p>

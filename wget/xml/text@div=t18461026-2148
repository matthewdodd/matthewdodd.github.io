                  </hi>. I live at Deptford. The prisoner was my apprentice—on the 30th of Sept., in consequence of information I received from my son, I went up stairs and spoke to the prisoner—I got no answer from him, he ap<lb></lb>peared to be asleep—I said to my son, "Never mind, go to bed; you will find it in the morning"—next morning I called the prisoner into the room, and asked what money he had got in his pocket—he told me he had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "Have you no more money in your pocket?"—he said, "No, not any more"—I told him there was half-a-crown taken out of my son's pocket since last night, no one had been there but him, and I insisted on its being brought for<lb></lb>ward—after a great deal of talk, for I suppose ten minutes, I told him he should not leave my presence till the half-crown was found; I should call in a policeman and have him and his bedroom searched—after that he turned round, put the half-crown on the round part of the sofa where I was standing, and said that was the half-crown—he fell on his knees and asked me to forgive him—I said, "This is not the first, second, or third time I have detected you, I shall put you in charge"—it was my half-crown—my son is fifteen years old.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did it become your half-crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had taken it in business, and given it to my son the evening before—the prisoner has been my apprentice a little more than five years—the Magistrate said, "Would you not wish the indentures to be cancelled?"—I said, "No; the last two years of the lad's time is worth all the first"—I would not let him go, but have him committed, and said when he came out I would have him back again—I have done work under his father for many years—his father had something to do with a building society—I had something to do in preparing the zinc for the houses under Mr. Butler—I was not discharged from that duty in consequence of my neglect—I did not tell Mr. Butler that I could not reach the father, but it would not be long before I had the son in Newgate—it is false, as God is true—I never said so in my life—I never punished one person for another's faults—I had occasion on the Monday evening to send my son on an errand—I gave him two shillings and a half-crown to go and try to buy me a particalar sort of tap, which I did not happen to have in the home—he returned just about eight o'clock—he sleeps in the same room as the prisoner—they occupy different beds—my son changed his trowsers to go to the Scientific Institute—he was in a hurry, and threw his trowsers on the prisoner's bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the Magistrate tell you that under the circumstances you were disclosing, you could not expect to convict this prisoner, and he should admit him to bail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me it was a clear case; he should send him to the Central Criminal Court—I did not say, in a conversation with Mr. Butler, that I could not reach the old man, but I would have the young one in New<lb></lb>gate before long—when I found the half-crown the prisoner was in my one<lb></lb>pair-of-stairs front room, under his bed-room—he is in the habit of coming down without his shoes—I waited for him, called him in, and put this question to him about the money, and before he left the room he put the money on the sofa, and implored forgiveness.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of the 29th of Sept. I left my trowsers on the prisoner's bed—there was a half-crown and two shillings in them—I went out, and returned a little later than half-past nine o'clock—I went to my trowsers in about half an hour—the two shillings were there—the half-crown was gone, and my trowsers had been disturbed—the prisoner was in bed when I came home—I said nothing to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder; I have lived in Botolph-lane nearly three years. I know the prisoner and his father—I am connected with a building society—we contracted for the building of sixty houses—the prisoner's father is one of the trustees, and the surveyor of the society—the prosecutor applied to my brother, who is a superintendent of the works at Greenwich, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> do the zinc-work, and he was employed by us under the superintendence of the pri<lb></lb>soner's father—a complaint was made of the dilatory manner in which he was doing the work, and in consequence of that he was discharged—he afterwards told me that he could not reach the father, but it should not be long before the son was in Newgate—he used that language at the White Hart, at Green<lb></lb>wich, at the time I paid him his account.</p>

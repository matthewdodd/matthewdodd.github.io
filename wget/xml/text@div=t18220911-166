On the 27th of August, I received 27 s. in copper; I put 2 s. worth in my coat pocket, which hung in the stable, and laid 25 s. worth in a canvass bag on the bin - the prisoner was drinking with me in the stable, and saw the clerk pay me, and saw me put it in the bag; he was with one Whirley. I went out of the stable to water the horses, returned in a quarter of an hour, and the bag was gone. I saw him in the street in about ten minutes, and said,</p>

            . I was sitting in my master's shop right opposite Messrs. White and Co's. stable, and saw the prisoner, another man, and Sawyer drinking a pot of beer. The clerk brought Sawyer his money - the prisoner could see that, and while Sawyer was gone to water his horses, I saw the prisoner go in, and come out with the bag in his hand - he walked up Bushell's-rents; I followed, and then he ran - I told Sawyer, who went after him, and caught him - he denied it.</p>

            . A few minutes after seven o'clock I saw the prisoner not many yards from the stable, running with something which looked like a bag. I saw him put it under a stone. A great many boys cried out that a bag of money was lost - they could not find it; but in the morning when I heard of it, I went and lifted up two stones, and there found the bag of money, which I gave to my father. That produced is the same.</p>

I did not see the girl, the deceased fell upon his back, when he got up I lent him a handkerchief to wipe his mouth, his mouth was cut then, he said he would fight, they fought, Harris was knocked down several times, and the prisoner was knocked down two or three times, they fought about half an hour, the prisoner give in, they then shook hands with one another, the deceased walked to a public-house just by and he had part of a pint of mild beer.

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether your brother did or said any thing to the prisoner before he struck him - A. No. I was ten or twelve yards off him.</p>
               <p>DANIEL STENSON. I am a surgeon and man-midwife.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called in on this Saturday night - A. Yes, about nine o'clock at night, I found the deceased in a state of total insensibility.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it originate from - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any appearance of liquor upon him at all - A. None at all. I found him in a state of insensibility, with symptoms denoting concussion on the brain, the sensation of the pupils of the eye, sickness at the stomach, involuntary discharge of faces in the urine; notwithstanding the employment of every means he continued in a state of insensibility all Monday afternoon about four o'clock, when he expired. Upon examination of the head on Tuesday morning I found a considerable extraversation of blood on the left side of the brain, between the membrane of the brain, the dura pia mater, evidently arising from the rupture of the vessels at the back part of the brain; the brain was perfectly sound in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you form you opinion what caused those consequences - A. From a fall or falls.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you whether, if it had originated from any defect of the brain itself, would the brain have had that appearance - A. No, certainly the substance of the brain would have been alter'd, it would have been coagulated blood from the artery of the brain.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any external wound - A. The lip was cut through, and there was also a cut in the right eye-brow</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Mr. Cooke, another surgeon, opened the brain with you - A. Yes, he is a medical man in the town.</p>

            . Q. You are a surgeon, I believe, at Brentford - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend and examine the deceased - A. Yes, I attended at the request of Mr. Stenson, the surgeon who opened the body. The appearance was extraversation of blood on the left side of the brain, and a preternatural distension of the membrane of the right side of the brain; that is all the unusual appearance that I observed; there was no external marks of violence on the scalp of the back of the head, no fracture of the scull, to the best of my recollection whatever. There was a lacerated wound over the eye-brow, and one on the lip without much contusion.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not have produced that effect upon the brain. - A. Upon my oath I could not declare that they would.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearances that you have described upon the brain, can you take upon yourself to say from what cause it could proceed. - A. Certainly not. I have opened a head, and I have seen others opened, in which blood has been extravasated upon the membrane of the brain as here, as well as in the substance of the brain, without any external violence, and for these reasons I would not positively say that a fall or blow occasioned it. My opinion is, in consequence of the knowledge I have acquired both from opening heads myself, seeing them opened, and from what I have read, that such appearances might have arisen from some particular internal cause as well as from an external cause.</p>
               <p>Q. If this rupture had taken place from any act during the fight, could the person have walked away from the place after the fight, in the manner as described, without any symptom of concussion of the brain. - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I will ask you whether if you thought the injury the boy received at that time, had caused his head to be in the state as you found on examination, whether if the vessel was ruptured at the time, he could have walked home without a symptom of concussion of the brain. - A. I do not think he could have walked home without a symptom.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the sickness at the public house was not a symptom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The sickness has not been proved at the public house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. to Smith. You accompanied the deceased to the public house. - A. Yes; he was very well at the public house; he drank beer with me there, then he walked home, about three hundred yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that beer any effect upon the deceased, did it cause any sickness. - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sick. - A. Yes; I asked him what it was; he said, he believed it was the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. By sickness do you mean that he vomited. - A. Yes, against the chemist's place; that was about ten minutes after he was gone from the public house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. to Mr. Gooke. Was not that symptom that you have just heard, almost a certain symptom of concussion of the brain. - A. Certainly, it is a usual symptom of concussion, but it might arise from another cause.</p>
               <p>Court. Might or might not such appearance as you have described about the brain, arise from a fall on the ground. - A. It might arise from that, I merely accompanied Mr. Stenson to examine the brain. I did not see him till he was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Stenson. Have you the means of knowing how long the lad had been home, before you saw him. - A. About ten minutes, I am not certain; one of the family came for me; when I saw him he was totally insensible, and I saw what he had vomited on the ground; he was in the act of vomiting when I came in; that was on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. How came you to accompany him to the public-house, instead of going home with him. - A. I asked him whether he would have any thing to drink, he said he would; he walked without help to the public-house, and also to his own home, and when he came out again he was taken to bed.</p>

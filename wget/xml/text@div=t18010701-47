               <p>WILLIAM WALKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am the son of John Walker; the prisoner was my father's <rs id="t18010701-47-deflabel261" type="occupation">warehouseman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18010701-47-defend447 t18010701-47-deflabel261"></join>: On Saturday, the 13th of June, I received information from Gandon, in consequence of which I gave him direction: On the Monday morning I went to Mr. Gandon's and found a cask of molasses there, but I cannot say whether it is our's or not, the cooper can speak to that; I examined the warehouse on Sunday, and missed one puncheon of molasses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long has the prisoner been with your father? - A.Five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q.Gandon coopered the hogsheads when they wanted repair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it must have been pretty well known that Gandon maintained an honest, good character? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Suppose you had wanted Gandon to cooper a cask, should you have sent for him to your house, or sent the cask to him? - A. We always send for him.</p>
               <p>- GANDON sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010054"></xptr>Gurney. On Saturday, the 13th of June, the prisoner came to me between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and asked me if I could send three puncheons; I told him, yes, or three dozen, or some such thing; I serve all the puncheons; the prisoner followed me, and said, I am going to send some molasses to your house on Monday morning; I said, yes, as much as you like; I am in the habit of housing sugars for Mr. Walker, but not molasses; he said he should send one puncheon; I informed Mr. Walker of this conversation; on Sunday morning he called at my house, and said, I am going to send out some sugars to-morrow morning, I shall send you the molasses at the same time; I said I should be up at five o'clock, and he said he should send off the sugars at half past five; they accordingly came by Jewell, a carman, about six o'clock, under the crane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose cask that is? - A.That is a cask I had supplied Mr. Walker with; I believe it was one that went in on Saturday, but am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite sure it was one that you had supplied Mr. Walker with? - A. Yes, I am; it contained about ten hundred weight of molasses, it might be more or less.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.This was a full cask? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner knew that you got a good deal of your bread by working for Mr. Walker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He knew that you had always bore the character of an honest man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he make any other application to you, but to leave it at your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it in as you would any other goods of Mr. Walker's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had asked you to assist him in disposing of it, you would have taken him for a thief? - A. I certainly should have had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had housed molasses for Mr. Walker before? - A. I had six or seven years ago, and about two years ago, but they did not come from the sugar-house.</p>
               <p>Q.If he had desired you to conceal it from his master, you would have said he was wrong in supposing you would do it? - A.Something of that sort I should; I thought it was rather odd in Mr. Walker to send a single puncheon.</p>
               <p>Q.The prisoner has borne a good character up to this time? - A. As good a character as any man.</p>

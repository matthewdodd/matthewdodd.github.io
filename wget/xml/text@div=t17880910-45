               <p>The prisoner brought me a bay gelding, on Tuesday the 5th of August, into Sharp's alley, Cow-cross; he asked me a guinea for it, and said he brought it from Croydon, and that the waggon was come to the Bear and Ragged Staff in Smithfield; I told him to fetch me the waggoner and I should be more satisfied that it was his property; he wanted to take the horse with him, but I stopped the horse; I afterwards enquired whether any such waggon was come from Croydon, and I was informed no; I advertised the horse twice, and kept it very nigh a week; I never saw the prisoner before; when he went to fetch the waggoner he did not return; I know no more of this horse; I enquired at the blacksmith's at Streatham, and found out the prosecutor, Mr. Meager, of Norwood Common; the prosecutor came to my house and saw the horse and swore to it; I am sure the prisoner is the man that brought me the horse.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 9th of August, I was sent for by Minshell, to take the prisoner into custody on suspicion of stealing another horse, about a quarter after nine in the morning; hearing there was a horse stopped by Smith, I had him sent for; he came and owned it was the prisoner; when he had confessed where the last horse came from, says I, take the horse with you, by the description of it, may be you will hear from whom the first horse came; there was not a promise or threatening in any respect whatever; he was a long time before he confessed the first horse; but he said he took it from near that same place, and that the man's name was Meager.</p>

               <p>Court to Smith. Was it in consequence of that information that you enquired for Mr. Meager? - Yes, my lord, it was in consequence of what I heard the prisoner say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was the gate shut the evening before? - The gate was shut the evening before, and pinned with a stick, I fastened it myself.</p>
               <p>Jury. Could the horse get out any other way? - I saw no gap he might get over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a slopseller, and live in Houndsditch. The prisoner was in my employ as an articled servant, and has been so for six months—it is part of my business to make up clothes from drill—on the evening of the 4th of June, when I came home, the prisoner met me in the passage in tears, at eleven o'clock at night—he said, "Oh, Sir, a dread<lb></lb>ful thing has happened"—I led him into my sitting-room, and asked him what was the matter—he said, "Oh, Sir, I have been stealing"—I had no knowledge of what had happened at the time—I said nothing to induce him to say any thing—I said he had better state what had happened—that was after he had said he had been stealing—he produced a parcel, which I have here—I gave it to the policeman the following morning, and know it to be mine—there was also a newspaper and a letter in the parcel—the pri<lb></lb>soner handed me the parcel himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Besemeres. I was em<lb></lb>ployed in cutting drill like this on the 3rd and 4th of June—on the 3rd of June, the prisoner laid hold of some drill, and said, "I shall have two yards and a half of this"—it was a similar pattern to this, but drab instead of lavender—my answer was, "Indeed?"—he said, yes, he should—in a moment or two he came round, and began to undo the piece—I said, "Have you got an order?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You had better get your order"—he said, "I will manage that; there is a great deal of over-measure here"—I said, "Who is it for?"—he said, "My brother"—I said, "You must not have the raw material; you must have nothing but what is made up; the governor won't stand that"—he said, "Hold your tongue, I will manage that"—in about an hour and a half, he cut off two yards and a half—I did not see that; but after he went up to tea, I missed the first cut, the fag end—he had no business to cut that at all—the tea-bell had rung—I found he was in his bed-room—I waited until he came down—I said, "Dudley, you have taken that drill"—he did not deny it—I said, "Go and get it, and bring it down stairs"—he said, "Will you hold your <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>?"—I said, "Nothing will satisfy me till</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150016"></xptr>
               <p>you bring it down now, while every thing is quiet, and put it on my board, and I will manage it"—I insisted on its coming down stairs, or to Mr. Besemeres, I must go—he said, "Well, be quiet, I will have my tea, and will bring it down stairs"—he went down to tea, and in about ten minutes brought it down stairs to me in brown paper, from his bed-room, and threw it on my cutting-board—I put it up on the left of me, without undoing it—I went to the principal young man in the house, and ac<lb></lb>quainted him of it—on the 4th of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, he went in the counting-house, and took out a bunch of keys—I did not sec the keys, but I heard them rattle—I was adjoining the counting-house—I suppose he must have seen me—as he went in, he passed behind me—it was not done secretly—I heard the keys rattling—I knew they were the keys of the back premises, where the work-people come in—he took the keys and went out—I sus<lb></lb>pected he was taking something out of the house—I went round to White, and spoke to him—I suspected be had concealed something in the yard—I let every thing be quiet till half-past eight o'clock in the evening when I leave—I missed him from the warehouse half an hour previous, which was three-quarters of an hour before his time—I sus<lb></lb>pected he was getting ready to go out—I went out before him, and waited at the end of the street till he came up—he came out at the private door with a parcel in his hand—that was not the right door to come out at—the par<lb></lb>cel had string round, and was sealed—I went up, and said, "Dudley, what have you there?"—he seemed surprised, and said, "Hold your <hi rend="italic">bother"</hi>—"What is there," I said, "You know what happened yesterday; what is it"—he said, "Only some old newspapers, and nothing else; I am going to send them into the country to my mother" (or brother)—I said "Let me see it, and I shall be satisfied, or worse will come of it"—he said, he would not, and began to swear—I said, "If you do not, I will give you into the hands of a policeman, and what happened yesterday will all come out—I am deter<lb></lb>mined not to part with you till I see all"—he went into a public-house par<lb></lb>lour in Liverpool-street, with a great deal of hesitation, and opened the parcel—I found it was this drill—I said, "What this is newspapers, is it?"—he said, "Hold your <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>—don't kick up a noise, it is only a rem<lb></lb>nant"—I said "This wont do, I shall get in trouble for this"—I called the landlord, and asked him to take care of him, while I went to get the prin<lb></lb>cipal of the house—he said he would not keep the prisoner, but he would keep the stuff—I persuaded the prisoner to go back with me, and he did—I told the young man in his presence what he had done—the clerk went with me to the public-house, and got the stuff, and brought it down to the house—I took it out of the landlord's hands, and gave it to the clerk, who took it to the watch-house—I do not know where he put it, for I left the house, and went home—this was as near nine o'clock as could be—the pri<lb></lb>soner slept in the house, and so did the clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. When he applied to you the day before to cut off some, you would not do it without the order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was on the 3rd, and on the 4th he took this—he said, he would have a piece—I told the Lord Mayor that he said he could manage it, and that it was over-measure, and would not be missed—I said near to the same meaning, but perhaps not in those words—the parcel was directed to his brother—there was a letter and a newspaper in it—he said, it was a bundle of newspapers, I am quite certain—I was once charged with bigamy, but it was proved I was not guilty.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had the privilege of having goods at cost-price, which was allowed all the young men—I cut off the goods to send to my brother, on receiving a letter from him between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, by a friend, who was to leave London at five o'clock next morning—I had to take it to Holbom after business that evening—I made up my mind to send him these trowsers—Mr. Besemeres not being at home I could not ask him for an order for it, but I intended to ask him for an order, and pay for it next day—I had plenty of money, and did not want to steal it.</p>

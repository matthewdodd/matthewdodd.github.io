            . I belong to the Thames Police. I heard the alarm, and turned into Water-street; I found the prisoner in custody of a brother officer - I went up, and the prisoner dropped this shawl from his person, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me drop it? A. I did, I was not a yard from you; that was about three hundred yards from where the prosecutrix lost it - she had not come up then.</p>

            . I heard the alarm, saw the prisoner run, and I took him; he said, "My tar, if you will make it all right for me, I will give you two sovereigns;" I had him by the collar, and he had his hand behind him, but I did not see him drop the shawl - I found a pair of scissors on him, and a watch-key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I say to you? A. You said you had lately come from sea, and had 4l. 15s. in your captain's hands, and you would give me two sovereigns; you said you were running after the man that stole the shawl, but there was no one near you; there was no one in the street but you - there had been some rioting just before, and the people followed them.</p>

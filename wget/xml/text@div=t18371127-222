                  </hi>. On Tuesday morning, the 31st of October, about seven o'clock, I was under an arch of the Greenwich Railway—it was raining—I saw Worbey there with Mr. Humphery's wagon—I knew him before by sight—I believe he had lived with Mr. Golding, but he came into Mr. Humphery's service—he said, "I suppose you are, like me, standing out of the weather?" I said, "Yes"—Pennington then came up to speak to him—I did not hear what they said, as they spoke low—Pennington asked me if I was hired—I said, "No"—he then said, "How much will you charge to take two pockets of hops by the King's Bench?—I said, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Worbey said, "We will give it to him"—Pennington then took of my horse's head to shove it off—I asked where he was going to them—he said, "Off the wagon"—I said if he was going to load them off the wagon he might take them himself, I would have nothing to do with do with it—I knew it was Mr. Humphery's wagon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman at Hayes's wharf, in the employ of Mr. Alderman John Humphery. On Monday night, I helped to load 113 pockets of hops marked "Isaac Simmonds"—I saw part of them put on—were to be taken to W. Noakes and Co. Weston-street—Worbey was to them—we missed three of those that were marked on the following day.</p>

On the evening of 27th January, I was in Long-lane, Smithfield, and received some information, which induced me to go into Charterhouse-street—I there saw Mrs. Parker, sitting on the ground, with her back against the wall of the house, No. 21—I spoke to her, and in consequence of what she said, I sent for an officer—she made a complaint against some one, in answer to my questions—the other officer took her to St. Bartholomew's hospital, and I went up stairs into the front room of No. 21, and found the prisoner there—there was a chair thrown upside down, near the window, and a candlestick upside down on the table—the window was wide open—on a table, against a door leading to the bed-room,</p>

Charterhouse-street, in the first-floor front room—between 6 and 7, some words took place between us—we were quarrelling, and he frightened me, and I opened the window and jumped out—he brought a hopper in with him, which he had just sharpened—I don't suppose he brought it in with the intention of hurting me, but he said he would not mind chopping me any more than he would chopping ten pigs down, and that frightened me—he had the chopper in his hand at the time—I was standing against the window, and I opened it momentarily and jumped out—he was standing near the table, close by the door—I could not get to the door without passing him, or I should have done so—I did not think of hurting myself when I opened the window, of course—the table is 4 feet 6 inches or 4 feet 8 inches long—one end of it was near the window—there was room for me to stand between the table and the window—he was standing up at the end of the table at the time he spoke to me about chopping the pigs down—I was taken to the hospital after I was picked up from the pavement, and have been there ever since; five weeks to day.</p>

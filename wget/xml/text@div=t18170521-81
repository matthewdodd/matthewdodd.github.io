            . I was at home on the 25th of April-the lower part of the house is a counting-house, we keep the rest of it. The articles stated in the indictment were taken from the room on the first-floor, out of the closet, which was not locked - I had seen them safe an hour before. I was in the kitchen, which is two stories under the first-floor, and heard some glass break, and ran up stairs. I heard the silver fall on the floor, and a cry of Stop thief! and found the prisoner in my daughter's custody - I had not been in the room for an hour before; the street-door is open all day - I do not know whether the room-door was closed, or not. We have no lodgers; my husband is a merchant. I stopped the prisoner myself - He turned round and asked me what was the matter, and said he had got none of my property; he fell down on his knees, and wanted me to let him go.</p>
               <p>CAROLINE MOSS. I am the daughter of the last witness. I was in the two-pair-of-stairs room; I heard the glass break. I had been in the room a very short time before-the door was open. I came down stairs, and saw the prisoner coming out of the dining-room - He was quite a stranger to me. He said "how do you do?" and went down stairs; I followed him down to let him out, thinking it was some person come to my father. I did not suspect him. As he was going down I saw a spoon sticking out at his collar, which made me suspect him. I called out Stop thief! and pursued him, still calling out; he got out of the door - I only lost sight of him for a moment; I am quite sure he is the man whom I saw coming out of the room; he had two keys about him when he was stopped. My mother came; he was searched - I saw the articles stated in the indictment fall from him as he ran out; he let them fall on the mat-they were buttoned up in his coat. I am quite certain he is the man - He opened his coat, and they fell from him.</p>

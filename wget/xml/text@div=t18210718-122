On the 20th of June, the prisoner came there, and enquired for a situation. I asked if a pot-boy's place would suit him - he said, Yes, thanked me, and went down stairs. He came up in a few minutes, and said he had a waistcoat to sell, and wanted me to buy it. I refused. He offered it to me for 3 s. Seeing he was so distressed, I gave him a shilling in part of it - he was to come for the rest a little after seven o'clock. When he went away the first time I looked out and saw a suspicious man, with a bundle, waiting outside, which made me suspect the waistcoat was stolen, and I followed them to Gee's-court, where they offered something for sale - this made me suspect something. I lost them. I went to Marlborough-street, and then went home, but missed nothing until towards evening, when we missed these things. I went to the shop in Marylebone-lane, where I saw them go, and asked if they had such things - they said No, but I found the ring-handles. The boy said he bought them with other metal. I asked to see it, and it was my other things.</p>

            . At the time this happened, I lived in Marylebone-lane. My father kept an old-iron shop; the prisoner came with another boy, rather bigger than himself, on the 20th of June, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and brought some old brass, I gave him eight-pence or nine-pence for it, at 5 d. per lb. - it was the articles stated in the indictment; I gave the money to the prisoner, I think.</p>

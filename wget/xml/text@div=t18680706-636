                  </hi>. I am an engineer, at 17, Eleanor Street, Woolwich—on 26th January, I was on a steamer returning to Woolwich—as the passengers were landing, I stood at the left side of the gangway—I felt a touch at my watch, and looked down, and saw it in the prisoner's hands—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at him, and caught him by the coat—he had plenty of opportunity of passing the watch away—it was worth about six guineas—I gave him in custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the prisoner's husband been a customer of yours? A. I had seen him about twice in the shop, but she always purchased- some of the soles which I had marked had been sold, but not more than three or four pair - my shopman is here - my wife sometimes attends the shop in my absence; she might have sold some of those marked soles; she is not here.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the Paul's Head from Mr. Torey's? A. About five minutes' walk; she had this piece of leather openly in her hand - her husband was taken on another charge, and the bill was thrown out.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Torey - on the 30th of November the prisoner came between eight and nine o'clock - I served her with one pair of soles, but I do not know which of these it was - I did not know there was any mark on any of them - I was behind the counter - I went away to weigh the soles she bought, leaving about two dozen pair of soles of this sort on the counter - I did not miss any after she was gone - I had no suspicion at all - I had heard Mrs. Torey say he missed some.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Did not your master let you into the secret of his marking the soles? Q. No; I served them just as they came out of the drawer - I sold soles when my master and Mrs. Torey were not there - I did not miss any soles.</p>

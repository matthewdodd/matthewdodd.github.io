            . I lost a harrow and some iron tynes. I had set the harrow up against the stable wall, and I never saw the harrow any more till I saw it in a field near two miles from my house, and the tynes were found at Teddington.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I had some reason for it; and upon that I got a search-warrant to search his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing there?</p>

               <p>Leyton. Nothing at all, my Lord. Soon after I had word brought me, that they were sold at Teddington to Mr. Fry, the blacksmith. I went over the next day, and asked him, if he had bought any harrow tynes, and would let me see them. He shewed me them, and there was one that I knew by a particular mark. [He produced it, and swore to it.] He said he bought them of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you then?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I got a warrant to take him up; but he was in custody before for some assault.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the prisoner's counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the first search of the prisoner's house, when there was a distress made for 9 s.</p>
               <p>Leyton. No, it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was in custody for an assault?</p>
               <p>Leyton. The constable told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of searching this man's house, was there not a great deal of money found there?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the keys of the prisoner's doors when he was taken from home?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I think I have heard the constable had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, at whose expence is this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Leyton. At my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you declared, that the expence of this prosecution was to be defrayed out of the money found at the prisoner's? Pray recollect.</p>
               <p>Leyton. I believe I have been told so; but I never proceeded upon that footing.</p>

               <p>Q. When the last witness went to inquire about it, did you own the having bought such things, and offer to deliver them when he told you they were his?</p>
               <p>Fry. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say, that all of it was his?</p>
               <p>Fry. No, my Lord. He said he would not swear to any but that one; and that he would positively swear to.</p>

            , did not you say you could not exactly tell when you bought them?</p>
               <p>Fry. I don't know but I might then?</p>
               <p>Q. Are not other tynes liable to such an accident as to have such mark whereby he said he knew that tyne?</p>
               <p>Fry. He ought to know whether it was his or not.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came, did he make any scruple to tell you who he was, and where he lived?</p>
               <p>Fry. He very readily told me.</p>
               <p>Jos. Wilkins. I came to live with my master in November.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the harrow spoken of.</p>
               <p>Wilkins. About a fortnight before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish and swear to any of the tynes in the harrow?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fry. What is the value of that tyne?</p>
               <p>Fry. About a peny.</p>
               <p>Q. to Leyton. Had you any money of the prisoner's in your hands at any time?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I never had.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think of getting a search-warrant for the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Leyton. Because I had always a mistrust of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner called upon to ask the witnesses any questions.</p>
               <p>He said one Clements owed him 16 s. and he let him have that old iron; which he told Mrs. Fry when he sold it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner ever used to lend money?</p>
               <p>Saxton. He has lent me 20 s. which I paid him honestly again; and he lent my wife 20 s. upon a gold ring.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of Great Cumberland-street. About three o'clock on the morning of the 9th of December, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor pass by me - the prosecutor seemed very much intoxicated, and the prisoner was supporting him along; in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoner run by on the other side of the street, and the prosecutor came running as well as he could after him without a coat - he cried Stop thief! I went after the prisoner, and saw him taken in Oxford-street. As I went behind him, he dropped this glove, which I picked up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had I the coat when I passed you? A. You had something dark under your arm, which appeared to be a coat.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at the corner of Old Quebec-street. I heard the alarm, and the rattles - the prisoner ran by me in Oxford-street. I followed, and saw him drop this coat - while I took it up he gained ground on me; he was stopped at the corner of Park-lane. The prosecutor came up in his shirt sleeves - he was intoxicated but he knew his coat immediately.</p>

I live at Maida-hill; I was in London the 9th of December - I was very much intoxicated - I can remember losing my coat, and seeing a man run away with it - I cried Stop thief! and the prisoner was taken. I cannot pretend to say how he got my coat off.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been with a person up the Edgware-road - it rained fast, and I ran to get home. - I heard the cry of Stop thief! and the watchman said,"If you don't stop, I will knock you down?" I know nothing of the coat nor the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was never guilty of such a thing in my life; that man and another came and wanted to buy some halfpence, and I sold them to him by weight; I have got a witness to prove that I sold them by weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Griffiths.) Q.Among the halfpence you took from Head, which he said he had from the prisoner, you found four shillings loose, not in paper? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the name of your neighbour, who has bought eight hundred weight? - A. Mr. Martin, four doors from my own house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

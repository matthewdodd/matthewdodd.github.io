I felt their hands about my fob, pulling my fob open; I had not power to call I was so frightened, they held me I suppose for the course of a minute and a half, they pulled me about very much, and tore my breeches open, and took three guineas and nine shillings out of my fob; in the scuffle I saw a man stand at some distance, who it was I cannot say; he called out come along Price, in the instant they all went away; I was so terrified I had no power to speak, nor to follow them, some people came past and I said be so kind as to go up this court; this woman came out of this court; I have been robbed by one or two men, some went up the court with me and we went into the house, we asked what woman came out of that house, out of which I saw the woman come? several people answered, that there was nobody went out of that house but Bet Cope; I told them I had been robbed by that woman and I should be glad to know whereabouts I could find her; they seemed to make a laugh and joke of me, and I went away; I went immediately up Petticoat-lane and I heard of a constable, I applied to him, he was not at home, I left word where I lived, No. 93, East Smithfield; accordingly the next morning the constable came down to my house where I live, and him and Mr. Dawson went and took the two prisoner's; Mr. Dawson and I was at the justice's and laid the information against them, we did not take the man till the Saturday following; we took the woman up the Tuesday following in the evening.</p>

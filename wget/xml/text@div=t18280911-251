Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the night of the 23d of May I was coming from Duke-street across Smithfield to the East-side; I met two females near the Bear and Raggedstaff - they caught hold of each arm, and said "We have got you now, we will not let you go without you give us some gin;" I tried to get away, but could not - I then gave them a glass of gin each - I did not have any myself; we remained but a very short time in the house - they then turned into Smithfield - I remained a minute or two at the door, and said, "Now for Clerkenwell;" the prisoner and another man were there - the prisoner said to me, "You live in Clerkenwell;" I said, yes - he said, "You are not far from it;" I said, I know it - I looked at him, thinking he was a neighbour, and we went on together towards Bath-street, where I live - we crossed the way towards Cow-cross, and I turned up <placeName id="t18280911-251-crimeloc1290">Peter's-lane</placeName>

I seized my money out of my pocket into my hand - there were six sovereigns and twelve shillings; I tried to save myself, but could not- I was thrown down, and the prisoner seized my hand, and said, "You b-g-r let go;" I was obliged to let go, and he received the money into his left hand - he turned back my hand, and took it; I saw it as plain as I see you now - I never saw my hat afterwards; the prisoner went off to my right-hand: I called Watch! and at length one came from St. John's-lane - I told him I had been robbed - I did not go back the same way, as I thought it might be worse for me; we went up St. John's-lane - I am certain the prisoner is the person: my eyes were fixed on him several times in walking along, when we came to a gaslight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many gaslights did you pass? A. I do not know; the young ladies turned into Smithfield - I had not seen them before; I did not take any of the gin myself; I had been drinking two or three pints of beer, but no spirits; I was not considered tipsy when the watchman came up, nor I should think the worse for liquor; the prisoner was not taken up till the 1st of September; I gave information on the 31st of August - I did say that I had been treating two women, and I might be a little tipsy; Phillips asked me if I knew the person that robbed me, and I said I did not - he is not a particular friend of mine; I borrowed a hat of him, and called on him a fortnight afterwards and paid him for it - he asked me if I had had this person apprehended; I told him No, but I could have him apprehended at any time; the reason I did not have him apprehended was, he was a character so well known - he was out of the way; I was taken ill, and could not go through such a fatigue: I mean I had not got his name and place of abode. On Saturday, the 6th of September, I called again on Phillips; I told him I had been to Hatton-garden Office, and had parties apprehended for this robbery; I think he asked if they were the parties I had been speaking about before, but I did not say "No, it was a neighbour of mine" - I am quite sure I did not tell him they were not the same parties I was speaking about before; I said the watchman knew the prisones, and he gave me the first intimation, knowing the prisoner and one of the women passing his beat repeatedly, but he did not know the prisoner's name; I will not positively say whether I said it was upon the watchman's information that I took this man up.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night in question I saw the prosecutor in Smithfield, between ten and eleven o'clock, just below the Bull's Head public-hose - the prisoner was with him; I passed them from my beat - the prosecutor was very much in liquor; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110140"></xptr>where he was going - he said to Clerkenwell; I said, "This is the way," and I passed him off my beat; the prisoner said they were going to Clerkenwell; I did not take any more notice of them that night, but the next night the prosecutor came and told me he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. I do not know that I had seen him before; I had no knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? A. Yes: I never saw him in company before.</p>
               <p>Q. Company or not, had you not seen him? A. Not till after the robbery; I saw him after the robbery a few days; it may be a week or two.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen him several times since? A. Yes; he did not say he was the person who had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you he was the man who had been with him? A. Yes; he mentioned that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew he stated that the prisoner was the man who robbed him - did you tell him you had seen the prisoner repeatedly? A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take him up? A. He gave me no order to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know the prisoner before? A. I had seen him once or twice before.</p>

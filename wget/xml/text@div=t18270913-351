I laid four half-crowns, some shillings and sixpences on the counter, for a gentleman- the prisoner came in, and stood close to the gentleman - he was having some rum and water. I went to another part of the counter, to give another person change, and the gentleman asked for his change, which I thought he had taken up, and immediately I said some one had taken it, he went out, leaving half his liquor - I stopped Proudfoot, who was taken to the watch-house; the prisoner was brought there afterwards - it was about a quarter-past ten o'clock; he confessed it to the Alderman.</p>

            . I was at Gurney's wine-vaults; the money laid on the counter, near where the prisoner and I stood; I went out; Crisp came after me, and charged me with taking it, and took me to the watch-house; I had some money of my own, but not theirs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not go voluntarily with you to the watch-house, to see you righted? A. Yes; I accused him of it - he denied it, but went to the watch-house quietly - there were eight or ten other people there.</p>

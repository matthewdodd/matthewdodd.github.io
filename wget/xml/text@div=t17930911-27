               <p>Q. Was you present when these ornaments were found on the prisoner? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this matter of your own knowledge, or who does? - I know nothing of the matter myself, I know them to be my daughter's.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house were they? - I believe in her bed chamber; this studd is my own, I lost it about two months since, a week after my daughter set off for Scotland, I wore it myself, I see it at the end of July, or the beginning of August, I lost it from upon my table in my closet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the prisoner was apprehended, that you saw the stud? - I never had any suspicions of the man, I had him about six months with me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer? - About eight days? he took papers besides these things, and the lock was broke, and the prisoner menaced me to assassinate me.</p>

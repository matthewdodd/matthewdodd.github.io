             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner, and I know the prosecutor's house; I remember the prisoner working for my master at daily work, plaistering, and a little painting, or any thing he required; that morning I was alarmed with the cry of thieves, by the watchmen, and went down, and took charge of the prisoner, and the watchman gave me a padlock that he had taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- HARWOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>This padlock I found upon the prisoner, on Sunday morning about one, as I was crying the hour in Mason's-yard, I catched him, and searched him, but no key was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140020"></xptr> to be found; the prisoner was creeping in upon his belly, all but his ancles; I was crying the hour down Duke-street, and through Mason's-yard, I saw the prisoner in Mr. Hutchinson's house.</p>
               <p>Was he trying to get in at any other door? - That I cannot say, but the hinges were broke, where he was trying to get in, it was a room that contained property, I seized him by the feet, and dragged him out, and then I collared him, and went and alarmed the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Was that padlock on the outside of the door? - Yes, I saw it hang upon the staple at twelve.</p>
               <p>Did you know it was locked at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you try it? - I did, and it was fast then, and at one, when I was calling my round, I found the door open, and the man upon his belly.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you the key of the padlock? - Yes, I have it, but it is at home.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the padlock? - Yes, I am sure it is the padlock that was on my outer door, and I believe my man knows it to be so.</p>
               <p>Have you any means of saying that that padlock was fast on the night of the robbery? - I am sure it was in the day, about four to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Fullwell. I remember it being fast in the day, but I cannot say how it was at night.</p>
               <p>Had you unfastened it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Hutchinson. Had you ever unfastened it at any time after, the day you locked the door? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten it with the key? - I locked it with the key, I left it at home.</p>
               <p>About four you say? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Fullwell. It was about three or four.</p>
               <p>Court to Harwood. You was saying that the prisoner was all but his ancles in the outer room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what means could he get into the other room, all but his ancles? - There was a kind of a bit of shutter, and he dragged that in; I cannot explain what the fastening was, it was a kind of a shed, where he was endeavouring to get into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This was a shutter that I fastened at the bottom with two burt hinges on the outside, the top was fastened with a pulley to the rope on the inside, so that nobody can get in at it; and he had forced the bottom of the shutter from the hinge that remained, and part of the shutter, had got that down, and was getting into the back house where my property principally is.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you are not satisfied of this offence being fully compleat, as it is a capital offence, to be sure it is your province to judge of the case, and as the account that has been given is a very puzzling and perplexing one, you may acquit the prisoner.</p>

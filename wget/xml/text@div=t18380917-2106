                  </hi>. I live on Holborn-hill, and am a clerk. About eleven o'clock, on the 3rd of September, I was at the fair at Smithfield—I saw the prisoner there—I received information from the officer—I felt my pocket, and found I had lost my handkerchief—I turned round, and found the prisoner in possession of the officer, with my handkerchief in his hand—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patrol of Farringdon-ward. I was on duty in the fair, about half-past ten o'clock—I saw the prisoner following a gentleman he came to a lady and gentleman, and took a handkerchief from the lady's pocket—at last he came to the prosecutor, and took this handkerchief out—I immediately collared him—he took his hat off, and I saw four hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs in it—as I held him he drew a pocket-book from his right-hand pocket, and threw it away—I called to some gentlemen to take it up, but they did not—he then put his hand down to his left pocket, and got a purse out—I tried to get it, but it was got away by some one.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

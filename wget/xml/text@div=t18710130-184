                  </hi>. I am employed by the Solicitor to the Treasury, in Mint cases—on 7th January I was with Fife, and other officers, in Black-friars Road, and pointed the prisoner out to Fife—when he get under the archway of Blackfriars Bridge, Fife seized him, and said that he had received instructions to take him in custody, as he was suspected of having counter<lb></lb>feit coin—he struggled very violently, and I saw him take his closed hands from both pockets, and drop a packet containing ten half-crowns, wrapped separately, with tissue paper between them—the officers took from his other hand a packet, which fell on the ground—it contained nine bad half-crowns similarly wrapped up—I said "Harry, what name are you going to give now? I need not tell you ray name; I have received instructions from the Treasury to look after you as dealing in counterfeit coin"—I asked where he lived—he said that he had no fixed home—he first gave his name Chandler, and afterwards Johnson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live at 15, Trevor Square, Brompton—on Saturday evening, 9th January, about 8 o'clock, I was in one of the avenues of the New Meat Market—I felt something, turned round and saw the prisoner, he was looking that way (aside) and performing on my pocket—I looked down immediately, and saw the prisoner snap the bow of my watch off, and he ran away with the watch—I pursued him, and overtook him about forty yards off; some person had stopped him—my watch was afterwards shown to me at the station, in about a quarter of an hour—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

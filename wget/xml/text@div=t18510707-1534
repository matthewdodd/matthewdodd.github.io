                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Taylor, we live at Wandsworth, near the South Western Railway. The prisoner lived two doors from me, with his wife, Elizabeth Eastwood—I have been there four or five years, and they between five and six years—on 4th June, between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, I was hanging out my clothes in the yard, which is common to all the houses in the row, and heard Mrs. Eastwood swearing very much at him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070119"></xptr>
               <p>and b—ring him (she had been away for three weeks, and had been at home about a fortnight)—he said, "You promised when you came back to behave yourself; you don't call this behaving yourself, do you?"—in three or four minutes I heard a bit of a scuffle, and I heard the deceased's eldest child call out, "O father, you have killed mother!"—he has two children by Elizabeth Eastwood, and two by a former marriage—I went to the back-door, got into the house, and saw the prisoner coming towards the house with the youngest child in his arms, which is three or four years old—I asked him what was the matter with the children—he said he did not know—I went into the front-room, and saw Elizabeth Eastwood lying on the floor on her back, with a chair towards her feet—I asked her, in the prisoner's presence, what was the matter; she said Mr. Eastwood had stabbed her—he said she had run against the knife—I saw a knife on the table with the supper things—Mrs. Staples, a neighbour, came in after me—the prisoner carried his wife up-stairs, and Mrs. Staples and me went up after him—he put her on the bed, kissed her, and said, "God bless you, I hope you will do well"—we undressed her before the surgeon came—her stays were cut through, and beneath the cut there was a wound about three inches below her left breast, and blood on her breast.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of Wandsworth, and live within two doors of the prisoner and the deceased—on this evening, I heard the children screaming, and went out—I went into the house, with Mrs. Taylor, by the back-door—before I went in, I heard the prisoner say, "Speak to me, speak to me, once more"—the children said, "Mother cannot speak, she is dead; you have killed my mother"—I went into the front-room, and found the deceased lying on the floor—she looked up, and said, "Oh, Mrs. Staples, my husband has stabbed roe to the heart"—I said, "Oh, Eastwood! you have killed your wife"—he said, "I hope not; but do what you can for her"—I stooped down, and said, "What is the matter?"—she said, "He has done it at last; he has stabbed me to the heart"—he then said she had done it her<lb></lb>self—I asked him to help me to raise her up—she said, "It is under my left breast"—I took her things off one shoulder, and then she bled very freely indeed—he carried her up-stairs, kissed her, and said he hoped she would do well.</p>

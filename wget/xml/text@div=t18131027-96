I lost these shoes and boots from the first week in December, till the 27th. From information I got an officer, and searched the prisoner, Jeffreys's, apartment, No. 13, Knightsbridge; I enquired of Jeffreys for the shoes my servant had sent her, that was stolen; she denied all knowledge that any thing come whatever. I told her my information was so correct, and if she did not deliver up the property I would give her in charge of the officer. She then said, that she had but one half of the room to herself, and another person had the other half, her name was Athlick; she was not at home. I saw a box in the room with Robert Jeffreys upon it, on a plate; she said, it was her husband's box, but she had lent it to the other woman, for her use. The officer broke that box open, and the contents of that box were the articles stated in the indictment. Mrs. Jeffreys said, she knew nothing of the goods in the box, they did not being to her. The officer searched the bed, and found a pair of boots. There<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270060"></xptr>was another box in the room; Jeffreys said, that was her box; I searched that box; in it was a pair of jean shoes, my property. She said my servant had made her a present of them the preceding day, and in searching the box, I found another pair of shoes; by this time Mrs. Athlick came in; she said, she brought away thirteen pair of shoes when she called at my house, my servant gave them to take to Jeffreys. The officer took the property and the prisoners, to Marlborough-street office, and left them there. He came to my house; I asked my servant if she knew any thing of the property; she denied all knowledge. I told her I had been to a house in Knightsbridge, and found the property, and her accomplices were in custody; she said, she had taken the goods, and sent them to Jeffreys.</p>

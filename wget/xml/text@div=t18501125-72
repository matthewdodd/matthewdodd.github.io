                  </hi>. I keep the Hotel de 1' Europe, 15 and 16, Leicester-place. The prisoner was in my employ up to 19th Nov., when he left, having given me notice on the 12th—he asked me if I would allow him to leave his box for a few days, and I did so—on 22nd Nov. I met him in Leicester-street, with three men, and I said I was sorry to see him in such company, and desired him to come and fetch his box at once—he followed me with his companions to the house, and the waiter brought up the box, when my wife, in the whole presence, said, "Stop that box; I have reason to suspect this man, I will have it searched"—the prisoner objected to that, and called help from his friends, and placed the box off the premises, and said, "It is out now," and struggled to get it away—I helped to pull it inside, and his friends said the best thing he could do was to call, "Police!" and "Murder!"—the police were called, and arrived—the box was then in our possession, inside the bar, and the police</p>

               <p>shut the door immediately, and the prisoner was shut out—the policeman asked me what was the matter—the prisoner was let in, and I said I wished to have the box searched—the policeman said, "you can find no objection to your master's searching your box; if you know it is all right, why should you object?"—he said, "I do not wish it to be searched here, it must be searched in a proper place"—I did not know what he meant, and said, "You had better have it searched quietly; why should you object?" he said, "My character"—I said his character would be as good as it was before, if everything was right; he had better have it searched, it would not go further: and after a little conversation, he acceded to it—he was asked for the keys, and said, "I have not got them"—I said, "Where are they?" and he said, "I will go and fetch them"—he went out of the house, and in a few minutes came back without them—he then went out again, and came back with them—he uncorded and unlocked the box—he pulled out a coat, and under it lay a cruet-stand of mine—he said, "Halloo! who puts this here"—I said it was better known to him, and said I would not drop the matter, he must go to the station; and told the policeman so—while in my employ, it was his business to clean the plate twice a week—this cruet-stand was not in use then, it was put by for the winter season, because there is not enough business to employ them all.</p>

               <p>with his own money, and afterwards collected it from the customer—I was fined for that, and was told that if I had "free vintner" over my door, it would not occur; sol borrowed the name of Mattheson, who l was told was a free vintner, and who had a room in my house; but it is the law that he must reside in the house, and I was fined 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—they did not know how to catch me, and they got some officers, dressed as travellers, with boxes full of luggage, and one of them spoke French; and they ordered rum of the waiter, which was fetched from a public-house, and no money was asked for, to fetch it—those are the only charges that have been made against me.</p>

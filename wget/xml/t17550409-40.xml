               <p>On Sunday the 23d of March, my turnkey came to me, and said to me, if you will have a little patience, there is a fine scheme going forwards; upon which I told him I would. He told me Winifred Farrel, then a prisoner, was dressed in a disguise, mussled up, and a straw hat in her hand, and people along with her. I told him to take no notice; but if he found her going out, to stop her, and the rest that were with her, and call out; which he did, and I came and helped to secure the two Duffeys;

They went into the tap-room to Farrel; after they had been there together two hours, I wanted to go and see the prisoners, then Farrel sat at the end of the table, with a yellow bed-gown on, the same that Golden came in with, and Golden had her gown on, and Farrel had a hat and cloak tied over her eyes; it began to grow late, and my master ordered me to lock up; then I called out, as usual, All strangers! I opened the gate, and out went the three men, and Farrel; Jordan was much in liquor, he followed Farrel, and gave her a shove; I went to push her back, turned them all together, secured them all, and locked them in again. Farrel's face was hid, I could see no more of it than if she had a sack about her head, she had a handkerchief about her mouth.</p>

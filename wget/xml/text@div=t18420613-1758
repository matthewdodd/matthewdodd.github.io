                  </hi>. I am one of the enquiries of Her Majesty, and was in attendance on Her Majesty when she went out on Monday, the 30th of May—in accompanying Her Majesty on her drives, I generally ride behind the hind wheel of her carriage, about five yards in the rear of Her Majesty; about five yards behind the carriage—there is another equerry besides myself, in attendance occasionally, but not always—not one of the Queen's equerries, but one of Prince Albert'—I ride behind, or on one side, just as it happens—I had received some in<lb></lb>formation previous to leaving the Palace, on the 30th of May, which in<lb></lb>duced me to alter my place of riding that day, and I rode as close to the side of the Queen as I could make my horse go by the side of the car<lb></lb>riage—Colonel Wylde, Prince Albert's equerry, was in attendance, and rode on the other side—he also rode by the side of the carriage—on re<lb></lb>turning from the drive, and coming down Constitution-hill, between sir and seven o'clock in the evening, about half-way down the hill, I observed the prisoner, on the carriage reaching him, take a pistol from his side, and fire it in the direction of the Queen; as quickly as I could, I pulled up my horse, and gave the prisoner in charge of a policeman who was stand<lb></lb>ing by his side—the prisoner had, before he fired, caught my attention, as</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between twelve and sixteen paces behind the carriage—just as Her Majesty's carriage got past the pump, I saw him take two or three paces from the pump towards the wall nearest Buckingham Palace gardens—I saw him hold his arm out, and directly after saw the flash of the pis<lb></lb>tol, and heard the report—the pistol was directed towards her Majesty's carriage—I saw the fire, and heard the report—I have been in the army about eighteen months, or rather better—I have had experience in firing ball as well as blank cartridges.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We want to know whether the pistol fired from the place where the prisoner was, although only loaded with wadding and powder well rammed down, as it fired at such a distance from the Queen that it might pro<lb></lb>duce bodily harm to the Queen, or wound her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is it most have produced injury to the Queen, even though only rammed down with gunpowder and wadding at the top of it.</p>

I am equerry to his Royal Highness Prince Albert, I accompanied the Queen on Monday, the 30th of May—her Majesty went out in an open carriage, that will not shot up, and sat on the right-hand side—in the route from the Palace towards Constitution-hill there is a wall on the left-hand side—it is the wall of the Palace garden—there is a space between the wall and the carriage road—I should think the space is six or eight yards from the wall to the carriage road, including the foot-path—there are several trees there—there is the carriage road, and on the other side a foot-path, and the iron railing inclosing the Green Park—I saw the prisoner after he fired—he fired on the Queen's side, on the right-hand side—she was returning to the palace at the time—it was on the right-hand side of the carriage—her Majesty was in the same situa<lb></lb>tion in the carriage in returning home as when she went out—she had not changed her position—anybody who had seen her go out might expect her in coming back to be on the wall side—she always sits on that side of the carriage—I was riding as nearly as possible abreast of the Royal carriage, on the near side—a communication had been made to me, which induced me to keep very near the carriage during that time—the first thing that attracted my attention was a sharp report of a pistol—I pulled up short on that report, turned round to my right, and saw the prisoner—the carriage had then passed a few yards, going at the rapid pace it was—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner, with his hand down, and something in it—a policeman almost im<lb></lb>mediately seized him, and a guardsman on the other side—I rode up to him, and desired them to bring him to the porter's lodge at the Palace, that I might examine him, or see him examined—I saw the pistol—(<hi rend="italic">Inspector Rusell here produced a pistol</hi>)—. this is it—it was taken from him in my presence, by the policeman—I am able to recognize it again—I have not a doubt of its being the pistol.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not know whether yon are acquainted with this sort of fire-arm, how far it would carry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes, it depends much on the elevation, but it would carry fifty or sixty paces—it might be made to carry more—it depends on the elevation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it as dangerous when discharged as a larger one might be at the distance it was fired? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, at a short distance—so good an aim could not be taken with it as with a larger one, hot at a short distance it is as destructive as a larger one—I cannot state exactly how far the prisoner was from the Queen at the time it was fired, as I was on the opposite side of the carriage—a pace is thirty inches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the distance of about seven feet would the wadding even of the pistol, if well runned down, be competent to do any personal mischief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, any exposed part of the person, if it was wounded, and it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130042"></xptr>
               <p>would be very likely to set fire to the dress; but it would decidedly wound the skin, or any part only covered with thin muslin it might wound—it was a very sharp loud report for such a pistol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form any judgment whether it had anything in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>. No further than from the sharpness of the report—it must have had some<lb></lb>thing to compress the powder strongly to induce it to make such a report, either very strong wadding, or a bullet—something to compress the powder very considerably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it had not a bullet, but an irregular piece of lead or metal, was the pistol competent to do mischief in that way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly, or if a stone, either round or of an irregular shape, had been in it—from what I heard of the report, in my judgment, the powder certainly must have been well runned down with something—I saw the prisoner searched—an empty pocket-book, and some powder screwed up very tight in paper, and some trifling things were found on him—nothing else of any moment—I think there was a penny or twopence found on him—he did not appear much excited, very firm, I thought; I observed some agitation about his lip and nose—I asked his name, where he lived, and what he was, but he remained silent—he gave no answer whatever—I took him through the palace to the equerries' door in Pimlico, and, accompanied by inspector Russell, saw him put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the guardsman and policeman, and conveyed to Gardener's-lane station-house—I accompanied him on horse back, and in the cell I star him stripped and better searched than he was before, and there I left him—the policeman put some questions to him there—he merely stated that he had a father and mother alive, also brothers and sisters, and that he lived about two miles off—he would not tell where, nor say anything else.</p>

On the afternoon of the 30th of May I was on duty on Constitution-hill—I was there for about an hour and ten minutes before the Queen returned to the palace—I observed the prisoner there about half an hour before the Queen returned—he was just in the middle part of Constitution-hill—I was ten or twelve yards from him, and saw him go behind a tree to hide himself, as I was looking at him. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From something you observed, had your attention been attracted to him so as to be looking at him particularly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was looking down the hill, saw him standing back, and saw him <hi rend="italic">go</hi> behind a tree—he was locking at me at the time, at least he appeared so—he was about a yard</p>

               <p>from me when the Queen came—as the Queen was passing, I heard the report of a pistol—my eye was not actually on the prisoner at that time—I then looked around—he was standing a little in the rear of me—he was leaning over a plug which they draw the water from, with his left hand, and standing just in this way with a pistol in his hand—I seized him—he was holding the pistol towards the carriage—I did not see him till I heard the report, and when I turned round, it was a little towards the carriage—I took the pistol from him—inspector Russell searched him.</p>

I was in the park on Constitution-hill, on the day in question—I was there at half-past five o'clock—I was waiting there to see the Queen come back from her ride—I saw the prisoner soon after I got there, soon after half-past five—he was walking up and down with a young man, behind the trees—I observed the prisoner so as to know him again when I saw him, I recognized him—the trees are on the same side of the road as the pump, on the left hand going up—I saw him three or four times up to about a quarter of an hour before the Queen passed, I then lost sight of him—during the time I saw him he was with the other young man—they were walking together in entrust conversation—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody of a police<lb></lb>man and soldier, and recognized him as one of the two I had seen walking up and down—I remarked them first, because I thought it odd they should be there—I noticed them because there was a resemblance in his compa<lb></lb>nion to my brother.</p>

On Sunday, the 29th of May, I was in St. James's Park at the time Her Majesty's carriage was returning from chapel—Her Majesty and Prince Albert were, I believe, in it—I saw the prisoner there—I saw him present a pistol at the Royal carnage—he did nothing more than Pre<lb></lb>sent it—he neither drew the trigger nor attempted to fire, or any thing—the carriage was four or five yards from him at the time he presented it—this was almost in the middle of the Mall—he presented it as the carriage passed on—this was coming through the Mall of St. James's-park—I do not know whether it was the side on which Her Majesty or Prince Albert sat—he was on the side of the carriage next the Mall, on the left side of the carriage—when the carriage passed on he returned the pistol to his bosom, and said, "They may take me if they like, I don't care, I was a fool I did not shoot"—he then went away—I saw him afterwards among several others in prison where he was—I had not the least doubt of his person.</p>

                  </hi>. My mother keeps a draper's shop in Francis-street, Woolwich. I saw the prisoner in the shop on 3rd Aug., in the evening—my sister was in the shop at the time—I was in the parlour, but I could see into the shop—I had seen him in the shop a fortnight before, when he came for some black silk, and offered me in payment a bad half-crown, I returned it to him, and he went away without purchasing anything—in consequence <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that I watched him when he came on 3rd Aug.—I saw my sister serve him with something, and he put down some money on the counter—I then went into the shop, and there was a shilling lying on the counter—I did not notice whether it was good or bad—it was put into the till by my sister.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister of the last witness. I was in the shop on 3rd Aug., when the prisoner came for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of black thread—I served him—he gave me a shilling—he put it on the counter—I gave him change while the shilling was on the counter—my sister came out of the parlour, and looked at the shilling—I put it in the till—I had no other shilling in the till—I did not take any other shilling that evening before I went to bed—the shop was closed directly after the prisoner went away—when I went to bed I took the shilling out of the till, and placed it on the mantel piece in the back room—in the morning I found it there—there was only one shilling there, I looked at it, and found it was bad—I placed it in a small drawer of the scales—there was no other money there, it was put there separate—about ten days afterwards I gave it to the policeman—I had not put any other money in the scale drawer in the meantime—I marked the shilling when the policeman came—I am sure I gave him the same shilling I took of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Belvoir Arms, at Plumstead. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, 15th Aug., the prisoner came, about twenty minutes before 6 o'clock—I served him a pint of porter and a short pipe—he put a shilling on the counter, I looked at it, and found it was bad—I looked at him, and said, "I think this is not the first you have passed"; he was very <hi rend="italic">bounceable</hi> about it, and said he earned it honestly—I said, "Where did you get it?" he said he took it in change at a public house near the Bench—he had before this given me a good shilling, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I detained him—he said, "Give me that bad shilling"; I refused to give it him—when he said he took the shilling at a public house near the Bench, I said, "If you are an honest man, if you will wait till I get my clothes on, I will go with you to the place"—he went a few paces from the bar, and I went round, and saw he was putting something into his mouth—I caught him by the neck with one hand, and struck him very hard with the other—I gave him to the constable—I marked the bad shilling, and gave it to the constable—it had been in my hand the whole time.</p>

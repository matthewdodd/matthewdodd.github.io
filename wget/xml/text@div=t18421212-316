I produce this lead, which I took from the prisoner on the 7th of December—I asked him what he was going to do with it—he said, to take it to Whitechapel—I asked where he got it—he gave me no answer—I said, "If you cannot give me an answer I shall take you to the station"—he then took me to Wellington-street—he knocked at a door, but got no answer—I said, "Is this where you got it?—he said, "No"—he turned round the corner, to a dark place, and called out, Master, master, the policeman has got me"—I felt, and he was gone—I took him again the same evening.</p>

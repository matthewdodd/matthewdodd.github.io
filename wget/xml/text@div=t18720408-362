                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 553). About 7.50 p.m., on the 24th February, I was in plain clothes in Queen Street, Cheapside—I saw a boy named Horsage come from a letter-box—I had examined the box and found it all right—I examined it again and saw part of a newspaper put in—I saw prisoner speak to the boy—I took the boy into custody—I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the street, and I asked him if he had any appointment to meet this boy—he said he had—I told him I was an officer. and asked him what time he had to meet him—he said "Half-past 6 o'clock"—the boy said "No, half past 8 o'clock"—he also said "This man is an officer, and has charged me with putting paper in the box"—the prisoner said "Oh, no, that cannot be"—I said "It is so, because I have got the paper in my pocket"—I said "I shall have to take you to the Station to explain this matter"—the boy said "Take hold of me, and I will make you pay for it"—I took them both to Bow Law Station—the boy was taken into the charge-room, and the prisoner remained in the passage—behind the door where he stood was a canvas bag—I took prisoner out to the Inspector—he gave his address as 39, Bouverie Street—I received these parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the officer Malyon—I saw the prisoner on the Monday morning, and showed them to him—I said "This parcel was found behind the canvas bag, in the passage," and I showed him this letter, and asked if he knew anything about it; he said he did not—the letter bears his name inside—I asked if he knew anything about these other papers—he said "Yes, they are mine, and this letter has reference to these papers"—amongst those is a photograph of the boy I took into custody—he saw the deed and said he knew nothing about it—the boy was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

On Saturday the 24th, I was in Bow Lane Station, when the last witness brought the prisoner in—the boy was taken in to the charge-room, while the prisoner remained in the passage—I was not there the whole of the time—he stood close to the canvas—the next morning I found these papers behind the canvas.</p>

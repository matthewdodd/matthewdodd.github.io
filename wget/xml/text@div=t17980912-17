I went to No.27, New Bond-street, but no such person lived there. About a week after, I saw him pass the door, I pursued him, but he outrun me, and I lost him. Sometime after, Kennedy called upon me, and asked me, if such a man had been at my shop; I told him, yes. I went to a pawnbroker's, and found two pair of stockings of mine that had not been worn at all, with my private mark upon them.</p>

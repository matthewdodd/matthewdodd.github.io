                  </hi>. I keep a brush and turnery shop in Grosvenor-row, Pimlico, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square; I occupy the whole house. I examined my shop-window on Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 23rd of November, between seven and eight o'clock, and found a square of glass broken, and twenty-five toy cannons, and one toy watch taken from it—there was a sufficient aperture to admit a boy's hand—seven of the cannons were iron, and eighteen brass—they were quite close to the glass.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lower Sloane-street, with Mr. Carter; I know Usher and Savage. On Friday evening I met them and Webb, who I did not know before, and a boy named M'Kee, in Lower George-street—we went up Grosvenor-row together, and looked in at Mr. William<lb></lb>son's shop—Webb asked for a knife—Savage gave it to him, and he cut the putty out, broke the glass with his thumb, put his hand into the win<lb></lb>dow, took out some cannons, and put them into his pocket—Savage then took out some, and they ran away into Union-court—I did not see Usher put his hand in—he was looking in at the window—I followed them—Usher went home—he had some cannons—I do not know who gave them to him—I ran after the prisoners and M'Kee to Union-court, and said I would tell—Webb said, "Tell," and then he gave me a cannon, and Savage gave me a cannon, and they gave M'Kee a cannon a-piece—Savage then said, "Let us come and hide them in White-stiles"—they went through the George public-house—I went with them, and M'Kee gave me his cannons, and went home—Savage dug one hole, and I dug the other—he put some cannons into the hole, and I threw down mine into the hole, and covered them over—I gave one of the brass cannons to Wells the same</p>

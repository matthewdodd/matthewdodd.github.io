                  </hi>. On the 3rd of April I received information that the pri<lb></lb>soner was taking out more goods than he accounted for, and on the 4th of April I watched him, and saw that he was doing so—I told the inspector—he told me to watch him on the following morning, and I did—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and the foreman put the goods into the cart—the prisoner took the cart into the street—it was then taken to the station, and I found in it one dozen more than the prisoner had accounted for—he had done it by a very novel mode of packing—in the bottom tier of the crate he had managed to put four dozen and three bottles, four dozen and three in the middle tier, and in the top tier only four dozen—the officer found that also, and in consequence of that I gave him into custody.</p>

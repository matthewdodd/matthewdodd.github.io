On the 8th of February the prisoner came and asked for a pipe of tobacco—I told him I had got none—he then asked for a pint of beer—I sent my little girl to draw it—he put down a half-crown—I told him I could not give him change—he then said, "I will take one of these little loaves which will make 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said it would be 6 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but as he was a poor man I would not take the farthing—I gave him four sixpences in change—after the prisoner was gone I called my son, and he said the half-crown was bad—I told my two sons to follow the prisoner—he was brought back in an hour—the half-crown had been on the counter all the while—I afterwards gave it to the officer.</p>

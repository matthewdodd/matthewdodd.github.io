I did; and in consequence of something that Gibbs told me I went to the prisoner, and told him he had got a book that was not his own; I took it out of his pocket; he then told me that he had bought it. I sent down to Mr. Leigh to know who had purchased it; I was answered that Mr. Prest had bought it for sixteen shillings; we immediately sent for an officer. The prisoner had bought two lots at the sale that day, one six-pence, and the other two shillings and six-pence.</p>

            . I am a servant to Messrs. Leigh and Southerby. On the 30th of June, in consequence of instructions that I had received from Wheatley I watched the prisoner; he took this book off the shelf, put it under his catalogue, went and sat down upon a form, and then he put it into his pocket. I informed Mr. Wheatley what I had seen; Mr. Wheatley went up and spoke to the prisoner, and took the book out of his pocket. The prisoner said he had bought it, and he would pay for it. Mr. Wheatley called out who had bought it; I looked in the catalogue, and found that Mr. Prest had bought it.</p>
               <p>MR. SOUTHERBY. I am a partner with Mr. Leigh. When Adkins, the officer, came, the prisoner said he had purchased the book, and wished to pay for It; I said that was not sufficient for me from what I had heard of my servant. The prisoner then was in the accompting-house; he offered twenty pounds, I think he said, rather than it should come public.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I attended different sales of books, where frequent opportunities offered to purchase at a quarter price they were published at. I had two objects; the first was to collect the prices at which the books sold; secondly, to purchase whaever books might be useful to me, and was offered at a low price; I held the book in question under my catalogue as a prop to write on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

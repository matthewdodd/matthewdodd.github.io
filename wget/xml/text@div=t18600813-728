I said, "Police; open the door; I want to come in"—he made no reply, but walked back again—I continued to knock for I suppose a minute or two, and he came again and opened the door—I said to him, "Who was that man that has just come in here?" he said, I don't know; no one, that I am aware of"—I said," It is very strange, I just saw a man at the Fishmonger's shop, and he ran in this house"—he said, "No one came in here that I am aware of"—I said, "It is very strange—this house smells of the very same kind of stuff that the house was set on fire with"—he was dressed in the same clothes he has now on—he went up stairs and I followed him to the back room, which is his bed-room, and on the bed I found this waistcoat—the prisoner said, "That is my waistcoat, give it me, I want to put it on"—I found it quite wet, and it smelt of the same stuff that the house was set on fire with—it smelt like naptha—I said to him, "No; I shall keep this waistcoat, and also take you in custody"—I took him in custody—I had no further conversation with him in going to the station; but in going from the station to the Court he said to me, "I would rather be in custody for this than I would for felony"—I said, "This is a felony"—he said, "What I mean is, I would rather be taken for this than I would for stealing anything"—I said, "It is a very bad case, I would rather be in custody for stealing than I would for this crime"—he said, "I only merely did it to frighten, not with the intention to set the house on fire—only to frighten him as he has been taking some of my customers away."</p>

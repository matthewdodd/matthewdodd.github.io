                  </hi>. I keep a coffee shop at Brentford. On Monday morn<lb></lb>ing 6th March, five or six persons came to my house about twenty minutes before 5 o'clock—the prisoner Harvey was one—they asked for six half pints of coffee, I served them—some more persons came in, and they had some—Harvey paid with a half crown; I was to take sixpence, and I gave him the change; I put the half crown in my waistcoat pocket; I had no other half crown there—I went afterwards with the officer to the White Bear, at Hounslow; I there saw both the prisoners, I knew Harvey in a moment—that was about three miles and a half from where I live—there were twenty-three or twenty-four persons in company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the White Bear, at Hounslow. On 6th March, about twenty-four persons came to the house about 6 o'clock in the morning—Burk came to the bar by himself, and asked for six screws of tobacco—I served him; they came to sixpence—he gave me a sixpence; I put it in the till; there was no other sixpence there—I afterwards took it out again—there was only one sixpence there then—I marked it, and gave it to Irish.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I was on duty, in Old Brentford, on 6th March. I saw both the prisoners, about half past 4 o'clock in the morning; in company with about twenty others; they were walking through the street, coming from the direction of town—I afterwards went to Mr. Wood's, and received from him this half crown—he went with me to the White Bear, at Hounslow—I went in the tap room, and found the prisoners there; I sent to the station for assistance—Mr. Wood pointed out Harvey—there were about twenty-five in the party—I apprehended Harvey; I found nothing on him—when I went in the room I said, "I am a policeman; you are all smashers"—I heard something rattle on the floor near to where Burk was standing, and when assistance came in about five minutes, I went and picked up what I heard fall, and I found these two half crowns, and two shillings, and I also found this box of cement—I saw the witness, Gorton; she gave me this sixpence, and pointed out Burk—I saw a great deal of metal picked up in the ashes—I should think there was the metal of seven or eight half crowns—I did not pick it up myself—the other men went away—when I first went in, the two prisoners were sitting next each other—Harvey then got up and went away to a distance.</p>

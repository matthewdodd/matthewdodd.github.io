               <p>Q. On the 26th of July did you lose any saddle-flaps stirrup-irons and trace-buckles - A. Yes, they were on a pentice, as high as a one pair of stair; they were safe on the night of the 25th. I set up till four o'clock in order to detect the prisoner. Finding that he did not not come, I went to bed, and nigh upon half past five Mr. Bellfour called me, and told me some person had been stealing my leather, I got up and pursued the prisoner, and catched him just by the skin market; about half a mile from my house. The saddle flaps had been cut of a whole saddle, he spoiled the saddle. I took them from the prisoner, they were in his hand. The constable found two stirup-irons on him, and two trace-buckles. I asked him how he got them, he said they were mine; I said yes, you rascal, what have you done with the property you took before; he said he took none before.</p>
               <p>JOHN BELLFOUR. My father is a schoolmaster. As I was opening the window I saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand, he picked up two saddle-flaps from of the ground. I told my father, and he called Mr. Parry up.</p>

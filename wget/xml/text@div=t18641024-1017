                  </hi> I am a carpenter, and lodge at Westhill<lb></lb>park, Wandsworth—on Saturday night, 20th August, after 11 o'clock, I left Wandsworth, and was going to Vauxhall-station—I met a friend, and stopped in his company till between 12 and 1—he told me I could have a bed next door to him; I went there, but they could not take me in—I went as far as Vauxhall-station, and saw two men, and asked if they could tell me where to get a bed—one of them said he could tell me where I could get a bed, and he took me to the female prisoner's—she was in the street with a shawl on, but no bonnet—I am sure she is the woman—she asked the man if he should like anything to drink; he said he should—she said she had nothing in the house herself, but she could tell him where he could have some, and she would go with him as it was not far—we all went to a house where there were seven or eight persons drinking and smoking—this was about 3 o'clock—I stayed there half an hour, and left with the female prisoner—I did not notice other persons go out—the man that went in with me left before me; he was neither of the prisoners—when I had got about twenty or thirty yards from the house, I saw the two male prisoners stand<lb></lb>ing in two separate doorways; Dwyer was nearest the house I had left—the female prisoner crossed over to the opposite side of the street, and asked me what the time was—I deliberately pulled out my watch to tell her the time, when she snatched it from me, and broke it from the guard—I seized hold of her and threw her down to the ground—the two men then came up; Ray was first—he struck me a violent blow on the nose, and broke my nose—I am sure he is the man—in the first instance I identified a man named White to be the man, owing to his being so much like him—when Ray struck me on the nose, Dwyer was trying to get the watch from the girl, but I wrenched it out of her hands—the two male prisoners then ran off—I ex<lb></lb>pected that the other men were coming out of the house, and I kicked the female, in the heat of the moment, and ran for assistance—she began to cry—I ran after Dwyer—I met two constables; I described the prisoners to them—I have no doubt now that Ray is the man—White was very like him—they were dressed exactly alike, but Ray had a very slight moustache, ap<lb></lb>parently about a week old—I identified Dwyer at the station on the Tuesday—he was not amongst other persons; there were only constables there in their uniform—I clearly recognised him, and am sure he is the man—I don't know what became of the woman; I left her lying on the ground.</p>

I crossed the road and saw the female prisoner turn out of Hooper-street, and turn towards the Obelisk—I knew her by sight—I spoke to her, and asked what she was crying about—she was crying—she made no answer, but went on—I went towards Francis-street, and met the prosecutor coming back from Oakley-street in com<lb></lb>pany of a constable of the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> division, who is not here—the prosecutor told me what bad taken place—I went with him down Francis-street, and a man named White, and several others, were standing in Francis-street—we passed by White, and went to the end of Francis-street, and came back again, and the prosecutor then gave White into custody for assaulting him—I took White into custody—he is here.</p>

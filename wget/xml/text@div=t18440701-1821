                  </hi>. I am the wife of William George Clemen<lb></lb>son, and live in Chapel-street, Westminster. On Saturday night, the 23rd of June, about twelve o'clock, I was at the corner of Little Chapel-street,</p>

               <p>looking after my younger brother—there was a fight—the prisoner's wife was there—the prisoner pulled her away, and struck my eldest brother, who was standing outside the public-house—he then struck my youngest brother, and afterwards struck me, and knocked me down, and while on the ground I found his hand in my pocket, at the right side, in which I had a handker<lb></lb>chief, a latch-key, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—when I got up I found the purse and money were gone—no one but the prisoner had their hand in my pocket—he escaped out of the mob, and ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Chapel-street, Westminster. I was standing talking with Mrs. Clemenson on the 23rd of June, about twelve o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner's wife strike Mrs. Clemenson's elder brother—the prisoner pulled his wife away, and attacked him—he then struck her younger brother, and then struck Mrs. Clemenson on the side of the face, and knocked her down—I immediately ran for a policeman, and saw no more.</p>

               <p>Was you told to say so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who told you so? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Do you know it is your duty, if sworn, to speak the truth and the whole truth? - Yes, and then I shall go heaven.</p>
               <p>He is sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you lived with Mr. Lloyd? - I believe I have lived there eight months.</p>
               <p>Did you go in July last with his linen any where? - I have been with it ever since I lived with that gentleman; this was on a Thursday night; I do not know how long ago; there were four of them met me in Gray's Inn-lane; two of them parted with the others in Gray's Inn-lane, and went up towards Holbourn; the other two followed me from Gray's Inn-lane to the Spa-fields; in the Spa-fields they met the other two again; they dodged me.</p>
               <p>If they followed you they were behind you? - They came up behind me in the <placeName id="t17800913-13-crimeloc77">Spa-fields</placeName>

               <p>Did he say any thing to you? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to them? - No; when they took the bundle away I ran after them and cried stop thief! they ran towards the turnpike; a gentlewoman at the turnpike stopped the prisoner and asked him if he had taken any thing from that child who was crying thieves and murder? He said no, hang me; and in about five minutes after he said, indeed it was not me. The gentlewoman said it was, and then he threw down the bundle.</p>
               <p>You did not see him drop the bundle? - No; he threw down the bundle before I got to him; when I came up the gentlewoman had the bundle, and the turnpike man had stopped him; then Musgrove, the constable came and took him to prison.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk with them in Gray's Inn-lane? - They said they would cut my throat if I did not give them the bundle; they had a knife.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Between nine and ten at night.</p>
               <p>How came you to go on after they said that? - I went on; I would not give them the bundle; I walked as fast as I could; I did not think they would follow me; I did not see them follow me; I did not see them again till I got into the Spa-fields, but I did not properly see them then for they came behind me.</p>
               <p>How came you not to call for assistance in Gray's Inn-lane? - I did not think they would follow me.</p>
               <p>Had you taken any notice of their faces in Gray's Inn-lane? - No.</p>
               <p>In Spa-fields, it was dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could not see them distinctly? - No, I could hardly see them.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the turnpike? - Not far.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - No; they told me he was stopped; just as I got to the bottom of the field he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>What makes you think that he is the man? - Because I saw him in the prison and knew him to be the man, and I saw him at the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Suppose you had seen him any where else and the bundle had not been found should you have known him? - No; I did not take notice of him; all I know is that that is the man I saw at the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough of him in Gray's Inn-lane, and when he took the bundle, to know him again? - Yes; he stopped me in Spa-fields.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130012"></xptr>Did they do you any hurt? - They pinched me.</p>
               <p>It was the other man who pinched you, not this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As stout a man as this? - No; he was not so big; he ran the other way; there was a shirt and stock in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going across the field and heard somebody cry out stop thief; there were two men running across the field; I ran away for fear they should think it was me.</p>

               <p>I live in Tailor's-court, Islington-road, close to the turnpike. On the 13th of July I saw the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock; he was running along out of the Spa-fields towards the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Did you see a little boy there? - No, I did not see the child but I heard him cry out murder and stop thief! I went across the road and saw the prisoner. I asked him if he had taken any thing from the child who cried murder and stop thief? He said he had not, indeed. I said he had. Then he dropped the bundle; I picked it up and called stop thief! and the turnpike man stopped him directly.</p>
               <p>How long was it before the boy came up? - Not two minutes; I heard him crying, and told him the man was taken; this is the bundle (producing it).</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to the boy when he came up? - I told him I had got the bundle, and the man was stopped; and he went and fetched his mother, who lived just by; the turnpike man asked him if that was the man? He said it was.</p>
               <p>To Bolton. What was the shirt and stock in? - A bit of cheque rag; this is it.</p>

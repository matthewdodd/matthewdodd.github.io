            . I am an officer. On the 2nd of June, a little past six o'clock, I met the prisoner; he had a basket on his shoulder; I asked him what he had got in it; he said, wood and chips. I told him I was an officer; it appeared to be heavier then wood, I would like to look in it; I then examined it, and wood was on the top. I took the wood out, and at the bottom of the basket was thirty pounds of white lead. I asked him where he got it; he said at Mill-wall. I told him he worked at some place, and I must go there; a gentleman standing by said it is at Price's manufactory, I had better go there. On my taking the prisoner along he told me not to go there, he did work there, if I took him there he should lose his bread. I took him to the manufactory. I asked a gentleman in the accompting-house if he knew him; he said, yes, he had been working there all day, I went to his room afterwards.</p>
               <p>HENSHAW STEVENS ADAMS. I am clerk to the prosecutors. The prisoner was a labourer. On the evening of the 2nd of June, the prisoner was brought by two Police officers; I asked the prisoner where he got the lead, when, and what he took it for; he said nobody had given it him, he took it in the morning, he took it before the person employed in this department came to work; he took it with a view of painting some part of his house. He has been four years in our service; I never heard any complaint against him before.</p>

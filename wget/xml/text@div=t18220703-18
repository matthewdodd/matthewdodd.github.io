            . I am servant to Mr. M'Gowan; the prisoner was in the house on the night of the robbery; there were other people there; he was there about half-past eleven o'clock; I was the last person up; I did not see him go out. I went to bed about ten minutes before one o'clock; everything was safe in the bar then, and the windows and doors all fast; I fastened the door; nobody could get in from outside without breaking in.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I alarmed the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner at twenty minutes past two o'clock that morning with another young man; they walked by me towards the Strand, both with bundles, as I thought, under their coats. I turned to look after them, and they both ran; I followed them and sprung my rattle, and heard something fall like glass about the middle of Catherine-street. I pursued them into the Strand; they turned into Wellington-street; the prisoner turned to the right, and the other to the left. I went down under the bridge to the left in pursuit of them, and as I came round under the arch I met the prisoner; his mouth and nose were bleeding; I secured him. I am sure he is one of the two I saw before, it was twilight; I never saw his face till I took him. He was only out of my sight while he went down the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see where they came from in Catherine-street - A. No; they came down the middle of the street. I took him to Catherine-street, and when I returned Fitzgerald had the clock, and said in his presence that a girl of the town found it, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw his face till you took him - A. No; they were out of my sight in crossing the Strand. I noticed that his dress was dark, and when I took him I found he had a snuff-coloured surtout on; he was flurried, and appeared out of breath. I supposed that a public-house had been robbed, and on trying M'Gowan's door, it opened; there were no marks of violence on it.</p>

            . I am toll-collector at Waterloo-bridge. Street sprung his rattle, and I saw two persons running towards the gate, one on the right and the other on the left; I went to my gate. One man turned down the right-hand steps, and the other on the left. I saw one man brought back, which was the prisoner; I knew he was one of the men who were running; I knew his face before by passing through the gate. It was twilight; he was about twenty or thirty feet off. After he was brought up, I went down the steps, and saw a man among the mud by the Savoy wharf. I found some money in the common-sewer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030012"></xptr>under the Savoy; the other man had gone that way. I found a handkerchief on the shore, which I had seen in the man's hand, and near it was about 5 s. in copper and 2 s. 6 d. in silver, three silver tea-spoons, an hydrometer, a snuff-box, and some other articles.</p>

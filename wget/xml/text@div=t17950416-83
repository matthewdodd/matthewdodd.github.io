               <p>Q. You had information at Union Hall, of some things against the prisoner at the bar; did you mark the half guinea at Union Hall? - No, we marked it in a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked it on purpose to draw the woman in? - We might.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any bad money in the house? - No; we found some good silver, about eight or nine shillings, and some gold on her.</p>

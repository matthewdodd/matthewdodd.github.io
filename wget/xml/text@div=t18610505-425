                  </hi>. I am waitress at a coffee-house in West Smithfield—on 4th April I served the prisoner with half a pint of coffee and two slices of bread and butter, which came to two pence—he gave me a two shilling piece—I gave it to my mistress for change, and gave him a shilling, a sixpence, and fourpence in copper—in one or two minutes he said, "I do not much like the look of this shilling, will you please to change it?"—I had in the meantime been serving another customer at the next table—I took it to my mistress, brought another back and gave to him—he then went away—four days afterwards, on the 8th, he came again, at 7 o'clock in the morning, and had half a pint of coffee and a slice—he gave me a shilling in payment—I took it, tried it, found it bad, gave it back to him, and asked him if he had any more money—he said he had only a penny—I took the bread and butter from him, and took the penny for the coffee—he came again the next day at ten minutes past 5—I knew him, and spoke to my mistress about him—he was sitting near the door that time—he gave the money to me, and I gave it to my mistress—it was a bad shilling—she bent it—I am sure he is the man that was there the three times I served.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On 9th March I went from Billingsgate-marke to Charles-street, Westminster; I had about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket. I got drinking up there, and playing at skittles. I played a man for sixpence and a pint of ale, and I lost; on the last two games I lost a shilling, and had two pints of ale to pay for. I said, "Here, take your shilling and give me eighteen pence out of this half-crown, and we will have two pots more, and then go home." On my coming home I went into this lady's shop. I was sitting down eating and the policeman came in and took me. Do you think, if I intended to get my living by uttering, I should go in two days running, with counterfeit shillings? I must be sure that she would know me or lock me up. I can prove where I was; I was not in the city all day long; at the time she charges me I was at Stepney fair. I am perfectly innocent of what I am charged with.</p>

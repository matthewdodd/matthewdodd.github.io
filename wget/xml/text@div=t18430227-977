                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Johnson, we live in Upper Corn<lb></lb>wall-street, St. George's in the East—the prisoner took a furnished room of me in Sep. or Oct. last—I missed two sheets which were used in her room—I have sent her to pawn things, but never gave her permission the pledge these—after she left me I went to her and asked if she would bring the sheets back—she said I must wait her pleasure for them—I went again, and she gave me some very abusive language, and again told me I must wait her pleasure—these are the sheets—here is a mark on one of them, and the other I know to be mine.</p>

               <p>them, nor have any of the money for them—she left me without notice, and left a fortnight's rent unpaid—I went and told her if she would bring the sheets, and make arrangement to pay for the things she had broken, I would forgive her the rent.</p>

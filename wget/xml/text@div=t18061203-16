            ) I understand you to say, that the prisoner was at work at the upper rooms. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistresse's bed room was below. - A. No, on the same floor; he had nothing to do with her room.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the room in which the mistress slept, to were he was at work. - A. The adjoining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the bed room usually left open. - A. It was that morning, the doors were all open; I was about my work.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly clear in your recollection about that. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. And the place where you supposed to have put the watch, either in the drawer, or upon the drawer, was in your young mistresses' bed room. - A. Yes. There were two doors to my mistresses' room, one in the room where the prisoner was at work, and the other came out on the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the door that went from the room where the prisoner was at work, that went into your mistresses' room, was open. - A. It was open; there was a part of the morning that it was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning do you recollect it was open. - A. It was open all the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said that you locked it. - A. So I did, but I very soon opened it again to go into the room where the prisoner was at work; the door that went into the room was open all the morning but a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect about what time that was. - A. It was all within a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you did lock it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before ten or eleven. - A. Yes, it was before that, it was before the prisoner had left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. But, after your young mistress had left there. - A. Yes. I had taken the clothes off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be locked. - A. Five minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of locking it. - A. The prisoner went in there with the paint, my mistress had a great dislike to the smell of paint, I asked him what occasion he had in that room when he had finished it on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him in that room then. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this. - A. The 27th on Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say. - A. I cannot say what answer he made.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you locked him out. - A. Yes, he had to go through my room to go into another room.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you fastened it then you opened it afterwards. - A. I had to go through that room to go into a room adjoining my mistresses' room to make a bed.</p>

            . I am one of the police officers of Whitechapel. On Monday the 27th of October, a young man, a pawnbroker, called at the office and desired me to go with him to his master's house in the Minories, they had stopped a man there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him. - A. I did; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030017"></xptr> came there the man was standing in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Which man. - A. The prisoner. I desired the pawnbroker to shew me into a back room, that I might search him; he shewed me out into the back yard, where I searched him. In his pocket I found this purse, containing two foreign pieces of silver, one guinea in gold, three sixpences; there were four sixpences, one shilling, and a seven shilling piece in gold, which I gave him since. One of the foreign pieces is half a dollar, American; these are them that I found, and this is the purse (producing them). In his coat pocket I found these two handkerchiefs, this white handkerchief is in the indictment. When I had done searching of him the pawnbroker reached me this watch before him, saying this is the watch which the prisoner at the bar offered for pledging. I asked the prisoner then where he got this watch, he said it was his own property and he had it some time. After that I took him to the office before the magistrate; upon his examination the magistrate asked him where he got this watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the examination taken in writing. - A. I cannot say; his answer was, he bought the watch at Colchester, that he gave four pounds for it, and that he had it four years in wear; the magistrate asked him as he had it so long if he knew the number of it, he said no, he did not recollect the number. I was desired by the magistrate to hand the watch to him and let him look at it, he desired him to open it, he opened the first case, he could not open the other at all; I then took the watch from him, he was committed for re-examination. I went round the next day, and going to one Mr. Webb, a watchmaker, a quaker, in Red Lion street, Clerkenwell, that is how I found who belonged to it.</p>
               <p>Q. We are told that both the watch, key, and seal, are gold, do they appear so to you. - A. They do, the outer and the inner case are all gold, it is what they call a double bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any idea what is the value of that watch. - A. I should suppose this watch is worth sixteen or seventeen pounds at the lowest, I would give that for it.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is well worth twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday I came to Mr. Blake's house, I was employed by one Mr. Dowe, a painter. I had a man that was at work with me at the same time.</p>

            ) Was there any other person at work with him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was at work below. - A. They were both at work below in the morning, then my master desired him to finish the windows; the other man kept below, this man was desired to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was nearly nine o'clock when he came, I did not go to work till he came; when he came he said he would finish the lower part of the house first, accordingly we did; I said I will take the machine for you, you can get out of the window better than me; he said, we have finished this work, Mr. Blake desired the door and frontispiece to be finished, he desired to have some porter. Mr. Blake allowed us sixpence a-day, the sixpence is there, he said you had better go and ask the coachman for it, I went to the coachman, with that he gave me the sixpence. I went for the beer, and on coming back I did not see my partner, I drank out of the beer and took it to the coachman; after he had drank I went to put the beer between the shrubbery and the door. During that time I saw part of the property that is produced here lying among the rubbish, I went to the public house, I acquainted the landlord, I said I did not know how it was, but there is some property that I found belonging to the young gentlewoman that is in the house; with that I stopped till four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped where. - A. At this public house till four or five o'clock; with that I said to the landlady I do not hear of any person that owns the property, I will keep it till it is owned. With that I came along with three or four friends, I did not know whether I might not be deprived of this property. I thought I might pledge it for a small quantity of money, it might be more secure till such times as I went to my work again.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at this purse, and look particular at these two foreign pieces, is that the sort of purse your mistress had. - A. It is, I know the purse, it had a hole in it, there is a hole in the purse exactly in the same place; I had seen the hole before, it is drawn up with a piece of black silk.</p>
               <p>Q. It is so now. - A. No, that is burst out, the hole is in the same place.</p>

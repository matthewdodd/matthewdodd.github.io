When they came in, Hatch and I went from the house with Johnson, we went off towards them, immediately as they came up to the stable door, Sample went between the two horses and made his escape, I left Hatch with Wood and pursued him with Johnson into Goudge street, from that into John street, and from that into Pitt street, I called out stop thief! and he was stopped there, I went immediately and laid hold of him, I took him to a public house and there I was informed that he had thrown something down an area, I found about him two guineas, nine half crowns, thirteen shillings and eight six-pences, and a remarkable Queen Ann's sarthin, and some other halfpence; I then went where I was informed he had thrown something down an area in Pitt-street, by the place where he was stopped at, I asked whether any thing had been thrown down there? they told me yes, there was two watches the servant had picked them up; the servant was bound before the magistrate but we could not get her forward, I went into the area myself, and there I saw some pieces of glass myself of watches, which I picked up. They were both secured till Monday morning when they were taken before the magistrate, Sample was dressed in black as he is now, and Wood had on a sort of a clergyman's grey, a sort of a Mixture, I brought them to Bow-street on the Monday, and there were informations there concerning several robberies.</p>

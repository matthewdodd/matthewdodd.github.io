                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place. On Monday afternoon, the 19th of September, I was at my lodging—I hung a shawl on the banisters, opposite my bed-room door between three and four o'clock—I did not miss it till next morning—at five on Wednesday evening I met the prisoner in High Holborn, near St. Giles's-church, with my shawl on—I pointed her out to a policeman, he stopped her—she said it was not mine, it was hers, that she bought it at Greenwich, two years ago—I asked if she would go to my lodging, and there were plenty of persons there that knew it—it was then taken off her—she said she would not like to part with a thing she bought and paid for—this is my shawl, there is no particular mark on it—but I know it, from having worn it, and by a little stain in front—I will swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Broad-street, St. Giles's—the prosecutrix pointed out the prisoner to me—I called to her, and went with her with the prosecutrix—I told the prisoner that the prosecutrix had suspicion that it was her shawl—she said it was her own, she had bought it at Greenwich two years back—I went with her to the prosecutrix's lodging—there were three women there—they looked at the shawl in the prisoner's presence, and said it was very much like the prosecutrix's—I took the prisoner to the station—she gave her address," No. 14, Coal-yard, Drury-lane," with a woman named Esop—I went there, it was a black smith's shop—I could find no such person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> She stopped me, and said if I gave her the shawl, she would do nothing further. I said I should not give up what I had paid for. I had never been in the house before; I bought it two years ago at Mr. Kershaw's; and the first day I put it on I tore it.</p>

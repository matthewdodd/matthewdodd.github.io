                  </hi>. I am a Birmingham agent, and live at No. 3 Carpenters-buildings. On 7th July, about 6 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my office, and said he was a travelling auctioneer, and buyer of Birmingham goods—he mentioned several houses, and said that he knew Marchand's—I showed him some jewellery, plate, and cutlery—he was engaged for an hour and a half—he laid several articles aside, and said, "I will take that and that," but no money passed—I showed him one load of goods; he said it was too heavy for him to buy, without asking his partner, and hurried out before I could ask him to leave a deposit, and leaving the goods—he did not return; and immediately after he had gone, I felt certain that he had robbed me, and set to work to examine—I had a parcel on my desk to go to Hamburgh, I checked each item of it by the invoice, and found three items deficient; they were half a dozen gold pencil cases, at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, a card of gold pencil cases at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and one gold pencil; they had been safe an hour previously, when I was packing them for the steam packet—I also missed a set of studs, which I had taken out of a box, and placed on my desk.</p>

On 7th July, between 7 and 8 o'clock, he asked me to take charge of this set of studs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) until Sunday—a policeman came and made some inquiries, and I gave them up to him.</p>

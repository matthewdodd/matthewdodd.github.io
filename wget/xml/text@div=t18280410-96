            . I am an officer. I went to the lodging, and found these articles. I did not see the prisoner there, but he was taken about six o'clock in the evening. Parker, who was with me, said, "That is the man;" and I took him - and said I had a warrant against him, for taking some things from Mr. Bailey, he said,"Very well, I can answer to that;" and we went to the Office - when we got there, I said, "Do you know anything about a little bronze figure, and some tools?" he said, "No;" I showed him the figure, and he said,"That I found among some rubbish;" I told him I had been to his house, No. 8, Marchmont-place.</p>

            . I know this figure to be Mr. Bailey's. I had put it into the drawer of the bench in the study; it was not locked - when it was missed, I asked the prisoner about it, he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am placed in a very serious situation; I have had a responsible situation, and conducted the business of an eminent man in the City, and no one could say anything against me. I was able to get a sum of money, and intended to go into business, but through good nature to others. I lost it, and went to work again as journeyman. If I had known of these things being stolen. I would not have stood here to vindicate myself, but have pleaded guilty - I have an aged mother, who, though poor, is honest, and never had any of her family placed as I am at this time; I know it will be the breaking of her heart; I have a wife and three children, whom I have brought up with the respectability of a tradesman, and I feel the dreadful idea of being torn from them, and leaving them to the mercy of a world, that will frown on them. I have been in confinement for six weeks, with men, whose characters I detest, with thieves of the worst description - and am forced to hear all kind of language; which has been a punishment more severe than any I ever felt - never having been in confinement in my life. With respect to the image, on the 5th of November, I had occasion to go to a pump which supplies the prosecutor's shop with water; and near there is the rubbish heap, and it frequently happens, that tools are carried out with the rubbish, and thrown there. I saw a chisel of my own there, and took it up - I then turned over the rubbish and saw the image, which I took home, and gave my children to play with - and not only them, but the children at the house I live in, have played with it likewise; they have had it out in the street, where it might have been lost; and should I have shown it, if I had taken it with a guilty knowledge. I did not think it belonged to Mr. Bailey - I never saw it in his shop in my life; one of the witnesses says he put it into a drawer, which is in an open shop, thought he called it a study - there are ten or fifteen men work in the shop - he said before the Magistrate, that Mr. Bailey gave it him to put on a pedestal, and he put it into the drawer, and thought no more of it, till it was asked for, which shows how little they thought of it; one of these tools is my own - and I have used it to work with of an evening, at home: and I can declare I have had it these five years, as my father-in-law can prove, though he cannot identify it. I had left three pair of Louises with Mr. Bailey's foreman. which were worth 3l., with an understanding, that if I had anything of Mr. Bailey it should be returned - when I came for the Louises. I then went to work at King's Palace, in St. James's Park, and found I had this drill-stock, which is Mr. Bailey's; it is a worthless thing - have several of them. I told my wife if they called, to give it to them - a man did call, and brought the Louises, but my wife forgot to give him the drill-stock. I can assure you, I had not the least idea of stealing anything; I have felt much my awful situation - my home is gone to wreck and ruin; I have been forced to part with what little property I had; I have not been able to provide any thing for my family to stand up in, or to rest their bones upon: and if I am torn from them the work-house must take them.</p>

No; she got up on a chair and took the image off a shelf in her right hand; I said"What have you got?" she said "Nothing;" I took hold of her hand and found the image in it; the tools were on the same shelf; she did not say the image had been found.</p>

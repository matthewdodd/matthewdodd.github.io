                  </hi>. I live at Enfield-highway—I have a stable there. On Sunday afternoon, 19th Feb., between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw then boys (<hi rend="italic">the prisoners</hi>) standing against the window of the room where I was washing and cleaning myself—they could see me-—I could see the stable as I stood there—it adjoins the house; the window looks into the road—the boys stood looking at me all the time I was there, till I had done washing myself, and went into the next room—I saw nothing more of them at that time—about two minutes afterwards, my attention was attracted by hearing a plunge from my pony; my wife got up and went to the door; in consequence of what she said I went to the door, and saw my stable on fire—I went to the stable, and got my pony out as quick as I could, but it was burnt very much indeed—part of the stable was burnt down, the result of this fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, at Ponders End. On Sunday afternoon, 19th Feb., about 4 o'clock, I saw the two prisoners standing against the prosecutor's window for a short time, and then they moved from the window to the corner of the stable—I could not see what they were doing there; they had their backs to me—there were no other persons with them, or near the stable, that I saw—I was walking down the road; if any other persons had been there, I think I should have seen them—they stood at the corner of the stable for about half a minute, or it might be a minute, and then they ran away—after they had got a little way, I saw some smoke coming from the corner of the stable where they had I stood; it was very trifling at first, but as I walked along it increased, and I ran towards it, and gave the alarm of fire.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, 19th Feb., between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw the prisoners standing in the road against my palings—Baldwin struck two lucifer matches, one after the other, against the palings; it was between thirty and forty yards from Mr. Crampton's—Webb said, "Mind how you let it off;" that was before they commenced striking the match, when they stopped against the palings—they then went away in the direction of Mr. Crampton's beer shop—in about five minutes, I saw them return running—there was an alarm of fire; I went to the stable, and saw it partially burnt.</p>

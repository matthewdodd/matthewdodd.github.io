The prisoner was in my employ; I sent him to the docks on the 26th of June, with a cart, to fetch twenty bags of sugar, in the morning, about ten o'clock; he came back to me on Saturday, and I thought he had delivered them - he said he had stopped, and given the horse a bait - he offered me the change; I said he had better settle with the person he took it of.</p>

            . I am an elder belonging to the East India Company. On the 26th of June the prisoner came and received twenty bags of sugar, in a perfect state - I saw them put into the cart, and they were all in a sound state, as they had been weighed, but not weighed at the time he had them.</p>

            . We gave the warrant to Nicholls to bring up twenty bags of sugar for Robert Smith and Co.; the prisoner brought them to the warehouse about five o'clock that afternoon; we were weighing, to send five of them into the country, and we found two of that pile deficient in weight; one was 1 qr. 6 lb., and the other 1 qr. 13 lbs. deficient - the two bags had evidently been cut open and sewn up again, but I could not judge whether that had been done recently; they were very dirty - the prisoner was gone before we discovered it.</p>

            . I heard the prisoner was wanted, and on the 8th of July I saw him; I said, "They want you;" he said, "What for?" I said, "About some sugar"- I went to Mr. Smith's, and found seven bags, which they said were deficient; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it - I took him to the Mansion-house.</p>

             re-examined. We only weigh the bags when they come in; I will swear they were in the same state when I delivered them to him - they had lain in the warehouse, and none but our men had access to them; none of them were cut then.</p>

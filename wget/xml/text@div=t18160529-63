She passed me; I thanked her and bid her good night. I got to the opposite side of the street where I lost her. The prisoner passed by me about as far as from me to your Lordship; he turned sharp round upon me, and drove his head against my chin, and took the seals from my ribbon. The seals, key, and part of two broken keys. I directly put my hand to my watch, and found my things were gone, and I tried to stop him with my left hand; with that, he ran away, and I ran after him, calling stop thief. He ran I suppose, one hundred yards; but I secured him at last; I never lost sight of him. Three or four more then came up, and asked me if he had robbed me, and I said yes. The prisoner struck at me several times, and I struck him again and cut him. I never found my things since. I never lost sight of him, and I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

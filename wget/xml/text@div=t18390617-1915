                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 193.) In the afternoon of the 17th of June, I was on the Hyppodrome race-course—I saw the prisoner near a car<lb></lb>riage with this reticule in his hand running away—I took him, and found in it this napkin and smelling bottle—he ran some distance, and put it under his coat—then turned and saw me—he threw it under a carriage and ran on—I pursued him, cried "Stop thief!" and took him—I went back to the carriage, and got the reticule—I then went back to the carriage, and the ladies in it claimed their reticule—I asked their names—they would not give me their names—I told them I was going to take the prisoner to the station-house—they never came near—they wanted me to give them the reticule, but I would not.</p>

I am a milliner, at 252, Regent Street—I have another shop at 210—I also have a shop in the Edgware Road, and two other shops besides, in other parts of London—in February, 1870, the prisoner called on me at 252, Regent Street, and produced this paper—he said he was an agent for the Royal Scottish Plate Glass Insurance Company—I told him I had never heard of the company—he showed me this prospectus, and told me they were doing a large business, their premiums were very moderate, and said he would charge 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the risk if I would insure with him—he said he was only an agent—I asked him if it was a sound affair—he said certainly it was, and that their bankers were the London and Westminster Bank, and that there were substantial directors—he said sufficient to induce me to insure—I told him to look in again, and he came again two days after, and I agreed to insure with him—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me a receipt—I received the policy in a very few days—he brought it one evening—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the signatures to the policy are A. Lumsden, Vicomte De Cissy, and A. M. Walker, secre<lb></lb>tary—when he brought the policy I did not notice that his own name was written on it as the secretary, although the name on the prospectus is James Anderson—I did not observe that variance—I saw the prisoner several times after that—I insured the shop in the Edgware Road with him about a month after—he said then they were doing a very large business, and were very successful—I then paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards insured 252, Regent Street, and paid him the amount on the policy, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I also insured the shop in Shoreditch at Michaelmas, 1870—he then said they were doing very well—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that—this is the policy—it was left with me at Regent Street—the name of the Company in that policy differs from the name on the first policy—he told me they were going to change</p>

               <p>the name of the Company—I did not see any prospectus with reference to that one—I insured 210, Regent Street with him, about the same time—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—all the policies are in the same handwriting—the second policy is signed C. Masterman and A. Lumsden, and A. M. Walker, secretary—the policies, Nos. 3 and 4, are headed "British and Foreign Plate Glass Insurance Company, Limited," and signed A. M. Walker, manager and C. Lain, p.p.—I had occasion to call upon the Company to make good some breakages—I think the first was about May—the skylight was broken at the Edgware Road shop—my clerk communicated with the prisoner, and the breakage was made good—I have no idea what it cost—it was rough plate glass—ground glass—there was a second breakage shortly afterwards, also in the Edgware Road—that was a square of glass in the lobby—it was replaced—the next breakage was about June, in Regent Street—a small fanlight was broken—that was replaced—in putting in the fanlight his people broke another—that was a very large square—I should think it cost 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other three breakages, which were replaced, would cost 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—the last breakage was never replaced by the Company—there was another breakage at 210, Regent Street, about November—it cost me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to put it in—I endeavoured to get it put in by the Company before I put it in myself—I saw the prisoner with reference to both those large breakages—with regard to the first he said his people had done it, and it should be put in directly—I think that was the same day it was broken—I saw him again two or three days after that, and he said it should be attended to—I should think I saw him half-a-dozen times, and he always said it should be attended to—when the last breakage of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. happened, I saw him the same day—that was in November—I had some conversation with him, and he said it should be put in—I said I was very sorry that it was such a large breakage—he said he was not, it would be a good advertisement for the Company—he said it should be put in, and I arranged with him to have it put in at night, so as not to interfere with the business, and I agreed to pay his men for night work—no men came—I wrote and told the prisoner I should go the next day to the Police Court if there was not something done—I did not see him to speak to after that—the matter was then investigated at the Police Court.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "From Mr. Thompson to the British and Foreign Plate Glass Company. December 1st, 1870.

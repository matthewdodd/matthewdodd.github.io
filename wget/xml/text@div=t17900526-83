I went to Mr. Bell's, the constable's, and saw Henman's wife there; they did live as man and wife; we knew no other; I asked her how she came by the iron which was laying on the tap-room table, in the house of Mr. Bell? she said, if Mr. Brodie would forgive her, her husband would do so no more; Mr. Brodie then took her, together with Mr. Bell, to the Compter; to the best of my knowledge, the iron is his property; one piece I can swear to; this is the piece, which was cut by a tool which we have, which I never heard of such a tool before; it is a tool in the form of a bench, with a chisel; I never saw that piece of iron to my knowledge: Mr. Brodie may have sold iron cut with that tool: Henman was a labourer of ours. On the 26th of April, I had information that there was iron under Henman's bed; and we found it under his bed: the constable has it; his name is

                  </hi>. I am a dyer and contractor, and live in South Street, Whitechapel. I contract for cleaning blankets for the Admiralty; during the last few months I have received a large number of blankets; I can tell the number by the book—I received 356 on 17th Aug.; 137 on 21st Sept.; and 630 on 14th Oct.—I missed 101 on 23d March—they were clean—I should say some of them had been cleaned perhaps a month—they were tied up with string in tens, folded rather peculiarly for the accommodation of the persons who have to receive them—some blankets were shown to me by the policeman; I know them, they were what I lost—there were four bundles tied in tens, and the others were loose—I knew them by the folds and the string they were tied with—These are all marked "T O," and the broad arrow, and a rim; they are all the same marks, done with a stamp I sup<lb></lb>pose—oneblanket was peculiar, it has "W D" on it, for War Department, and three stripes of red down it—I know this string; it is the string that I used to tie the whole of the blankets up; it is made expressly for me—I saw it when it was brought by the policeman—it was tied in a knot which was peculiar—the persons are here who tied them—I also wash blankets for the Penitentiary—they were not brought in bags, I received them in bulk—this blanket is a peculiar one; it had the three stripes of red in it—it has got a mark on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not know much about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My people will know better than I do—I am a dyer, and contract for the Government; I send in my bill when it suits me—I have been the contractor about eleven months this last time, and I was contractor ten years before—I may probably have received a thousand blankets during the eleven months; they all belong to Government, except those with the stripe—they belong to the Peniten<lb></lb>tiary—Ihave received perhaps 200 of them within the same period—here is a dark mark on this one; it is one of the Penitentiary blankets—it has got the three stripes on it, and here is the mark "W D" on it, and the broad arrow—it is War Department; the Penitentiary get their blankets from the War Department, probably—that is their business—I have undoubtedly sent to the War Department blankets marked as this one is—I contract with the Government, and they send me these to clean.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Johnson. I have examined these blankets, they are my employer's—I saw them safe on Saturday, 20th March, at No. 2, South Street, Whitechapel Road—that is the place of business—theywere all clean except this one before me with the red stripes, which was dirty—I had tied up a part of the blankets which were clean—when these</p>

               <p>blankets were brought to me I examined them, of course—I know them by the mark "T O" upon them; and these being in our possession some time, they had been tied up some time, and I find the mark of the string round the blankets—I examined the string that was brought; it is a part of the string we use in tying these up—the knot has been untied—we missed 100 blankets marked "T O," and one with red stripes—these are the marks on them—we fold them all the same way—these had been folded some time, and bear the stronger impression of the string.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>have seen blankets sold that have been once cleaned, but they have been used since—I am not able to say whether these have been sold, and they have the appearance of having been washed—the sale is advertised, and some large dealers come and buy them in large lots and sell them again—some prison blankets have been sold; I think some were, sold last Nov.—171—theywere marked differently—we do not mark these ourselves—they are marked at the War Department, at the Tower, and then they come from Millbank Prison—all the blankets that were sold in Nov. were like these—171or 181 were sold—I only go by memory—in 1857, 11,507 were sold in three sales.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Goulstone Street, Whitechapel, and am a whole<lb></lb>sale rag merchant. I have been in the habit of attending Government sales in the Dockyard and other places—I have bought blankets of this description to a very large extent; about seventeen or eighteen thousand of this sort and some "B O's"—I have bought blankets the same sort as this, with red stripes—the last lot I bought was 181, six or seven months ago; just the same sort—they are sold for dirty blankets, but there were a great many new ones and clean ones among them—I do not know that they had been cleaned they were clean—I have about thirty tons of different sorts—I have had dealings with the prisoner; I have sold him blankets, I dare say, ten or twelve times—once he bought 700—the last time I sold him any was about six months ago; at one time he bought 200; one time 50 and 100—I have sold him blankets of the description of these that are here within the last six months, 200, and 50, and 100—I cannot say whether he had any with red stripes; there have open striped ones among them—I cannot say whether he had any or not—when I buy them I put them all togelher—I cannot say whether the striped ones are used as wrappers to the others—I know he has been in the habit of dealing in these sort of things; he makes purchases of other persons as well as me—purchasers who buy them at the Dockyard, buy them in large quantities and sell them in small—I cannot say whether the prisoner has purchased at the Dockyard; he has at other places.</p>

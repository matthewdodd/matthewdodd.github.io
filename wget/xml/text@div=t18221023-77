On the 7th of October, in consequence of information from Atkins, I and an officer watched the prisoner about quarter past one o'clock, from Atkins's house, in Cecil-court, into Hawkes, Mosley, and Co's., Piccadilly, army accoutrement makers. I went in about five minutes, and found him offering three gross of buttons for sale, which were ours. I asked what he did there? he said, he only came with Atkins. I said,</p>
               <p>"I suspect you have been robbing me of buttons - these are mine;" he said,</p>
               <p>"They were Atkins's." Atkins (who was with him) said,</p>
               <p>"They are not, you want to get me transported as well as yourself;" he then said he had bought the metal and made them, and that Mr. Mosley had ordered twelve gross. Mr. Mosley came down and said, he had never seen him in his life; and had ordered none. I gave him in charge. We took stock a week ago, and found we were five gross deficient. They came out of our die, and are our metal; and it is impossible he could make them from his own metal.</p>

            . I was a burnisher, in the prosecutor's employment, four or five months ago. The prisoner came to me five or six weeks ago, and said he had an order from Hawkes, Mosley, and Co. for twelve gross of buttons, and wanted me to burnish them for him. He came to me on the morning of the 7th of October, about half-past eight o'clock, and left five gross to burnish, and said if I would do them by two o'clock we could go and sell them, for I knew the shop better than he did; I suspected him, and informed Mr. Bryan, as I knew his die. Mr. Bryan told me to burnish as many as I could by the time, and I did three gross. The prisoner called, and I set him to count them while I went out and told Mr. Bryan he was come. I returned - he said,</p>
               <p>"Here, you take them; I'll have no more to do with them." I said, I would have nothing to do with them; they were tied up, and we went to Hawkes's, and at the door he said,</p>
               <p>"You go in with them;" I said,</p>
               <p>"No; I'll go in with you." He went in and offered them for sale to the clerk, at 3 s. a gross; he had told me he would take 2 s. Bryan came in and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 53, Bunhill-row and Essex-street, Islington—on 15th July, I was called to the house in Lempster<lb></lb>terrace, and found the child in a dying condition—it was in a most filthy, offensive state, extremely emaciated, and all but dead—a bottle of medicine was standing near, of which a portion appeared to have been given, and had been ejected from the stomach, the child's linen was covered with it—I had a little warm milk given to it immediately, and then requested the persons in attendance to take it to the workhouse—it was suffering from diarrhoea—I think the death arose in part from the diarrhoea and the emaciation, in fact from inanition completely—I think the diarrhoea most likely arose from the debilitated condition into which the system was reduced—I apprehend that had been caused by want of food and care—I was not present at the post-mortem examination—assuming there was no internal disease, I do not think from the external symptoms that the child could have arrived at the state in which I saw it without great neglect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you know that the child was teething at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the diarrhoea was produced in part by that—the medicine that I saw was for diarrhoea—I cannot say whether it was a healthy-born baby or not; if the mother, during preguancy, had been in a starved con<lb></lb>dition,</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am medical officer of the Islington workhouse—on 15th July, about half-past 1, the child was brought to the workhouse—I went there to attend it, and found it lying on a bundle of rags, in a very filthy, emaciated condition—it had evidently been suffering from diarrhoea with <hi rend="italic">prolapsus ani,</hi> in consequence of the prolonged diarrhoea—I ordered it to be washed and attended to—it died about 4 o'clock that afternoon—I made a post-mortem examination next day—the brain was healthy and very little ensanguined, less than usual; the lungs were healthy, but not quite inflated, from want of power; the heart was also healthy; in the stomach we found a little food, which had been given according to my directions—that had not been ejected from the stomach after it was given; the whole intestines otherwise were entirely empty—I found no particular disease—I attribute the death to the continuance of the diarrhoea causing emaciation, and to apparent neglect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the diarrhoea have the effect of emptying the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the child appeared to have been neglected—a little cold milk, and small doses of brandy and water were given to it in the workhouse—those would be proper things to give it—the dirty appearance of the child indicated neglect—that would not cause its death—the diarrhoea caused the death—I heard before the Coroner that the prisoner's husband was a labourer in the docks—I don't know what his wages are—if she had applied to the work-house, anything would have been given her—it is never refused there, even though the father was in work—I believe that is generally known.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Angel-terrace—the deceased child was brought to me by one of the witnesses, I think, on 7th July—I was in the surgery at the time, my assistant saw it, and I concurred in what he gave it—it was medicine to check the diarrhoea—it was suffering from diarrhoea, that was caused probably in part by teething, but I judged it had chronic diarrhoea of long continuance—I could not form any positive infer<lb></lb>ence as to the care that had been taken of the child—from what I saw, it seemed to be in a very exhausted condition, but I am bound to say, that a great many children have been brought to me in a state of as great apparent neglect as this child; that apparent neglect might have arisen from disease—I observed no neglect beyond emaciation and want of food—if a child is not nourished by its food, there would be emaciation; in that case, it would be attributable to disease and not to neglect—I observed nothing that I could truly call neglect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter—I went to see her each day at the lying-in hospital—the baby was a very weakly-looking child from its birth—after she left the hospital, she used to come to see me with the baby sometimes where I was living, that was about twenty minutes walk from where she lived—I never saw the baby dirty, it always appeared to be clean—she never came to me inebriated—she has asked me for a few halfpence to get the baby food—she came one morning and said she was going to take it to the doctor's, and I gave her sixpence to pay for some medicine—I went with her to the surgeon's in Peter-street, and when we came from there, I assisted to put the child in a bath—the day before it died, I saw it put into a warm bath and its clothes washed—it used to sleep with mother and father I believe—they slept on the mattress—I have once or twice seen my mother the worse for drink—the child wore an old cotton frock, a petti<lb></lb>coat, and a little shirt, I think that was all—it had been ill ever since its birth—it had diarrhoea—my mother used to feed it with beef-tea and milk—I have seen her give it that—I work at the mantle work, in Banner-street, Whitecross-street.</p>

               <p>ROGER HINDE. I live in Norris-street, Hoxton - at half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 2d of April, Jane Johnson took hold of me, and I went down an alley with her - I went up a few stairs into a room where she took me - I was not there five minutes before she forced my handkerchief off my neck and ran off - I pursued her, and when I got to the top of the alley I overtook her - I said I would have my handkerchief again, but the male prisoner came up and rescued her from me - they went back, and I thought it was not safe to go after them - I went for the policeman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner E. Johnson. Q. Did not you say it was lost in the lane? A. No: I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you say that it was taken when you got a few steps in the passage? A. It was in the room, which is only a few steps up - the man did not use any force, but if I had gone back, perhaps he might - I had not hold of the woman when the man came up.</p>

             (police-constable G 140). I received information of this, and went to the prisoners' lodgings - I asked Jane Johnson for this handkerchief - she said she had not got it - I took her to the station-house - on the way she said she had got it, but would not give it to me - it was taken from her pocket at the station-house - the male prisoner did not say any thing.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did not she say that that was not enough, and you must leave your handkerchief? A. No: I did not say so before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Jane Johnson's Defence. I met him, and he asked to go home with me, which he did: he then said he had no money, but he would leave his handkerchief.</p>

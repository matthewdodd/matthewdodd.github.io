                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, College-terrace, Bond-street, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea—I carry on business as an oil and colourman. On Monday night, 21st June, I went to bed about 11 o'clock, my house appeared safe—we all went up to bed together as nearly as possible—in the front of my house I have a cellar, covered with boards which shut down, and on those boards I place some large water butts of a night—the water butts were on the boards that night—if any person were to move those butts and lift up the boards they could get into the front cellar, but not without a great deal of trouble—there is a communication from the front to the back cellar, which opens to a back yard, and the back parlour window opens into that yard; a person could get through that into the house—I was disturbed about 1 o'clock on Tuesday morning—my daughter came down and said something to me—I listened a little while, and we thought we heard a noise down stairs—we then went down and found the back parlour window open—it had been shut overnight—there had been a desk there, in which I kept my money—it bad been shut, and safe, when I went to bed—when I came down it was open—there were two drawers in it; I kept silver in one drawer, and gold in the other—the drawer in which the silver had been, was lying on the top of the flap of the desk, and the silver was gone—the gold drawer was quite safe—the room was in confusion, an ornament that I had on the mantelpiece and other things were removed—when we went into the shop I missed copper money out of the till, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from a shelf by the side of the counter—the policeman was knocking, in the shop, and he said, "Do you know your door is open?"—I said, "No"—I looked, and found it was open—it had been safe when we went to bed—if a person had got in at the back parlour window he could have let himself out at the front door—I missed about one pound of tobacco, out of a jar behind the counter.</p>

On Monday night, 21st of June, I was at a raffle at the Cheshire-cheese, at Chelsea—there were a good many persons there—I saw M'Donald and Doherty there, when I first went in at 8 o'clock—I left about ten minutes to I—the prisoners had been gone before I left—I did not see them long—my way home takes me past Mr. Cotton's shop; I live hut two doors from it—when I got there, I saw Doherty on the flap of the cellar, and M'Donald was close by—I passed them without saying anythiug, and after I had passed I heard the tubs move—I had to turn a corner soon after<lb></lb>wards, and when I turned I met Daley—I knew him—I had seen him about—I had not seen him at the Cheshire-cheese that evening—I had not seen him at all that night before I met him—I passed him, but did not speak to him—I saw Doherty about 2 o'clock the next day, in College-place—he spoke to me first, and asked where I was going—I told him I was going out for a walk, and I said his master had been after him to go out with his fruit (he lives in the same house that I do)—he said he did not mean to go out with any more fruit, he meant to go stealing—he said—"I must go now," and he went, and I did not see him till he was taken—when I met him he took some tobacco out of his right hand pocket, and filled his pipe and went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 3, Little Keppel-street, Fulham-road—I know M'Donald, I knew nothing of his being taken till the Thursday—I saw him on Tuesday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock in bed—I had not seen him on the previous night—I do not know what time he came to bed—I was in bed about 11 myself—he was not there then, but I found him in bed when I got up—he was in regular work as a plasterer.</p>

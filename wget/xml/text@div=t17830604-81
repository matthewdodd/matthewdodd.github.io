               <p>JOHN BROWN sworn.</p>
               <p>I had been at a brewer's, between two and three, for grains, I live with Mr. Rhodes, in Gray's Inn-lane, I lost 3 s. and a purse, I got the purse again; I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>How came she to be so near you? - She was walking along by my side, she followed me up Red Lyon-street, and asked me where I was going; she said, shall I go with you, I said I do not care where you go, she walked, alongside of me, and I found her hand in my breeches pocket, she pulled her hand out, and shoved it into her pocket, I took hold of her hand and said, what is that you have put in your pocket, I opened her hand, and there was the purse, she gave me the purse, but not the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you swear that your money was in the purse at the time she took it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had she been with you; had you no consideration for this, had you nothing to do with this woman? - No, nothing at all any more than as she was walking along the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him whether he did not send for me to make it up with him, if I would give him six shillings; I have witnesses in Court.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A woman that said she was her sister came to me, and I told her I could not make it up without going before the Justice where I had been before, I charged the watch with her then, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not approve to give him six shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you out so late? - I was walking, and the prosecutor asked me for a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw the woman before she spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Court. You had not been to any other public house in company with any other woman? - No, I was as sober as I am this minute.</p>

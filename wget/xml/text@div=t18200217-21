The prisoner took hold of my arm, and began talking about the roads being bad, and said he would help me along; I was walking steadily along I am certain. We walked on past Shadwell Office, he having hold of my arm; in passing Ratcliff-cross, some person from the footpath crossing the road, struck me a blow on my left temple, which knocked me down, and the prisoner fell on the top of me; in raising up again I found his hand taking my watch from my fob - I felt him doing it as he laid on the top of me. The man who knocked me down stood up by me; I am sure it was the prisoner's hand at my fob - I felt the watch go from my pocket while we were on the ground together; we rose up together and proceeded forward - I laid hold of his arm; the other man ran off before we got up. I observed to the prisoner that the man had run away with my watch; he said he saw him run up Butcher-row - I saw nothing pass between them; we then proceeded to my house. About 150 yards from my house another man came up and talked to him, then took hold of my arm, and we all three walked home together.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to observe to the prisoner that the other man had run away with your watch - A. I knew the prisoner had taken it, but I did not want to charge him with it until I got home, as I knew an officer who lived near me; I thought he might escape before I could give him in charge. When I got home I called the watchman, gave him in charge, and went to the watch-house with him myself; I was quite able to recollect what passed, and am quite sure the prisoner took the watch from my fob.</p>

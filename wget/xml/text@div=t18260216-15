               <p>JUAN ANTONIO COVIAN (through an interpreter). I have lodged six months at Delia Bailey's house - and keep my money in my bed-room closet. About eight days before this robbery the prisoner came to my house to inquire for another Spaniard - I did not know him before. On the 21st January I was out all day - I returned about six o'clock in the evening and took some money from the cupboard, to get my dinner; I then left two sovereigns and four half crowns safe in the closet, which was not locked. I returned from dinner at seven o'clock, and missed it all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the people of the house access to the room? A. Yes.</p>

On Saturday, the 21st of January, after six o'clock, the prisoner called, and asked for Covian - I said he was not at home, and it was uncertain when he would be in - he said if he waited till eleven o'clock he must see him - I then shewed him into Covian's bed-room, staid a few minutes with him, then went into the front room on the same floor - I had not been there more than five minutes when I heard him rattling money; I entered the room and saw some half-crowns in his hand - immediately on my entering the room he said "I cannot wait any longer, and will see Mr. Covian to-morrow morning" - he then went away, and nobody else entered the room till Covian returned, nor had any body, except me, been there since he went out - he missed his money immediately he returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember when Covian went out? A. About six o'clock - I was in his room, or the adjoining one all the time he was out - I am quite certain nobody but the prisoner was in the room. Next morning Covian missed some shirts and handkerchiefs from his linen - I did not observe that the prisoner had any bundle - the room door remained open while he was there.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Westminster. Covian informed me of his loss about ten o'clock at night - I took the prisoner in Great Windmill-street, at two o'clock in the morning of the 22d of January, and at the watch-house two sovereigns, two half-crowns, a shilling, and three half-pence, were found on him - he was in liquor. On the way to the watch-house I asked if he knew Covian - he said Yes; that he lived in Bridgewater-street, Somers-town; I said "That is the gentleman you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160017"></xptr>>been robbing;" he said "I was drunk - I did not know what I was doing."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a native of South America, but have lived in very respectable situations in this country for many years - I received this money from former employers - I had received three sovereigns from a Mr. Holland - George Baring, Esq. also, in the same week, gave me some money, and Mrs. Sharp, of Park-lane, did the same. My landlady can swear to my having a considerable sum about me the whole of the week. Some clothes were lost at the time, and the servant knows that I had no bundle when I left the house. Is it not likely that the person who stole the clothes also stole the money. My business with the prosecutor was to gain a situation. My character could be borne testimony to by George Baring, Esq. (I was his butler eight years); also to William Baring, Esq. - also Mr. Johnstone, deceased, of Gloucester-place, and in the establishments of Mrs. Sharp and General Taunton, both of Park-lane.</p>

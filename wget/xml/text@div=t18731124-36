                  </hi>. I am one of the association called the Orange and Fruit Porters' Gang, which consists of fifty fellowship porters—they earnmoney by loading and unloading fruit vessels in the Port of London—theprisoner has been employed as clerk and manager since 1867—he received 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, out of which he had to pay two boys—he received all themoneys from the brokers' ships, an account of his receipts and disburse<lb></lb>ments—if he wanted money he applied to me—I advanced him 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in October, 1872, and he gave me this receipt for it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Free haslooked into his books since he left—on 31st July we gave him notice toleave, and he left on 6th September—on the night he left he handed overto me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him if that was the correct balance—he said "Yes"—after Mr. Free had gone into the accounts a statement was made out of 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the prisoner after that till he was in custody, but Ireceived this letter from him on 8th September—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated September</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">and stated</hi>: "Dear Jack, I am sorry to inform you that there is adeficiency in my accounts, which I shall expect you to keep to yourself. Iwas surprised when I balanced to-day to find it so, but there it is and itcannot be altered at present. Since the gang so kindly informed me myservices would be no longer required I have been gambling very heavy, andhave got rid of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Of course you are aware, as well as Mr. Free, that we have during the last three years received from Mr. Grant alarge sum we were not entitled to, that amount you are aware has gone tothe Gang's credit, I have not received one penny. I simply mention this tokeep you silent. If I succeed I will send you the amount I amdeficient. I have pawned my watch to pay my fare to Paris, &amp;c. Signed E.

Adams, Keeling, and Grant, the items, and name the amounts you have knowinglyreceived from them which you were not entitled to. You know I havepointed out the discrepancies to you, and you have distinctly said 'Letthem pass, they will not be found out. 'which so far has turned out correct. There is no excuse for you, the amount so obtained has gone direct to yourfund; I have not received one penny benefit, so I think you will have badluck if I bring these matters to light. Would you believe theamounts you have received make a total of 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? it seems a very largeamount, but then you know the errors were so numerous. Theamount I consider I owe you is 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I received from you, which I did not enter, I declare most solemnly was a pure accident, I wasastounded when you produced the receipt. I shall leave London to-night; it is no use your going to expense to try to find me, you will find Ihave got nothing if you do, &amp;c.")—I also received this letter from Newgate Gaol, in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This requested the witness to take the opinion of the men as to whether the prisoner was to be subjected to any further prose<lb></lb>cution</hi>)—Messrs. Grant have not been defrauded, and the prisoner never said Ia word to me about it—no overcharges have been made to Hunt, or Keeling, or Adams; I have been to all the brokers—the prisoner never named to me Ithat he was overcharging them—I took the opinion of some of the Committee I—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the only two books I have had from the prisoner; Ithey are in his writing.</p>

This 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which is brought forward in thisbook is supposed to be part of what I have stolen, but if last year's wages-book is produced, it will show that the 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought forward by me, Ihaving paid it out of my own pocket to make the accounts up. Therewas not enough money, and I used money belonging to myself to make upthe payments, and that is brought forward here. When I wrote, I ad<lb></lb>mitted that I owed 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had received money in 1871 and 1872 amountingto 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as I had paid the money out of my own pocket I should havepocketed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but instead of doing so I wrote it into the account, andkept the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out, so I was cheating myself of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. When the deficiencyoccurred, I tried to account for it, but could not till Mr. Wontner producedthe receipts. If last year's balance sheet and wages book are produced, Ithink they will prove that what I say is correct With regard to Bloom-field saying that the men are not of opinion that I should be let off, it isentirely false.

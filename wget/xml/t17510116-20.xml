The windows next the road have shutters to them, the other in the yard have not. On monday morning, as I was going out about 7 o'clock, I missed my hat, going into the hall, there I found the shoes, which the overseers and churchwardens had sent in, and the child's clothes were gone. We had five dozen of shoes, but I had disposed of some of them, so I can't be exact as to the number, but I believe there were forty pair left, which were taken away; I let the overseers know of it, and we did what we could to find them. One Ross, who was cast last sessions, gave us a slender account of them, but would not tell the person's names, &amp;c. The next was Clements the prisoner, I went to him in Clerkenwell Bridewell, with the two overseers; there he confessed every thing voluntarily, and his confession agreed with this account by the evidence. Westley own'd to the fact, that he was on the outside, and took the things, &amp;c. And before the Justice, they were all for being admitted evidences. There was neither threats or promises made them, to induce them to confess.</p>

Bisben and Clements were taken up on suspicion, about a week or eight days before this confession; Bisben was committed to Tothill-fields Bridewell, and Westley was taken in the mean time; then the confession came out by Clements. We sent for the prosecutor with a view to have him admitted an evidence; they all confessed, expecting each to be an evidence against the others; one said he could tell more than the other, the other could tell more than he; so it came all out.</p>

They fetch'd a man who look'd like a gentleman, he took them away in a bag; I was with them at the Adam and Eve, in Jewin-street, he paid them some money; they treated me all the next day, and would have had me went to the play with them.</p>

            . About the latter end of September, Clements and I went over into Tindal's burying ground; Westley said without side, at a house where was no window shutter, we took out a pane of glass; Clements put in his hand and opened the window and went in, and handed out a copper pottage-pot, four pair of stockings, one shift, mark'd with S, and two checque aprons; we were there about a quarter of an hour, Westley staid till we came back; we three came from near Rag-fair to get what we could, but had not this house particularly in view, when we set out; our intent there, was to see for some linen in the back yards.

We carried the things to our room, we sold the stockings and aprons in Rag-fair the same day to a stranger, for 4 s. and 6 d. we had 18 d. each; one

            . I live in Brownstreet, Bunhill-row. The back part of my house looks into Bunhill-fields burying ground. On Sept. 26 at night I fastened all my windows, in the morning when my servant got up, she found one of the lower windows open; these things mentioned in the indictment were missing. I never saw the things again.</p>

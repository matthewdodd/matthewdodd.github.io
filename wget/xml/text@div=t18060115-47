               <p>Q. What do you mean by answering the bell? - A. She knocked with the chair, she slept over my head. I did not hear her come down stairs, I rung the bell again, I heard her go down stairs then by my door, which she passed to go to the kitchen, I heard her open the kitchen windows. I am generally up the second in my house if I am well. In about five or ten minutes I heard my house-bell ring, which was my shop boy, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150034"></xptr>sleeps not in my house: she immediately let him in, I heard his voice talking to the girl. After that she came up to my room door, knocked with her finger and then opened the door and came to my bed side; she said come down, your house is robbed, and your gold and silver things are about the floor; she had some in her hand that she said she picked up at the street door. I immediately got up and come down stairs, I looked to see whether my door was wrenched, or bolts broke, or any of the windows were broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing of that kind happen? - A. No, it was as safe as when it was shut up in the evening. I saw some large silver buckles, and one gold ring lay on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any drawer opened? - A. Yes, there was a drawer half open in the shop window, where these things were kept. The gold rings were found afterwards by the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came there was the door shut? - A. Yes, and the shutters were all fast as I left them the night before, the prisoner let me in.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened? - A. When she opened the door, she said, the door is upon a single lock, (the chain was not up); I heard her open the spring lock, she said we shall have the shop robbed.</p>

The maid came back to me and shewed me two ear-rings she had picked up, she said they were on the floor, she gave them to me; upon which I told her she had better call master down, I then said, stop a minute, I will see if any thing has gone out of the drawer. I went in to the other room and saw the drawer half open; I asked her if any one had been in the shop after I left it last night, she said no one; I told her I would take the shutters down and see if any thing was gone out of the drawer; upon which she went down into the cellar, I then took the shutters down, and upon examining the drawer, I found almost all the gold rings out of it; I went to the top of the cellar stairs and told her to go and tell my master, she went up, and called him down, he came down; afterwards I saw the cellar searched by Gill the officer, and after he had searched all about, the cellar, he found these gold ear-rings and finger-rings in the saw-dust; they were wrapped up in a knife-cloth in the cellar, were the maid had come from.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated that the door of the shop that she let you in was on the single lock, how was the other door of the shop? - A. That was bolted as I had left it the night before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go away? - A. About half past nine o'clock at night, that is my usual time of going away.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of the Thames police: on Tuesday the 10th of December last, I searched different parts of the house; I then went into the coal cellar, after moving a great deal of wood that was there, I searched a heap of saw-dust in one corner of the cellar, there I found a knife-cloth with a quantity of gold rings wrapped up in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What number? - A. Thirty-four finger rings and forty-three pair of ear-rings and one odd one. These are the rings.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutor) Look at these rings and tell me whether you know them to be your property or not? - A. I know them to be my own writing, the selling price is to them, they were in my drawer the night before I was alarmed of the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150035"></xptr>Q. They were put upon a paper as they are now with the price written with your own hand? - A. Exactly; on this paper there is three pair and an odd one, they stand me in about six shillings a pair; here is two pair, they are six shillings a pair; here is two pair, they are worth seven shillings a pair; another parcel there is three pair, they are eight shillings and sixpence a pair; two pair five shillings and two pence a pair; two pair at five shillings and six-pence a pair; one pair at five shillings and six-pence; three pair at five shillings a pair; one pair five shillings a pair; five pair at three shillings a pair; there is eight pair more of ear-rings but they are off the paper, they are of different prices, we will say five shillings a pair; and these are finger rings, they are upon black velvet as we keep them in the drawer; there are thirty-four finger rings, from two shillings to ten shillings or eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that these were in your drawer the day before? - A. Yes, I always go round my shop every night, to see that my locks and bolts are right, and my fire and candles out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen these things in the drawer the day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives in this house besides yourself; your wife and servant maid? - A. My two sons and one daughter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Very little gold in any of these things? - A. I trust they are gold, I have no rings made but what are Hall marked; we buy none but of the makers.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you swear to them is, you had gold rings of that description on black velvet; supposing any body had brought you these gold rings on black velvet at any other place, could you have sworn to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that is the only reason that makes you think they are yours. You have one daughter and two sons, is the other son here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your daughter here? - A. No, she knows nothing about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

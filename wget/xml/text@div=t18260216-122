On the 24th of December a lad came into my shop and inquired for an article; I turned to get it, and saw him take seven handkerchiefs off the counter which were safe a minute before, and put them into his breeches - I jumped over the counter and secured him - I sent him to the watch-house, but he got out - he was about the prisoner's height, but I do not know that it was him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take the boy, and was taking him to the watch-house when I met a watchman who took him - I asked him his name, and he told me Christopher Cook - I knew his father, and went to him on the Monday, to get the lad, but he was gone - I then offered a reward, and this boy was taken, but I do not think it was him.</p>

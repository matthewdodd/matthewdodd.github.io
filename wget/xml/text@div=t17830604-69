               <p>Court. Could Whittenburg see from that desk what was done in the warehouse? - Yes, Sir, I came out of the counting-house into the warehouse, and saw two pieces of printed cotton lay near the warehouse door to Friday-street, they were laying withinside of the warehouse, and I saw the prisoner at the bar running up the street, the other witness was running after him, he was stopped half way up the street; Whittenburg laid hold of his collar, and we brought him back into the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there any wood or any thing before your desk? - Nothing only the plain desk; I saw the prisoner with two pieces of cotton in his hand, he was carrying it towards the door, I called out to him; they were piled up in the middle of the warehouse, he removed it about two or three yards, I immediately called out to him, and he let them drop, and set out, and I after him; I am sure of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was he ever out of your sight? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you took him, and brought him back? - He said nothing to me.</p>

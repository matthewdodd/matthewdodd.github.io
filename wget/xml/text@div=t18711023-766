                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant Y</hi>). On 15th September I went to the prisoner's house—I had some difficulty in getting in—I got to the bedroom and knocked at the door; it was opened by a woman—I did not see the prisoner on entering, but I found him concealed in a cupboard, on the floor—I read the warrant to him, which I had had two months, and while I was doing so he passed this pocket-book to a woman who was in bed—it contains two cheques on the London and County Bank; one is filled up and signed H. W. Morgan, the other is blank—he told me at the Police Court that they were given him by a man named Collins—he said at the station that he had been doing a little work for a man named Williams, and had it given to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I was in bed, then, with my two little boys, and yet he calls it a cupboard; how big was the cupboard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>The door was about a yard wide; it was a sleeping place—there was some clothing on the floor—I heard a conversation before I went in—you said that a man named Williams had received 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the cheque, and I told the Magistrate so—you gave Williams's address, and I went there, but could never see him—he has absconded, I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he been there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>Yes—he carried on business there for a few weeks—he is a builder, and they told me he had an office there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. In the month of June I was introduced to Williams, to make out a lot of builder's estimates, for which I was to have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me he had received a cheque from a customer, and would I accept that, and leave him the balance. I took it to my landlord, and told him how I came by it, and asked him to discount it; it was payable to bearer. If I got it dishonestly it is not likely I should put my name on it. It was not crossed. I waited in the house three days afterwards, and paid him a week in advance.</p>

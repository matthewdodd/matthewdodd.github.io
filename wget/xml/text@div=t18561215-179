                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Cross-street, Bermond<lb></lb>sey New Town. I have known the prisoner about nine or ten months, he lived near me—on 13th Nov., he came to my shop and said, "I want to ask you a favour, it is not for myself, but for a particular friend of mine, it is to cash an advance-note for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he wants the money and he does not want to go to a Jew's, for he will have to take it out in clothes"—I said it was not in my power at present, but if he would call again I would consider of it—he called again in about an hour, and said, "Well, will you oblige me?"—I said, "I have been considering it, and if you think it is safe I will, but I shall have to distress myself very much to do so, for it is money that I have to pay away"—he said, "It is perfectly safe, I assure you, for I know the man as well as my own brother, I have sailed several voyages with him"—and he said, "You can take the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that Mrs. Gage owes you out of it, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound I will allow you for doing it"—Mrs. Gage is the woman he lives with—I did not give him cash, I gave him a note for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable at Wilson's, at Dock-head, on Saturday morning (this was on Thursday evening)—he said, most likely he should get it from Mr. Wilson to-morrow—I said, "You can please yourself about that"—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash, deducting the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for doing it—I saw him again the next afternoon—I always knew him by the name of Minton—I said to him, "Mr. Minton, I think I have done a very foolish thing by paying you that money; when I came to look at the note this morning, it was not stamped"—he said, "Oh, dear, is it not?"—I said, "No; perhaps you will be kind enough to call and put one on"—and he said, "I will"—he called, I think, next morning, and asked me for the note, and put a stamp on the back and signed this name, "Hudson," on the stamp—I saw him do it—I gave him the pen and ink, and stood by him while he did it—he said to me, "Shall I put my own name on it"—I said, "I know nothing at all about it"—he said, "I think it will be best to put the same name as is on the note"—I did not say anything, he did as he thought proper, I told him to please himself—when he gave me the note, I saw the name of Hudson on it—what he said was, "Shall I put the name Minton, or this name?"—I am sure he said so—he said, "Shall I put the name of Minton, or the name in which the note is made out?"—I said he might please himself—when I re<lb></lb>ceived the note from him, he said, "You will not have longer to wait for your money than a fortnight"—I met him several times after that, but nothing more passed about the note till it became payable—I think I let it be for some time after the fortnight, because it did not suit me to go for it—I met the prisoner on a Tuesday morning, and said to him, "I think, Mr. Minton, if I can make it convenient this afternoon, I shall go for that note"—he</p>

               <p>said, "Well, I should not be in a particular hurry"—I said, "I don't know that I can go to-day"—he said, "Perhaps it will be as well to leave it till to-morrow"—that was all that passed then—I met him again about 4 or 5 o'clock that same evening; he said, "Have you been after that note?" I said, no, I had not, but my mistress was gone that way, and she was going to call for it—he said, "Good morning," and walked away—I went and presented the note at No. 23, St Mary Axe—I did not find any one carrying on business or residing there named Hill and Co.—I inquired at a great many offices and places, but could not find Hill and Co.—on that same evening, I went to No. 9, Queen's-road, Bermondsey, with a policeman—the prisoner lives there—I saw him, and said, "Are you aware that this is a forged note that you have given me?"—he said, "I am not aware of it"—I asked him if he could settle the bill with me—he said, no, that was not in his power—I said, "Can you let me have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "I can't, what time will you give me to pay it?"—I said, "I don't know, I want the money very badly, you know I distressed myself very much to let you have it; if you can let me have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it will be acceptable to-night"—he said, "I can't, but if you will let it be till 12 to-morrow, I will make it up and give it you"—I then gave him into custody.</p>

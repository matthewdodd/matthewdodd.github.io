                  </hi>. I live at 30, Kirby-street, Snow-fields, and am a night watchman to Henry Grey, a lighterman of Water-lane—on the afternoon of the 23d August, I went to the London Docks, to the Shadwell basin, to look after the lighter Kenmtt—she is the property of Henry Grey—I went on board between twenty minutes and half-past 8; there was nobody on the barge then—it was laden with ten hogsheads of rum—I bad been there about ten minutes when I heard a footstep on the gunwale of the barge, and I asked who was there—the officer replied, "It is me;" that is, Wenman, he is a Custom-house officer—I knew he had gone to take charge of the rum—he went about half-past 3 in the afternoon—Wenman then came down into the cabin and said, "Are you going to stop here?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have a friend on deck; I am going for a few minutes," and went out, of the cabin—he returned in a short time and said, "Are you going to stop all night?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I don't think it is any use me stopping, I think I will go home "—I said, "That you can do as you please about; I am not going to leave charge of the craft"—he said, "My friend does not go away till 10 o'clock," and went out oi the cabin—he had been gone some little time and came back and said, "It is'only now about half-past 9"—he stopped ten minutes or a little more and then said, "I will now bid you good-night"—I saw no more of him till he was in custody on the quay—I had one other lighter to look after, a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Elbe</hi>, laden with flour—I was not always on board the <hi rend="italic">Kennett</hi>—I did not see Brownson till I saw him in custody on the quay—I went an shore to have a look at my other barge—Cooper called me; I went up to him and he asked me what I bad there—I said a barge loaded with sugar, rum, and molasses—the prisoners were both there and could hear that—he asked me if I knew either of them—I said, "Yes, I know Wenman; he has charge of the barge"—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "They have got some rum about them"—I was detained on the quay till the inspector came—I did not take any rum; nobody could come on the barge without Wenman's knowledge—he showed himself about four times—there was nobody on board the barge when I went away.</p>

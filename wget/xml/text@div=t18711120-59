                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, at 65, High-street, Gravesend—in September last I was travelling from Strood about 10 o'clock—I got out at Gravesend for the purpose of speaking to the guard—I was not in time to get into the same carriage again, and got into another compartment—I had left a bag in the carriage containing various articles—when the train stopped again I got into the same carriage—I found the bag there, and the prisoner and another girl—I examined the bag afterwards, and missed a ring, some pieces of crystal, a ring without stones, a breast-pin, and other things, of the value of about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen the ring and a piece of crystal since, which I have recovered—I lost a mourning ring with an inscription on it, "John Steddolph,"With the date of the death.</p>

I am the wife of Robert James Warren, a jeweller at Woolwich—the last week in September the prisoner and another girl came into the shop and left this ring to be repaired—they left this piece of crystal to be cut into four stones and put into the ring—they never called again for it—the prisoner was in the shop, but the other girl left the ring—a stouter and bigger girl than the prisoner—I am not quite certain that the prisoner is one of those two girls, but I know she has been to my shop.</p>

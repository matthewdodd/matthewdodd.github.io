               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe it is customary for clerks to drink at every house they go to; you were perfectly sober? - A. I was not perfectly sober; I was a little merry; I perfectly recollect every thing that passed.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. Did you happen to be in the Whitechapel-road? - A. Yes; on the 26th of May, about eleven o'clock at night; I saw the prosecutor fall; I saw the prisoner take his foot in his hand, and he said, he has broke my foot, or toe; and while he was hopping off, another man sat him against the wall.</p>

               <p>Q. When the man fell, are you sure the prisoner at the bar is one of the men? - A. Yes; it was not very light then, but it was light enough for me to see the man; I took notice of his features; he was very well dressed, but the colour of his coat I cannot tell; when he hopped round me he looked me full in the face, and went off towards Bow: my wife was with me, we had been at Bow Fair, she looked more at the man on the ground that she did at this man; there was another man taken up on suspicion, and they were both together in the lock-up house, and when she saw this man, this, said she, is him; and when she looked at the other, she said, that is not him.</p>

On Sunday night the 18th of January last, about half after six at night, I locked the door of my apartment. The house is let out in a variety of apartments to different lodgers; I locked the door, and took the key out of the door, and put it into my pocket, and went up stairs to drink tea with Mrs. Watts, who is a lodger in the house; a person, whose name is Underwood, brought a letter to Mrs. Watts; as Mrs. Watts was lighting him down stairs again, when she came near the bottom of the stairs, she called out to me, that my parlour door and my street door were open; I immediately came down stairs, and desired that if any body was found there, that they would secure them. The person who brought the letter took him in the middle of the room; he had not taken any thing.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Whether you have not declared that you could not positively say that the door was locked? - To the best of my knowledge I locked the door; but I did say, I could not swear it till I had enquired of the smith whether there was, or not, a possibility, that if I turned the key in the door, it could happen that the door might not be locked; the smith said, it could not be that in so good a lock as that, the key could be turned in it, but the door must be locked; therefore from the best of my knowledge the door was locked.</p>

He refused to be searched till a constable came; then he was searched, and several pick-lock keys and a tinder-box, in which there was some lighted tinder, and a turn-screw were found upon him, and there was a wax-taper found in the room. The scutcheon upon the key hole of the door of this parlour was removed from its usual place as if done by violence. The prisoner did not make much resistance when he was taken, but he went down on his knees, and asked forgiveness of Mrs. Ashton.</p>

               <p>To the prosecutor. Did any such person lodge at your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Underwood.

There was a bag found in the room, but I did not hear any body say who it belonged to.</p>

               <p>I picked up this bag with a parcel of breeches and things in it; I went up to this house; a man stood at the door; I asked him whether Mrs. Smith lodged there; he said, he could not tell; I went into the passage, then another man came out; I went to the stair-foot; then Mrs. Watts came down, and called out to Mrs. Ashton, here is a man, and your door is open. Then the man laid hold of me, and asked me what business I had there? I told him. Then the bag was produced, and a man was taken to the watch-house, but they let him out next day upon bail, and he has not since been heard of; I was never in the parlour; I was only in the passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any other person taken up?</p>
               <p>Ashton. Yes; a man who was seen at the door was taken up on suspicion; there was nothing against him, and he was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-merchant and wharfinger, at Tothill-street. I have a warehouse at 97—I keep corn in sacks there—on 17th Jan. I inspected some corn mixture in the hands of the police—it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have no doubt it is mine—Quincey was in my employ—on 15th Jan. he had to carry fifty sacks of barley to the New Cross-station—he had no business with any empty sacks.</p>

               <p>stable, corresponds with mine—it is clover-chaff, and there is a peculiar sort of beans and oats amongst it—here are black and white oats—all corn<lb></lb>chandlers sell chaff, but the mixture that was in my bag is not sold by corn<lb></lb>chandlers—my man limited to take out a nose bag of food for each horse—he was not to take sacks—I do not know what work my horses had to do that day, it depends upon the carman—sometimes they stop on the road, and do not get back for several hours—a nose-bag contains, perhaps, a peck—I have not brought nay of the mixture from my own bin, as I was satis<lb></lb>fied about it—the first day Quincey was given in charge, he was discharged—I afterwards spoke to Salmon—I said nothing about money, nor gave him any—his father worked for me some time ago.</p>

                  </hi>. On 15th Jan. I went out with Quincey, with his wagon—I assisted him to load it with barley, at Shott's wharf, Rotherhithe—I went up to the stable at six o'clock that morning—he had fifty quarter sacks in the wagon, three new empty sacks, and some horses' food in one of Mr. Shott's sacks—there were three nose-bags—I filled them—Quincey put the food into sack—I hung the nose-bags on the wagon, and Quincey told me to put the horses' victuals at the top of the gateway till he came round with the wagon—I then went down to the warehouse, and he had eleven sacks of flour in the wagon—he then came up to the gateway, took the horses' victuals, and we went to the Saxe Coburg—he took the sack of horses' victuals and the three new sacks into the shed—he wanted me to get up into the wagon and get them out—I went to the privy, and when I came back I saw the two prisoners talking together—I did not hear what they said—we then went to the Brighton Railway and to Deptford, with the flour,—we delivered the fifty sacks of barley at the New Cross-station.</p>

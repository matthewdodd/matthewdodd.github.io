               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What quantity of grains did you send for? - A. Seventeen quarters.</p>

(Produces the sack the grains were in).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare the grains? - A. I got a man to drive the waggon home to the farmer's house; I did not compare the grains.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This was at twelve o'clock at noon day? - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. So that Warren took the grains from off the sack? - A. Yes; the sack was covered.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what grains were contained in the sack? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never heard since, not at the Magistrate's, that they were of a different quality? - A. I heard the people say that saw them, that they were the same vinegar grains; I am no judge, and therefore don't know it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never looked into the sack at all; who did the sack belong to? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Prosecutor). Q. Where is your other man? - A. He is not here; I did not know that I had any occasion for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish the grains? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined the grains? - A. Yes; but I cannot take upon myself to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To the Prosecutor.) Q. Tomlins was bailed? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. That sack is not your sack? - A. No; it belongs to one Winter, a cornfactor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. We cannot go on with this business; for in the first place, there is nobody to prove this property; no doubt but this was his property, but it was in a sack separated from the grains in the cart; if any body had seen the grains, that would be evidence to prove they were his grains. As they are in a sack, and as Stevenson cannot prove the property, therefore, I believe you must dispose of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my uncle, in Blackman-street, Borough. On the afternoon of Tuesday, 2nd Feb., I saw the three prisoners at our shop—I afterwards watched, and saw them go into Mr. Clark's shop—I then saw two of them come out, and the other one shortly afterwards—it was then about four o'clock—I watched them for more than an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Catherine Clark, a widow, who carries on the business of a draper, in Waterloo-road. On the afternoon of 2nd Feb. the three prisoners came into our shop—Albury asked for some lace—I showed her some—she said there was none to suit her—there was a collar on the counter—one of the prisoners took it in her hand—my mother saw them from the parlour window—she came and took it from her—they then left the shop—Clear came in, and from what he said, I looked into the window, and missed some ribbon, which I had placed there about half an hour before—it was not on a block, but loose—clear and I then followed the prisoners—they went to the New-road, and stopped at Mr. Lawrence's shop—we saw them take something from there—they then went into a kind of recess—I went for a policeman—we found them together, and charged them with having taken the ribbon—they said they had not taken it, and did not know anything about it—I saw the ribbon in Hoare's hand—she said it was not mine—I gave them in charge—when we got to the station, I did not see the ribbon again—I knew the ribbon—it was my mother's—there were thirty-five yards of it, as near as I can guess.</p>

She laid down a sovereign, which I took up, and found it a good one. I had laid her down the change, 18 s. 2 d., she then hesitated, and said it was not for herself, and the person she bought it for would think it too dear. (I had told her the price as soon as she laid the sovereign down,) and she thought she should not take it. I took the change off the counter, and pushed the sovereign back to her, she took it up; she then said she would take it. I tendered her the change again; she put a sovereign across the counter. I never suspected it, concluding it was the same; and she went away with the change and soap. I discovered it was a bad one when I went to put it into my purse. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When she put the sovereign down you told her the price - A. I cannot speak to that. I did not tell her the price till she offered to pay. The counter was between us, She took the sovereign up and held it, as I thought, between her fingers and thumb. I discovered it was bad before I put it into my purse, and did not put it in. I had put it into my pocket first; there was no other sovereign there; it has not been in my possession ever since, but it was marked about a fortnight afterwards, and I can swear to it; it was in my pocket all that time, except when I produced it at Guildhall. I shewed it to several people myself, but never lost sight of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Is this the sovereign - A. It is. I put it into a paper, and put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. SEWELL. I am assistant to the solicitor of the Mint. This sovereign is counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not officers of the Mint who know the coin - A. Yes. They are only examined in capital prosecutions. I have been clerk to the solicitor of the mint for thirty years, and attend particularly to business of this description.</p>

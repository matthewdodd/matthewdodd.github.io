On the 10th of August I saw the prisoner - I have known him for the last twelve years; he came into the shop and took a piece of leather out of the basket, looked at it, and asked for some others. I had some suspicion, and took notice of what I put before him. He looked at them and asked for some others; and while I was getting them, he reached over, and slipped down two pieces by the side of the counter, and caught them with his knee. He then bought a pair of me for 71/2d., which he paid for, and went out; I pursued him, and met the constable in the street - we went to his lodgings. He had been home, and was gone out again; we wanted to search, but his wife would not let us, unless we had a warrant - we went to the office, and they told us to go back and break the door open. We went back and found these two pieces of leather in a pan of water, which they had not been in above four or five minutes. I can swear to them - we found the prisoner in Newport-market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. But he has bought a great number of pieces of leather of you, and whether these were not some of them you cannot tell? A. Yes; I can - I had bought this one pair that day, and they have particular veins on them; being in water so short a time will not alter them.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with the witness and found these pieces of leather in a pan.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought a pair of soles for 71/2d.; for which I paid - and if he had any suspicion he naturally would have given an alarm, it being in the middle of the day; I went straight home to my dwelling - I left the inner soles, and went towards the Strand - when I was going down Newport-market I met a man I knew, and while talking to him the prosecutor and the constable came up and charged me with the robbery. They took these two pairs of soles from my apartment, where there were several pairs, all with the prosecutor's mark - they had all been bought at his shop.</p>

            . I live at No. 30, Little New-street, and am a shoemaker. Leather being steeped in water, makes it browner - this part appears to have been in water as high as this mark; being in water will alter the appearance so materially as to make it difficult for a person to identify it.</p>

            . I am a bootmaker, and live at No. 33, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square. The effect of steeping leather in water will alter the colour, so that no man can identify it. There is nothing at all uncommon in the appearances of these two pieces of leather.</p>

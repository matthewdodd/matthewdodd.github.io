On the 27th of March, about a quarter past six in the morning, I was in company with the prisoner, a woman, and one Price - I did not know the prisoner before, I fell in company with him, about a quarter past one in the morning, at the Bunch of Grapes. I paid for a pot of porter for him in the course of the morning, and three for Price, as they had no change. They said, if I went to Whitechapel they could get change - we went to Wentworth-street, and then to the <placeName id="t18210606-140-crimeloc816">Compasses in Brick-lane</placeName>

Price said, he thought I could give change - I said, I could not; and to satisfy them, I pulled out what silver I had and four 1 l. notes. The prisoner snatched my notes out of my hand, and run out of the tap-room door, and I after him - Price followed, and tripped me up in the street. I saw Harris running; Price was brought back and taken to the watch-house - he was tried and convicted last Session. I did not see the prisoner till the 7th of May, when he was taken.</p>

            . I keep the Compasses. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning the prosecutor came in with Price, the prisoner, and a woman - Price produced a bit of paper, and asked me to give change - I cannot say whether it was a note or not. Price asked me to trust him a pot - I said, No; and they might leave the house. I heard a bustle as I was lighting my fire, and saw the prisoner and another running out. I did not see Carter produce his money, but heard money jink.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. I was in Wentworth-street, and saw the prisoner, Carter, Price, and a woman, before they went into the Compasses. Price and the woman were arm-in-arm. I saw them go in and come out of a coffee-shop - I watched them into the Compasses - the prisoner and Price ran out very fast. I went in, heard every thing quiet, and went away. I searched Price at the watch-house, and found no note on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Denmark Road, Ham<lb></lb>mersmith—on Saturday, 11th July, about 12 o'clock, I was with a man named Smith in the Hand and Flower public-house, Fulham—I saw the prisoner there—I had not known him before—he called me a West End thief and a bloodsucker—I had not spoken to him before this—I said, "I am much obliged to you"—he came and shook hands with me—I said I did not wish to have a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with him, and he said he wished to have a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with somebody—he said he had been to the back woods of America, where he had killed many a black b——, and chucked him behind the bush—I asked him to sing a song, and then the potman came in—the prisoner began knocking him about, and then he commenced knocking me about—he asked me what song he should sing, and I said, "The Sailor's Grave"—I and Smith then left the public-house and the prisoner followed—he passed by us and crossed the road—he went about twenty yards before us towards Ham<lb></lb>mersmith, and all of a sudden he rolled against the shutters—he held his hand out, and said he would shoot the first b——that came near him—Stacey then came up, and asked what the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was about—I had seen him in the public-house about five minutes before—he had no conversation with the prisoner while I was there—the prisoner made a rush towards him and said, "There, take that"—Stacey called out, "I am stabbed"—the prisoner's hand was down when he rushed at Stacey—he pulled down his trousers, and showed me the wound; the blood was streaming down then—a young man named Bedborough came up, and caught hold of the prisoner's hand; I then saw a knife in his hand which I had not seen before—he was taken into custody, and Stacey was taken to a doctor.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old, I am son of the last witness; I recollect the prisoners coming on the 19th of February, and going away on the 20th; they said they would come back in the evening and pay. As they were going away, I saw a sheet put round Key's body, and his coat buttoned over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop them - A. No, I told my father; he got up, and he and I joined in pursuit of these men; we caught sight of them in a field; Mr. Saunders laid hold of them; I saw them throw the sheet into the ditch. I picked it up.</p>

               <p>Keys' Defence. I lived with Mr. Webber, a butcher, 268, Oxford-street; I had just left him.</p>
               <p>Read's Defence. I am innocent of what I am brought here for; I was helper in stables; the last place I lived at was Mr. Moore's in David-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>

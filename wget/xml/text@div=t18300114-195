               <p>GEORGE TAYLOR. I am a watchman of Shoreditch. On the 28th of November I was standing at the corner of Church-street, a little before seven o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner and another man walking together; I followed them; they both came together - just before I came up, the prisoner hung back, and got before me; I asked what he was about; he made no answer - I collared the other man, who had the tub of butter; he threw it back, which broke my hold, and he ran away - I pursued, but lost them both; I took the butter to the watch-house -I suppose it was thirty or forty yards from Mr. Needham's where I saw them; I inquired, but could not find any one who had lost it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You never saw the prisoner with any tub? A. No, the other person had it - the prisoner was with him at first; it was Saturday morning, and many people were about with carts.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you see the prisoner do? A. Nothing; but when I went to make up to the man who had the butter, he got before me, and tried to prevent my getting to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Habberfield, a tailor, of 15, Denmark-street, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-fields. We live on the first floor—on 16th Dec., about a quarter to eleven in the morning, I went out and left nobody in the room—I locked the door and took the key with me—I came back at a quarter to seven in the evening, went up stairs, put my key in the door and found it would not turn—I then took hold of the handle of the door, found it was unlocked, and opened it by turning the handle—I saw a man standing in the room by the window—I did not see his face, only his height—he had on a frock coat and a hat—I saw his back—I shut the door, ran down stairs, and screamed—a man, who I believe by his height to be the same that was in the room, came down after me, struck me a blow on the side of the head, and knocked me down at the street door—I went up stairs again with the policeman, when the had brought back the prisoner, and missed a work-box, a victorine, a waistcoat, and one cuff—a clock, which hung behind the door on a nail, was taken down, and the weight-chains twisted round it on the sofa, ready to be taken away—there was a coat beside it, which had also been taken down from a nail—the things are worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the clock—they are my husband's property—the man I saw in the room was the same height as the prisoner—I never saw his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruit-saleman. On 16th Dec., about half-past six, I was coming out of 25, Denmark-street, and heard a scream—I went towards the place, and saw the prisoner run out at the door of No. 15—I stopped him, and in the scuffle his hat fell off into the road—he put his head down, knocked me in the stomach with it, and I fell to the ground—I got on my feet as soon as I could, and ran after the prisoner, hallooing out, "Stop thief!' until the policeman caught him and brought him back to No 15.</p>

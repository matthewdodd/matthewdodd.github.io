                  </hi>. I am now staying in the Sailors' Home in London—my home is in Philadelphia, United States—I am a German—I was a sailor on board the vessel Fanchon—she sails under the British flag, and belongs to the port of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia—I joined her in December,</p>

               <p>1878, and sailed from Philadelphia to the Tagus—the prisoner was the chief mate—he is an Englishman—a man named Stobie was boatswain—I am an able seaman—the vessel was anchored in the Tagus in the tide-way, a few miles from the mouth of the river—we lay abreast of Lisbon—while anchored there on the 29th, I went ashore in a boat with the captain—there were in the boat including myself four able seamen and the boatswain Stobie—we rowed the captain ashore and landed him—we had several drinks, and afterwards re<lb></lb>turned with the boat to the ship—Stobie returned with us—one of the sailors brought a bottle of spirits, and gave it in charge to Stobie, who brought it on board—I went to work down in the hold, and we all had a drink out of the bottle—I was the worse for liquor—while down in the hold Stobie kicked me—he said I was not working—he hit me in the eye and knocked me down and kicked me—he struck me with his fist—my nose bled—I then went up on deck—the prisoner was also down in the hold, but had gone on deck before me—the prisoner said, "Go down below. Go to your work"—I said, "I will, as soon as I have got the blood washed off"—he said, "Go down below"—I gave him the same answer as before, and he followed me aft, ordered me below, and struck me with an iron belaying-pin—he got it from between the fore and the main rigging—he struck me on the forehead with it—my hat was below—I lay insensible for a couple of minutes, and bled—the belaying-pin is about 14 inches long, and two and a half to three inches round—when I came to my senses again I got up and sung out for help—I called out towards the river—there were other vessels about—he then told the steward to get irons and hand<lb></lb>cuffs—the steward got the irons out and gave them to Cook, and he ironed me with my hands behind to a stanchion—I continued to call out for help—he said, "If you don't be quiet, I'll knock your brains out"—I did not keep quiet—he then picked up one of my shoes from the deck and hit me with the heel in the eye and on the nose—I think there is something broken in the nose; it is still sore—the blow closed my eye up altogether—when he threatened to knock my brains out I said, "Now you can hit me again, you cowardly brute," and he then struck me with the shoe—I told the carpenter to get me something to cover myself—I had nothing on—he had torn my shirt off—I was kept up to the stanchion for about half an hour—I remained quiet at last—the carpenter brought his own jacket, but the prisoner ordered him back again—then the Portuguese police-boat came—the captain came a little while after—I was sent to the hospital in the same boat with Cook and Stobie, who were taken to prison—I was 10 days in the hospital—I lay three days in the Portuguese hospital and seven days in the other hospital—the doctors could not say whether I should live or not—I had brain fever in the Portuguese hospital, and was insensible all the time—all my hair is off from the fever—I was attended by the doctors, and after 10 days I was able to be discharged—then I made a statement to the English Consul, and was sent to this country with the prisoners to have the matter inquired into here—Foster and Waldgren, two of the crew, were also sent home with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The crew consisted of seven able seamen, the captain, mate, boatswain, the cook, steward, and boy—there were six foreign seamen—the ship was lying in Lisbon harbour, abroast of Lisbon—we came down the docks and we anchored in port—Stobie cams into the hold and told Cook he had brought a bottle of gin on board—I did not hear him teli Stobie</p>

               <p>—the steward brought the irons, and I was ironed with my hands to the stanchion—the captain came on board—I could not say whether the captain said to me "It served you right"—he told me to go forward and wash myself—he did not tell me I was drunk—Stobie knocked me down several times—I could not tell how many times—I fell on the floor in the hold; there were staves lying about—I aid not fall on them—they are used for making casks—I was not knocked down on the staves—I did nothing to aggravate Stobie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Up to the time the prisoner chased me round the deck I made no noise—when he struck me I sung out for help—a vessel was lying about twenty or thirty yards off; we could speak to them—I never struck him or used any violence to him—I kicked at him after he had put me in irons, and was going to wash the blood off—I did not kick him; I tried to kick him because he had hold of my hair, and held my head down to wash the blood off—he had a basin—the forecastle is where the men would go to their meals—he said he would not allow any one to go in—our vessel is nearly 600 tons, and she was anchored in the river in the tideway, where the tide ebbs and flows—the river is five or six miles broad at that part, and about half a mile from the shore—we were off Lisbon in the harbour, not in any dock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an American—I was the cook and steward on board this vessel, and had been three voyages in her—I was on board on the voyage from Philadelphia when we went into the Tagus—I did not go on shore with the captain—I saw Boltenstein and Stobie down in the hold about 2.30—I saw Stobie strike Boltenstein down in the hold—I was sober—Boltenstein was afterwards called on deck by the mate, and was bleeding from the nose—when on deck the mate (Cook) told him to wash his hands and keep quiet—he then went forward and halloed out to the other vessel for help—the mate went forward and asked him if he was quiet, and took the man's shoes that lay on deck and led him aft, and struck him on the back of the head with the shoe—he then asked me to get him a pair of irons—whilst I was in the cabin I heard some words between them, but could not say what they wore—when I came out I saw the prisoner strike Boltenstein with the iron belaying pin in the forehead; that was before he was fastened to the stanchion—the effect of the blow was to knock him over the hatch—he did not move; he lay for two or three minutes insensible—the blood flew all over the hatch—when he came to, the prisoner put the handcuffs on him and fastened him round the stanchion with his hands behind him—he told the boy to go and wash Boltenstein's face, and the boy said he would not do it; he had nothing to do with obeying his orders—he was my boy, the cabin-boy—the mate asked me for a pan of water, and I gave it to him—he went aft and washed the face of the man in irons, and he made a kick at the mate, but did not kick him—he did not get a hold of him—he was going to wash his face—I believe Boltenstein called him a coward; that was when he was fastened up—when he made a kick at him the mate struck him in the groin with his fist—he then got hold of him by the hair and washed his face—that was a little after he had kicked at him—the sailors generally wear knives in the sheath—the prisoner took a knife from the sheath of one of the men—the man had told the second mate to knock off from abusing the sailors—Waldgren and Edwards both spoke to the prisoner, and asked him to knock off, for God's sake, from beating them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030066"></xptr>
               <p>—it was Stobie the boatswain they spoke to—the chief mate took the knife from the man down in the hold while they were speaking to Stobie—I did not hear the prisoner say anything when he took the knife—the man was not using the knife; it was in his sheath—he was speaking to Stobie at the time—I was sober—Boltenstein was worse for liquor, and Stobie was drunk—the prisoner was sober—shortly after this the captain came on board—Boltenstein was kept fastened to the stanchion about half an hour—the Portuguese police-boat came before the captain—then the captain sent him to the hospital, and he sent the prisoner and Stobie on shore for the Consul to deal with the case—I am quite sure all that Boltenstein did when I was present was when after he was in irons he kicked at the prisoner—before that he had not struck the prisoner or used any weapon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see Boltenstein struck with the shoe after he was in irons—I was sober, because I do not drink—the seven able-bodied seamen were all foreigners; the only one not a foreigner had left—all except one were taken on board in Philadelphia and had gone to Lisbon with us; that one was shipped in Philadelphia the voyage before—Boltenstein was not mutinous that I know of, nor refusing to work; he was a very quiet man—Edwards and Waldgren seemed to be sober; I could see no sign of liquor on them—I am not sure if Edwards was one of the men that had been on shore—I do not know whether Edwards and Waldgren had been drinking out of the bottle—I can swear that no knife or threat of knife was used by Waldgren—I cannot say why the prisoner took the knife from him—he was asking the second mate to knock off from abusing that man—he said, "You will be sorry for this after you are sober"—Boltenstein and the boatswain were both the worse for drink—Edwards and Waldgren did not threaten the boatswain; they said, "We will not work any more while the beating is being carried on"—that was when the prisoner told them to go to work—he had not then committed any assault—he was in command of the vessel, and responsible for the management and control of the vessel in the absence of the captain—Boltenstein and the boatswain had a bit of a scuffle, but he did not put himself in a lighting attitude—the boatswain made a strike at him—I was there when Boltenstein came on deck—the boatswain struck him, and then Boltenstein put himself in a fighting attitude—when Waldgren came on deck Stobie knocked him down, and then he knocked Stobie down—that was before any assaults by the prisoner—Edwards did not put himself in a fighting attitude—he was knocked down soon afterwards, but not before the prisoner had committed the assault—Edwards was struck in the forehead by the mate—that was not because Edwards had attacked him—he did not attack him—he was sitting on the bar with his arms folded—he refused to work—the mate went up to him and said, "Will you work?"—he said "No"—the mate then took up a belaying pin and struck him twice on the head—Edwards is a Russian—this was before the assault by the prisoner upon Boltenstein—Boltenstein was not putting himself in a fighting attitude—there was no fight in him—he was told by the mate to go and wash his face—he told the mate to wash his own face first—then the mate struck him with the belaying pin—the boy was told to get the water, but would not go—I went—the boy is under my orders—I am under the orders of the cap<lb></lb>tain—I do not know whether or not I am under the orders of the mate when the captain is away—stewards of vessels are their own "bosses"—they do their own work without any interference from any one except the captain—</p>

               <p>there were only two men on deck—the men all stowed themselves away, they were scared to death—they were all sober so far as I could see—I gave the prisoner the water out of the galley on deck—I was about two minutes getting the water—the prisoner struck him in the groin once after he was lacked at—I got the irons—it is the custom to put men in irons who are violent and refuse to obey orders—I considered I was doing my duty in getting the irons—I considered myself under his orders—I did not consider it a fit and proper case in which a man should be put in irons—I went because I told the mate he was taking the law in his own hands by putting the man into irons in port when we were rather more than half a mile from the shore—another vessel was about a couple of lengths from us—I did not see that Boltenstein had a knife—it is customary for sailors to carry a knife—Waldgren had a knife—I cannot say if Edwards had one—I swear I did not see it—when I heard the cries I came to the hatch—Cook was there, Stobie the second mate, and Boltenstein lying down and Stobie kicking him, and also Waldgren and Edwards—that was about half a minute after I heard the cries.</p>

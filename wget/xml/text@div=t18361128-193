                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, live in Union-street, in the parish of St. Nicholas, Deptford. I was called down stairs on Wednesday morning, the 16th of November, and in consequence of what my sister said I ran out, and heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I ran through part of High-street into Loving Edward's-lane—I saw a man running, and saw him throw some watches into a ditch on the left-hand side—I ran to the spot, and waited there till three of the watches were taken out—the person who threw them there ran on pursued—by several persons—the watches had been intrusted to me to be repaired—I should think they are worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had hung against the wall in my shop—I had seen them about a quarter of as hour before—I had not authorized any body to take them.</p>

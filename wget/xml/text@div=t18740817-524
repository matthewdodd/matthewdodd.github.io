                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, of 33, North Street, Whitechapel—on the night of 3rd August, about 12:30, I met the prisoner and twelve other men in North Street, Whitechapel—one of them hallooed out "That is the b----y swine"—this was three doors from where my brother lives the prisoner struck me but I got away—three or four of them came after me and the prisoner was the first—they knocked me down and I became in<lb></lb>sensible—I had a purse and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, and 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., two knives, and a cigar holder—the prisoner took them away—when I came to my senses I was on the ground and my brother was lifting me up—I do not know who took my purse and money—I was kicked on the side of my head, and I had the mark of a boot—my brother saw the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> kick me—the policeman showed me one of my knives at the station.</p>

               <p>know that the prisoner is quite deaf, but from his conduct before the magis<lb></lb>trate I believe that he is deaf—my brother had not been drinking with me that night—he had not been with me—I know Mr. Rolf, a bootmaker, just opposite where this disturbance took place—it is not a fact that the prisoner got away about thirty yards while the mob were assaulting me—I was not using bad language, and I did not challenge anybody to fight—the prisoner and I were not engaged for some time in a stand up fight.</p>

I live at 33, North Street, Whitechapel—I was called up, went into North Street, and saw a mob and my brother lying on the ground and three men holding him down—the prisoner had his hand in my brother's trousers pocket—I pushed the people off my brother and took him in—his mouth was bleeding—they went towards Whitechapel—he had had a little drink.</p>

             sworn. - On Friday evening, the 8th of December, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in the bar, I observed the prisoner going from a chest at the foot of the stairs in the passage, I lost him instantly, I called my husband directly, I went up stairs, and on the stairs I found a pair of shirt sleeves, that had been in that chest, there were several other persons slept in the same room with him; in a chest in that room, I found a pair of blue pantaloons, and a pillow; I took them in my hand to bring them down, and met the prisoner at the door, I said to him, Gunner, what have you been about, and shewed him the things, and he said,"one man gave it to me;" he was taken before Justice Staples, and committed upon those things; there was another chest up two pair of stairs, that had been stripped entirely, that the articles in the indictment came out of; that chest, I believe to have been locked, I had the key in my desk; the next morning, after he was committed, I went to examine that chest, and there were forty-two articles of wearing-apparel all gone, they all belonged to two persons that are gone to sea, and who left them in my care;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100049"></xptr>among other things, I missed several calico shirts, two or three pair of nankeen breeches, and a cloth coat; I afterwards found, at a pawnbroker's shop, one or two jackets, and one pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner was not committed for taking the things in the indictment, but he sent for me that evening, he was in a lock-up room adjoining the office, he began to cry before I said a word to him, he said to me, in Swedish, don't hurt me, and I will tell you of more things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him if he confessed? - A. No, nothing of the kind; I said, where shall I get them; he said, go to Peggy, in Gravel-lane, and there you will find all the duplicates; I knew who he meant by Peggy, she had been with him three or four times in the tap-room; the next morning, I got an officer, and went to search Peggy's house; her name is Welby; I found nineteen duplicates upon her; I went to the pawnbrokers, and among others, found the things named in the indictment.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 5, Rodney's-row, Ratcliff-highway; I had the pleasure of seeing the prisoner in company, about three or four weeks before he was taken up; the officer came to me with Mr. Winbury, and I gave him a great many duplicates; I had a coat, blue trowsers, nankeen breeches, and a shirt, from the prisoner; he desired me to pawn them; he told me they were his own, that he got them from his own chest on board a ship, and I was to have the money.(Three pawnbrokers produced the property, which was deposed to by Mr. Winbury).</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. When you have seen this woman come there with the prisoner, had she any access to the place where these things were taken from? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. (By the Interpreter). There was a Swede who gave me these articles to deposit them in my chest, he having none of his own; when they had been in my possession eight days, he asked me if I would lend him seven shillings; I told him, I had not got so much money; afterwards, I lent him six shillings; and after that, Margaret Welby asked me for some money, and I told her, I had not got any; I went to my lodging, and desired the man that I had lent the money to, to let me have some back; he said, he could not take up money from the floor; he said, I might take his clothes, and give to the girl; I gave her the breeches, the jacket, and the waistcoat, and then she asked me for more money; he then put into my hands some more articles; after some more days, she wanted more money; and I told her, I could get none till I had a ship; and then I spoke to the Swede again, and he told me, I might take the coat and the pantaloons, and a hat; which I gave to the girl.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Winbury. The day that he was taken up, there was a Swede man ran away, and we made search after him, but could not find him; he lodged at my house, and was an acquaintance of the prisoner's; he had been at our house two or three weeks.</p>

On the 10th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went out, I left the prisoner at the bar cleaning himself in my room. In half an hour I was sent for to come home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. This man had given you the sum of twenty guineas in order for you to teach him his trade - A. He certainly had.</p>
               <p>Q. You wished to get rid of him - A. No, I did not. I told him he would be of great use to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you promised to give him three guineas - A. I had, it was by his own proposal; I had not paid it him, I was to pay it him on the following day, but as we found my property on him, and he was going out of the house with them, he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not in the habit of selling shoes for you - A. Not a pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that he never sold for you a pair of shoes, nor recommended to you a customer - A. He was at the business before he came to me; after he had been with me a few weeks he said his aunt wanted a pair of shoes; I let him have a pair at the wholesale price; he always paid me for the shoes as he had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had bought shoes of you at the wholesale price - A. He had so, by single pairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. This man was an articled servant to you - A. He was articled to me for eighteen months, he was with me about six months; he gave me twenty guineas; I was to board, wash, and lodge him, and learn him his business.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he want you to give him - A. Three pounds or three guineas, and find him in work, and then he was to board himself.</p>
               <p>Q. He did sell some shoes for you, did not he - A. I cannot say he did; I sold them to him first; what he did afterwards I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he take shoes and sell them - A. No; he had always a measure for the shoes that I sold him, I did not sell to him at haphazard more than once; they were two pair of shoes of a size.</p>
               <p>Q. You did trust him with two pair of shoes - A. I did, without having the money for them; he brought them back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the articles here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you now upon your oath did you or did you not, either before he was in custody or after he was in custody, at any time say to the prisoner that you would give up the prosecution if he would give up the articles - A. I did when he repented he had done the crime. He said Mr. Stevens, I am sorry for what I have done, this is the first time I robbed you; I told him if he would give up the articles and go about his business, he might do for himself, or else he would come to be hanged; he said the articles were at an attorney in High street, St. Giles's; then I said Thomas you must go through the regular business of the law.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not to give up the shoes but the articles - A. The articles; nothing was said about the shoes then; he delivered me the shoes before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH STEVENS. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 10th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, as the prisoner was coming out of the back room door, he had this two pair of shoes, and the pair of shoes he had bought in the course of the week, under his arm; I looked very hard at him and he at me; we had missed shoes repeatedly, I said Thomas what have you got in that bundle; he made no reply but went back, stood at a box, and endeavoured to shove the two pair of shoes into the drawer at the bottom of the box; I said Thomas, is this your property; he said he had them in his possession ever since last Sunday; I told him another night he should not sleep in the place for he had been continually wronging us; I told him I did not wish to hurt him the least in the world only that he should not sleep in the house any more; I sent for the beadle; he wished to take him into custody; I would not let him till my husband came home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. The prisoner used to board with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any quarrel with the prisoner - A. Yes; he was impertinent to me and he had more power over my husband's property than I had; we had a great many words.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he had given your husband twenty pound - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know that if your husband got rid of him at six months a great part of that would be profit - Ao. No; I do not think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when your husband offered to drop the prosecution if he would give up the agreement - A. When the officer took him in my custody; my husband said if you are of the mind to go about your business and destroy your agreement, I will do nothing against you; he said he was sorry for what he had done, he had lodged them in an attorney's hands; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010071"></xptr>first said that he had destroyed them.</p>

            . On Sunday the 10th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody. Mrs. Stephens said he had stole two pair of shoes, her husband was out, she did not know what to do. I recommended her to keep the prisoner locked up and send for her husband; I locked him up; Mr. Stephens came home in about three quarters of an hour; I was sent for again; Mr. Stevens desired me to bring the prisoner forward; he informed me that he did not wish to hurt the prisoner, if he would destroy his indentures before me; his reply was, he had already done that; Mr. Stephens imagining that was false, said I must take him in custody; the prisoner then said he had lodged it in the hands of an attorney in High street. On the Monday morning I took him to Marlborough street office; the indentures were delivered to the prisoner at the office, and I believe delivered up to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford I take it for granted you have told us every thing that passed in your hearing; no such conversation passed in your presence, as that he was sorry he had robbed his master, that was the first time - A. There was nothing passed than what I have related.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he gave up the articles he offered to give up the prosecution - A. He did so.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have paid that sum of money to the prosecutor; and his wife frequently taking up unlawful weapons to throw at me, I told my prosecutor that I would go from him. On the Monday following I asked him for three guineas, I told him I would pay him in the course of the summer; and he has never set down to work with me the whole time I have been there, above one fortnight. I could make a thread when I went to him - but what could I learn from him. The shoes I bought of the prosecutor on the Monday before; I gave him eight shillings and sixpence for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

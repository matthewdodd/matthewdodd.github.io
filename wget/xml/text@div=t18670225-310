                  <hi rend="smallCaps">REV. CHARLES PETER McCARTHY</hi>. I am a clerk in holy orders, and live at 14, Colebrook Row, St. Mary's, Islington—on Tuesday, 8th January, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was called up—I went down stairs and found the whole of the lower part of the house ran<lb></lb>sacked, and the window in the back door broken, so that a person from the outside could undo the bolts; there is a second door leading from the back kitchen into the front of the house, an inner door; that was fastened with sheet iron and on the opposite side to the place where the entrance was effected, it was protected by an iron bar three feet long, two inches wide, and a quarter of an inch thick—I found that bar, which was let into iron grooves from the sills of the door, bent nearly double, at an angle of about forty-five degrees; then the door was easily opened, and an entrance effected into the front kitchen, and the property, plate, linen, boots and shoes, and fifteen or sixteen coats were all taken away—the linen for a fortnight's wash was placed at the foot of the stairs in the hall ready for the laundress, and that was all taken—I have since seen all the lines in that bundle just as it was tied up at the time it was taken, amounting to fifty-two pieces, besides boots and shoes—it was produced to me by the con<lb></lb>stable Gully—I had heard considerable noise during the night, but there was a hurricane blowing that evening, quite a gale, and my house is large and old—there was a good deal of rattling of windows and doors, and I conceived that all the noise was caused by the wind—I heard those noises at a quarter to five—I first heard them at hast-past four, but distinctly at ten minutes or a quarter to five—I know the time, because I had to get out of bed—after getting up in the morning I went into the garden, and found traces of persons having been there during the night—they had got through an iron railing that I had put up to prevent my poultry going into my neighbour's garden—I went into the next garden and there found traces of how the robbery had been committed, and found my plate basket in the middle of the garden; the plate was gone—the wall into Alfred Street, over which the burglary was effected, is over sixteen feet high on that side—I have had the place pointed out to me where the cabman took up his fare, I have measured the distance from there to the place where the burglary was effected, and it is under thirty yards—to my door it is further.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabdriver in Leather Lane—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 8th January, about five o'clock or five minutes past, I was on the cab-stand near the Eagle Tavern, City Road—the two prisoners came up to me, Arnold first; she asked if I would go up to River Terrace, and take up—at that time Gibbons was standing a little distance off, on the pavement—they both got into the cab—they pulled me up at the corner of Alfred Street—I have since seen the prosecutor's house; it was a few yards from there—Gibbons got out of the cab first, and was then followed by Arnold, when Gibbons met Arnold on the pavement with a bundle; they put it into the cab and got in, and I drove off—Arnold told me to drive to Church Street, Shoreditch—when I got to Church Street Arnold looked out of the cab window, and told me to pull up at Turville Street; she then got out of the cab, and went into a house—at that time the police constable came up, and took them into custody—I did not see any men with the prisoners.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250066"></xptr>
               <p>and I asked her where she got these things—she made no answer—I then told them both to get into the cab, and directed the cabman to drive to the station—I was present when the articles were delivered up to Mr. McCarthy; they were articles that had been in the bundle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gibbons's Defence.</hi> All I have got to say is, the men came and asked me to carry the things, and I did. They said they would make me a hand<lb></lb>some present, and, being an unfortunate girl, not knowing where to get a breakfast, I went for the sake of the money to get myself a breakfast in the morning. They gave me half a crown to get a cab. Arnold called for the cab, and we went to River Terrace. I do not know the name of the Street; we stopped the cab at the corner of the street. There were three men, two stood outside, and one went in, and the little one gave me the bundle; but where he brought it from I can't say, because he came up the street with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Arnold's Defence.</hi> On 7th January I left my home to go to work in the afternoon; instead of going to work, I went to Gibbons's house to have some tea. We went out and went to the play. It was too late for me to return home, and she said I could come home with her. I stayed with her all night. At four in the morning she woke me up; there were three men in the room; they asked her would she go and carry a bundle. She went, and I did the same as any other girl would do, because I would not stay there by myself. She did not ask me to go.</p>

On the 28th of September, I went out about six o'clock in the morning, leaving him in bed; I was sent for about half-past eleven, and he was then gone, as also my box and clothes - I saw him next morning coming out of a pawnbroker's shop, in Fleet-market, with a bundle under his arm; a man stood in the market; he was going to open the bundle, but saw me, and ran; I followed, calling, Stop thief! I stopped him, and gave him in charge; he had my coat and handkerchief on his arm; I have known him about eight weeks; he was working at the Three Tuns public-house, in Jury-street; I never gave him leave to take them.</p>

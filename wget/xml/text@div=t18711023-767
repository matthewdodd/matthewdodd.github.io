                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London and County Bank, Oxford Street branch—this cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by E. S. Robinson, was presented there, and dishonoured—the cheque-book was issued by us to a person named Hansford, whose account was closed in September, 1867.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you know the whole of your customers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>Not all, but I know there is not such a person now, because I have got the books here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. All I have to say is that I received this cheque also from Mr. Williams, in the same way, and never had a shilling out of it; I gave it all to Mr. Williams. He has absconded, and made me a dupe. I received that two months after the first.</p>

The prisoner gave me a cheque, and I changed it at the baker's—he returned it, and I went to him, and told him I did not know it was bad—I told the prisoner the same day, and he took me to Clement's Lane, at 11 o'clock next morning, where I saw a City gentleman, named Williams, who said he would set it right on Saturday—the prisoner lodged at my house at the time—ho said that he did not know it was bad, and he would go down to the man who gave it him—I said "I will go with you"—I went with him next morning to Clement's Lane—he went into a public-house, and fetched Williams out—I stayed outside—I spoke about the cheque being bad, and he said that he would see it righted.</p>

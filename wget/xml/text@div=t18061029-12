             sworn. I am a brass founder, I live at No. 8, Shoe-lane. This day week, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop between one and two o'clock in the day, he had two parcels of metal tied up in a handkerchief; he emptied one in the scale, I asked him who the metal belonged to, he said his father, he kept an old rag shop at the further end of Shoe-lane; I knew there was no such shop there; I asked him to tell the truth, for I knew the metal must be stolen; he then said that she lived in Shoe-lane but her shop was in Holborn; he said he could not tell me but he could shew me the house; I told him he must tell me, because I was very certain it came from some founder's shop. I went with him along Shoe-lane, till he came to Robin Hood court, he went up the steps into Dean-street; and then made a push to run away, I then seized hold of him and brought him back and repeatedly requested him to tell me whose metal it was, and I would send for his master to take him away, and the metal together. I sent for a constable, he searched him, and then he said he worked for Mr. Warner; he then said after his master came, that he took one part on the night before, and the other part on Saturday night.</p>

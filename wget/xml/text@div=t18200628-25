I came down between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and found the drawers of the dresser all open, which were closed when I went to bed. I was the first person up. On going to set the breakfast things I missed a table-cloth. I afterwards missed four tablecloths, which were safe the night before, and are worth above 20 s.; my master's umbrella and boots were gone from the kitchen. I also missed three pair of silk stockings, two pair of which were my masters; they were new, and worth 20 s. - a shawl, two shifts, and two aprons, worth 12 s. together; a coat, a hat, and a pair of shoes were also gone, they belonged to

               <p>Q. In what state did you find the door - A. The chain was off and the bolts undone - they were secure overnight; the skylight, which was safe the night before, was broken; it must have been broken by the thieves getting in at the window. The windows were all shut, but a person could get in by coming over the houses. The prisoner was Messrs. Blackenhaghen's servant, I have seen him at their kitchen window. I saw the property the same morning - I believe he was then in custody. Hutchence slept in the house, but did not get up till after I came down.</p>

On the 23d of June, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw a black man on the leads of our skylight, which is just under one of Mr. Jones's windows - there was daylight enough to distinguish him. I saw him take from Mr. Jones's window a coat, a hat, an umbrella, and take them towards Messrs. Blackenhaghens' house - I did not see him go into the house. I made no alarm at the time, but told my master when I came down. The window was open when I saw him take them. I knew the prisoner lived at Messrs. Blackenhaghens' - I cannot say it was him that I saw.</p>

In his bed-room on the second floor, up the chimney, I found two umbrellas.

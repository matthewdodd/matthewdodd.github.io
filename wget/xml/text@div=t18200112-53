On Saturday morning, the 25th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I and my wife and son left the house to go out with milk. I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket - I left nobody in the house. I do not know what parish it is in. I returned about a quarter after nine o'clock, and found the back door broken open - it was bolted inside when I left. I missed the property stated in the indictment. There was 7 l. or 8 l. in copper and silver, and 5 s. or 6 s. in old halfpence, which I had put by in an old stocking - I had not seen them for a week or two - they were in a chest of drawers, which I always kept locked, and kept the key. I saw the drawer safe that morning. I also lost a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. When had you seen the knife and copper - A. Not for several weeks. My son got home before me, and was crying out that we were robbed.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of Stepney. I apprehended the prisoner on Christmas Day about eleven o'clock in the morning, and found a silk handkerchief in his hat, and an old stocking in his pocket, containing 104 old halfpence; he had thirty penny pieces and 7 d. in new halfpence, loose in his pocket, also a knife, which the prosecutor claimed. I received information, and apprehended the prisoner at his father's, in Hare-street-fields, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's. The handkerchief was in his hat, which was on the table. He was asleep by the fire. He said the hat was his.</p>

             re-examined. I know the handkerchief and stocking - it is a remarkable stocking. I also know the knife by a piece being broken off the end. I will not swear to the handkerchief, as there is no mark on it.</p>

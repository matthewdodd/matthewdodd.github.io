I selected some goods to be sent on approbation to Mr. Nicholls, of Bridgewater; I put them in paper in the silk room, wrote on them "Nicholls, of Bridgewater," and left them in the department to be fetched out by the collectors, and forwarded—I do not know what became of them—these two pieces of silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two out of five robes, which I enclosed with a great many other things—the person who ought to forward them is a porter; we have about thirty porters—the collectors take the packages to the entering room, and hand them to the porters to be packed—the directions are given by the superintendent of the packing room—I afterwards found that the goods were gone from where I left them—the party whose duty it was to pack them is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Nicholls and Co., drapers, of Bridgewater; they have dealings with Messrs. Cook and Sons, of St. Paul's Churchyard. On 5th Aug. I received some Silk goods from them, which I examined, and among them were seven silk robes—I noticed the two in question; one was thirteen, and the other sixteen, yards long—they came on approval, and were all sent back—I packed them in a box, which was addressed in my presence, "Messrs. Cook and Sons, St. Paul's Churchyard, London," on a card, which was nailed on the box—the box was delivered to the carrier, I entered it in the book, the carter signed it, and I saw him take it away—I have since seen two silk robes at the Mansion-house, which I recognized as part of what I had packed—the box was about two and a half feet long, fifteen inches high, and eighteen or twenty inches wide—there were parcels for other parties in it; a parcel of barege for Hitchcock and Co.; a parcel of woollen for Henry and Co.; a parcel of gloves and stock<lb></lb>ings to Morley and Co.; and another to Lycett and Davis—they were all enclosed to Messrs. Cook for delivery; we frequently do that to save having different parcels—the contents of the box were worth between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of the robes which came to us from Cook and Sons; I saw them taken out of the box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, of the Oxford Arms, Warwick-lane. The prisoner Smith was in my employment, to clean the horses and the stable, and to take out goods with a horse and cart; he was a sort of porter—in the early part of Aug. I had a box of goods from Nicholls and Co., of Bridgewater, which should have been delivered to Messrs. Cook, of St. Paul's</p>

               <p>Churchyard—I delivered it to Smith on Monday, 14th Aug., to deliver; he had other parcels in the cart to deliver at different places—he never came back, and I found the horse and cart at the green yard—on the following morning I went to Messrs. Cook's, and in consequence of what passed there, I had reason to think that the box had never reached them—I have seen both the other prisoners before with Smith, I think, but I cannot say when or where—I will not say positively that I have seen them in his company—Smith was only in my employ about three weeks, and I should think it was during that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at No. 70, Milton-street, City; that is near the Axe public house, which I use sometimes—I have seen all the prisoners before. On Saturday evening, 12th Aug., I saw Smith at the Axe public house—he said that he had got 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from his master on Saturday night, and he should look for something better to pay him on Monday—I had not seen the other prisoners before that, but after that Luke came in—Smith was still there, and Luke saw him, but did not speak to him—after that Watts came in—he saw Smith, but they had no words—they were not in company, and did not sit together—Smith had half a pint of porter—I do not know what they came for—I did not see either of the other two drink anything—Luke stopped about half an hour—I heard him say nothing—Smith stopped about five minutes—he only said to Mr. Mel<lb></lb>bourne that he came to look after his old debts which were owing to him.</p>

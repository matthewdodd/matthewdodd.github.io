I was the last up in my house on the 13th of May; my doors and windows were all fast then. Between one and two in the night my little dog made a prodigious noise. I opened my room door, and came out and listened upon the stairs; I cannot say I heard any thing but my dog. I went in again and shut my door, thinking it was something in the street that disturbed the dog. After that the dog made more noise; then I came down. They had broke in at the window, and broke my bureau open, and taken several things away; the windows were unbolted and left open; they had taken away a counterpane, three table-cloths, a gun, and other things. Mr. Birch's house was broke the same morning; he took the prisoners.

            . I live next door to Merlin's Cave, in the Spaw Fields, by the water-works. On the 14th of this month, a little after two in the morning, I heard a noise in my house; I opened my room door and peeped over the banmisters of the stairs; I had a gun by me, having been surprized almost every night. I found my two double doors were both wide open; I heard a whispering in my parlour. The first thing I saw was a man come out of my parlour, with this was candle in his hand, endeavouring to come up stairs. I rang the bell for a gentleman that lay above, to come down. He ran down in his shirt. The thieves ran over the bank by the water-works, and turned down towards Bagnigge Wells. I ran down and saw four of them; two went first, and two after them. One of the first had a bundle in his hand, and one of the other two had a bundle. I said to the gentleman, There they are; whip your clothes on, I will pursue them. While he went up to dress himself, I got my gun in my hand, and went behind them all the way to Bunhill-Row. Just by the French pest-house there was a carpenter coming out of his house to go to work, a little before four o'clock. I said, My friend, for God's sake assist me; I have a suspicion of them four men robbing my house. He called to the watch; the watchman ran after them; one made his escape, we took three of them in Bunhill-Row.

There came the father of Freeman, and cried ready to break his heart, and begged his son might be admitted evidence. The boy was asked about a gun; the prosecutor had lost a gun, The boy said, We took it, and I'll go and shew you where it is. Then one of the keepers of Bridewell that was there, took his hand-cuffs off, and took him the back way; we went by the Foundling Hospital, and in the field by my house, under one of the water-pipes, he went on his knees and put his hand under, and brought out the gun, and we brought it to Justice Girdler's (The counterpane, table-cloths and gun produced in court.)</p>

             got over the gate, and got into the house, and I stood at the corner of an alley. They threw these things out of the house, and some more things. From thence we went round the fields, and put the gun under a pipe, and went over by Mr. Birch's house; we none of us went in as I saw; and after that he and another followed us.</p>

            's Defence:</p>
               <p>I never saw that boy, the evidence, till that morning, in my life. This young fellow and me were going down Grays-Inn-lane; he said, he found the two bundles and the fowling-piece. Between two and three in the morning we were all three of us together, having been out drinking. We had agreed to go down the lane and take a walk into the fields. Delaforce knowing the evidence, he turned back with us. He took the fowling-piece, and put it under a pipe; that gentleman followed us with a gun as far as Bunhill-row. We had no opportunity of seeing what was in the bundle; he called the watchmen, and they took us to the Round-house.</p>

               <p>On that Monday I was at Whitechapel at work, and was a little in liquor when my brother came to me; we came to this end of the town drinking. We met the evidence about two in the morning with this bundle; then we went cross the fields, and that man followed us, and said we had broke his house open. I don't know where his house is.</p>
               <p>Delaforce's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was drinking with the other prisoner; we met the evidence about seven or eight in the evening, and we went to the Green Man on Saffron-hill. We staid drinking till it was late; we could not get in; we all four went down Grays-Inn-lane together. Freeman wanted more beer, and we went into another public house; then I went away, and never saw no more of them. I never was in Bunhill-row at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any of the witnesses say that Delaforce was one of the four that was seen in Bunhill-row?</p>
               <p>Birch. I did not see his face, but I saw his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300012"></xptr> coat; he had a bundle; I will not take upon me to say he was one of them; I think he was. None of the watchmen saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bunyan. I live in Harp-alley, and am a cabinet-maker; Delaforce is my apprentice, and has served four years of his time. I never heard any ill of him in my life before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at home that night?</p>
               <p>Bunyan. I went out to spend the evening with a friend, and I cannot tell what time he came home.</p>

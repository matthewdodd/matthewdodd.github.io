                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Kingsland-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. I have a house there which is unoc<lb></lb>cupied. In consequence of information, I went to the house on Tues<lb></lb>day night last, the 27th, at about seven o'clock, and found two stoves re<lb></lb>moved from the upper bed-rooms—I found a policeman in the house—he brought a stove to me, and asked me if it was my property—I said it was—he went up stairs, and fitted it in the place where it had been set, and it exactly fitted the place—I had seen it safe on the Monday, I think, or on the Saturday—I have since seen the other—they are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and more to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier, and live in York-row, Kingsland-road. On Tuesday evening, I was opposite Mr. Little's empty house, and saw a man standing, with a white jacket on, in front of the house—I saw him come to the pavement—he looked up and down the oad, and went back to the area—he was about half-way to the area when I first saw him—I saw him stoop down, and appear to be taking some<lb></lb>thing from the area—he left it on the parapet wall, came again to the pavement, returned to the area, and appeared to be taking something up, as he was before, and he came away—the policeman came to me at that time whom I had sent for—the prisoner Hutchins was the man in the white jacket—I made a communication to the policeman, and went across the road with him to the men—I told him these were the men who had been in Mr. Little's house, or doing something to Mr. Little's house, and he was to bring them back—they had gut about fifty yards when the po<lb></lb>liceman stopped them—they said they had not been into any place, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183510260117"></xptr>
               <p>had come straight down the road—I said, "Bring them back to the house;" and I then lost sight of them, as I turned my back to go to the house—when we got to the house, I found the grate of the wall of the area—I said, "This is what they have been taking from the house, and I shall take it to the station-house"—I told the policeman to take the pri<lb></lb>soners there—when I got to the station-house, my hands were black with touching the grate; and I said, if the prisoners had touched the grate, their hands must also be black; and both their hands were black—Barker said he had been in to make water against the bricks—after I came from Worship-street, I went back and examined the bricks, and they were quite dry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From six to half-past six o'clock—it was dark—I was at the next house till after dark, at work there—I first saw Barker within three yards of the area—I saw Hutchins take the thing up the area, and after that he was coming away I first saw Barker within three yards of the area, or if might be within half a yard—he was coming away from the area—the area does not about on the pavement, but on the garden before the house—there used to be palisades before it, but the parapet wall is taken down; the pavement is close to the parapet—he was not on the pavement—I kept my eye on Hutchins, that I might not lose sight of him—I first saw Barker on Mr. Little's ground—the road is about six yards from the area—Little's ground is not enclosed—it has been enclosed, but is open—it was on that open ground I first saw Barker—he was walking—coming from the area—he had nothing with him—I went to Worship-street the same night—it was dark when I first saw them—Worship-street is about threequarters of a mile from the house—we stopped there till eight o'clock—I ascertained that the bricks were quite dry, by a candle and lantern—I did not put my hand to the bricks—the weather was damp—if there had been water there, it must have remained there for hours—the ground was not wet with water—it was damp all alike—the bricks were dry, as they came from the kiln—the ground was not wet, nor dusty dry—there was no sign of any thing having been on it—I had the candle and lantern—the prisoners said they had been working at smith's business, but it was different black on their hand, to some rafters where they had been working, which I saw next day, passing by Shoreditch—the rafters were brown, but not black like the black of men's hands—I was passing by, on the other side of the road, when I saw the rafters—they are about twenty feet high—I did not think of examining them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday night Mercy applied to me, and I saw the two prisoners on the opposite side of the road—he said, in the hearing of the prisoners, "Take these two men into custody, they have done something at a house"—I said, "What house?"—he said, "Mr. Little's house; bring them back"—and on my way back I asked the prisoners what brought them to that house—they both said they had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183510260118"></xptr>
               <p>not been there at all, but had come down the road, and that they had come from work, and were going home—I brought them back to the area and immediately Mercy stooped down and took up a stove, which was lying on the parapet of the area, and in the presence of the prisoners he said, "This is what they have been stealing from Mr. Little's house"—he said, "You take the prisoners to the station-house, and I will take the stove"—I brought them to the Station-house, and there, in answer to as question, Hutchins's said, he went into the piece of ground, in front of the house, to make water—I cannot say whether the question was put by me or the inspector—the inspector wrote down the charge—he said he had gone inside the ground, not into the area—I then looked at the prisoners' hands—I found Hutchins's hands black, and Barker's also very black—it appeared to me to be soot, something similar to what was on the store<lb></lb>I then went to Mr. Little's house, and examined it, and found two stoves had been recently taken down, one in the front room, and one in the back, on the first floor—I traced a quantity of lime and black stuff down stairs—I went into the kitchen, and found the window forced open—I then pro<lb></lb>ceeded to the ground in front of the house, and found a second stove on the parapet of the area, close to where the one was found—I brought it in and matched it with the fire-place—exactly fitted—I made a strict search round the house, but could find nothing else—I brought the stoves to the station-house—Mr. Little had come there by this time, and identified the stoves.</p>

In the year 1822, I bought the hay of Kensington-gardens; it was made up and stacked in the gardens. I began to dispose of it on the 22d of March last, and ended in May. Barnett was employed to cut it to go to market - he has worked eight or nine years for me. I superintended the making of the hay myself; I believe it was the best that has been made for forty years. The prisoner Cook had a rick of hay last year within six or seven yards from mine. The prisoners were apprehended in consequence of information from Barnett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The grass in the gardens is let by tender, I believe - A. Yes; I had he offer of it last year, but Cook made a better offer; I have made no offer this year; I assisted in stacking it myself - I have no partner.</p>

            . I have been seven or eight years in the prosecutrix's service. In March, April and May, I was employed to cut this hay from the rick in Kensington-gardens; the prisoner Cook came to me one morning between ten and eleven o'clock, and asked if his haybinder had been there? (that was Langton) I said No; he asked if I had done any thing this morning? I said No; he said</p>
               <p>"Well, get what you can; I shall give you 1 s. a truss for it;" he said no more, but went away. Langton came to me next day, and I had a quarter of a load of mistress's hay - Langton said,</p>
               <p>"Can we get another quarter of a load," and we got it - I cut it - he fetched some of it away and bound it, and I bound some; he took it into his shed. I generally twist my hay-hands shorter and lighter than other people; it was quite a light brown hay, and that in Cook's rick was a very dark brown; it was loaded on Cook's cart, and taken away - a quarter of a load is nine trusses. Langton paid me 4 s. 6 d. for it as soon as I had done it - that was 6 d. for me, and 6 d. for himself. I have drank at the King's Head public-house with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose you went and told Mrs. Medley of this proposal directly - A. No; I agreed to steal it for 6 d. a truss - it was not my wish, but they came and bothered me so. I was found out about a week after - I have seen Langton's brother since I made this charge, and said I was very sorry that it should happen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would not have said one word about it, if Mrs. Medley had not told you - A. No; I said no such thing; I stated at first to mistress that I knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030065"></xptr>nothing about it. I went away, and they sent me word that I should not be hurt, if I would come back and tell the truth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mrs. Medley ever tell you what to say - A. No; when I was accused of it, she wrote down what Puttick, the carter, had said; that I had been doing. I denied it at first, but when she read to me what he had said, I ran off, but came back, as they said if I told what had been done, she would not hurt me. She said nothing to me about Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Cook said he would give you 1 s. a truss - A. Yes; 6 d. for me, and 6 d. for Langton - we had that before when we took some.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL STRICKLAND. On the 21st of May, I bought thirty-six trusses of hay from Cook, in the Hay-market - it was divided between me and Mr. Knight. I had eighteen trusses - it was brown hay - I did not notice whether, it was all of one colour. When the officer came I had seven trusses left, which they examined.</p>

               <p>JOHN WILLIAMSON. I was with Buckeridge - Barnett pointed out three trusses at Strickland's - it was rather lighter and brighter than the other hay, and smelt sweeter; there was very little difference in the colour, but one appeared mouldy.</p>

               <p>JOHN PUTTICK. I was carter to Mr. Cook. I remember some hay being in his shed; he took it to the Hay-market for sale, on the 21st of April - eight trusses were taken from the shed to the loft, and then to the market by me, and sold to Strickland.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and have frequently seen Mrs. Medley's hay in Kensington-gardens, and have seen Cook's hay. About three weeks, or a month ago, I was passing through the gardens, and saw two of Cook's carts loaded with hay, near the spot where his own and one of Mrs. Medley's ricks stood. I was brought up a farmer, and have often noticed Mrs. Medley's stacks and Cook's - her's was very good, and his very bad; some of the hay in his cart looked much better than his own. I took no further notice, thinking she had borrowed his cart. Cook is a respectable man, and the last person I should have suspected - the upper trusses were covered with cloth - I have not the least doubt but what I saw was her hay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to swear that it was her's - A. By no means.</p>

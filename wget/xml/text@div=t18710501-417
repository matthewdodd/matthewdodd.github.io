                  </hi>. I am an attendant at the asylum—the prisoner came to me on 4th April, and said he had scalded Morley—he asked me to fetch the doctor, and I went for Mr. Ward—I saw the deceased in bed—he was scalded on the left arm and back—there are regulations for our guidance as to the temperature of the baths—as a general rule it should be from 90 to 96 degrees—some of the patients are bathed once a week, and others oftener—the deceased was not a refractory lunatic—the taps were not in good order, and we had to use all the force we could to turn them on and off—it was the prisoner's duty to turn the water off, and' ascertain the temperature, before the patient got into the bath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If a man should say that the water was too cold, I should ask him to get out of the bath, whilst I let more hot water in—a patient has never complained to me of the water not being warm enough—I might put my hand over the inlet hole, to ascertain if the water was too hot, and if not, I might let in a little more without requiring him to leave the bath—the inlet is under the man when in the bath, so that the hot water, if turned on, would mix with the other water at once, and the taps which supply the hot and cold water are about five or six inches apart, at the foot of the bath—the taps worked badly for about six months—I have found great difficulty in turning them off when the water has reached a proper temperature, and it has continued to flow notwithstanding all my efforts to stop it—there has been no alteration in the taps since this affair happened, but a fresh key has been bought, in order that we may turn them on and off more easily—the new key will fit on the taps further, and will not slip off, as the old key did—it gives us greater mechanical power over them—the prisoner was always very attentive to the patients—the deceased did not like any other attendant to do anything for him except the prisoner—he used to call him "George"—there are not always two attendants in the bath room—I have never known lunatics to get in before the proper time, notwithstanding the care used.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the junior medical officer of the asylum—on 4th April, I was called in to see the deceased man, Mulley, and examined him in the prisoner's presence—I found an extensive scald upon the back, another on the inner side of the left forearm, reaching from the palm to the elbow, and others at the back of each ankle, or rather, each heel—the scald on the back extended from the bladebone of the left shoulder down to the buttock—a greater part was on the left side—there was considerable shock to the system—he was cold and shivering when I saw him—he recovered from the shock the same evening, but on the 13th he got markedly worse, and I expired from bronchitis—I had seen him previously to the scalding, and he was not then suffering from that complaint; at any rate, not from acute bronchitis—he might have had chronic bronchitis, as I believe he spat a little at times—I made a <hi rend="italic">pout mortem</hi> examination of the body, in con<lb></lb>junction with Dr. Biggs—I consider that death arose from bronchitis—it frequently results from scalding—there was a little congestion of the mem<lb></lb>branes of the brain, on the right side, which might have been produced by the scalding or the bronchitis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had recovered from the shock, but not quite from the scalds, at the time of his death—the skin had not recovered—I do not think the shock to the system was the severest part of his injuries—he did not seem to be susceptible of pain—the scalds, as I have stated, had not quite healed—there was a large slough in the centre of one of them—he would suffer most from the shock in the first instance—there were more patients suffering from bronchitis at the time—it was a common complaint just then, and was attributable to ordinary causes—if the deceased, in this instance, had been liable to catch cold, he would have got bronchitis—if I had not heard of the scalds I should have attributed it, in his case, to the ordinary causes—bronchitis set in on the fifth or sixth day after the occurrence; but he got markedly worse towards the 13th, when he commenced spitting a good deal—he was treated for bronchitis on the fifth day, by the superintendent—it set in, I believe, immediately after the scalds—it may come on from a week or a fortnight after a person has been scalded—I know nothing of the baths, although I have seen them frequently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What part of the body would be most susceptible to scalds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The skin of the back is more susceptible than the skin of the hand—you could bear the palm of the hand in hotter water than you could the forearm or back—at the back of the heels the skin would be thicker than</p>

               <p>in other parts, and consequently not quite so susceptible to heat—I attribute the scalding of the deceased to there being a fresh influx of water let into the bath during the time he was bathing—from the position of the scalds I assume that the deceased was put in the bath the wrong way, with his back to the inlet—he might hare been turned a little more to one side, and probably would put down his hand as soon as he felt that the water was too hot—he might try to lift himself, or stand up as soon as he could—that is the only way I can account for the scalds being where they were—he was a very feeble man, and his constitution was breaking up fast—I should think he might have got out of the bath, as he was able to walk about his ward.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the resident physician and superintendent of the asylum—on 4th April I was called to see the deceased—he was lying on a bed, in a small room, suffering from a scald, which extended over the greater part of his back and left forearm, on the inner side—I agree with the last witness as to the position of the scalds—I attended him regularly until the 11th, and was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—in my opinion acute bronchitis was the cause of death, and that it was the effect of a scald—if he was in the bath at the moment hot water was turned on, he would be scalded instantly; I should say before he had time to get out—there is only one inlet to the bath for both hot and cold water, but the inlet is supplied by two pipes, the hot water on the left and the cold on the right—they both unite with a main, which forms the inlet alluded to, and which is 53/4 inches from the bottom of the bath—the diameter of the pipe is 11/4 inch, which would give a pressure of 10lbs. to one square inch, both for hot and cold water—there are regulations put up in every bath-room—the heat of each bath ought to range from 90 to 96 degrees—there are special orders against the water being of greater heat than that—from 125 to 140 degrees of heat would scald—some portions of the body, particularly the back and belly, would be more susceptible to scalds than others—the skin is more sensitive there—after seeing the deceased, I asked the prisoner how he could be so culpably careless as to turn on almost boiling water against the back of the patient, or words to that effect—he replied that it was done thoughtlessly, accidentally, or unintentionally, I forget which; that he had done it thoughtlessly, and did not mean to hurt the man—I said if anything happened to the patient, he bad laid himself open to a charge of manslaughter—I think he did not reply to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said he had turned the water on the man's back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I intended to convey, then, that the man had been put in the bath the wrong way, contrary to the usage of the asylum—he could lie in the bath very well that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never known a case in which the position of the patient has been changed—I do not see any object in doing it—I first detected the bronchitis on the day after the accident or the scalding, and I made a medical note of it—he spat matter the day after—the right lung was diseased—it was an old-standing complaint—the left lung was attacked by bronchitis, but there was no other disease there—he was a debilitated man, and feeble—troublesome, but not violent, at least not since his admission on 23rd March—I have never heard complaints of patients having turned themselves in the bath—if a patient requires the assistance of two attendants, they are sent—if a man was very violent, it might require more than two to restrain him—the engineer, of course, has the manage<lb></lb>ment</p>

               <p>of the water in the boilers—the water varies in heat according to the fires that are kept—the accident happened a little before I in the day time—baths are given, up to bed time—this was a cleansing bath, because the man was dirty—there would be no object in moving the man about—the taps run into what is called a Y piece—I should think there is a dis<lb></lb>tance of a foot and a half between one tap and the other—there is but one inlet, so that hot and cold water enters from the same place into the bath—the to comes along the 1 1/4 inch pipe on the left—I think it was necessary for his back to have been towards the inlet for him to have been scalded in the way he was—he was not injured in the front at all—I am positive about that—if he was there when hot water was let in with a rush, he might be scalded before he could get out—his legs and his belly, I think, would have been scalded first, which was not the case—I do not think it possible that the rush of water could have gone round the bath before it mingled with the water in the centre, and not have scalded his legs and belly—it is possible the tendency of the pressure would be to send the hot water more to the left than to the right—I think the hot water must have struck upon his back directly—I have tried the effect of a rush of water in this particular bath, and I find that it goes down the centre—I do not think that a column of water projected with force into the bath would go along the left side of the bath without mingling with the water in the centre—water of 110 degrees of heat would not produce scalding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for his heels being scalded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The water might have been forced on to them, or he might have drawn up his legs in order to get out of the bath; but all this is mere conjecture—there is a waste pipe of two inches in diameter, and an exit pipe at the bottom of the bath—the waste pipe is simply to prevent the water over-flowing the sides of the bath, and so making the place in a mess—the ordinary depth of water in a bath is five inches, and the time for filling it about a minute—no alteration has been made in the baths since the accident—they are new ones, and do not require alteration.</p>

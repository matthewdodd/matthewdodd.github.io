                  </hi>. I am assistant to an ironmonger. About eleven o'clock at night, on the 21st of April, I was pawing over London bridge with my wife—I felt a twitch at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner close behind me, passing my handkerchief behind him—it looked like mine, but he managed to secrete it there, and he sold it in the Computer believe—it was a yellow one with a white flower—I asked him for my handkerchief—he denied having it, and resisted very violently—he attempted to strike me.</p>

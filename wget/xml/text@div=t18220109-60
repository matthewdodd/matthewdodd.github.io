            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 20th of December, a little before eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Tothill-street, about a quarter of a mile from Buckland's with this bag, and the linen in it; another boy was with him, who ran away directly he saw me; I followed the prisoner, and asked what he had on his shoulder, and just as I stopped him, before he made any reply, the prosecutrix's daughter claimed it as her mother's which she had lost; I put him in the watch-house; he said a young man employed him to carry it, who was dressed in blue - there was no young man near.</p>

I beg leave to state, I was brought into this unfortunate situation by some designing and experienced practitioner; a man in a blue coat gave me the parcel in York-street, and told me to wait at the corner of Tothill-street, and wait his coming; and while I was waiting for him I was taken, if I had stolen the property, instead of wandering in the street, I should have concealed myself; besides, I was apprehended two hours after the robbery; I was to have 6 d. for my trouble - I beg to offer this circumstance as favourable to the Court and Jury.</p>

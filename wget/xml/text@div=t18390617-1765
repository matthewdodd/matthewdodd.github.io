                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Grenville, a tinman and brazier, on Uxbridge Moor. On Saturday night, the 8th of June, my husband and I went to bed after one o'clock—we fastened up the house as usual—a square of glass was out of the back kitchen window, and a square of tin was put in with tacks and putty—that was safe when I went to bed—I put five brass candlesticks in the window when I went to bed—there were four upright ones, one pair was a match, one stood high, which had been mended—the foot had been broken off, and it was white with metal where it had been soldered—one was a chamber candlestick, and another was smaller than the rest—it was an upright one—the shutter was not shut, as it shuts with hinges—I was going to shut it, but found the candlesticks behind it, which prevented my doing so—I got up next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, and found the kitchen curtain down, which had been up the night before, the square of tin out, and the candlesticks gone</p>

               <p>—I have never seen them since—I gave information of the robbery that morning to Murray—the chamber candlestick had a hook, but no extin<lb></lb>guisher, and a piece of soap was taken—the prisoners lodged in a little cottage, about 100 yards from us.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 9th of June, between one and two o'clock, I saw them knock<lb></lb>ing at my door—I was asleep—I got up in consequence of being awoke by my wife, opened the window, and saw the two prisoners—I am certain of them—I asked what they wanted—they told me they had got four candle-sticks to sell me—I said I would have nothing to do with them—I shut the window, and went to bed—I saw them again that day, after dinner, just at the end of my house—they asked why I did not come down stairs to buy the candlesticks, and said they were all right—I did not see the candlesticks—they never came to my house before—I knew them well.</p>

            . I am the wife of James Burke. I had a male child - it was born on the 8th of August - I went out a fortnight after being put to bed; I was going to the parish workhouse in St. Giles, for medical assistance - I sat down on a stone, near a coach-yard, in a court, leading to Broad-street; while I was sitting there the prisoner came to me, and asked me did I know Mrs. Harrage, a midwife, in Church-street; I said I did not; she then went a little way, returned, and said I looked very ill, and she would give me some porter - I told her I had not had my breakfast - she gave me 6 d.; I then went with her into a public-house in Broad-street - I do not know the sign; she called for a pint of porter, gave me a biscuit, and took the child out of my arms; its name is James. She asked me what my husband was - I said he was a poor dealer. She said if she knew where I lived she would call in the afternoon, and bring me some things for my child; I told her I lived at No. 16, Church-street; she then went away - I took the child, and we parted about half-past nine o'clock. She came to me in the afternoon, soon after one o'clock - my landlady and Ann Miers were in the room. She brought some flannel, and some wine to make pap for my child, and something to make a cap; she staid about an hour - I am sure she is the same person. She took my child again out of my arms, and said he was a sweet little child, and she knew a respectable lady who kept a society in her place, and she would take me to her, and she would give me some assistance to help me to keep my child - she said she would come again to me on the Friday - this was on the Wednesday. She came on Friday, late in the evening, after three o'clock - my landlady and Ann Miers were there at the time. I was not ready, and she ironed a pinafore for the child, and a cap for me; she dressed the child while I was cleaning myself to go out - then she rolled the new flannel about him to keep him warm; she told me she would carry the child herself, as I was weak. We went out - when we got to Broad-street she took me by the arm, and we came down to Little Queen-street, she carrying the child all the time. She then said she had to call in Lincoln's Inn-fields, where she should stay but a little time, and then we should be time enough for the lady - we went into Gate-street, to the Sun, public-house; she called for a pint of porter - she took a little of it, and I had some more; she said there was nothing sold there but liquor, and if we had a bit of bread and cheese it would help us on our journey - she gave me 2 d. for bread, 1 1/2 d. for cheese, and 1/2 d. for onions, which she sent me for. I left the child with her while I went, and when I came back she was gone; I was not a quarter of an hour gone. I enquired about her, but could not find her; I had not been in the house long with her - I made a complaint at Bow-street next day or the day after - the child has never been found since. I saw the prisoner again three days before Christmas. (I had used every possible exertion to find the child;) I met the prisoner then in Newgate-market; it was before ten o'clock; I believe she was alone, I had been selling some thread and tapes - she saw me, and went away very smartly; she was coming out of the market, and I followed her across Paternoster-row into St. Paul's Church-yard - I got up to her before she got to a shop; I asked her how she did - she said,</p>
               <p>"My good woman, I don't know you." - I said,</p>
               <p>"You do know me, you gave me 6 d. in St. Giles's." She said I mistook her, and turned into a butter shop close by. I looked out for an officer to take her up. She came out of the shop, and said,</p>
               <p>"My good woman, what are you waiting for?" I said I was waiting for some person. I turned my back, and she left the shop, and went on very quick to Paternoster-row - I had my little basket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130027"></xptr>and could not run so fast as her - I called out,</p>
               <p>"Hold that woman!" The more I hallooed, the faster she ran. When she came to the end of Paternoster-row, she was going up again to Newgate-market; I kept her in view - she then got into a baker's shop, and went into his parlour - I had not told her what the charge was against her; I only said she had given me 6 d. - I caught hold of her mantle, and said she should not go till I had got an officer. A young man saw her running from me, and he ran after us to know what ailed us. She then said she lived at the Old Change, in Cheapside; we went to her house, and then got a man of the name of Jackson, an officer, to take her - two men there said I was an impostor, and wanted to extort money from her; she said the same, and then Jackson would not take charge of her. The men desired me to beg her pardon, and they would let me go; and, as Jackson would not take her, I came out, and said I would go to Bow-street for an officer - I ran very fast, Jackson followed me, and brought me back; and said, it would be a very fit thing to take me before a Magistrate. I was taken to Guildhall; I was put in the bar there, and the two men charged me with being an impostor, and wanting to extort money; and the Magistrate said I ought to be sent to Bridewell; then I went on my knees to the magistrate, and begged he would send to Bow-street, and he would find I was no impostor. The Magistrate then told Jackson to take me to the Compter, till the next day, at twelve o'clock. One of the men then said,</p>
               <p>"No; set her at liberty, if she will promise not to do so any more;" but the Magistrate sent me till next day - I was liberated on Christmas-eve, and the prisoner was taken last Saturday. It was my husband who went to Bow-street; and they said they had nothing to do with it, as it happened in the City. I went to Bow-street, and gave the testimony there; on my solemn oath she is the woman who took my child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you always said that she was the woman? A. Yes; I have always said that was the woman; but I should not know my child. The first house I went to was in Broad-street - I was there half an hour - I saw the woman of the house there; she had an opportunity of seeing me and the prisoner too; there were two men sitting in the tap-room, but I did not know them. I should know the house again, it was opposite the workhouse. On Friday, the 20th of August, the woman came to my house, about three o'clock - I cannot exactly tell how long she staid; she was ironing a pinafore and a cap for the child, and a cap for me; I believe it was about an hour - then we went to the public-house, in Gate-street; we did not stay there long - it must be more than four o'clock. I am sure that when I went to Bow-street I gave a particular description of the woman who had taken my child - I said she had a fair round face, and had the remains of a mark under her left eye; a person who looked in her face could see it at once. After the Alderman had heard the cause, at Guildhall, I went to her house, and took two witnesses with me; and she gave me a direction, and said if any person wanted her she might he seen at her master's house; and begged that any one who could recognise her might come to see her. My landlady said she was not the woman, at Mr. Evans's, and Mrs. Delany said she was not the woman - I fell down on my knees and begged her pardon, for fear she should lay hold of me.</p>

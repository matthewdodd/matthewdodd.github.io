                  </hi>. I am a groom, and live at No. 90, Fetter Lane—on the 28th October, about half-past one in the morning, I was in Gray's Inn Lane, going home from Kentish Town—as I passed by Fox Court the prisoner and two other men were on the pavement—I was in the act of passing them when the prisoner struck me a violent blow in my chest, which knocked me down; it did not knock me exactly on the ground, but against a public-house—before I could fall another man caught me round the neck—the prisoner put his left hand round my neck, and one of the others put his hand over my mouth—the prisoner then put his hand in my right trousers pocket and took out what money there was, a half-crown and three halfpence—they ransacked my pockets and took what was in them—I said, "You are welcome to what there is there, there is only a few halfpence," but there was a half-crown—the prisoner said, "Oh, he has only got a few halfpence; you may as well put that back and let him go, he has got nothing," and he put back the three halfpence—they then let me go—I was determined not to lose sight of them, and I went on the opposite side, close to Gray's Inn, under the dead wall—I saw a female come up, and I saw the prisoner strike her and partly knock her down—I went into Holborn to look for a constable, and I spoke to one of the city men—he said he was not in duty bound to go with me—I went into Middle Row and saw another constable, and he said the city constable was bound to go with me, and as I was coming back to the city constable I saw another constable in Gray's Inn Road talking to another man who had been ill-used—ultimately G 249 went with me—I saw the prisoner on the</p>

I was in Gray's Inn Lane on the morning of the 28th October—the last witness came to me about sixty yards from Fox Court—he pointed out the prisoner to me and I took him into custody—I did not search him at the time—I charged him with assaulting William Carr and Richard Stanley, and robbing them—he said he was not guilty of the charge, that he had not been in the place for two hours—I took him to the station and searched him—I found on him a half-crown, a three penny piece, three penny pieces and a halfpenny—he gave his address No. 17, Union Terrace—he said he had received the money from his master—he was the worse for liquor, but quite sensible—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

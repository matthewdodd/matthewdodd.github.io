On Sunday, the 3d of August, I had nineteen sheep in the marshes - I missed seven that day, but found three about a mile and a half or two miles off: I came to Smithfield on the Monday and found the other four in Hill's pen; the prisoner lives at Southockenden, about four miles from me. I do not think he knew my premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He has been bailed with your consent and surrendered? A. Yes - we overtook him on the road when we were looking for them and talked to him about them; he had not got them then - the marsh gates are sometimes open; two of a farmer's sheep had got away - I have known the prisoner several years; he belongs to a respectable family - I said at the office that I did not think he stole them: I say so now - if he did not steal them, I think he knew who did.</p>

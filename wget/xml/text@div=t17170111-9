             deposed, that her Mother having left the Money with her, she having Occasion to go out, put it into a little Box, and that Box into a larger in a Closet, the Prisoner being in the Room at the same Time; and at her Return, which was in a very small Time, she found the little Box broke to Pieces, and thrown behind the great one, and the Money gone. Another Evidence deposed, that she was in the same Room, and in the Absence of Ann Fox, the Prisoner went into the Closet, and went immediately away, and never returned, though she lodg'd there. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and said she had some Business to go out, and God sent her a Friend to provide for her, and therefore she did not return.

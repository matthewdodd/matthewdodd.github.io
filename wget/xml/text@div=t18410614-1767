                  </hi>. I am in the Royal Artillery band, and am called the big drummer. I have seen Hands—on the 1st of May he came to my house with his horse and cart, and asked me to have the kindness to go to the station and state that a watch belonged to me, and that I sent the pri<lb></lb>soner Burt to the pawnbroker's to pawn it—he also told me to say the watch was sent to me by my brother-in-law—I went to the Woodman public-house, and Hands treated me to a little porter—I went to Burl's with him, and then to Booth's—Hands did not go in at first with me, he did at last, and when he was there Booth asked me if I knew what kind of a chain it was—I said I did not know, and went out of the shop—there was no truth in what Hands wanted me to say—it was not my watch—I did not send Burt to pawn it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker. I have taken this gold watch to pieces, and the two silver ones—the two silver ones, without the chain, are worth 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—this is a gold watch and gold case—it is worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I have examined these chains—this one to the gold watch is nothing better than metal—I call it copper and brass mixed—I do not believe there is any gold about it—I have not tried the ring or key, but I have the chain—I should say the chain as it is, is not worth more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe the seal, key, and ring are plated—they are better than the chain—I will swear they are not solid—I have not assayed them—I have tested the chain with aqua fort is, but not the ring and key.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you, as a jeweller, detect the ring and key without aquafortis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not to tell how much gold is in them—this other chain is not solid gold—there is a portion of gold in it—it is not so good as jeweller's gold—it is not worth more than 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would that chain be worth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not tested the seal and key.</p>

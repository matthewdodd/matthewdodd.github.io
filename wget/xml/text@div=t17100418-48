Being asked whether the Prisoner knew Capt. Hansberg, replied, that he did, for he was Abroad with him in Flanders. The Prisoner in his Defence-produced divers Witnesses to prove that he had-been drinking from Nine in the Morning till Ten at Night, at which time he came from the Cross-Keys Tavern, Covent-Garden, with Mr. Broad the Balliff, who deposed he left him very much in Drink, and as he thought going to his own House. There was nothing in the whole Evidence for the Prisoner that contradicted any thing that was Sworn by the Queen's Evidence, so that after my Lord Chief Justice Parker had summed up the Evidence on both sides, the Jury went out, and returned in about four Hours, well satisfied with the Proof of the Fact, but not as to the Points of Law, and therefore brought in their <rs id="t17100418-48-verdict209" type="verdictDescription">

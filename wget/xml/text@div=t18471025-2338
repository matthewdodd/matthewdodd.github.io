                  </hi> I am a linen-draper, at Uxbridge. The prisoner was in my service five or six weeks—he was employed to receive money for me, and was to pay it to the cashier at the desk, unless he was out of the way—the prisoner was to make an entry of the moneys he received in his own book, and to give a check in at the desk which ought to correspond with his book—this is his book—here is an entry, last Monday, of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the check is only for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Iver. I went to Mr. Jones' shop at Uxbridge, last Monday, and bought some print, some lining, and unbleached calico—the prisoner served me—I paid him two half-crowns and a sixpence—he gave me a bill which I left behind on the counter—this is it.</p>

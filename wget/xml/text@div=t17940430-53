               <p>I live with Mr. Naylor, I took a parcel of sugar from the prisoner; on the 5th of April, I took two pounds out of his pocket; he was Mr. Naylor's porter in the house. In going out of the warehouse on Saturday, the 5th of April, I brushed against the prisoner's coat, I thought it felt hard, I examined it, and took a parcel of sugar out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300090"></xptr>Q. By examining it you mean you felt in his pockets I suppose? - Certainly. I put the sugar in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this coat on his back at the time? - No, it was hanging up, afterwards I called the men to receive their wages, and the prisoner came, and he put his coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you perceived the coat with the sugar? - Past seven o'clock in the evening. When we got the men into that part of the warehouse where they are generally paid, I accosted the prisoner about having some sugar about him, more than he ought to have; I asked him if he had not a parcel about him, which was not his own? he turned out one pocket, there was a bit of bread in that; I asked him what there was in the other? and desired him to take it out; he turned out a parcel of sugar in a paper, and in a paper bag likewise, I had before seen it, it was opened then, and I saw it contained sugar; we asked him what he took the sugar for? and he -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not you tell him it would be better for him if he was to tell how he came to take it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him it would be better to confess? - No, I did not, I only asked him how he came to do it, and what was his motive? he muttered something, but I could not hear what he said exactly; the constable was sent for to take him to the Poultry Compter; the sugar I kept in my possession, it is impossible to swear to it, because there are sugars of all qualities, but we have sugar in the house exactly of that quality.</p>

               <p>Q. And so may a great many people? - There is no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was these any thing in the bag that you could swear to? - No, I believe it was the very bag that he brought his victuals in the morning with.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of sugar was it? - East India raw sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. It was impossible for you to have missed such a quantity as two pounds? - It was, Mr. Naylor is a wholesale grocer.</p>

            . Last Saturday was a Fortnight, I lost 20 s. and I suspected the Prisoner, because she had bought herself some Things in Rag-Fair, - that Gown upon her Back, in particular. So I took her up, on the Monday following, and when she was before Justice De Veil, she confessed she took 20 s. of my Money out of my Box, and told the Justice there was one Half-crown, and all the rest of the Money was in Shillings and Six-pences. The Money I lost was in such Pieces, in a Box which I put in a Cupboard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know what Questions to ask him; I know nothing about his Money. He charges me with taking it, because he saw I had got this old Rag of a Gown upon my Back, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160015"></xptr> a Pair of Shoes on my Feet. But as to these Things, I had a young Man, - an Acquaintance of mine, that I had kept Company with, and he was going to Sea; and before he left me, he gave me 8 s. to buy me a Gown and a Pair of Shoes. When he took me up, I don't know what I said to him, for I was very much in Liquor, and he took a blue Apron, and a Shilling from me at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Cable. When she made this Confession, she returned me a Shilling of my Money again. <rs id="t17400416-22-verdict130" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. How did he drop it? - A. He had got his hand to his breeches pocket, and he slipped it down the thigh; I stooped-down to pick it up, and he attempred to get away from me, but I would not let him; I led him immediately into my own house, the King's-arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was found upon him? - A. A great many halfpence; I cannot say how many, they apeared to me to be all good.</p>

M. upon it; I gave it to Mr. Prestow, upon the Monday, and he delivered it to Newman; I cannot distinguish which is the one that dropped from the prisoner.</p>

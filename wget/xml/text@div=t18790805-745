                  </hi>. I am a convict in Pentonville Prison—I was convicted on 15th October, 1878, with the prisoner Workman and Harding, but Harding was not charged at the same time—at the end of July or the beginning of August I went by appointment to Workman's house, 42, Stafford Street, Peckham—the appointment was for 12, but he did not come till 3—he apologised for being late, and said that he had been to see a man named Kippar, an old friend of his, who had a friend who had a safe job on, but he did not seem to like the idea of it; and he was going next day, Saturday, and should take a wax, and it would not be his fault if he did not bring an imp, meaning an impression—I asked him if it was worth attending to—he said "Yes, there is 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it on Mondays, and on quarter days there is generally between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I went again next Sunday to Workman's house, and he showed me the impression of a key on wax, and it was to be attended to at once—I said "Do you know it to be a perfect one"—he said "Yes, I took it myself at Kippar's house; we looked over a lot of keys, and I found one which could be altered to suit the wax impression instead of making a new key—in the evening I went to his house again and saw Workman and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Chandler and Baker and Jane West—Baker and Chandler were talking about Maudslay's affair in Westminster Bridge Road, and Baker was shown the impression of the key—Workman fetched it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050145"></xptr>
               <p>from the next room—I assisted Workman in making the key daring the week, and on the next Saturday I went with him to Kippar's house, in York Street, London Road—Workman introduced me to Kippar as his friend, and gave him a key—the prisoner went out with it and returned in a few minutes and said "I have given it to Simkins, he will be out to lunch presently, and then we shall know the result"—shortly afterwards Simkins came in; I had not seen him before—Workman introduced me to him as his friend, and Simkins gave him the key, and said "It does not fit, old fellow; I have had it in the lock, and had a hard job to get it out," and showed his hand where he had knocked the skin off—he gave me the key, and I pointed out the fault, one of the wards was wrong in front—Workman said that as Simkins was going to give the key up in a day or two we had better take a fresh imp. of it—I did so on the same wax, and gave it to Simkins, who said that he would not stay, he was going on an errand, and we were to meet him in a public-house at Southwark Bridge Road, and talk it over—a few minutes afterwards I met Simkins in a public-house, and Kippar asked me to go with him to Union Street—I said that it was not safe for me to be seen in his company, but Simkins said "Go with him, and hear what he has to say"—they went, and two hours afterwards I met Workman in the London Road—he said that the arrangement he made was to enter the premises through 'the passage door, which was to be opened by a false key—he said "We have plenty of skels" meaning skeletons, "which will open them"—I asked him what time it was to be done—he said between 8 and 10 o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—I went on the Monday morning to Kippar's house with the key, and as we passed Mr. Yate's office Workman pointed it out as the place we were going to do—we found Kippar at home—Simkins came in, and said that he knew we were there, for he saw us from the office—Workman gave him the key, and he said that he thought it would do—Simkins said that he thought it would do, and he would very soon see, and he came back in half an hour, and said that it opened the safe quite as well as the original, and the only thing we wanted was the cash—he said "By the by, the scheme we made on Saturday will have to be abandoned, because nobody can open the office door without being seen by the people living in the kitchen, and fresh arrangements will have to be made"—he said that he was going out, and we asked if we could not see the safe—he said "Yes, if you wish, come over in about an hour's time"—in about an hour Workman and I went over; we saw Simkins and a female in front of us—we went in, and he said "Oh, you have come"—we said that we had to complain of the rain which was coming through the roof of the house in Bale Road—that was merely to get behind the counter—we fixed upon Dale Road because Simkins told us he collected rents there for Mr. Yate's property—we passed behind the counter, and saw the safe under the counter—Simkins said that he would send a plumber to see to it—two gentlemen were in the back office, one of whom Simkins said was the governor—I saw Kippar return to his lodging about 12.30, and about 5 o'clock the same evening Simkins called—we stayed there all the afternoon—Workman asked how much cash there was in it—he said "Only a few pounds," and if we were ready to do it it was not worth doing that day, for the new collector came in just about 4 o'clock, and took it to the bank—the revolving shutters fasten inside with a thumb screw at the bottom, and it was arranged that Simkins was to leave the screw out so that we could lift the shutters, and after we entered we were to put them</p>

               <p>secure, and pass out at the passage door so that no suspicion should be thrown upon him—I went to Kippar's during the week—he said that the collector brought home Jess than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Mondays, but every quarter it varied from 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the bank closed at 4 o'clock—he said that the new collector was Sergeant Hammond, who had recently left the police, and that he had been collector prior to Hammond; that the governor had a small private safe in his office, but he did not know the contents of it—a few days afterwards I saw Kippar again—we had arranged that he should come to Workman's house; he came there and told us that there was between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the safe, and asked us if we would do it for that; we both said no, we would rather wait a little longer—he said that he had to be back before Sim kins left to tell him about arranging the shutters—we said that if there was more than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it we would do it—I went to Kippar's place the next week, and Workman asked him if he could account for the small amount being in the safe lately—he said "Yes, the new collector was very punctual in taking all the cash to the bank"—we then agreed to put it off till quarter-day—Workman was arrested on 15th September and I on the 21st—I left the key with my mother at Bermondsey—I gave evidence last Sessions against Workman and others in Maudslay's matter—I gave information to Inspector Hunt, who showed me this key (produced)—it is the one I made to fit the safe—I know a man named Liddicott—I did not see Simkins talking to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. I spoke to Mr. Hunt on, I think, June 24, and wrote an order from Southwark Police Court for thorn to go for this key—it was about the beginning of July that I gave information which led to the prisoners' arrest—I first met Simkins about the latter end of August or the beginning of September, 1878, at Kippar's house—I know it was five or six weeks previous to my apprehension for housebreaking in the Old Kent Road—my friend Workman was arrested previous to me, and a man named Harding, but Baker is his proper name—the first time I saw Simkins was when I took the key to him at Kippar's house—I mostly saw him there—I was not a friend of Kippar's till I was introduced by Workman:—I only visited Simkins while this thing was going on—I went several times to his house during the present case, and I saw him once in a public-house on the day we went to Union Street—we had a glass when we all met at Kippar's house—Simkins drank a glass or two; he never stayed more than a quarter or half an hour—we generally met about 11 a.m. when he came out to lunch, and Simkins would run over sometimes for a minute if he was going on an errand—I have been at Kippar's two or three hours, and Simkins has called in twice—we made it a rule to be there at 11 o'clock to catch him when he came out to lunch, and I have seen him there in the evening—I do not know that he was engaged to be married to Kippar's daughter—I do not know that I have seen her at the house—I saw a girl at the police-court who was represented as his daughter—I have not spoken to Harding or Baker since I was apprehended—I did not see him at the police-court giving evidence—Mr. Hunt told me that he was a witness. Cross-examined by Mr. Ribton. My age is 33—I have been convicted I believe six times prior to this, and am now under sentence of penal servi<lb></lb>tude for 20 years—I have been sentenced to penal servitude twice—I gave evidence last Session against my friend Workman, and his brother-in-law and his wife—I have been tried at the Surrey Sessions once too often, that</p>

I succeeded Simkins as collector—I know Kippar, he occupied the first floor at 29, York Street, which house is Mr. Yates's property—I have seen Kippar and Simkins together—Simkins was in the habit of going there—I saw a report in a newspaper of the apprehension of Rogers and Workman for burglary—Kippar said that he knew Workman over the way—I was collecting with Simkins—he ceased on August 7—the most I have collected in a day is a little over 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I once missed the key of the safe; it is generally in the safe during the day unless I require it—I remember Workman well, he reported himself on one occasion to me—I have not seen him since that; he is wonderfully altered—if the bolt was left out the shutters could by raised quite easily.</p>

I am the wife of Isaac Rudd of 29, York Street—in August last Kippar occupied the first floor, and Simkins visited him there sometimes once and sometimes two or three times a day—about the end of July or the beginning of August he said to me as I came through the kitchen, "Allow me to introduce to you my friend John Rogers"—I understood it was "John," but I know it was Rogers—I should not know the man again.</p>

I had Rogers in custody in the Old Kent Road, and received information from him and from Harding in reference to the intended burglary at Maudslay's—I have seen Rogers since, and he gave me information in consequence of which I went to his mother with a written authority from him—he gave me her address, and I received from her the key—I received certain orders from the Home Office as to taking out a warrant—I took Simkins and read the warrant to him, he said "I know nothing about it"—Mr. Yates then came from the back office, and I took this key out of my pocket and said, "Mr. Yates, will you be so kind as to fit this key into your safe?"—Simkins said, "I know all about it; they got my key from me while I was drunk, I had heard them say they intended to break into our place and I came back and told Mr. King so"—I asked Mr. Yates whether he had told him of the project to break into his place—he said "No"—Simkins said "No, I did not tell him"—I made this memo<lb></lb>randum at the time—he afterwards said, "It was all through drink or I should never have known them"—Mr. Yates pointed out a safe behind a desk—I tried the key to it, and it fitted very nicely—I found on Simkins a pocket-book, some papers, and a loan society's book, showing a loan granted to him, and this letter.</p>

Baker or Harding was convicted at the Surrey Sessions, and sentence was postponed—before that he gave evidence in another case, and they were convicted, and he was then sentenced to 12 months' hard labour, which was to run concurrent with another sentence, so that it was only equal to a sentence of two months—I know nothing against Kippar.</p>

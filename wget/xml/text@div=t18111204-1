               <p>Q. Did you find him - A. Yes; he was then standing in an oyster-shop; Charlotte went across to him, leaving me on the opposite side; after speaking to him she told me that all was right; then I went across with her to him, and I said to him that his wife had been fearful of his being detected, and he blamed her for being foolish; he had then a tortoise shell snuff box, with a miniature picture within. That is the box. He had some small silver medals in his hands. I walked with her, she went to Mr. Miller's in Westminster-road; she sold the medals to him. I did not go in with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask her how that could be done while the servant was in the house - A. Yes, I did ask her; she said that she went to see the maid-servant, and that he got in the back way; he knew the way of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hear this - A. Yes, he was bye and heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. You all went together to your house - A. Yes; but before that she pledged the small lip-salve box for two shillings. Rogers had left a bundle at my house while his wife and I were out. When I went home I saw the bundle, I opened it for curiosity; there was a muslin handkerchief, and two or three shirts; he had the snuff box in his pocket at that time, and went away with it. He produced a large silver medal; this is it, my husband weighed it, and it weighed six ounces. I saw no more medals than that, and that one snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any watch - A. Yes; not that night. I saw the watch I believe on the Thursday after, the 26th of September; Mr. Rogers pulled, it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that look like the watch - A. It was a deeply engraved case. I can almost be positive to that being the watch, and tied with a purple ribbon, as this is; he said he had taken that from Mr. Bird's. Rogers, on Friday the 27th, called again at my house, he said, that he meaned to put the property back. On Sunday the 29th of September I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day that he quarrelled with you - A. Yes; he came in the morning and fetched away the snuff-box, the medal, and the watch that he had left with me. On the Sunday evening he came drunk and quarrelled with a person in the house; he did not quarrel with us; Mrs. Baines, a neighbour came in; she picked up the case of a watch, Mrs. Rogers took it away from Mrs. Baines and gave it to her husband; he took the watch out of his pocket, clapped it on the watch, and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same watch that you have been speaking of - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. I believe you live in St. George's Fields - A. Yes; close to where Mr. Willmore lives.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of Sunday the 29th of September did you hear any disturbance in Mr. Willmore's house - A. Yes, in consequence of that I went in, I found the prisoner Rogers there, and his wife; I found in the parlour the case of a watch on the floor. He had been quarrelling before I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a gold case - A. I cannot say whether it was gold or metal, it shined very much. It was engraved, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that it - A. I believe it was something similar to that. I said, I have found the case of a watch on the floor, Mrs. Rogers said it was her husband's; I gave it her; she said it was nothing but metal; she gave it to her husband; he took his watch out; he put the case on the watch, and put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLER. I am a silversmith and salesman, No. 1, Coates-row near Westminster bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you purchase any silver medals in September last - A. Yes, I did. I suppose it was about a week before this robbery came out, I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sold them you - A. Mrs. Rogers, the woman at the bar, sold them me. It was in the evening, about seven o'clock. I cannot say exactly the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of them were they - A. Thirty three coins.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost such coins as these, and more in number similar to them. I cannot speak particularly to them.</p>

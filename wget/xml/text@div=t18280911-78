               <p>Q. Did he from time to time meet you and speak to you? A. Yes; I came by his house about a week after I meet him in Piccadilly - he began abusing me in the same sort of manner, and we both had a row, not a fight, but rough language; he called me a d - d informer, and such like - I gave him as good as he brought, but no blows passed: he went in doors, and brought out this thing, or one like it, and said if I came near him he would rip my g - ts out with it; I went away - I saw him again on the 30th of August.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long might that be after your last meeting? A. From three to live months.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had anything passed between you during that time? A. No; I was coming from the Feathers public-house, where I had been for change - I came up as far as his house, and met one of my men named Joe, who I had to pay some money to; I settled with him - I was four or five minutes settling with him, and he went away; I was then talking to Mr. Heath, when the prisoner came out of his house, with some lead in his hand - he held it up, and said, "Bl - st you, do you want any more lead to pay your men with?" I said, "You had better go in doors, you old fool, and mind your own business"- I went on talking a little to Mr. Heath, and the prisoner said, "What have you done with your wh - s of sisters? they are all wh - s together;" I had said nothing more to him; he said, "If you don't go off my premises, I'll shove you off;" when he said my sisters were wh - s, I walked up to him, and said, "You had better turn your old wh - e out of doors. and take your wife in, and not meddle with our family;" he then shoved me off the pavement - I was on the public pavement, not on his premises at all; he shoved me into the road - I held up my elbows, and told him if he would come out of doors like a man I would give him a good thrashing; he said, "I will serve you out another way;" he went in doors, and fetched this thing out, or one like it - he came down one or two steps, and made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110066"></xptr>one push at me, down towards the bowels; it was a sort of thrust - he caught it back again without it striking me, and then it was in my eye before I could put my hand or anything to stop it; I did not see it done, it was in so quick, or I should have tried to stop it - it went right through my eye-lid, and pushed my eye out; some part of my eye is in, but I am quite blind - I have lost the sight of it altogether; in drawing it back the sharp part of the instrument caught the inside bone above the eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he did this to you had you ever struck him, or anything? A. I had neither struck him, nor struck at him; when I held up my arm and said I would fight him if he came out like a man, I was not above a yard from him. I was confined to my bed eight or nine days, and had two surgeons to attend me - I had nothing whatever to do with what happened to him at the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. It began by his asking you to have another piece of lead? A. Yes, we abused each other; I know William Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he interpose before you received the injury, and say if you did not go away perhaps some mischief would take place? A. Never - I did not see him at all; he did not come in between us; nobody desired me to go away. I know Smith - he lodges in the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You said "Go in you old fool;" did you not use tenfold more abusive language? A. I did not; he was not in the house when I said if he came out I would fight him - he was on the footpath.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you not foreing into his door, after him, when you received the blow from him? A. I was not - there was nothing to prevent his hitting my bowels if he chose: he did not say he was sorry for the injury I had received, and that he only meant to knock my hat off - he never said a word of the kind; I did not at the time suppose I had received so serious an injury.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you when you said, if he came out of doors you would fight him like a man? A. On the footpath, and he was on his steps; he pushed me into the road before that - I did not see Smith at any part of the trasaction.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HEATH. I am a cow-keeper, and live in Ebury-street. I was in conversation with the prosecutor on the 30th of August, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; the prisoner came out - he was at the door when I first saw him, with some lead in his hand; he began shaking it about, and asking Green if he wanted some lead to pay his men, and called him a d - d informer; he told him it was no lead of his - Green tried to avoid him as much as he could, by turning to me again; he told him not to be such a fool, but to go in and mind his own business - after that the prisoner began again, and wanted to know what he had done with his sisters and their bastard children; I do not know what he called his sister - Green told him to leave his sisters' names alone, or he would pull him up for it; Green and I then walked into the road, on the pavement, and the prisoner said if Green did not get off his ground he would make him; we were on the public path: Green then said if he had any inclination for that he would come a little closer to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Inclination for what? A. To make him get off the pavement; Green walked towards his door and the prisoner pushed him off the pavement into the road; I am certain Green had not touched him; he had a pencil and pocketbook in his hand at the time; he turned round after that, and told him if he would come out into the road he would fight him, but would not touch him on his own premises - he was then standing on the step of his own door; the prisoner then made allusions again to Green's sisters, saying,"What have you done with your sisters and their bastard children?" Green said, "Don't talk about other people, turn your old wh - e out of your house, and take your wife in;" there might be a few more words pass, but nothing of any provocation that I can recollect - the conversation ceased; I was sideways to them, and could not see the prosecutor after he pushed him off the pavement; the conversation ceased for a minutes and a half or two minutes, and I saw no more till I saw the instrument go into his eye; I did not see the prisoner come out; I saw nothing but a hand come out of the house with the instrument in it, which went into the prosecutor's eye; I was on the same side of the way, and there is a board at the side of the door, so that I could not see; Green was turning towards me, and I saw the instrument enter his eye; I saw the water gush from his eye, and ran to his assistance; I saw the prisoner and another person in the passage - they banged the door too, and bolted or locked it, and I saw no more of him; Green was dangerously ill for some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a great deal of bad language on both sides? A. Very little more than I have stated - it did not last ten minutes altogether; the pavement is very narrow - there are two boards up at the door, so that I could not see what passed; I saw the instrument come out as from the prisoner's door and strike Green in the eye; when I went to Green's assistance I looked into the passage and saw another person down the passage; I had not seen him before, and who he was I cannot say; I did not see the blow aimed at Green's stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Green approached, and was he not going into the prisoner's house at the time the blow came? A. No; he was standin still, opposite the door - his own house is on the opposite side; he was not going into the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was he doing when the blow came? A. Standing on the pavement, and I suppose turning to come to me again as we were talking on business - the conversation had ceased nearly two minutes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say they went in and shut the door, how many persons were present when the thrust was made? A. Two were in the passage, the prisoner and another - I said they shut the door; I saw nobody but the prisoner go in at the door.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the person in the passage ever out of the house? A. I did not see him, only the prisoner; I do not know how long the person had been in the passage.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live in Royal Hospital-row, Chelsea. I was in the centre of the road when this happened, about twenty minutes past six o'clock; I came out of a door where I had been doing a job, and a row commenced between Mayden and Green; Mayden was the first who spoke, he had some cuttings of lead in his hand, and said, "Bl - t your eyes, do you want any more lead to pay your men with?" Green said, "Go in you old fool do, and mind your business;" Mayden said,"Go home and look at your wh - s of sisters and their bastard children;" Green said, "Go and turn that old wh - e out that you have in doors, and take your own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110067"></xptr>lawful wife in doors;" with that the prisoner pushed Green off the footpath into the kennel. Green said,"If you will come out I will fight you like a man;" Mayden said, "No - I'll do for you in another way;" he then went into the house at the shop door, and was gone the space of a minute or so, and returned with this pump book or sucker hook, and made a thrust at his bowels, underhanded, with a direction for the hip; the prosecutor drew back a little and it did not reach him; he then rose it instantly overhanded and made a thrust, and drove it into his right eye - (here the witness described the thrust by holding the instrument in his right hand, and passing it between the finger and thumb of his left hand) - it struck his forehead bone, so that I am sure it might have been heard fifty yards off - nobody interfered in any way with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The blow might have been heard fifty yards off? A. I never heard such a blow; the reason he did not receive the first blow was, because he drew back; the prosecutor did not square at him when he offered to fight him, nor lift up his arms at him - he rose his arms to save himself when he was pushed into the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. When he pushed his arms up was not the prisoner within his own door? A. No; the prisoner was at the bottom of the step are outside - it might be twenty or thirty yards from Green's own door; there are boards on each side the prisoner's door, that is for the convenience of the business he carries on.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath - if what you tell us is true, that the prisoner was down the step, out of his house, must not Heath have seen him? A. You asked me where Green was; Green was a yard and a half-from the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say he pushed him off the pavement into the road - how high is the road from the pavement? A. Six or seven inches, when I speak of the distance from the door, I mean from the door, not from the wooden shouldering that projects about twenty inches.</p>

            . I live next door to Green. On the 30th of August I was about three hundred yards off, on the opposite side to the prisoner's house, and saw the prisoner come out with some lead on his arm; he said "D - n me, do you want some more money to pay your men with"- Green said "No, you had better go in doors, you old fool, and mind your business" - then he shoved Green off the pavement into the gutter; the prisoner then went in, and laid down the lead pipe which he had in his hand - I saw him bring out a bucket book, like the one produced - he made a blow at Green's bowels; nothing more was said in my presence; I was about ten yards off - I heard nothing pass, but saw the prisoner job the instrument into Green's eye, and saw the stuff run down his cheek; the prisoner then went in and shut the door; Coulman and a person named Glenton went for an officer, and while they were gone he came out at the front door - I went after him, and said "Mayden, you must not go away;" he said "It is no business of yours" - I said "It was business of somebody's - you don't know the consequence of it;" I pressed him to come back - be came back, and the officer took him; the people asked "What was the matter?" - he said "only another lead rig."</p>
               <p>Q. While this was going on, did any one interfere between the parties? A. Nobody whatever - not a soul - nobody could get between them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you hear me put a question about anybody getting between them? A. No, I was out of the Court - nobody did get between them - I was about ten yards off.</p>
               <p>JANE BROWN. My husband is a carpenter and joiner. I heard none of the conversation between the prisoner and prosecutor - I was out of doors opposite to Mr. Mayden's door; I saw Green with a book and pencil in his hand, and a man talking to him - I saw Mayden come out and say something to Green; they said a few words - Green stepped up to Mayden, and Mayden pushed him off the payment - Green then never resented nor lifted his hand, but turned his shoulder in this way, and then Mayden went in for about a minute, came out again with an iron weapon in his hand, and aimed it at Green's bowels, and in a moment rushed it into his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. In all that time did Green attempt to strike him in any manner? A. I never saw it - nobody came in between them, nor attempted to part them; I could not help seeing it if they had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live there? A. In the same street. I heard none of the bad language - I am not deaf.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could you hear that language was going on? A. There was abusive language, but I could not distinguish what it was.</p>

            . I am a builder. There was an inquiry at the Police-office about some lead, and after that I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's presence - they had a few words, and the prisoner went in doors, and brought out a pump hook; this was six weeks or two months before the 30th of August; he brandished it about, and said he would do for him - he said "D - n your eyes, you are nothing but a common informer. you bl - y fool," and all that sort of language; he continued abusing him, telling him he would poke it into him, or knock his head off, and brandished it about at the same time; he said he would poke it into him, or rip his guts out - Green then went away; I saw him again about the first week in August - he was coming down the street, and said to me "Tommy, do you want any more lead?" - Green was not present; I said No; and he lifted up this instrument, and said"Either you or Green shall have it before you are many months or two months older."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When this passed, had not Green and him a good many words? A. I believe Green d - d him, and he d - d Green - he flourished the instrument over his head, but did not hit him with it.</p>

Gentlemen, this originated from a lead concern; there had been several rows between Green and me, and he laid himself in my way on several occasions, but the last row was about the lead; I went out, and was stretching a piece of lead - words ensued - he called me; I said to him "Do you want any more old lead?" - he said"You bl - y old b - g - r, turn out your old wh - e and take in your wife;" I went in doors directly, and going into the shop, knocked down this sucker hook with my right shoulder - I shut the door, and fell down over two pieces of lead - I took the hook up to move the lead, and as I had brought 10 cwt. of lead from Kensington that day, the place was very full; I tumbled down, and coming into the shop knocked the hook down - I moved a little lead to get the door open, and on opening it who should I see but Green there - he had followed me up to my door; I thought the row was done - I opened the door to hang the hook up, and there stood Green - "Come out, you bl - y old b - g - r, and I will fight you, (said he) - "you old b - g - r, turn out your bl - y old w - e;" I put my hand to him, and said "Green, go away, I want to say nothing more to you" - that is the time they say I shoved him - I was in my shop when he called me all these dreadful names, and he had got a new hat on, which he said he had bought with the money for the information; I went to knock his hat off his head with the hook, and unluckily it went into his eye, which I did not intend to do, God knows; and when I found he was hurt, I told them "For God's sake, take him to Doctor Hunter as quick as possible - I was so much hurt I did not know what to do; the only intention I had was to knock his hat off with the sucker hook - I have been extremely sorry ever since - I always inquired of every person who came to see me in prison how his eye was - whether he had lost it or not.</p>

            . I am a mason, and lodge in the prisoner's house. I was at home when this accident happened - I saw the prosecutor there, but did not see him come; when I first came out of doors I saw Green at the door, with one foot on the bottom step of the door - there are two steps to the prisoner's door, besides the cill; the next thing was, he was putting himself in a posture as though he was going to fight - he was then within a yard of the prisoner, when I saw that I ran to him, gave him a shove, and said "For God's sake Green go away, or else something serious may happen;" I then got on the top step of the door, between the two, before the accident happened, and immediately I got between them the accident happened - there was most dreadful language used on both sides.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prosecutor was within a yard of him, squaring at him, just before it happened? A. Yes - I have measured the stones. When I first saw the prisoner he was about one foot nine inches within his own door, on the cill; the whole of the step and pavement together is a foot and seven inches wide, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were in the house - where was the prisoner when you got on the top step, between him and the prosecutor? A. The prisoner was within his own workshop, and the prosecutor stood on the pavement - I stood on the cill of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You were on the cill? A. No - I was on the step; the prisoner was within the cill from a foot to nine inches; the prosecutor was below the two steps on the pavement - I did not notice any body about, I was so busy parting the two persons; there were a great many people, but I could not notice them - I was not present at first; I saw that hook in Mayden's hand; he had it in his hand when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What, when he came into the house? A. No - I believe, to the best of my knowledge, he was never out of the house; I never saw him out - I was not there when he had the lead.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses gave the prisoner the character of a good tempered man.</p>

            . I am the servant in Wadmore's house; I know the brass cock and ball were safe in the cistern on the evening of the 7th of March; I saw it safe, between six and seven o'clock. On the morning of the 8th of March, a little after six, the watchman came; I looked in the cistorn, the cock and ball were gone, and some of the pipe was wrenched off.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JONES. On the 8th of March, a quarter after four o'clock, I saw the prisoner about five yards from the prosecutor's house. It snowed very hard at the time. He threw down the lead pipe, ball; and cock. I asked him what he threw down; he said his glove that he had just picked up. I took him to the watchhouse. This is the brass cock, ball, and lead pipe.</p>

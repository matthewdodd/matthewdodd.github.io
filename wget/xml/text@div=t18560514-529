                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of No. 29, John-street, Bedford-row. I manage the business of my brother, a stationer, in Paternoster-row—on 26th April, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner entered the office—I was busy writing my evening letters for the mail, and had not much time to speak to him—he was standing at my back, the desk</p>

               <p>being against the wall—I had finished one letter, and took out my gold pencil case, worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to seal it with, after which I laid it down on the table—the prisoner, who was about two feet from me, took it up, asked the price, and made some other remarks, which I did not pay much attention to (we do not sell pencil cases, we are wholesale stationers, and only sell paper)—being busy writing, I did not observe him leave the room, but heard the door shut, and then missed the pencil case—I went to the stairs and saw the prisoner just about to go out into Paternoster-row—I called to him, but he made no reply—I hesitated for a moment to leave the place, as there was nobody there but myself—I then ran into Paternoster-row, but did not see him—a man passing spoke to me, and I ran into St. Paul's Churchyard, and saw the prisoner running—he was stopped by a policeman, and I saw my pencil case in the policeman's hand—the prisoner was taken lo the station.</p>

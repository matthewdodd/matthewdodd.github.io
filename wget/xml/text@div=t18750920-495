I am a watchmaker, of Rathbone Place—on Saturday evening, 4th September, about 11 o'clock, I met the prisoner in Hyde Park, and walked with her away from the path I under a tree—I promised to give her half a crown, but did not do so; as I only kissed her—I felt for the money to give her and missed my purse from my right hand trousers pocket, containing a sovereign, a half-sovereign, a new half-crown, a shilling, a few pence, and some postage stamps—I accused her in English of taking it—I said "You have my money"—she said some<lb></lb>thing which I did not understand—I then found my purse in her hand under her shawl, and took it from her—there was then only 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and ten postage stamps in it—she went away fast, and I went back to my friends, who were about 15 paces off—I afterwards found her with a man and gave her in charge—on the next afternoon, about 3.30, I went with my friends to the tree and found two postage stamps on the grass—I did not feel the prisoner's hand in ray pocket.</p>

I am a watch—maker, of 34, New North Road—I was with Paetzold when he and the pri<lb></lb>soner went away on to the grass—I could not see what took place, nor did I hear him say anything when the prisoner was there—he came back, and I was there when the prisoner was given in charge—she was walking fast—I went with him next day to the tree and found two postage stamps.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 27, Denmark-street, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-fields. I am the owner of the house—I am a coach-trimmer and harness-maker—I let the bottom part of the house for a beer shop—I have no shop of my own—I have not done any business for some time—I am sure I am the landlord of the house—there is a communication</p>

               <p>tbetween my house and the beer-shop—there is a door that goes into the pas<lb></lb>sage—about half-past ten o'clock on Sunday night, the 14th of February, is ring at my bell first attracted my attention—I keep the two rooms on the first floor, and the back room on the second floor—the bell rung in conse<lb></lb>quence of my nephew calling for something he had left there—I went down one flight of stairs, and met my lodger's daughter on the first-floor landing, and she opened the door—my nephew came up stairs—I gave him the light to go up stairs and get his parcel—before the shade of the light had gone I put the key into the first-floor door, and found the bolt would not shut—I laid hold of the handle of the door and found it was open—I went in about two or three steps, and discerned a light as I thought, but I thought probably it might be the gas-light—I stood for a moment, and saw a man's arm advance with a light, by which I could distinguish up as far as the elbow—I called out "Who are you? what do you want there?"—upon which the light was immediately dropped or put out—at the mo<lb></lb>ment I saw the figure of a man, by the gas, through the window, en<lb></lb>deavouring to conceal himself behind my elbow-chairs; finding no con<lb></lb>cealment there, in his endeavours to get away from that place he over<lb></lb>turned a mabogany table—I called out to my nephew, "William, Wil<lb></lb>liam, bring down the light; quick, quick!"—he came down, and the noise that was made brought down two or three of my lodgers—we went into the room, and one of the parties said, "Here he is under the table"—they laid hold of him—the prisoner is the man—I found a portmanteau in the inner room was opened, and two parcels of paper taken out—it had not been opened before—not at six o'clock, for I saw it safe then—the papers were laid on a table—the officer has the things found in the room—there was a hat fount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lodger in the prosecutor's house. I remem<lb></lb>ber the alarm on Sunday night—I came down after the light came, and saw the prisoner underneath a large table, down on the floor—I asked him how he got in—he said he came in at the wrong door—I saw two hats on the table—he had no shoes on—he had his shoes in his pocket—I asked what he pulled his shoes off for?—he said, because they pinched him—he asked for his bat—I gave him the first one I came to—he said that was not his hat—his hat was on the table—they were both together—I found one chisel, one screw-driver, and a plumber's knife, lying within two feet of him.</p>

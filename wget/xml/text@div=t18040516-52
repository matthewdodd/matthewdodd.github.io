               <p>Q. Have you not been in the habit of bailing together in the Court of Westminster? - A. There were two friends of mine had a dispute, and one arrested the other, they were in the Lock-up-house; and there was a certain man in St. Giles's became bail for him, and asked me if I would become bail for him in the Lock-up-house; they brought Badden in with them, and made a third bail at the Lock-up-house, but I never bailed Badden any where, nor ever assisted to bail with him, ever since I was born but then.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you, in point of fact, whether you did not demand twenty pounds of Mr. Carr? - A. No such a man as me demanded twenty pounds of Mr. Carr, no such thing; I made several enquiries after Carr, I had notice from Mr. White, I found out where Carr lived after I received a letter from Mr. White, I told Mr. White where he did live, he ran away; I have seen him in the street many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that you were liable to pay the five hundred pounds? - A. Mr. White told me I should be in a pretty situation if I did not find him out.</p>

               <p>Court. It would be unnecessary to explain the unrighteous deed, it does not entirely depend upon his testimony.</p>

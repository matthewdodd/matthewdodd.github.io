I an a leather-seller, of 3, Gun-terrace, Rhodes-well-road, Limehouse—on 16th March, at half-past 12 at night, I fastened up my shop, saw the fastenings all secure, and went to bed—I came down at 6 next morning, went into the shop at twenty minutes to 7, found a desk opened, which had not been fastened, and the papers strewed about the floor; the cash-book, day-book, and ledger were removed out of the desk and laid on one side—I found a hole cut through the brick wall, 18 inches thick, between my house and the next—the hole was big enough for a man to get in; it measured 13 inches by 12; we tided it by my man—I missed from the till a bowl containing about 120 farthings; also 41/2 dozen of soles, 3 gross of iron tips, 2 bundles of <hi rend="italic">kip</hi> leather, and shoe hair, value altogether 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went into the adjoining empty house, and found 3 gross of iron tips, the empty bowl that had contained the farthings, and in the yard a pair of boots of mine; in the room was 2 bundles of <hi rend="italic">kip</hi> leather, one of which was tied up by two pocket-handkerchiefs, and strapped round by a leather belt—I left my man in charge of the property while I com<lb></lb>municated with the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not married—I live at 118, North-street, Lime-house; I have known the prisoner intimately about eighteen months; he has slept with me, but I did not live with him—from something which was told me I spoke to him about three weeks after I heard it—I said, "Agnes Kitchener met me, and told me you broke into Mr. Smith's, the leather<lb></lb>cutter's"—he said, "You are a liar; and what is it to you if I did do it—I did do it"—I said, "Agnes Kitchener says, the way you broke into the house was through the brick wall"—he said that I was a liar—I have seen, this handkerchief and belt before; they belonged to the prisoner—I have washed the handkerchief several times for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

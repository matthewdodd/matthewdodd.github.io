                  </hi>. I am shapman to Mr. Simeon Browne, when lives in holborn. On the 22nd of December, about five o'clock in the evening. I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner at the door with a piece of ticking on his shoulder—he took it out of the shop, and I followed him—as I turned out of the door I saw him placing the ticking against the door of the next house and he was moving gently away from it, as if I had seen him—I went after him, and brought him back, and told another man to bring the piece of ticking—I should not think he had any opportunity of seeing whether I observed him—when he placed it outside he pretended to look into watch<lb></lb>maker's shop—I noticed two or three men outside, who appeared to be connected with him—he had got about five yards from the door—it is a private house, and rather a dark place—I should think it would be heavy to carry—there are sixty-five yards of it—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of these men came up to me, and had I been a little further I believe he would have struck me—they did nothing to the ticking—the prisoner was carry<lb></lb>ing it out as softly as any cat would have walked—it had been it the win<lb></lb>dow, four or five feet from the entrance—he had lifted it over a pile of hearth-rugs, and some druggets.</p>

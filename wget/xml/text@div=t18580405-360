                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old—I was brought up in the Islington workhouse—not all my life; I went there after my mother died—I cannot tell how long I was in the workhouse—I think I was ten years old when my mother died—in June last I went into the service of Mrs. Laigh, at No. 10, Park Place, Liverpool Road, Islington—she keeps a lodging house; I used to be in the kitchen—I had a fellow-servant named Ellen Morgan; she came there the week after I was there—she come from Hornsey School, the Parish School; she used to wait on the ladies and gentlemen—she attended to the door—my uncle fetched me away on the Monday before Christmas—on the Thursday before that Monday (the 17th Dec.), Mrs. Laigh did. something to me; I think it was a poker that she hit me with; I cannot recollect it now because my head is so bad—she used to beat me nearly every day, sometimes with a poker, sometimes with the brushes, and everything she could get hold of—she hit me with the poker on my head sometimes; it was on my head <hi rend="italic">a'most</hi>—I was beaten a good many times with the poker during the last week before I left; she beat me nearly every day, and with the poker—she also beat me with the chopper, the hearth-brush, the fire-tongs, and everything she could get hold of—it was the back part of the chopper that she struck me with—I was beaten sometimes because I could not wring the clothes dry, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050002"></xptr>
               <p>sometimes we used not to get up early, and then mistress would beat us for that—during the last week I was beaten for not wringing the clothes property, and sometimes for not getting up—sometimes my mistress used to say, "If anybody comes, don't say nothing, and I will give you something," when they did not come; and if they did come and I did not say anything, sometimes she would give me a little bit of meat, or a potato or two, not to tell—my uncle came on the Monday as Christmas 'day came on the Friday—he saw me in the front kitchen—Mrs. Laigh was there all the time—I had a black eye, and my face was as green as a berry—my head was very bad, it was all cut—myhair was cut short; I cut one part, and my mistress cut one part, it was soaking with blood, and then I cut it and she used to cut it—when my uncle came, my mistress spoke up, and said it was my fellow-servant beat me, when she did not; she never did anything to me, she never lifted up her hand—whenmy mistress said that, I did not say anything, because I was frightened that if I said anything, when my friends were gone, she would beat me—my uncle said to me, "Is your mistress speaking the truth"—I said, "No, uncle, take me away"—he did not take me away at first, because my mistress would not let me go at first—my uncle left, he returned I should think from about ten minutes to half an hour—he then took me away—tny mistress kissed me when I was going—I was down stairs when my uncle there to take me away; my mistress came and told me that my uncle was there, she kissed me, and said, "Don't say nothing, Susan, and then I will give you your ten shillings; that was my wages—I had not been paid my wages—after she kissed me, she put me on my fellow-servant's bonnet and shawl, and then she kissed me, and said I might go, and I went—I was taken to the workhouse; and I could not move hand or foot hardly; I was in bed for a month"—I had no other fellow-servant but Ellen Morgan.</p>

               <p>the workhouse is a good step from Mrs. Laigh's; I could go it in five minutes—they always treated me kindly at the work-house—Iwas not afraid of them—I did not go to the workhouse and, complain of being ill treated, because I was always in the kitchen, and my mistress used to threaten us that they would never take us in the workhouse again after we once went out; that was the reason I did not go and complain—I did not like to go after she said they would pot iake me again—used to say that very often—I think it was the third week that she began to say that, of a night—mymistress was always out in the morning for about an hour, but she always used to leave me my work to do—I did not go then and complain, because I had no shoes to my feet, I could not get out—she did buy me one pair of shoes, but I did not have them hardly; I never hardly wore them—I think it was the second week that she bought them; before that I had a very tidy pair of shoes which they gave me at the workhouse to go out in—she bought, me another pair, because she did not like to see me in the workhouse clothes—shenever gave me any dress, only, the shoes and half a dozen pairs of old ragged stockings that she bought at a rag shop, and she charged me more than I should have to pay for them—she deducted it from my wages, and the shoes also; she bought them at the rag shop—she never gave me any dress, only one that she bought at the rag shop too; she said it was a young lady's dress—it was a thin black muslin one; it only lasted me a week—the shoes I had from the workhouse were not very good when I went there; they were good enough to walk to the workhouse in, but I did not have them, because my mistress did not like to see me in the workhouse things—when my mistress used to go out she told me I was. never to go up stairs to the door, and I did not know what I should do, if I should be doing right—she would never let the lodgers see me, because my face was all black—she often used to threaten, me, and say they would not take me in the workhouse again, and I was not to stir up stairs, I was always to be in the kitchen—I always did remain in the kitchen when my mistress was out—I was in the back and front kitchens; and I sometimes used to go and help Ellen, make the beds, then I went up stairs, but I could not get out at the door—I could not have got out if I had tried, because there would be, all, the neighbours asking me where I was going to had never been to service out of the workhouse before, and I did not know what they would do to me; if a policeman or anybody had caught me in the street I did not know what might have done to me—that was the reason, and I am always frightened of anything—I never went put while my mistress was out—I never went out at all never went out at all when she was out—I am quite sure about that—there were two lodgers in the house, Mr. Brown and Mr. Carruthers; Mr. Brown was not at home—the Rev. Mr. Bousfield was also there, but he used to be out now and then; his wife was at home now and then, but I never saw them, only once or twice—they had no family—they had the upper part of the house—they did not stop there very long—they were not there when I went, they came afterwards—there waa another lodger before Mr. Bousfield came, and there were two ladies there when I first went, then there was another lady and gentleman came after that, and then Mr. and Mrs. Bousfield came, and after a bit there was a lady and six children, but I never saw that lady or the children—Mr. Bousfield had some beer in the kitchen—he used to come down every day to draw the beer in the afternoon and at night—mymistress went out shopping mostly every morning, but not every morning, and after she returned, the tradesmen used to bring the goods, but Ellen went up to the door, I never did—Ellen never ill-treated me, she saw the assault committed on me early with the poker, but not always—she saw her beat me once or twice in the second week after I came there—I have, not seen Mr.</p>

               <p>I was alone—Mr. Bousfield called "Ellen," and then he said "you had better come;" I said "I cannot, Sir; I must not," and then mistress came and attended on him—I did not make a complaint with a clergyman and his wife in the house, because I never saw them—there was Master James in the kitchen, and wherever I went to he would tell his mamma; I was threatened not to go out of the kitchen, because when mistress came home she would beat me—she sometimes beat me whether or no—I am not positive what she beat me for on Thursday 17th Dec., I think it was for getting up late—I am not positive whether Ellen saw her beat me on Thursday—I think it was in the morning part that, she beat me on the Thursday—before my uncle came, but I am not quite sure—I think it was the poker she beat me with, but I cannot recollect—she beat me on the Friday, I think it was with the hair brash, and I think with the chopper too; I am not quite sure—she beat me twice or three time that day; sometime she would get the poker or a fire brush, or the hair brush—she hit me with the chopper on the Thursday, I think it was in the afternoon part—I think Ellen Morgan saw her Strike me with the chopper, ahe chopped a bit out of my arm here, there is another place; both of these were done with the edge of the chopper but not both on the same day—the one here was done three days before the other, they were both done in the same week, I had a cut on my head the first morning my uncle came—this mark (<hi rend="italic">On the outside of her right arm</hi>) was done last; I cannot recollect when, or whether it was done in the week before my uncle took me away—I was washing when it was done, and had my sleeves up—thechopper had a wooden handly, she caught hold of the handle with both hands, and my hand was so on the bath in which we were washing; I was trying to ring the clothes—I cannot wring with my right hand, I never can do any thing with that—it was because I did not wring the clothes dry—my arm was resting on the bath, and she came very slyly and done it from behind—Ellen Morgan saw the Chopper used, but not when this wound was done just here—my mistress gave me the other wound inside my arm just before dinner timer; I was washing, and had just done wringing one of the clothes, and she took it up and wrung it again because it was not wrung dry enough, and then she came slyly behind me, and said, "You must try and wring the clothes dry; and I said, "I cannot"—she did the second wound two or three days after the first, I was washing then; we were always washing—she did both with the chopper, and when this place got better she hit it again with a poker and made it come worse—I think it was for not lighting the fire quick enough that she struck me with the poker—I have no wound on the other arm, but the poker has made it as hard as a stone by continually beat<lb></lb>ing on it, and I cannot move it—Ellen Morgan saw all these blows; I could not pull my gown off of a night, because my arm was so bad, and sometimes I had to lay in my clothes—I have a sister named Elizabeth, she came to the house about the middle of Oct. and saw me with a couple of black eyes—she did not ask me how it was done, my mistress told her that me and Ellen had been fighting—she is not married, but she is a great deal older than me—she did not ask me how it was done as my mistress told her that me and Ellen had been fighting, that was in Ellen's presence—I think my sister said that if she heard of any more fighting she would take out a warrant; my mistress said that she said so—my mistress being present prevented my telling the truth to my sister, she used to threaten to beat us, and we were both afraid to tell my sister the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be fifteen years old on the 2d of next May—I had been an inmate of Islington Workhouse five years, and was so when I went into the defendant's service—I cannot tell you where my father is, but my mother died in Islington Workhouse during the latter part of the time I was at a school at Hornsey, which is some distance from the workhouse—from there I went to Miss Daniels', in the Hornsey Road, for eight months, and a woman took me from there to Mrs. Laigh's, taking me to the workhouse first, but I did not stop at the workhouse—I do not know whether Miss Daniels gave me a character to Mrs. Laigh—I did not know the young woman Dean till she came to Mrs. Laigh, she was there before I went—there was no other servant there when I went—my duty was to attend on the lodgers upstairs—Ianswered the door of the house, and Susan Dean used to do the kitchen work—Mrs. Laigh did the cooking, I and Susan Dean did the washing, we used to wash every week—I remember her going a way, it was on Monday the 21st as Christmas Day was on Friday—within the last four or five days before that Mrs. Laigh Laigh hit her because she could not wring linen with her right hand—wewere both washing at that time in the front kitchen—I think it was a poker she hit her with—I cannot exactly say where she hit her—we then went straight on with our washing—Susan complained that she was hurt in the lower part, I think, but I cannot exactly say—on the next day, Friday I saw Mrs. Laigh strike her with a chopper, I cannot recollect what she was doing, it was after we had done washing—we had not been washing that day we had finished on the Thursday—the flat part of the chopper struck her on the back, on her shoulder—Mrs. Laigh gave no reason to me for striking her—Icannot recollect her saying anything or finding fault with her—on the Saturday night she was lifting a basin of water, and happened to upset some and Mrs. Laigh took down the chopper from the side of the fire-place where it hung, and hit her on the lower part of her body and. on her shoulders with the flat part of it—I was behind—I did not see anything more done to her that day but on Sunday morning there was some tea in the tea-pot which one of the lodgers had left, and Susan poured it out, and began drinking it; Mrs. Laigh came down stairs and said, "Who took the tea out of the tea-pot?" Susan said, "I did, ma'am;" she said, "What business have you to take the tea out of the tea-pot, because I wanted it myself?" and hit her across the mouth, with the back of her hand—I did not see her struck by Mrs. Laigh at any other time during the last week—I saw the back of her head bleeding on the Thursday or Friday, she cut her hair, and Mrs. Laigh cut some of it—I saw the blow struck that caused the bleeding—Mrs. Laigh struck that blow with a poker—shedid not wear a cap or anything on her head, because nobody used to see her—I did not notice any other appearance of violence about her only the two black eyes she had when her uncle came—she had them before her uncle came, and they continued until he came; they were going away when he came—I cannot recollect that I saw any blow struck which caused those black eyes—I remember her uncle coming—my bonnet and shawl was put upon her to go away in—she had no bonnet and shawl of her own only an old bonnet not fit to wear—as she was going away, mistress said she would give her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if she did not tell that she had beaten her—I never struck Dean</p>

Q.</hi> When did your mistress first begin to ill use her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three months after she was there, I can't say exactly—she never made any complaint before that, and I never saw any thing done—we used to wash once a week, beginning on Monday and ending On Thursday—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the founds on than's arm</hi>) I never saw those before, to my recollection—she and I never quarrelled, I swear that—we never had any words all the time she was there—I never took up the poker to her or a brass candlestick—the lodgers could not say that we were alway fighting and quarrelling, because we were not; we never did fight and quarrel—mistress used to go out every morning about 11 o'clock and remain till about 12 o'clock; while she was away, sometimes we were washing, and sometimes I was up stairs doing my work, and Susan Dean was down stairs—I can't say that my mistress never ill-treated me, she did sometimes—she never used such a thing as the chopped to me, or the poker or tongs, she used to hit me with her hand sometimes—whenshe was out in the morning, we were washing, Dean used to be down stairs doing the kitchen work, I was up stairs making beds and cleaning the rooms—Dean was not very sharp—we did not like to tell the lodgers or to make any complaint—I did not like to make any complaint—I left Mrs. Daniels because she was going to take apartments, and give up her house—I used to go out often to bring in meat and other things—I remember Dean going out a short time after we had been there, and losing her way—I re<lb></lb>member a policeman being sent for when Dean's sister came to see her, and mistress would not let her; the sister sent the policeman in, and he went into the front parlour and spoke to mistress—I do not recollect his speaking to me—(<hi rend="italic">Farrell was here called in</hi>) that is the man that came—at that time Dean was not sitting on the stairs with her face bleeding; she was down stairs in the front kitchen—I do not recollect coming up to the policeman—I cannot recollect her accusing me of having made her face bleed—I cannot recollect her saying that I had struck her and made her bleed—I cannot recollect saying that I had done it—I cannot recollect the policeman asking my mistress if I should be given into custody for beating the other servant—I did not say, "Pray, mistress, don't, I will never do it again; indeed she struck me first, and in trying to tike the broom out of her hand, she fell down and cut her head"—Ican recollect quite well that I never said such a thing, or any thing of the kind—I cannot recollect that I ever said such a thing—I cannot recollect the policeman speaking to me, or my speaking to him—I cannot recollect saying that Dean had struck me first—I did not tell him that I had tried to take the broom out of her hand, not as far as I can reollect, nor that she fell down and cut her head—I cannot recollect that I ever said it—I do not recollect what passed when the policeman came—I only recollect that the sister sent him in, and that mistress took him into the front parlour and spoke to him—I was cleaning the window, and I went out while my mistress was there with him—I was not in the room with them—it was some time in the afternoon—Mrs. Laigh did not send her little boy for the policeman, as I recollect Dean's sister sent him in—I do not recollect that I heard Mrs. Laigh say to the policeman, "My servants have been fighting, and one has struck the other with the broom handle"—I do not recollect that Dean was then sitting on the stairs with her hand to her face, and that she took her hand away, and the policeman saw the blood; I do not recollect it at all—Icannot recollect saying that she had fallen down as I was trying to take the broom out of her hand—I was not examined before the Board of Guardians,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 4, Nottingham Place, Upper Holloway—Susan Dean is a niece of mine—in consequence of what I heard, I went to Mrs. Laigh's on the Monday before Christmas day—I saw my niece in the kitchen; Mrs. Laigh was there—I found my niece in a very deplorable state, both in filth and braises, so much so, that I did not know her—her eyes were black, her hair was cut short, and she had wounds on her head—Mrs. Laigh said that she was a very bad girl, and laid a great many things to her charge—I then walked across the kitchen to the girl, and asked if her mistress was speaking the truth—she replied "Take me away, uncle;" upon that, Mrs. Laigh flew into a violent rage, and rushed to the fire-place; she said that the two girls had been fighting—both the girls were present—neitherof them said anything—Mrs. Laigh said that some of the bruises on the girl were from falling from a chair in the garden, and many other things she said that I cannot tax my memory with—I then went to the workhouse; and got their permission to receive her, and then I returned and fetched her away.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the medical attendant residing in Isling<lb></lb>ton workhouse—when Susan Dean was brought there on Monday, 21st Dec., I examined her—I found five wounds at the back of her head, each about an inch in length, and the marks of two in front just about the forehead, those had healed—I should say none of those at the back were more recent than three or four days; the skin was cut—there were several other injuries—she had an abscess on the right arm, just below the elbow, which broke the next morning; that might have been caused by a blow, or by natural causes—therewas an inflamed state of the skin covering the left blade bone; the same in the left arm above and below the elbow, and the left knee was inflamed—therewas also a bruise on the right side, and the left eye was black—the abscess on the right arm was just below the elbow—I have been in court and heard her examined (<hi rend="italic">looking at her arm</hi>); I did not notice these marks at the time, I only noticed the abscess—this mark I should say was the opening of the abscess (<hi rend="italic">this was the mark of one of the wounds spoken to by the prosecutrix</hi>)—Ishould say that is where the abscess healed from the appearance of it—thereis the trace of a slight wound on the other side of the arm—I cannot form any judgment within what time that wound had been inflicted; it was</p>

               <p>not a fresh wound when she was brought into the workhouse, or I should have observed it; there was an extensive bruise on the right side and buttock—I did not attend her until she became convalescent, she went under the care of Mr. Ede, the Surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what state was the abscess when you saw it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost breaking; I should say it had been gathering at least four or five days—there was no external wound there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. The prisoner lodged at my house, No. 18, Paul-street, Finsbury—he owed me, in Nov. last, about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent—I had applied to him several times for payment, and on 25th Nov. he brought me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and asked me if I would take it for pay<lb></lb>ment of the rent—I hesitated, but took it, thinking that it was true—I was to hold it as security, and when it became due I was to have the money—he proposed that to me—it is in the same state now as it was then—when it became due I went to where it was payable, No. 153, High-street, Borough, and showed it to Mr. Cumner, who is a draper; he said he knew nothing about it (I had advanced the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides the rent)—I sent a friend to the acceptor, William Smith, of Hammersmith, but could not find him—I told the prisoner that I had been to the Borough, and that the bill was dishonoured; he said he was much surprised, but he would get me the money from Mr. Blogg on the following Monday, before 12 o'clock—this was on Saturday—he went out on the Monday, about 9 o'clock, and did not return till 3 o'clock; he said he had been to Hammersmith, and had seen Mr. Smith, and he would send me the money on Tuesday (next day), at 3 o'clock—as no money came, I spoke to the prisoner, and I think he said it would come on Wednesday—I understood him that Mr. Blogg was to pay it—he said that on Tuesday afternoon, or Wednesday morning; after that he occasionally, from time to time, said he would get the money, and I should have it at such a time—he left my house on the following Sunday, and his wife told me that he had gone into the country—he was away three days—I had spoken to the police in the meantime, and when the prisoner came back he was taken into custody.</p>

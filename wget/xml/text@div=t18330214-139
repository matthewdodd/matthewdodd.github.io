            . I live in Noble-street, Goswell-street. On the 31st of January I saw the prisoner and another near the corner of Newgate-street - the prisoner pulled the prosecutor's handkerchief partly out of his pocket, when he got as far as the Magpie and Stump; they still followed him, and when they got to <placeName id="t18330214-139-crimeloc785">Bull's Head-court</placeName>

             (City Police-constable 98). On the 31st of January I was on duty in Newgate-street, and in consequence of what Robinson said, I saw the prisoner and another follow the prosecutor on to the Post-office - I directed Robinson to follow them close; I went down Cary-lane, and took them both - the prisoner had the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>AARON GOLDSMID. I live in Upper Bedford-place, Russell-square. I lost this handkerchief; it has my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was out of work, and was going to some of the warehouses to ask for work.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 14.</p>

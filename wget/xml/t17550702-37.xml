            , of Princes-street, shoemaker. We went six of us, and some of us inquired at every house in the street, but we could not make out any such person, either as an inhabitant, or a lodger. We were told there was another Princess-street, near Lincoln's-inn-fields; we went to that, and made the same inquiry there, but could get no account of any such person.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you asked at every house?</p>
               <p>Haywood. I believe we did not miss any house at all, we were extremely careful in our inquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never during your observations, know houses let out into particular tenements; that a person in one part of the house, does not know who lives in the other?</p>
               <p>Haywood. I know there is a great many houses in this city let out into tenements; but whether there was any such person as John Smith lived in that street, I firmly believe there was no such person, not only as a housekeeper, but a lodger. We made the strictest inquiry possibly could be; even at chandlers-shops, and bakers, where they must go for their common necessaries. We were very careful in inquiring, but could not find any body that knew such a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you upon your oath say that you have made so strict an inquiry, that you are certain there is no such person lives in either of these streets?</p>
               <p>Haywood. I can go no farther than to say, I do not believe there was such a person lived then, in either.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me an answer.</p>
               <p>Haywood. I do not believe there was such a person.</p>
               <p>Q. But if you were to swear absolutely whether there was such a person there, would you take upon you to swear there was no such person lived there ?</p>
               <p>Haywood. If I make the greatest inquiry possible to be made, and there is no such person to be met with; I am bound to believe there is no such person; we could not find such a person; we were as careful, I believe, as persons well could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain no house escaped you ?</p>
               <p>Haywood. I believe no one did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself personally make this inquiry?</p>
               <p>Haywood. If I did not ask the question, some of us did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs into every house ?</p>

               <p>Collins. I asked at every house in the street but one, and there I know is only one woman lives in that house, and has for several years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there are no lodgers there?</p>

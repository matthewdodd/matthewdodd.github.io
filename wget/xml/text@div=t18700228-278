Q.</hi> When you saw the prisoner, about 1 o'clock, you had no doubt from his appearance that he was tipsy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw that he was a little tipsy; he said he was not—during the time he was at Mr. Buecker's he was very quiet and well-behaved, only three times he was just like mad; the first time was eight days after he came there; he went to knock me down—we had had no quarrel, I thought he was a little cross, he was not drunk; I was taking some silver up stairs that I had cleaned, and the bell rang, the girls told him I had gone up stairs and called to him in No. 4 kitchen to fetch some chairs up stairs, and when I come down he went to knock me down—he was away for three months in the hospital last summer—I acted as night porter while he was away—the second time I observed something strange about him, was about a fortnight after he came back from the hospital; he made some toast and put about an inch of butter on it, and he made the table cloth foul with it, and his own clothes; he was sober then; the other time was about six or eight weeks ago; he did just the same then with the toast; I could explain it better in German—with those exceptions he was a very quiet, inoffensive, peaceable man; he was not quarrelsome—I shut the street door when I let him in on this night—there is an area gate, but there is no key, it is always kept locked—any one going down to the prisoner's bed room must come in at the street door—when that is shut the bolt catches; you can pull the handle back and open it without unlocking it—I shut the door—the door between the kitchen and the prisoner's bed room has no lock, it is always open; the door between the kitchen and the passage has no lock, only a handle—a person once inside the street door could go down to the prisoner's room without having any looks to turn, nothing but doors which could be pushed open—there is only one gas burner in the kitchen; when I first went down there was just a glimmer, enough to see that it was a light—when I first heard the calling out, and came down stairs, found the prisoner in the passage up stairs, on the ground floor, near the door where the umbrella stand was; he had the umbrella stand in his hand, knocking it about, and roaring out and raving like a madman, Mrs. Buecker was then on the first floor above, and he called out to her "Madame, madame, come down, the devil is down stairs!"—he repeated that many times—Mr. Apt, a Swiss gentleman, then came down stairs, and the prisoner then said, "Gentlemen, Gentlemen, come down, the devil is down stairs"—I asked him to be quiet; I followed him down stairs to the base<lb></lb>ment, then it was that I went through the kitchen into his room and felt what I have told.</p>

               <p>of it, I think—he was fond of butter—this was about 4 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, tea time, we were just having tea—it was about the same time on each occasion—those are the only three occasions upon which I noticed anything strange about his manner; all the other days he attended to his business in the regular way—he always acted as night porter—I thought he was a little angry, perhaps, from having been called up stairs when the bell rang, because I was not there—he was called up instead of me—that was the occasion when he used the chair—he had been to lie down to take some rest before night.</p>

My husband keeps Buecker's Hotel, Christopher Street, Finsbury, and has done so for eighteen years—the prisoner was in our service as porter—he was there, first for three months, and then left for eight months, and came back again—at the time this transaction occurred he had been with us about nine or ten months the last time—he was night porter—we have a good many foreigners come to our hotel by the night trains, and so on—there is a bell which rings into the prisoner's room—he always attended to his duty in the ordinary way up to the time of this occurrence—the area gate is always kept locked, and the key is kept in the bar—there is a wooden ladder to the area, which is put up when the dustmen come to take the dust away, and is then removed—it is used very rarely for anything else—there is a latch to the front door which catches when it is closed at night, and fastens it securely inside—on Friday evening, 14th January, I was at the hotel, up stairs—I must have seen the prisoner during the day—I was not out of my sitting-room, next my bedroom, on the first floor, after 8 o'clock—I retired to rest at 1 o'clock—I was reading in my bed till about 3 o'clock—up to that time I heard no noise, or anything which attracted my attention—my attention was first attracted by the crashing from below, about 5.30 in the morning—I had then been awake about half an hour—all was quite silent during that half hour—the crashing was a crashing of glass—I immediately got up and rang the bell—there are two doors to my room, one into the sitting-room and the outer door—I found it was no use ringing the bell, and I ran to the door and on to the lading, and called out, "What is it, what is it it?"—I did not see anybody at that time—the prisoner replied in German, "The devil is below"—it was the prisoner's voice—upon that I called to the gentlemen, aad begged some one to come down—Weber came down first, and he went down to the prisoner, then the cook and Mr. Apt, but I forget which was first—they also went down—I did not go down then—after I called to the gentlemen I ran down and saw the prisoner standing under the archway in the passage, waving something; he was on the ground floor at the foot of the stairs, about the centre of the hall—he was waving something in his hand, and raving—there was a light in the hall—there is always a jet of gas burning—I could see him by means of the gas—I did not notice whether the cook or Mr. Apt had a candlestick when they came down—I don't know what it was the prisoner was waving—I only saw him waving something in that manner, to protect himself—it seemed like that; in fact, it was to protect himself—he was raving in a terrible manner that the devil</p>

               <p>Was down stairs; a most fearful manner—Weber then came and took him down stairs—he was still raving, crying, in a crying sort of raving, most terrible—then I heard him again calling out to Mr. Apt, "You swim donkey, you Swiss donkey," repeatedly raving—then they ran up stairs again—I begged them not to leave him, as they passed me—he was raving continually after they left him—I went into my room after I had pacified him—before that he told me to come down—he said, "Come down, madame, come down, madame," in German—he was in the kitchen then, and he began beating about and smashing things again—I did not go down into the kitchen—I went back to the landing and stood there—later in the morning, when I was dressed, I went down stairs—I then saw broken things on the ground, but did not take particular notice of them—the only person who sleeps in the basement except the prisoner is Mary Stacey—Mr. Apt has gone abroad—the usual time for the servants to come down in the winter is about 6.30.</p>

On this Saturday morning, about 5.30, I was on duty in King Street, Finsbury—Weber called me to the hotel—when I got there I saw the prisoner at the top of the stairs leading I from the basement floor, on the same floor as I entered—he seemed much excited and was calling out in a language that I did not understand—his hands were covered with blood, his trowsers and shirt were also covered with blood, and there were spots of blood on his face—on seeing me, he called out "Police! police!"—I told him to go down stairs, and I followed him into the kitchen—the kitchen door was open—there was a pool of blood nearly in the middle of the kitchen—I observed the body of a woman there—it was lying between the prisoner's bedroom and the kitchen; the head and part of the body in the kitchen and the legs in the bedroom—there is a door leading from the kitchen to the prisoner's bedroom, but no passage—the body was lying across the threshold—the prisoner's bedroom appears to be parted off from the kitchen in one corner—the clothes of the woman were thrown up over the body, the lower part of the person exposed,</p>

SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Persons, in respect of whom it would be absurd to impute that they were insane, falling asleep in a drunken state and being visited by dreams, suddenly awaking, would be affected with hallucinations, illusions, and delusions, having no foundation whatever, in fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; canes have happened where persons to all appearance previously sane, have suddenly awakened from sleep, labouring under some delusion which has impelled them to some sudden act which would not have been committed by them if they had been previously awake and collected—may I explain? such persons, in first awakening from sleep, are reckless and have committed some act of which no one would have thought them capable beforehand—they have been suddenly afflicted with the most absurd</p>

               <p>illusions and delusions, without there being any permanent mental disorder, merely a temporary hallucination—I am not able to say whether a deep deep caused it, or anything in a dream caused it—I am speaking of a deep sleep, accompanied by drunkenness; cases have happened where such persons have awoke from sleep impressed with belief in respect of matters which did not really exist; they did not happen to me, but I know it from my reading—Dr. Taylor is a high authority in psychological science—the cases I heard of were cases where the hallucination was temporary—a man being afflicted with a powerful and impressive dream may awake under a delusion, haying been perfectly sane before, and be perfectly sane imme<lb></lb>diately afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will read you a passage from Dr. Taylor, under the head of "Hal<lb></lb>lucinations and Illusions," and tell me if it meets with your concurrence: "As regards hallucinations and illusions, these are the most striking symptoms which are met with in a confirmed state of insanity; hallucina<lb></lb>tions are those sensations which are supposed by the patient to be produced by external impressions, although no material object act upon his senses at the time." I will pause there to ask you, supposing, for instance, that a man had a dream in which he believed that the evil spirit, the devil, was in the room, might that operate upon his mind in a sleeping state in such a way as to impel him on awaking to do acts that he would not hare done if he had been awake and had his reflecting powers perfectly at his com<lb></lb>mand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should rather put it in this way, that a man waking up, might, at the time of waking up, fall under an hallucination, than make the hallucination the consequence of the dream—Dr. Taylor says, "A man has visions of all kinds, including the forms of the dead and living floating before him, when, in fact, he is merely gating on vacancy"—that is generally assumed—again, "a man sometimes fancies that he hears voices speaking or mysteriously whispering to him, while there is profound silence"—those are very frequent oases where persons are labour<lb></lb>ing under mere hallucination—I agree with Dr. Taylor when he says "These states of mind are dependent upon a disordered state of mind, no matter whether produced by physical causes or by mere mental causes, but they are indications, whether temporarily or permanently, of a diseased state of mind"—I shall not quite follow you in saying that a diseased state of mind, like a diseased state of body, may exist for a very brief period and be succeeded by a perfectly healthy state—oases are on record of a mere temporary delusion in the mind, existing for the moment, non-existing yesterday, and non-existing to-morrow—cases have over and over again occurred where a man, in dreaming, has believed that he has heard voices, and been in contact and collision with persons who have not been near him at all—I don't remember a case, narrated by Dr. Winslow, of a person imagining, while he was asleep, that he saw a person approaching him in a menacing attitude, and leaped out of bed, seized the first article that was near him, and, some person being in the room, beat him in a terrible manner—I should suppose there must be something amiss with such a man beforehand, either bodily or mentally, that was not known to those around him; some disturbance of his health, either mentally or bodily, or both together, and, all at once, a delusion or hallucination takes place and he acts upon it—I concur with this passage of Dr. Taylor," Instances of hallucination are furnished by the act of dreaming, while illusions often occur during the act of suddenly waking from sleep, giving rise occasionally to serious questions involving criminal responsibility."</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> division of police—on the morning of 15th January, about 6.30, I was sent for to the Old Street police-station—I saw the prisoner there and examined him—he had a wound on the third finger of the left hand, just below the nail, about the site of a fourpenny piece—it was merely an abrasion of the skin, just through the two skins—it was bleeding then—the inspector called my attention to it—it was a kind of wound that might have been produced by a bite—the next finger, the fourth, had also a slightly incised wound, not of the same character, that was an incised wound—his hands were covered with blood, and his face was bespattered with blood—the wound on the fourth finger might have been caused by coming in contact with a piece of broken glass—there was blood on the sleeves of his shirt and on the breast—I afterwards saw blood on the lower part of his shirt, and on the trowsers—I dressed his finger—he said "Thank you," several times—he seemed quite calm—he smelt of drink—he was quite sober—I saw a candlestick covered with blood, at the station—there was a small quantity of brain matter on the lower part of it, human brain I took it to be—this is the candlestick, but all the blood and brain matter has been wiped off—it was at the base, on the edge, and there were some long hairs attached to it which are gone now—there was a piece broken out—that was covered with blood, and also had brain substance on it—the composition that filled this up, to be a weight to steady it, was found in the prisoner's room in my presence, and I fitted it—I afterwards went to the kitchen of the hotel about 6.45—I saw the body of the deceased on the floor—she was lying on her back, in the door-way leading from the kitchen to a small sleeping apartment—the head and body were in the kitchen, and the feet and part of the legs in the bedroom—the clothes were thrown up over the body, exposing the person and the lower part of the abdomen—the right stocking was pulled down over the boot, and the breasts were exposed—the right arm was bent upwards and the hand clenched; the left arm was lying down by the side—there was a bonnet on the head—it was tied tightly round—I removed it—it was on the back part of the head, it had got out of its place—there was a large lacerated wound on the right side of the head, involving nearly the whole of the right side of the face, the fracture of the temporal bone, and the upper and lower jaw bones on that side—on the left eyebrow there was an incised wound, about an inch in length, coming over the eyebrow and eyelid—the right eye was partially dislodged from the socket; the left eye was contused, blackened, and the nose bones were both broken—I don't think I examined more minutely at that time; I made a post-mortem examination next day—I observed that some of the teeth were loose in the mouth—I took the</p>

               <p>things which the policeman has produced out of the pocket; that win all that was in the pocket—she was very poorly dressed, the clothes were very old; she had on an old brown dress and side-spring boots—she was quite dead when I got there—I have no doubt she had been dead two hours; I believe certainly more—I had the body re<lb></lb>moved to the dead-house, and afterwards made a post-mortem examina<lb></lb>tion—she was about twenty-six years of age, 4ft 11 in. in height; a very spare figure, fairly nourished—I examined her left hand, and between the finger and thumb I found about twenty short, brown curly hairs—I believe they were taken off the prisoner; they were his hairs—the hands were clenched, and there was some blood in the hand, and the hairs were matted together—I put them into a plate for the purpose of cleaning them, and some of them were thrown away—I have only been able to keep two or three, which I produce—in the wound on the head, that communicated with the brain, there were a number of small pieces of green glass, and some resinous substance, a small portion of which I have preserved—I com<lb></lb>pared it with the stuff at the bottom of the candlestick, and it was the same kind of stuff—an instrument like the candlestick would make a wound of that kind, and the bottles also—the back of the left hand was very much contused, and there were five or six incised wounds, and there were four or five incised wounds also on the back of the right hand—there were incised wounds on some of the fingers—there were bruises on the right thigh, down to the knee—the right knee was very much bruised—there were scratches also about the private parts and on the left thigh—the bruises on the right thigh were quite high up—there were scratches on the inner part of both thighs—they were all in the inner part of the thighs—they varied from about the site of a five-shilling piece to about the size of the palm of my hand—that on the knee involved the whole of the inside of the knee—that might have been caused by resistance to connexion—that was the only way in which I could account for them—there were some scratches on the left side of the private parts—I opened the stomach; it contained about 3/4lbs. of a dark-coloured fluid, with some white substance in it, consisting of fish and potato, and there was some potato peeling—the fluid smelt of wine; claret, I believe—I found no evidence of connexion having recently taken place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She was a woman of the town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the hymen was absent—no doubt connexion had taken place; but I found no evidence of recent connexion—I found no seminal fluid either in the <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> or about the private parts—supposing connexion had taken place after 2 o'clock that morning, I might have found some traces—it would be rather a long time afterwards to find it—the fracture of the skull was the immediate cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I don't understand you to pledge your opinion as to when she had last had connexion, whether it was within a few hours, or several hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; I do not give it as an opinion; I say I found no evidence that she had recently had connexion—in the ordinary course I should not expect the seminal discharge to remain in the <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> probably more than an hour—it might be overcome by a variety of causes; by natural discharge of her own—I do not venture to say she might not have had connexion within two or three hours of the time I saw the body—I believe the bruises and scratches were caused immediately before death—I think I may speak to the scratches with more certainty than the bruises</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187002280040"></xptr>
               <p>—we do not usually find an indication of A bruise until some hours have elapsed after the injury has been inflicted—it is my opinion that the scratches were not caused six or eight hours before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As to the bruises, was it consistent with their appear<lb></lb>ance that they were caused recently before death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they were caused a short time before death; not six or eight hour before, but quite recently before death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the discoloration which is attendant upon a bruise, generally present itself after death? <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> Oh, yet, it may be caused imme<lb></lb>diately after death; but the blood that is effused close by the side of a scratch would not present itself unless it was caused immediately before death, and before the body was cold—I made the post-mortem examination on the Sunday, about 1.30—it was not until then that I saw the hairs in the hand—she had then been removed from the hotel.</p>

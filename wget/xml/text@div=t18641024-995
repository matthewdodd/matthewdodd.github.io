                  </hi>. I am the brother of the boy who was killed—on 7th September, I was in Epping Forest with three other boys, Charles Hoytesbale, Robert Holliday, and the deceased—we saw the prisoner and another boy about 5 o'clock, carrying guns on their shoulders—we asked them the way to the Rising Sun, and they directed us through the forest—I asked them if they had shot any birds or got any game, and they showed us a sparrow, which the prisoner threw up and shot—we stood and watched them fire for about ten minutes, and then went away—the prisoner and Meadows followed us—I had a black and white dog, and the prisoner said he would shoot it—we then ran away, but the prisoner followed us—my brother then said to him, "You are not allowed to shoot in the forest, the police would not allow it if they knew it; you do not know what danger you might do"—the prisoner said, "Yes, I am, I will shoot you," and he put the gun to his shoulder and discharged it—my brother fell down, his face was bleeding, and we carried him to the Rising Sun—he lived eighteen days afterwards in the London Hospital—I was with him when he died, and saw him when he was dead—I had not known the prisoner before.</p>

The prisoner was a trooper in the regiment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You shoe a great many horses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the shoes you supposed you lost old horse-shoes, or new ones? - A. There were some new ones; there was one new one.</p>
               <p>Q. The rest were old? - A. I only saw one new one.</p>
               <p>Q. You, of course, superintend your business? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Your men work these shoes, and you superintend your business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your men are here, I take it for granted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You serve the regiment by contract? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the iron and shoes are your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, according to the number and quantity, you are paid by contract? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Of course your property in general is very well secured, by the doors being shut of a night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Unluckily for you, you know, it was not this night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was open to every body of course? - A. No; it was in the life-guard's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't be angry, we shall be very good friends, I dare say, presently. - To all the life guards it was open, throughout the regiment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, unfortunately, this shop was open to all the life guards? - A. All that were there.</p>

               <p>Q. How many were there? - A. There might be six or eight; there was only the corporal and the guard.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130110"></xptr>Q. When did you see them again? - A. The next morning; I was sent for to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have been taken away you know, and this man might have had them given to him? - A. It might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my Lord, and the Jury, just now, that you superintend the business, and the under people work them? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear now to all your different workmen's work? - A. No; but I can swear to my mark.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put your own mark to it? - A. My men do; I cannot do it myself, all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you are a very diligent man? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will give you credit for it; always your servants put your mark upon them? - A. The men when they work the shoes, put the mark on.</p>
               <p>Q. And the men are not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The new shoes that your servants make, in your business, they put the mark to; now will you swear there is any other way to know them than that they appear to have your mark upon them? - A. I would not wish to swear any further.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't mean to swear to these more than to any other of your shoes? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever fell any old shoes? - A. No; we buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. I beg your pardon, it is an improper question to put to a contractor, certainly; what do you do with your old shoes? - A. Work them over again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long have your shoes borne this particular mark? - A. Many years: the initials of my name, and the mark of a crown.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it usual for farriers in general to put a mark upon their shoes? - A. A great many do, and many do not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He was in his regimentals? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he carrying them? - A. Before him.</p>

               <p>Q. He said he was upon duty, and therefore offered to give you some money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He first told you he had iron? - A. He told me first he had ball.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he told you he had old iron? - A. Yes; when we stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, he said, he had got horse shoes? - A. Yes.</p>

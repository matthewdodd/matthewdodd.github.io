            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of June I was in South-street Bethnal-green at twenty minutes past two o'clock in the morning; and saw two persons go down Hart's-lane towards Bennett's-place; I could not see anything with them, but just as they had left me I saw a piece of lead lying near Mr. Watson's gates; I took that up; I then saw another piece in the kennel - I took them both to the watch-house: I came back and saw the two prisoners walking and talking. At past three o'clock I went again to the place and found two more pieces of lead among some timbers; I sprung my rattle; another watchman came, and we took the lead to the watch-house - I came back again and saw the two prisoners walking near the same place; I then looked about and found another piece of lead in a stone-mason's yard; I took that, came back again, and just before five I saw the two prisoners come to the place walking and talking, and looking towards where the lead had been; I said to a man, "I don't like those two lads, I have some suspicion of them;" we took them, but found nothing on them but three knives, a button book, and a handle of a door; one of the knives was sworn to.</p>

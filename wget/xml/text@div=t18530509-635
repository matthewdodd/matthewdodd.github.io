               <p>way. On 8th April I was at Elmore's beer shop, about 1 o'clock in the day—I had two pints of beer in the parlour; Mr. Elmore was there with me, but nobody else—I had seven half crowns in my pocket, and changed one to pay for the porter—they were in my purse in ray left band trowser's pocket—Mr. Elmore left the room after that, and I went into the yard, and then came back into the tap room—the prisoner was there then, and two men—she pushed me down on the settle, and sat down on my knee, slapped her hand on my left hand pocket, and said, "Old mate, are you going to pay for some beer?"—I told her I should not, pushed her off my knee, crossed the tap room, and sat down in the opposite corner—the prisoner came again, and began pulling me about—she called for some beer, which was brought by Miss Elmore, who asked for the money—the prisoner said, "That man will pay for it"—Miss Elmore said she knew I would not—the prisoner began pulling me about again, and in pushing her off my knee I broke the window with my elbow—I had bad two pints of beer, and I laid down and went to sleep—when I awoke there was nobody there; I went home, and when I got up next morning, about 5 o'clock, I missed my six half crowns, but not the change which I had received for the other half crown—I went to Mr. Elmore's, beard something there, and gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect the prisoner being at my father's house, at Barking—I saw the prisoner sitting on Mitchell's lap, in the tap room, about 1 o'clock—I saw her offer to feel in his pocket—she asked him to pay for some beer—he said, "No"—about an hour afterwards I saw him fast asleep, and saw her put her hand in his pocket, take out a purse, and count out six half crowns on the table—I did not see whether she put it back again—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I was going to awake him, but she said if I did not go out of the room she would split my head open with the poker.</p>

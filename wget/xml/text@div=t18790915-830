                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and lodge at 18, Albert Street, Shadwell—on 29th August I was at home; about 7 o'clock the prisoner came with three other men—the third man was drunk; I don't know his name; he went to sleep; the second man was sober; his name is Nicolas Michaels, or Carealis—the prisoner sent for some beer; I fetched it; after drink<lb></lb>ing that he took the jug to fetch some more; we all had a share of the first beer, not the man that was drunk, he was asleep all the time, but I and the I prisoner and Carealis—when the prisoner returned with the beer he brought another man with him, an Italian, and introduced him as his cousin; it was Salvatori Segansio—the prisoner called me out into the passage and asked. me what they put in the drink to make them drunk—I said I did not know—he said the Italian had 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon him, and he wished to make him drank and rob him—I told him he should do no such a thing there; if he did I should tell the police—he said "All right, I won't do it"—I then went out to fetch some more beer—we all had share of that too; I gave Carealis a glass; he drank it, and I gave a glass to Segansio; he drank the best part of it—I saw the prisoner stir something up in the glass with a piece of paper—I had given a glass of ale to Segansio, and I was pouring some beer into another glass; that was when I saw the prisoner stirring something with the piece of paper; that was in Segansio's glass—the prisoner did not say anything; I watched him for a minute; he gave it to Segansio and told him to drink it; I saw him drink it, and I said "All right"—I meant that I was going out to tell the police—I had a glass in my hand; I put it down to walk out, and before I had time to move from the table the prisoner took a revolver from his pocket and said "Look here," pointed it to me, and fired—I was standing at the corner of the table, facing the prisoner, with my back towards the fireplace; he was sitting in a chair on the other side of the table—I moved my head on one side as he fired; I heard the smash of glass behind me—I heard a whizzing noise as something passed my head—I ran out and into the next house but one, No. 20—the prisoner followed me—I ran upstairs into the front room; the door was open; I shut it after me—the prisoner called for me to come down, saying "Come down; I won't hurt you"—I said "No"—he tried to open the door—the mistress of the house came running to the foot of the stairs, and called up the stairs "Who</p>

               <p>is there? come down; I don't allow any one in my house"—the prisoner went down directly—as soon as I saw him get out into the street I ran out—I met a constable coming down the street, and I gave the prisoner in charge—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the revolver—the prisoner had been drinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that he was drunk—I have known him about thirteen months, not five or six years—he is a seaman; he has been in the habit of visiting me; he slept with me on the night of the 28th—we had all been drinking together on the night of the 29th; he came in with two Greeks—he is himself a Greek—two mugs of beer had been drunk before the Italian came—it was when the prisoner went out the third time that he brought in the Italian—there were then four men in the room—the Italian was sitting against the prisoner—the prisoner called me out of the room into the passage when he spoke about making the man drunk—I gave the Italian a glass of beer—the prisoner gave the beer to him and told him to drink it, and he did drink it; that was the glass of beer I gave him—the prisoner took the glass up; I thought he was going to drink it, and I noticed him stir up something with a piece of paper; then the glass was given to the Italian and he drank it—there was a bed in the room, a table, and pictures—there was a picture over the fireplace representing a soldier going away to war—I was standing up at the table at the time the pistol was fired—the prisoner was sitting not two yards from me—I saw the revolver—there was a lamp in the room, but not alight—this was about a quarter or half-past 7; we could not see very well—when I heard the pistol fired I ran out at once—he did not ask me to whom the pictures belonged—he said he was going to Liverpool that night—what he said was, "The Italian has 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on him, and I want to make him drunk and take it from lim"—he did not use the word "rob."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 32). On the night of 29th August I was sent to the prosecutor's house by Inspector Smith—I met the prosecutor in Cambridge Street, coming towards the station—we met the prisoner at the door of 18, Albert Street—I asked him what was the matter—he said "Nothing, it was only a glass broken"—he spoke English—I got a light, and went into the room—the prisoner stood in the passage—there was a broken glass on the table, and three others which contained some beer—I asked him whore was the revolver—he said "I did not have any"—I searched him, but found no revolver on him—there was one man on the bed in the room drunk, and two others, Segansio and Carealis, who gave the name of Michaels, and was at first included in the charge before the Magistrate—the prisoner had been drinking, but he appeared to be perfectly well aware of what he was doing—I asked the prosecutrix if she had seen the revolver—she said "No, it must have been a glass"—the prisoner took up a broken glass from the table, and said "It was only this glass"—Sergeant Talbot came in immediately after—he said to the prosecutrix "Stand in the position you were in when he fired at you"—she did so—he then asked her where the prisoner was sitting when he fired—she pointed it out—I then followed the course of the bullet, and found it in the wall just in a line where the prosecutrix was standing—the bullet went through this picture, breaking the glass, and making a hole in the picture, and imbedded itself in the wall;</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He spoke English enough to be understood—I cannot say whether he said "Glass broken," or "A glass broken"—when I asked him where was the revolver he said "I did not have any"—I don't think I have said "I have not any"—when I told him the charge, he said "Me shoot Lizzie; why, I slept with her last night, and I am going away to-morrow."</p>

I went to the prosecutrix's house on this evening, and saw her and the prisoner there—I said "What is the matter here?"—she said "That man tired at me with a revolver"—I said "Are you sure of it?"—she said "Yes, I saw it in his hand"—I told her to place herself in the position she was in when the shot was fired, and in a direct line with the top of the head the bullet was found in the wall—I then I took the prisoner into custody—I afterwards apprehended Carealis in the Highway; a lot more sailors were with him—I asked him where was the I revolver that Doucatis, or Dukes as he was called, had in 18, Albert Street—he said"I do not know where it is"—I am not exactly sure that I said "The revolver that Dukes had"—I think I said "Where is the revolver I that was in 18, Albert Street"—to the best of my recollection I said "What have you done with that revolver that was in 18, Albert Street?"—he said 1 "I don't know anything about any revolver"—I said "I think you do"—I caught hold of his greatcoat pocket, and felt something bard; I put any hand in, and found this revolver—I examined it, and found five chambers loaded, and the sixth recently discharged—I said I should take him into custody, and charge him with being concerned with Doucatis in attempting to shoot a woman in 18, Albert Street—he said "All right, I will go; I do not know anything about it"—I drew the charges from the other fire chambers—I found this bullet was similar to the others.</p>

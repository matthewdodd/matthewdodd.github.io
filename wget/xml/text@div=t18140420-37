            . I am coachman to Sir Joseph. On the morning of the 3d of February, about half past seven o'clock, I went to the coach-house; it was getting light then, I found the coach-house door about an inch and a half open; I went in; I missed four glasses from the chariot, and three from the coach, and two box coats were gone. One of the box coats was the coat I wore; it is the property of Sir Joseph. It is a blue coat, with a white button.</p>
               <p>JAMES FRANKLIN. I have been in the habit of driving a hackney coach; I was brought up a farrier. On a Wednesday night in February, I do not know the day of the month, I and the two prisoners went to Sir Joseph's coach-house, in Dean-street, Soho-square. The prisoner, Butcher, unlocked Sir Joseph's coach-house door, at about half past eleven. Butcher unlocked the coach-house door with a pick-lock key. Jelks was present at the time. Butcher and Jelks went into Sir Joseph's coach-house; they locked themselves in, and left me out to watch. I did not see any more of them for an hour. I waited at the door all the time. When I saw them again, Jelks came out with seven coach-glasses, and Butcher came out with two box coats. Butcher put on one coat; and I the other. Jelks carried the glasses to Butcher's lodging. Jelks walked on first; Butcher and I followed him. We left all the property that night at Butcher's lodging, and then Jelks and me went and slept together. We returned to Butcher's lodging the next day. Butcher and Jelks went out together; where they went to I do not know. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200020"></xptr>left me there, and returned in about half an hour, and then Butcher and me went out in search of a man of the name of Joseph. We got intelligence at a public-house in Oxford-street, what time he would be there. We went home to Butcher's lodging again; Butcher sent me to fetch Joseph. I went to a public-house in Oxford-street; I do not know the sign of it; I saw Joseph at the public-house; he misunderstood me where to come to; he did not come at the time appointed to the house. Butcher himself went and fetched him. Butcher sold the two blue box coats to Joseph for two pounds six shillings. I was present at the sale. I never knew Joseph before. It was me that proposed the intention of stealing at Sir

No. 27, Cow Cross, he was not at home. I found a quantity of scantlings, deal ends, and joists. concealed under the coals in the cellar; I looked at these pieces. I knew them to be mine by the private marks I ordered the carpenter to put on them when taking down. The prisoner was kept out of the way I believe: I never saw the prisoner untill Mr. Harmer introduced him at Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In what capacity did you employ the prisoner - A. As master bricklayer, to superintend and carry on the work.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted in the course of the business he has done for you, he has earned a great deal of money, how many men did he employ - A. Open to the amount of six or seven, and sometimes one or two and sometimes none.</p>
               <p>Q. The consequence arises there must be a great deal of money due to him - A A great deal of money for a little work. He made no claim but what he got.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he threatened to arrest you before you had accused him that he had robbed you - A. No, never before I got another man to do his work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he threaten to arrest you before you complained to the magistrate against him - A. He never threatened to arrest me until this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying that he never threatened to arrest you until you had got another man to do his work - A. He threatened to serve me out in an open tap-room in public company, on a certain day.</p>
               <p>Q. And before that certain day was, you applied at Hatton Garden office and accused him before the magistrate - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a bold question to put to you - has not he accused you of altering a receipt of his from twenty pound to one hundred and twenty pounds as money paid - A He never has.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath did not Mr. Harmer in my presence before the magistrate accuse you, or complain that it was altered from twenty pound to one hundred and twenty pounds, and was it not snatched out of his hand - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the paper snatched out of Mr. Harmer's, hand which was presented to the magistrate - A. Mr. Harmer snatched a paper out of Mr. Fletcher's hands, and Mr. Fletcher snatched it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from the prisoner a receipt for the sum of one hundred and twenty pound - A. From his wife I did. On the 31st of November I paid her a one hundred pound note, and a twenty pound note before a witness, she gave me a receipt for the one hundred and twenty pound on plain paper.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you, whether true or false, did not he serve you with a bill of one hundred and thirty seven pound - A. On that day I was in the back premises, he and another man came, and the other man had a thick stick in his hand, he presented me a bill of one hundred and thirty seven pound.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the day before Christmas-day; was it not - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.

            Then it was on the 23d of December - A. Upon my word I cannot recollect, I cannot say whether it was the day before Christmas day or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days after that was it you went to the police office - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath that you have taken did not you go to the police office the next day out one; and the reason that you did not go the next day was because it was Christmas day, the police office was not open - A. I went as soon as the information was given.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not suppose that you will dupe me that way, nor my lord, nor the jury - A. I tell you the truth, I did not look at the bill; I put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAITE. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed by the prosecutor after the prisoner had left - A. Yes, and I worked for Mr. Cummings when Fowler did, and was discharged with him, and upon the prisoner being discharged I applied to Mr. Cummings for the job; Mr. Cummings told me that I had robbed his premises; I told him that the person that told him so was the greatest thief; I told him then what I saw the prisoner take out; I had seen him take boards out of Mr. Cummings's house that he was building, and took them to the prisoner's house. After this Mr. Cummings had a search warrant. I went with the constables who had the search warrant. The wood was found in the prisoners coal cellar. I saw the private mark upon the wood, some red chalk marks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner had not left the work when he made the accusation against you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.

            When he had left the work then you accused him - A. Yes. I told of him because he had told Cummings that I had stolen them.</p>

               <persName id="t18110109-55-person609">

            Why did not you tell before - A. He had a right to do what he asked, I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a single board found that you or any body else could speak to - A.

               <p>JOHN TOWEER. I assisted in loading the cart with timber, I put a cross made with red chalk on the pieces of wood for one load, they were to go to Cow Cross.</p>

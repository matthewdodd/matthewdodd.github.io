                  </hi>. I am a gun-maker, and lire at Lambeth. Wynn and Walker dealt with me—on Thursday, the 25th of July, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my shop—he was a stranger—he said he came from Mr. Wynn for three guns, and said, he and Mr. Wynn and Evans were going out for a day's shooting—I said, as he was a stranger I could not let him have them unless Mr. Wynn came himself, or he brought me a note from him—he brought me a note, in about an hour—I questioned him, and he told me he knew the parties—he said, Evans would come in the morning for his gun, and he would only take two—I gave him two—I met him again on the Monday evening accidentally—I said to him, "How could you serve me in this way?"—he took me by the arm, and said, "I will make it all right with you"—I took him round the corner, and gave him to a policeman—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a note</hi>)—this is the order he brought me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)</p>
               <p>"To Mr. Allen, Lambeth. The bearer of this note informs me you would like Mr. Evans to speak to you about the guns; and as I cannot see him to-day, I have written this to say I will be answerable for them, &amp;c. &amp;c. If you will lend us one powder-flask I shall be obliged. I will bring them home on Saturday. <hi rend="smallCaps">F. WYNN."</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody—he said, "Let me go to my mother, and she will make it all right"—I said, I must take him to the station-house—he then endeavoured to go away—when I got him to the station-house he said he had lent the guns to somebody—on the way to Union Hall he said, what a fool the prosecutor must be to let him have the guns—he said he had written the note, but Wynn had given him leave to do so, but that he was so agitated any body could have observed it.</p>

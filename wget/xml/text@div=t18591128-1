I am a jeweller of 14, Corn-market, Oxford—about the latter end of August the prisoners came to my shop, and I made an exchange for them of some jewellery, these bright chains (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid them 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in exchange and bought some Napoleons of them then—they said that they expected a brother from Australia who was going to get married, and they would come when he arrived and buy a lot of things for wedding presents—Jacob and Rosa came two or three days afterwards but they merely talked about goods which they wanted—on Friday, September 9, they all came and selected a number of things, of which I made out this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the same evening after they were gone—they are silver salts, forks, spoons, and all sorts of jewellery; my counter was entirely covered with them—my young man and my sister were also in the shop at the time—Rosa Levy fainted, and I went round the counter and helped her into a chair with the elder prisoner—he Said, "Give me some brandy"—I said, "I have none, but I have some very fine old rum"—he said, "That will do"—my young man fetched a bottle—Rosa had some and was restored—she had been about three quarters of an hour in the shop before she fainted—she had been taking part in the selection of the articles, but nothing had taken place to make her faint—Jacob wanted to know whether I had any loose diamonds—I said no, but that I could get some—I went to get some, but they would not arrive till the next day—he wanted some pearls for ear rings; I showed him a parcel to select from, and he selected four which were put on one side—when the counter was covered with articles Jacob selected from them—he continually</p>

               <p>put his hand in his pocket and took out a box; he had asked me, between the first and second occasion, whether I could get him a larger snuff-box; his was almost as big as my hand, and I said that I should have to make a larger one expressly—after Rosa recovered, Jacob asked for a violin which was hanging up; my young man got it down and Jacob began playing it in the shop—one tray which Jacob had selected, containing jewellery to a large amount, was taken at his desire into my back shop, and he went in there and played—my shopman was showing things also, and Jacob took him by the shoulder bodily to take him outside the window to show him a tray of coloured gold seals and keys which he wanted to look at—I told the young man not to go—I said, "Let him go out and point, and you can stay inside; but he took him by the arm and took him out—Louis first took up one thing and then another, and began to play again—Rosa fainted again, and had some more rum; they all had some; they drank half a bottle—the value of the goods they selected on the 9th was about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they then said that they should require some diamonds, and some fine gold chains, and a lot of other things which I had not got in stock—they left my shop about half-past 6, Jacob saying that he would come next morning, when the invoice was to be made out, properly numbered, and pay for them and take them away—they said that they were going to stay in Oxford four weeks—they all left together, and Louis returned within two minutes and wanted to buy an opera glass apart from his father-in-law—while he was there Jacob came back and said something to him in German—he made a great to do and they both went away; they did not take the glass—after they had gone I missed a diamond ring which had been among the articles I had shown them, and after I had had my dinner I went to Solomon's to ask him if he would tell me where they lived, as they had told me that they had bought things of him—I went to the railway station and made farther inquiries, but could not find them till I saw them in custody—I examined my stock minutely on the Saturday, which is a busy day, and again on Monday—I missed six antique forks, six double thread fiddle spoons, ten pearls, eleven seals, a chain and other articles—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a ring which I took in exchange from them—this gold chain, pencil case, and ring, are mine; but I had not missed them till I saw them—I then went through my stock and missed eleven seals from the bunch of twelve—a dialogue had passed between us respecting the seals; they had the mark of a horse shoe, which is good luck, and I explained to the prisoners what good luck means—I must have thrown the bunch into the tray; they came from the same tray as the pencil case.</p>

               <p>appeared respectable—Mr. Solomons lives in the Corn-market about a dozen doors from me—mine is a large shop and well stocked—my sister was in and out of the shop; she went to fetch some water to mix with the rum when Rosa asked for it—I told Mrs. Evans that they had robbed me and mentioned a diamond ring—I do not think Rosa went into my back room after the tray was moved in there—the amount of foreign money, exchanged was I think, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or perhaps more—I buy my jewellery of the manufacturers, but I make several short chains—the seals were all alike in pattern and cutting and were all strung upon a hoop ring, but the stones were various in colour—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the jewellery they exchanged with me—they spoke very good English.</p>

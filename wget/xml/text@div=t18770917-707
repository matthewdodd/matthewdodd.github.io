                  </hi>. I live at 21, Hackney Grove, which, house was broken into on the early morning of the 25th July, on the night of the 24th—the doors and windows were fastened when I went to bed, with the exception of my front dining-room window—I saw all the shutters, that will fasten, closed—I am not certain about the front dining-room window—a little before daylight I was disturbed by a noise and went downstairs after a little while—it would be between 3 o'clock and 3.30—I moved about a little while first—T thought it was a door that was standing open, so I left my room and shut the door and then went downstairs, and I saw my dining-room door was open—I had shut it over night, and I saw that a long horizontal bar had been removed from the shutters opposite the end of the front dining-room, and the shutters were partially open, and the first thing I then noticed was that a pair of very old boots not' belonging to me, were placed on the carpet—then I noticed that two desks had been forced open, and the contents of one of them removed—I saw a plated top claret jug placed near, and a case that had contained a dozen knives and forks thrown on a chair, and the contents gone—I had left that the night before on the dinner waggon—a cigar case of mine had been taken from the mantelpiece and the cigars taken away—there was one of the knives left—I saw the empty scabbard of a sword of mine (I was formerly in the Artillery Com<lb></lb>pany), and the drawn sword was placed near the door—a cupboard was forced open and a pair of boots taken from the hall—I was quite undressed, and I went upstairs and searched the house inside to see if there was any<lb></lb>one concealed—afterwards I went to the front and gave a constable an account of what had happened—I examined the house and found distinct marks of an entry having been made at the dining-room window—my</p>

               <p>servant had been neglectful and I cannot positively say whether it was fastened—I went out of town, and was in town again on the 10th August and I inquired at the police-station whether anything had been heard of my property, and the answer was "No," but moved by a certain idea, I visited the Clerkenwell police-station and I asked to see three persons who were confined there—I had made no charge at that time in reference to anyone, and no one had been apprehended in reference to the burglary—the prisoner was one of the three persons—I asked that the boots he was wearing should be taken from his feet—that was done; they were handed to me—I examined them and found them to be my boots, the pair that was stolen on the night of the burglary—these are the boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I positively identify them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was first at the police-court on the 10th August—I made a charge and gave evidence there and then—I had not seen the prisoner and two other men in the dock on another charge; I know they had not been in the dock—the bootmaker who made the boots has been examined—I did not say on identifying them that one was bigger than the other—I was asked in July, whether 1 identified them by any particular mark—I said I did not place any particular mark on my boots, but I identified them by their general appearance—I gave every direction about them, and I found them exactly correspond in every particular—then I said to the inspector, I think it was, that he would find if I put one of them on my foot that it would be tighter in one place than the other—it is the left which is tighter than the right—I heard the prisoner was taken into custody on the 3rd August, and this (the 10th) was his first remand.</p>

On the morning of the 25th July, I was on duty in the Aberdeen Park Road, about four minutes' walk from the prosecutor's house, when I saw the prisoner with another man coming from the direction of the prosecutor's house—it was about 3.30 or 3.45—I took particular notice of them—they had nothing with them, and I did not stop them—when I was at the police-court I heard the prisoner say some<lb></lb>thing about buying the boots somewhere, but he didn't finish the sentence, or I didn't catch anything more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was taken into custody with two other men and placed in the dock on the 3rd August as being a suspected person; I assisted in apprehending him—I spoke to Inspector Jensen on the 10th August about the boots—I first gave evidence at the police-court on the 23rd August—Mr. Barstow, the Magistrate, was going to discharge the three prisoners on 3rd August for want of evidence, but on the application of the police, through the gaoler, they were put back and remanded for a week, to the 10th—the other two men had three months on the 23rd—I did not say that he was one of the men and one of the other men who had three months was the other concerned in the burglary, until one of the men had had three months for something entirely different—there was no appearance about the two men of anything bulky, they were talking and I heard something mentioned</p>

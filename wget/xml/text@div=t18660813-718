On Sunday, the 5th August, I saw the prisoner and some others quarrelling in St. George's Street, Rat<lb></lb>cliff Highway—I went and asked them to go away—they took no notice at first—I tapped another man on the shoulder, and asked him to go away—I said, "Go home"—the prisoner turned round and made a thrust at me with a knife, but did not reach me—I pulled my staff out and warded off the blow—some one then called out, "Mind the knife behind you"—I turned my head, and immediately the prisoner stabbed me in the abdomen—he was in front of me—there was another man in front of me, with a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stevedore, and live at 5, Salter's Court, Whitechapel—I was in St. George's Street, and saw the prisoner with four or five others—the constable stood on the pavement, and the people in the road making loud noises—Izzard asked them to go away—they took no notice—he touched one of them on the shoulder, and told him to go home—the prisoner pulled out a knife, and attempted to stab him, but did not reach him—he made several other attempts, which were of no use—a short stout man came behind Izzard with a knife—I said, "Look out," and as he turned his head the prisoner stabbed him—56 H came up, and the prisoner ran into a boarding-house with the others—56 H and Izzard went in and brought him out—I saw the short stout man attempt to stab Izzard behind before the prisoner stabbed him, but 56 H knocked him down—the prisoner got away from Izzard, who ran after him and fell—I followed the prisoner and knocked him down—a knife and a few halfpence were taken from him at the station.</p>

            , Mrs. Dane's son, came down, and told me there were some suspicious boys about the window; I went up stairs, and took my seat at my work-board, close to the window; I saw three boys at the window; I then observed them divide; one stood at the middle of the window, and the prisoner and another boy at the next window, which is a medicine warehouse; I saw then looking very stedfastly in my face, I looked at them several minutes very hard, and they at me; presently, I heard the spoons jingle in the window; I desired a little boy to pull the sliding-sash back, and he told me the wind came in at the window; I got up, and observed that the window had been cut, and a piece of glass flew to the opposite side of the spoons; I told the boy to call his mother up; I took my hat, and immediately went out of doors; I went about 200 yards down Oxford-street, but did not see any thing of them; upon that I crossed over the way, and presently met the three boys that I had seen at the window; one boy I laid hold of, and the prisoner slipped away; some time in February I was sent for to the Marlborough-street office, I knew the prisoner immediately, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you hear the noise of the glass being cut? - A. No; I heard the glass fall in; the whole glare of the light of the medicine shop, which was transparent, was shining upon their faces, so that I could not be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this was one of the boys? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you certain? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the boy that you held? - A. He was tried and convicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Upon hearing the jingling of the glass, you did not go out immediately? - A. I desired the boy to pull back the sliding sash, and I went out immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy, upon whom the property was found, was convicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you know the person of the prisoner before that night? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This boy was not at your window at the time you heard the jingling of the glass? - A. No; but he was in company with the others.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him again till a month after? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.And then in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have perhaps heard, that there is such a thing as forty pounds reward, if this boy is convicted? - A. I did not know any thing of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180036"></xptr>Q.Don't you now know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you expect a part of the reward? - A. That would very ill pay me for my time and trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had a part of the reward for the other boy? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you expect, if this boy is convicted, to have a part of another sorry? - A. I imagine I shall come in for a part of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Supposing you had seen that boy not in custody, should you have known him? - A. I should, set me have seen him where I would.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know, that if you say that which is not true upon your oath, you will be punished not only in this world, but in that which is to come? - A. Yes; I am the son of Mrs. Dane; I was going of an erralid for Mr. Phillips, a paper-hanger, Princes-street, Cavendsh-square, and saw three boys next door to my mother's, and another coming across to them; after I had been back to Mr. Phillips's, I came home; one of the boys had been taken; I went to the watch-house, but I could not swear to him, it was so dark.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. To the best of my knowledge he was one of them, but I cannot swear to him, it was so dark; he was about his heighth, and had a short blue jacket on, and the same countenance, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LOVITT sworn. - I am an officer: On the 6th of February I went with Warren to take the prisoner into custody, he was dressed in a blue jacket; we took him up, upon the deseription of Wheatley; we took him down into the kitchen in Belton-street, St. Giles's; when we got into the kitchen, the candles were knocked out, and the prisoner escaped; I found this wire upon him, (producing a piece of wire bent up at the end); he got away, and I did not take him again till the 24th, (produces the spoon); I took this from the little boy who was tried before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You know that there is a forty pounds reward, I suppose? - A. Yes; people of our profession cannot be off knowing that.</p>

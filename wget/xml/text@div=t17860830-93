               <p>Had you no Christian or Jew by? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How many times have you appeared here and the Juries found verdicts against your evidence directly? - You know best; I will tell you the reason; the prisoners employed people to swear. I get nothing by what I do.</p>
               <p>You will not swear that; do you mean to swear that you do this without fee or reward, and for the good of your country? - Yes, I do swear that.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that you are to get nothing for this? - I suppose I shall be allowed my expences.</p>
               <p>By whom? - By the Court I suppose.</p>
               <p>Suppose the Court should not, who are to allow you your expences? - I do not know rightly.</p>
               <p>Take care what you swear, for though you may not give a true account, those that employ you will? - I am employed by nobody.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - I am employed by nobody.</p>
               <p>Nobody knew before-hand of your doing this? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Nobody promised to give you any thing for it, or to pay you any expences? - No, my Lord, I had no promises from any body.</p>
               <p>Nothing at all? - No; my expences I expect, that is all.</p>
               <p>Did you prosecute Cole for nothing? - The gentleman paid me my expences.</p>
               <p>What did he pay you? - He allowed me a crown a day, but I did no know he would pay me any thing.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect five shillings a day from the Solicitor of the mint on this prosecution? - I do not know, Sir, if he pleases to give it me.</p>
               <p>Do you expect it, Sir? - I do expect it after the trial is over.</p>
               <p>You did not know what a piece was? - No, I did not know what he meant by it.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then upon the former trial you did not swear what a piece meant? - I do not know; I cannot say whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Do you believe you did not? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Since you have been transported how often have you been examined as a witness?</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. I object to that? - I shall not answer without my Lord tells me so.</p>

In about five minutes came Roach and another man in the passage, and they seeing some people standing at the door, turned back; I searched Roach, and in his left hand waistcoat pocket I found five shillings and some good silver; in his breeches pocket I found two; and this five shillings I took out of Abrahams<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300138"></xptr> breeches pocket; Mr. Sargesson who was by, said, search him as well as the others.</p>

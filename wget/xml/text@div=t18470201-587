                  </hi>. I am an engineer—I live Wellington-place, Commer<lb></lb>cial-road. I know the defendant—I became acquainted with him in the latter part of Sept., 1844, at a coffee-room in Coventry-street, which I have used for many years—he came in there casually, and an acquaintance com<lb></lb>menced between us—he told me his name was Carnegie; that he was a captain in the Royal Engineers—he said he was a first cousin to the Hon. Captain Carnegie of the Royal Navy, and he was first cousin of the Hon. Fox Maule—he said he had property in India—on the 30th of Nov., 1844, he dined with me at the London Tavern, Bishopsgate-street, at a dinner for the Scottish Hospital, on the anniversary of St. Andrew—I was a steward there—he asked me for a ticket, and I gave him one—he accompanied me there—he asked me if I could oblige him with a ticket for the Countess of Beaumont to go into the gallery—I procured one, but the Countess did not come—he said the Countess of Beaumont was his wife—at the dinner he borrowed three sovereigns of me, which he said was to give to the charity—I do not know what he did with them—I was induced to lend him the three sovereigns by his representing that at that dinner he expected to see some of his relations, and on the faith that he was connected with the honourable person that he stated—he said he knew Sir Henry Pottinger—on the 7th of Jan., 1845, he called on me, and I accompanied him to Lime-strrt—I meet the Countess there—he on that day mentioned to the gentleman I was with, that he was cousin to those honourable person—we left the office there, and on our way from there he said he had forgotten his purse, that he and the Countess were going shopping, and he borrowed five sovereigns of me, which I lent him on the faith that he was connected in the way he represented—I have never had the five sovereigns again, nor the three sovereigns—he was taken into custody ten days or a fortnight ago.</p>

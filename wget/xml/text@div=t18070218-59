               <p>Q. You do not pay rent nor taxes; does your brother ever lie there. - A. No; the lease is in his name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose these goods. - A. On the 17th of this month I was sitting at breakfast in the parlour behind the shop, about half after eight o'clock; on turning my head towards the shop, I saw a man crossing the side of the shop towards the door; I immediately ran into the shop and caught him by the skirt of his coat, before he had got out of the door, and at the moment of seizing him by the coat, one pair of boots dropped either from under his arm, or from under his coat. I took him by the collar and forced him across the shop into a chair, and on looking on the floor I saw a large bag. I desired my wife, and them that were in the shop, to take the contents out of the bag; they did; it proved to be three pair and an odd boot that was in the bag. I am sure they are my property; the name is marked in full length on the inside of the tops; there are the boots; they are all new, and were hanging on the inside of the shop on brass hooks on a rail.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a photographic artist, of Lancaster-road, Notting<lb></lb>hill—in November, 1865, I was in business as a photographer at Richmond—I let the premises of which I was the tenant, to the prisoner in November, with the use of all the appliances, apparatus, and furniture at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—there was no written agreement—he occupied the place two or three weeks, and I then received a letter from him—I went to Richmond two or three days afterwards and found the place deserted, and the goods in question</p>

               <p>removed—I returned to town, ascertained where the prisoner lived, went there and saw his wife but failed to see him at all—finding I could get no redress I took a warrant out for his apprehension—part of my apparatus has been produced by a pawnbroker, and part has been brought to me by the prisoner during one of his remands—he has never given me any explanation in conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his receipt for six weeks' rent given him to save him from bankruptcy—he told me I might have the place to work there, and he lent me the apparatus—he owed me a quarter's rent—<hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There was a quarter due on Christmas Day—I only took it in September—that receipt is in my writing—you were not in my employment at Richmond at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, nor were we afterwards partners; never—when I found it did not answer I did not say, "You may as well have the things as my creditors—an execution was not about being put in—I should have been prepared to pay the rent if I was asked; I have not yet been asked—I did not ask you to be a brother to me in my difficultics, and say that I wished to make all my things over to you.</p>

I will return everything that belongs to you, because we are out of work; we are badly off and my hus<lb></lb>band was working without wages"—the prisoner had to take a return ticket every day at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. backwards and forwards—it was his intention to return, he had the key; he only went away because the noise was so great; the furniture was not removed, only the apparatus—he took that away while the creditors were making a noise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Grant, a pawnbroker, in London-wall. On the 7th of December, 1836, the female prisoner pawned a tea-spoon, for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am quite certain of her person—she afterwards pawned other things—I remember her coming to me on Wednesday, the 11th of October—she said that the house had been broken open, or a robbery had been committed, that the whole of the plate was gone, and she said, "If there is any inquiry made, you know nothing of it"—she was referring to the plate now produced—she said a robbery was committed and should the plate now produced be inquired for I was to know nothing of it—I said I could do no such thing—she said, "If you know nothing of it the plate would become your own"—I told her she had better redeem it, for if in<lb></lb>quiries were made I could do no otherwise than take the usual course—I went the next morning to the Mansion-house, and gave information—I have seen the female prisoner many times during the last two years—I have not the least doubt of her pawning the tea-spoon—she has taken things out of pawn which she has pledged—she always represented them to be her own—the spoon has the prosecutor's initials on it, and a crest—she gave me the name of Harley—I asked her where she lived, and she said in Broad-street—I believed her—this duplicate says Bell-alley, but she has been a customer of ours for two years, and the latter part of the time we have not asked her residence.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not keep a shop for jewellery - A. No, I cut drops for ear-rings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. He was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to my place; he took a pair of gold ear-rings and a gold keeper. The rings were my wife's; they lay on my bench. It was on the 30th of August that he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again - A. Yes, his wife gave me intelligence that he had got them. I went with the officer up to his place. I found the ring upon Mrs. Murray's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What, were the ear-rings upon her finger - A. No, the keeper; the ear-rings were in pledge; the officer has got them. The prisoner confessed to me and to Mr. Smith that he took the rings; distress (he said) drove him to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. A clock-maker.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I am an headborough. I have got a pair of ear-rings and a metal keeper. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner. I asked the woman that lived with the prisoner to let me look at her hand. She gave me the keeper off her finger. The woman went out and fetched these two ear-rings. The prisoner then said he was sorry; distress drove him to do it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The ear-rings and the keeper are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I purchased them of a person at the Pied Horse public-house, Chiswell-street.</p>

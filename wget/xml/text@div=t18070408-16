               <p>Q. Whereabouts had you left any shoes. - A. In the windows, they were placed in rows, and some on hooks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window glass all whole. - A. I have a number of windows cracked but no glass was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives in the house with you. - A. I have three lodgers up stairs, they were all of them in and the door was fast; the lodgers have a back door to come in at.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the night did you hear any alarm. - A. I heard something in the shop, I had no apprehension it was any body at the window, I heard a ratling of glass, I imagined at the time it was the cat, for we use glass in our business, and I thought the cat had got upon the man's seat in the shop. I sleep in the back room adjoining the shop; about one o'clock the watchman knocked at my door; I got up, the watchman said I had been robbed, he told me I must come to the watchhouse; when I had got a light I saw I had lost five pair and one shoe, and an odd child's boot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive what state the windows was in at that time. - A. The shutter was down, I perceived a pane of glass out. The shoes were all lost from the spot where the window was broken. I went to the watchhouse, I saw the the two prisoners at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any shoes that were lost. - A. I saw them at Worship street. On the next morning a young man came to my house and said he had found some shoes. I went up to his house and saw the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of shoes did you see. - A. Four pair with the half boot, I saw them again at the office, I know they are mine, I cut them out. I lost six pair in the whole with the half boot, I have the fellow to that at home, there was but four pair found.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my box is in Goswell street.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where the prosecutrix lives. - A. Yes, my box is between thirty and forty yards from her shop. On the 25th of February, about twenty minutes to one o'clock, I perceived two men at Mrs. Welldon's window, the moon shone very bright at the time, I perceived one of these men stoop; in the course of a minute afterwards I heard some glass crack. I got out of my box, and when I got within ten or a dozen yards of the men they run away, I ran after them, they separated, I catched hold of Purdon, he stopped suddenly, and when I laid hold of him he asked me what was the matter, I told him nothing particular. I led him to the watchhouse; bringing him along I perceived Taylor come out of the willow walk. I am sure he was one of the men that I saw at the window, he had gaiters on.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had lost sight of him. - A. I had, but I had not lost sight of Purdon. Taylor came to me while I was taking Purdon round Old street corner, he shammed very drunk; we perceived him sober when he came to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What symptoms did he show to you that he was drunk. - A. He staggered and run against me and asked me what I was going to do with that man. I called the other watchman to lay hold of him. I told him he must go to the watchhouse; when I came back I see one of the shutters down, and the pane of glass was broke large enough to put a man's head in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long have you been a watchman. - A. Six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness here before. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In a case of burglary. - A. Yes, I was here once in a case of burglary.</p>
               <p>Q. If these men are convicted you know there is a reward. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you mean to swear that you did not know there is a forty pound reward upon the conviction of these men. - A I know it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do y them twto swear that you have not heard it before you come into court. - A. I have heard there is such a thing.</p>

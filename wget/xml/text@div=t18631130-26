On the morning of 31st October I was on duty in Holborn—I observed a Hansom cab drive up with the pri<lb></lb>soner and prosecutor in it—the prisoner alighted and the prosecutor got out—he appeared in a state of stupor, as if he had been sleeping in the cab—his coat was all open, and his watchguard hanging loose—I said to him, "Have you lost anything? I think you have lost your watch"—he said, "Have I?"—I immediately turned round to the prisoner, and said, "You have got his watch "—she said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have"—I took hold of her right hand with my left—she said, "He is a friend of mine; you are mistaken"—she was about to do something with her left—I let go of her right hand and took hold of her left, and in struggling I put my hand on her bosom or right shoulder, and there felt the watch—I said, "You have got it now; give it up;" and my hand with hers took the watch from the upper part of her dress—I took her in charge, and took her to the station—she there said that the prosecutor had given it to her—I found 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on her.</p>

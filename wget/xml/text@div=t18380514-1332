I am a servant out of place—I met the prisoner, Plummer, on the 4th of May, at the corner of Great Queen-street, Long-acre, about half past one o'clock in the morning—I went with her to No. 2, Leg-alley, to the second floor front room—I took my watch out of my pocket, wound it up, and went to bed, replacing the watch in my fob, and putting my trowsers under the pillow—there was no lock to the door—I put a chair against it—when I awoke at half past five o'clock I discovered the door was open—I jumped out of bed, and missed the watch and chain, seals and key, a sovereign and some other money—the watch chain was silver, and the key and seal were gold—I lost a silver pencil case—these are the articles—I was not conscious that Plummer had left the room till I awoke—I was perfectly sober.</p>

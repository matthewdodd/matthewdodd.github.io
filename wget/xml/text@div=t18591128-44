                  </hi> I live at 8, Hayes-court, St. George's—I was in the Crooked Billet, Tower-hill, on Thursday, and saw the prisoner there—I told him I would tons him for a pint of ale—he said, "I will"—I won it, but he would not pay for it, and we did not have it—I then tossed him again and won, but he would not pay for it—in a few minutes he struck me on the nose, and I struck him with a pint pot and cut his lips open—he went outside the door, waited about five minutes, and came in again with a knife open in his hand, with which he stabbed me twice on the back of my head and once on my shoulder—here is the hole where the knife went through my mantle—I ran for my life, and the next thing I remember was finding myself in the London Hospital.</p>

I was called and took the prisoner—he said nothing then, but as he was going to the station he said that he had got the worst of it—his lip was cut and was bleeding; it was afterwards sewed up at the station—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given me by a man standing by, who I saw pick it up in the middle of the street—I saw the girl bleeding from the head and insensible—there was no blood on the knife, as it was covered with mud—it was a wet night—the man said, "Here is the knife the man did it with"—the prisoner heard that and said nothing.</p>

On the 22d of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came in, and bought a shawl of my man, which she paid 4 s. 4 d. for - he suspected she had stolen something, and went out and brought her back; she had a reticule basket in her hand, with a handkerchief over it, and under the handkerchief was this lawn, but the shawl she bought was in her hand in paper. I sent for a constable, who took it out of the basket; there were two other new shawls, and some vegetables in it. The lawn had laid on the counter, close by the shawl. She fell on her knees, and begged for mercy when the constable came.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Morris. I sold the prisoner the shawl - the lawn was close to it; she did not ask the price of it. I observed her spread her handkerchief over it while she was looking at the shawl; she left the shop, and I missed it, and fetched her back - the handkerchief was at the top of her basket, and the lawn next to it; then some vegetables, and two shawls at the bottom, folded in paper. She was very much affected.</p>

            . I am a constable, and found the prisoner's basket with the handkerchief on the top, and the lawn under it. She said she found the two shawls in the street - that she had laid her handkerchief on the lawn, and did not know she had got it, and must have taken it up by mistake with the handkerchief.</p>

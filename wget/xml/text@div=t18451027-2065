                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a fishmonger's shop in Clerk<lb></lb>enwell—in July last the prisoner was in my service about eight or ten days—it was part of his duty to take orders for fish, and receive money for me—I received an order for some fish from Mr. Atkinson, of Bond-street, which I sent by the prisoner, with a bill, on the 2nd of July—when he returned I asked him for the money—he said Mr. Atkinson had met him and said he would call and pay me—next morning he came to his work very much in liquor—in the evening I sent him on an errand, and I never saw him any more till he was in custody—the money was never paid to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a perfumer, and live in Old Bond-street.

I think—I objected to paying for the baskets, and paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mrs. Jones occupies a house of mine—her brother-in-law took it for her—they were both present when I gave the order for the fish—I understood it was her business.</p>

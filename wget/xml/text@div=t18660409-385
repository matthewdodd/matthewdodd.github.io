                  </hi>. I am a constable at Fresh-wharf, Lower Thames-street—about half-past 12 o'clock I was on duty there—Sharp, who is in Mr. Atkins' employ, touched me on the shoulder and pointed to the prisoner—I saw him with his hand in a lady's dress—he had an Inverness cape on, apparently with his hand in his pocket—the lady was a Sister of Mercy, the prosecutrix in this case—she gave evidence before the Magistrate—I laid hold of him, and said, "What are you doing with that lady's dress?"—I then asked the lady to see if she had lost anything—he tried to get away—she put her hand in her pocket, and said, in his presence, that she had lost her purse, and that there was some gold and a ring in it—the prisoner said he was waiting for a friend from Paris—he was on her right side—I saw him put his hand in her right hand pocket—when the lady said she had lost her purse, the prisoner said he had not taken it—several other words passed between us—I searched him, and found a knife, a pipe, and a pocket-book—he struggled to get away—I pushed him against a packing<lb></lb>case, and when he was removed from it, a gentleman not here picked this purse up—I did not see him—he said, "Hambrook, here is the purse," and the lady owned it—the money and the ring were in it—I did not see the purse taken—there were three or four cases there—I took him to the station—he gave me his address, 12, Star-street, Bermondsey—there is no such a place—I inquired at the police-station.</p>

I am a packer, at 83, Lower Thames-street—on Tues<lb></lb>day, 26th March, I was at work at Fresh Wharf, about half-past 12—I saw the prisoner with his left hand in the lady's pocket—I called Hambrook's attention, who took him, and they struggled and fell across a case—I left</p>
               <p>the lady standing where I first saw her—I saw another man with him, who went away.</p>

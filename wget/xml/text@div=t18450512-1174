                  </hi>. I am a widow. I have known Catherine Hayes for thirty-nine years—she lives in a room in Marchmont-street, and it confined to her bed—I go to her once a week, and manage her affairs—the prisoner was in her service—I engaged her, and before she came, which, was on the 28th of Nov., I looked over Mrs. Hayes's drawers—I have not since then observed her things—I was sent for by the landlady of the house on the 22nd of March—the prisoner was then gone away—I found the drawers locked, but when I opened them they were all empty—I missed a blanket and all the other things stated—this is the gown—these are the silver spoons—I swear they are Catherine Hayes's property, and were in the house when the prisoner came—I missed them on the 22nd of March.</p>

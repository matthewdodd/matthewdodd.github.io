               <p>Q. Were there any people in the street near you. - A. No; there was a young man happened to come up when I was knocked down; his name is Samworth; I got up again; I found my coat all over mud; I was going to pull it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the blow given you that knocked you down. - A. I do not know where.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not sure whether it was upon your head or not. - A. No; it was done so quick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive yourself stunned. - A. No; I got up, and was pulling my coat off about half off my arm: in the mean time they were all three round me: the prisoner pulled my watch out of my pocket, and ran away: the prisoner is the very man; I will swear that he is the man; he was in blue clothes at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when he was taken, were you. - A. Yes; I kept him in sight all the time; the watchman stopped him; I holloed out, stop thief; the watchman came up, caught hold of him, and they both fell together; I was close by, he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other men. - A. God knows, we followed after him, the watch was picked up off the ground where the watchman and he fell down, about a yard from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked the watch up. - A. A small boy picked the watch up in my sight, the boy gave the watch to Mr. Griffiths the officer, he happened to come up.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see what he knocked him down with, did you. - A. No: with his hand, I believe; Mr. Harvery got up again out of the kennel, and his coat was very muddy, and as he was pulling it off, the prisoner at the bar snatched his watch, and ran off with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him do it. - A. Yes, I ran after him and Mr. Harvey likewise; I never lost sight of him; after we had ran some distance, and did not get any ground, we cried out, stop thief, and the watchman met him and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060033"></xptr>knocked him down in the kennel, and fell upon him; he was secured in White Lion-street: I was not two yards from him all the way: Mr. Griffiths came up at the time, I told him he had taken the watch away.

No; I attempted to pull off my coat, it being so muddy: I had not time to say any thing; I had not been there two minutes before the young men came.</p>

I did; I was near the place, I heard the cry of stop thief; I was in Chamber-street: I ran up directly, and when I came up they were just got up out of the kennel, the watchman and him; he had hold of him: I pulled the the prisoner of one side, and searched him: I heard a person say here is the watch, a boy gave it me. I have had the watch ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Samworth. You said the boy picked up the watch, did you see him pick it up. - A. Yes; I stood a little way off: I saw him pick it up, and give it to Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>HARVEY. That is my watch, the maker's name is Salter, I know it by the seal and chain. This is the same watch that was pulled out of my pocket that night by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffiths. You were present at the examination of this man. - A. I was all the time; after the evidence was gone through, the magistrates asked him what he had to say about taking this watch; he said he did take it. I believe he made mention that the person wanted to fight him and he took the watch for that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were so many questions put to me I did not understand them. On the Sunday night in the house that I was in, with two other sailors and three young women. I called for half a pint of gin for me and my companions, in the course of a quarter of an hour there came in a strange man; the landlord turned him out of the house. I stopped a quarter of an hour, and thinking it time for me to go to my lodgings the servant cautioned me from going out of the door that he had gone out of; she told me there was another door that she would let me out. I went out, and this man seeing me, he challenged me to fight; I refused, and then he challenged me with taking the watch, which I deny.</p>

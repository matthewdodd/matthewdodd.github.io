                  </hi>. I am the principal foreman of the East India Import Dock—by the Act of 1 William IV. the East and West India Docks were united as the East and West India Dock Company—the prisoner was employed on the 15th of February, on the second floor in the East India Import Dock, in lowering some iron work from the crane—I went up stairs, and saw him close to where the tea-chests were, on the right hand side of the room—he had no business there—I went up to him directly, and asked what he did there—he walked off to the other side and said he was looking for a rope—I told him there were no ropes there and that he knew—I saw a protection under his smock-frock, and said, "You have tea, Foster,"—he said, "Yes. I have"—Tiplady, another fore-man, was coming up stairs—this tea was taken from tae prisoner—there was 4 lbs. 10 oz. of gunpowder tea—he was going off with it—a man took him to the Dock station, where I left him—I went to the pile of chests and found one open, and 12 lbs. short of the weight—I compared the tea with that in the chest.</p>

On Saturday the 15th of February I had occasion to go on the second floor of the East India Import arehouse, and was called by Colnett to search the prisoner—I lifted up his smock-frock, and under it I found a handkerchief of tea under his belt—just as I took it he said, "I have some tea"—I took it from him—I went to the station and saw 1 lb. 14 oz. of tea found in his hat.</p>

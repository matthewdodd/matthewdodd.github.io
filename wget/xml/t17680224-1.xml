            . I live at the One Tun at the bottom of Holbourn-hill; the prisoner was at my house on the 23d of January in the evening, sitting in a back room; a servant of mine perceived his pocket to stand out; she sent for me; when I came to him, he had taken out one pint pot, and delivered it to her; then he took another out, and gave it to me; I asked him how he came by them; he said he had picked them up, and intended to carry them to the prosecutor's house; while I turned to speak to a person he made out at the door; I followed and took him about one hundred yards from the door, and gave charge of him to the watchman, and took him to Mr. Davis's, his name being on the pots.</p>

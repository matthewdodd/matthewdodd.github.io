            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner's brother on a charge of housebreaking, and found these articles in possession of another person, who appeared as the prisoner's brother, on Sunday morning, the 30th of January, at No. 20, Great Chart-street, Hoxton, about ten o'clock - the prisoner was not present; I found in the brother's possession nearly three yards of silk, and this cotton cloth - I took the articles to Mr. Rumble's private house in the New-road, and he claimed them; the prisoner was at the house in Fleet-street, and I sent him with a note to Mr. Rumble's private house -I afterwards went to Mr. Rumble myself, returned to Fleet-street, and the prisoner had absconded; I saw him on the Monday morning at Guildhall.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 20, Chart-street, Hoxton, and am the prisoner's brother. Collier took this silk and cotton from my house on Sunday - the silk was brought to me by the prisoner on the Saturday night before; I am a tailor - my brother used to sleep at his master's - I received the cotton cloth from him on the Friday night; I was to use part of the silk for a coat I was making for the prosecutor - the prisoner told me he wished the other to line a coat for himself; I had told him the week before I wanted some shirts, and he told me he had some cotton which would do for them, and gave me the cotton for that purpose - I told Collier what they were brought for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. Twenty-one; I work for the prosecutor, and was in the constant habit of going to his shop - I said in the first instance that my brother gave them to me; the officer said he should take me into custody for having things found on me - I told him immediately he came that my brother gave them to me - I was going to use part of the silk on Mr. Rumble's coat, which he had given me to make - the prosecutor does not swear to the cotton.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mr. Rumble furnish the cloth to make the coat? A. Mr. Rumble did; he sent no silk - I was to find the lining, and charge him with it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was present when Collier searched the prisoner's premises, and found the silk and cotton; it was claimed by Mr. Rumble - I produce the cotton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not several articles found at this man's house, claimed as the prosecutor's, and not included in this indictment? A. I think there were several- they are not included, because they could not swear to them - here is some cotton which was afterwards found in the prisoner's box. at Mr. Rumble's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you find the cotton now produced? A. Collier found it - when he gave it to me it was on the brother's shop-board; the cotton I have was found in the prisoner's box, at Mr. Rumble's.</p>
               <p>MR. RUMBLE. I can speak to this silk most positively - it is not silk for coat-linings; it is gros de Naples for ladies' bonnets - I never intended it to line a coat; while the prisoner was in my service it was put into a box, after taking stock some time back, and was not for sale - I am certain it never has been sold; I have the remaining part here, which matches it; the prisoner slept in my house, but unknown to me - I did not know he had a box there; I can almost say to a certainty that the cotton produced by Collier is mine - the selvidge corresponds exactly with other cotton which I have; I have not the least hesitation in speaking to that produced by Jacobs - it corresponds with the rest in my shop; it strongly resembles what I have in my stock - it corresponds exactly in width and quality; I am positive of the silk - it is worth 10s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the box kept in the shop, tumbled about on the shop-board, and open to every body? A. Certainly not; I never knew the prisoner's box was there, and whether that was open to every body I cannot say - my answer applied to the box I had put the property into; the box said to be his was in the kitchen - my foreman lives at the house; I have no servants there - his box was brought up stairs when the officer came, and broken open; the silk is not used for coats - it is an uncommon good one, and what I can swear to; I only had this piece - there were fifty-two yards of it; the rest was all made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170089"></xptr>into bonnets, on my account - I have not sold a yard of it: when I took stock there were eighteen yards left; I have no mark on it, but know it by the quality, and comparing it; there is no mark on the cotton - I do not swear to that, because it is a common article; I have looked over my books - the prisoner is certainly not debited to me in them for three yards and a half of silk; there is no cotton claimed by me and omitted in the indictment - it is all included together; it makes twelve yards together - I have no doubt of its being mine - I took stock about a month ago; other persons could have gone to the box.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You suppose the silk was cut off that piece? A. I think it corresponds in the cutting.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's foreman. On the Saturday preceding the Sunday on which the prisoner was taken, we had an order to execute rather rapidly; we had a black coat to make, among other articles - it was not to be lined with silk; the prisoner cut the coat out, and it is usual for the person cutting it out to fit it up - I ordered no silk to be used; the servants of the house have been allowed articles at cost price, to complete a garment, but then it must be booked; this order was given out on the Saturday night, to be ready on the Monday following- the prisoner was taken on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had taken the article on Saturday night, could he, without unusual care and diligence, have placed it to account before Monday morning? A. He had no permission to take any thing without entering it; his brother had the coat away about the afternoon - the box the silk was in was placed on the counter, at the back part of the stop; the prisoner's box was in the kitchen - every body in the concern might go there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there not time on Saturday afternoon before the brother had the coat away, to enter any thing which he took honestly? A. Of course - this silk was not fit to line a coat; it is a very different kind of article; master allows servants articles at cost price, for their own use, but not to dispose of.</p>

            , JUN. I recollect this garment having been given to the prisoner to make up; I remember the prisoner saying he wanted silk to line it - I do not know what silk was taken; he did not tell me he had taken this silk for Mr. Rumble, and to charge it to the account - he inquired for the silk which is generally used for the handfacings; there being none in the house, I told the brother to get some and charge it to Mr. Rumble's account, which I suppose he was going to do - the coat might be given to the prisoner about ten or eleven o'clock on Saturday night - he was sent on Sunday with a note to master, and returned to the shop; I told him I had a charge against him, and was ordered to detain him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a memorandum found on the prisoner of two yards and a half of silk to be charged to Mr. Rumble? A. One was given to me when the prisoner was going to the office; it had been found on the prisoner when he was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would it require more time to write that in his master's book than on the paper? A. It might not take more time - the prisoner told me on the Saturday before that he was going to have a frock coat for himself, and it would require silk for the facing - that would take the quantity stated here; he had access to the book to make the entry - no cloth was delivered to the prisoner's brother to make a coat for him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was Mr. Rumble's a frock coat or a dress one? A. A dress coat - one-eighth of a yard of silk would be sufficient for it; silk for coat-linings is about 4s. a yard.</p>
               <p>MR. RUMBLE. The coat was only to be faced with silk, not lined; this gros de Naples is worth about 10s. - the prisoner's brother had no access to the premises; Slack, Jun. slept in my house - the order for the coat was given to the prisoner's brother, who came to us in the name of Parker.</p>

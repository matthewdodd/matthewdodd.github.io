                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Charles Walter, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Marylebone. On the 28th of February the prisoner came to the shop, with another person, and immediately the prisoner was gone missed two gowns from inside the shop—I saw them safe a quarter of an hour before—I missed them before the other woman quitted the shop—I stopped the prisoner on Saturday, the 24th of March, at the corner of Marylebone-street, for stealing a pair of our shoes, and on her was found some duplicates, one of which was of this gown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I took the gown out of pledge that day—I pawned it in company with Mrs. Lloyd at Mr. Daniels, and redeemed it from Mr. Grieves—it was my own—I bought it of his master twelve months ago—I was never in the prosecutor's shop that day, nor in company with the woman he names at all. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes, she was with Mrs. Kite, and when she stole the shoes she asked me if Mrs. Kite had been there—I know perfectly well she was the person that was there—she was with Mrs. Kite.</p>

On the 24th of March I saw the prisoner stopped by Spiller, and took a pair of shoes from under her shawl—I took her to the station-house, and asked her name—she said she would not tell me, she would tell the Magistrate—Mrs. Noble searched her, and found twenty-two duplicates—one was of a gown, pledged at Mr. Daniels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Daniels, of Bowling-street, pawnbrokers. I produce a gown, pledged on the 28th of February, by the prisoner in the name of Ann Lloyd, 6, York-court—Mrs. Lloyd was with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I purchased it in his shop twelve months ago last July—I was in his shop on the 20th of March—he said nothing about it—it could be proved by the pawnbroker's tickets and books that it had been pawned two months—I fetched it out that day. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I had seen it safe in the shop that day—it has our mark, and if it had been washed it would have washed out—we lost it at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 28th of February.</p>

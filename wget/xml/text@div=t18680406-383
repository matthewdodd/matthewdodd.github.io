                  </hi>. I live at 15, South Street, Stratford—on 11th March I was with some boys by Angel Lane Bridge, Stratford—Brooks had been fighting with some other boys—they asked me to go and help them fight, and I went along with them to fight Brooks—I did not fight at all, I did not get near enough to him to fight; I was going to—Brooks and the others ran away; I and others ran after him up Weston Street, and when I got about eight yards from him, he turned round, pulled a pistol out of the front of his coat and shot me—I don't know whether any others were running by the side of me or near me at the time; I don't think so—I think I was the nearest of the lot—there were three of his boys along with him—I was struck in the eye and face with something, I ran a few yards and fell into a lot of water—I went to a doctor, and have been in the hospital since—I have suffered great pain—I had seen the prisoner before—I had been friends with him—I never had any quarrel with him.</p>

I am an agent, and live at West Ham—on 5th March, about 8 o'clock, I was passing along Angel Lane, Stratford—I saw the last witness running along, and the prisoner—there were two crowds of boys coming up to the bridge, one party chasing the other—I heard a boy shout out, looked, and saw the prisoner raise his arm, and saw a flash at the end of his arm, and heard a report; and I saw the boy drop down—he called out, "Oh! he has shot me"—the prisoner ran away with the others.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the Lodon hospital—the boy was brought there on the 5th March—he had three wounds in his face, and a wound in the eye, the sight being destroyed by the wound—I took two stones out of the wound in his forehead, one was lost during the operation, but it was exactly like this, which was found in the centre of the eye-ball—I had to take his eye out—the other eye is not at all injured, nor do I think it likely that it will be—he is nearly well—it is more than a week since I have seen him; I think he is quite well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 39, East-street, Red Lion-square, in the parish of St. George the Martyr; I am a tenant of the house, and live in it On Saturday night, 12th Hay, I was sitting in the kitchen between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, and heard something drop in the front parlour—I waited a few minutes and then heard a heavy fall in the back parlour—I took a candle and went up stairs; before I got to the back parlour, a person came out, knocked me down, and made his escape—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the back par<lb></lb>lour open, and found the prisoner there—I collared him, and he knocked the candle out of my hand—we had a severe struggle, and he got away from me when I was just at the parlour door, but I secured him again before he got out of the house—my wife and daughter came to my assistance—I sent for a policeman—a chest of drawers in the back parlour had been thrown down, and the articles stated were in a wrapper, lying on the floor; there weree three or four gowns and petticoats, and a gold watch—I also missed a purse containing 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a canvas bag with two sovereigns in it—the things that were on the floor had been taken out of the drawers—I had left the parlour door locked, and had the key with me in the kitchen—the street door opens with a latch key—I was at that door about a quarter past 9 o'clock, and it was left safe—I had not let any one in after that—the door was shut so that it could not be opened without a key—no one had come in after that, till I heard a noise—I found about half a box of matches strewed on the carpet.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a greengrocer, of 71, St. George's-street. Between two and three o'clock in the night between 7th and 8th March, I was with a friend named Belsham, in Bishopsgate-street—we met two girls, who were strangers to us—we went into a public-house there, and treated them—we parted with them in Bishopsgate-street, between twelve and one; they had been in our company a quarter of an hour, at the most—we saw them again at Aldgate Church, and we went on to the Horse and Leaping-bar, Whitechapel, a night-house; my friend and the girls went in—I heard a disturbance, went in, and the girls asked me to pay for the gin—there were a number of people in the tap-room—I saw both the prisoners there—we remained there half an hour, and me,</p>

               <p>and my friend, and the two girls went into the parlour; Cannell was going in, and the landlord turned him back—I saw the other prisoner in the tap-room, but not at the time they were going into the parlour—the money with which I paid for the gin, I took out of my right-hand trowsers pocket—kept the money in a bag—there were sixty-eight or sixty-nine sovereigns in it—my other money was loose in my right-hand pocket, the bag was in my left—I had about six or seven shillings in my right-hand pocket—when we got into the parlour we sat down, and had a pot of porter, ant some meat and bread—I paid for it—I think we might have remained there about half an hour, or rather better—while we were there, I man in a light coat came in, and then the two prisoners, and another one—I did not produce any gold while I was in the parlour, nor at all while I was in company with the females, to my knowledge—it was about half-past two, as near as possible, when we left the Leaping-bar—my friend and the two girls went out first, and I followed them—I went through Spectacle-alley into Church-lane—Belsham and the two girls went on first, and I turned up John-street, which is in the same line—when I got there I stood for a time, and did not see any person; I turned round Back church-lane to a place called Williams'-rents, to make water—before I turned round, the two girls came up to me, and wanted to catch hold of my arms; I kept them off—they were waiting at the bottom of Williams'-rents, about three yards from me—I felt my pockets while I was there, and my bag was then quite safe—I was in the act of turning round when I saw the two prisoners about three yards from me—they made up to me—Cannell said, "What are you doing here? or "What are you about?—he then caught hold of me by my arms (be was at the back of me), and pressed them against my throat—then I recollect no more—when I came to my senses I found myself lying in the gutter—I have no recollection of being struck—I was bleeding from my note and forehead, under my eye, and at the back of the ear—Coglan was in front of roe, while Cannell was at the back—I did not perceive Coglan do anything more than he was in front of me, when Cannell seized bold of me—I examined my pockets immediately I got up, and both my trowsers pockets were turned inside out, and the money gone—I was confined to my bed till the following Monday, and then Kelly, the constable, came to me.</p>

I told her, I was for no Drams; but if she'd drink a Pot of Beer, well and good. So she went across the Way, and sat at an Ale-house Door; and when we were drinking there, a Soldier comes among with a Puppy in his Hand, and asked if I would buy it. I bid him a Shilling, but he would not take it; and so when I had paid for the Beer, I went away, and left her at the Door; but I had not gone far, before I met an old Friend, and he and I went back again to this Alehouse, where in a little Time, the Soldier and this Woman came in to us. The Soldier asked whether I'd have the Puppy or no, and so I took out Money to pay him, which I laid upon the Table, there was a half Guinea, a Shilling, a Six-Pence, and three Fathings. Prisoner presently clapt her Hand upon it, and took it up. What do ye mean by that, says I. D - ye for a Son of a Bitch, says me, I have got none of your Money, and it I had, what then? But by the bye, she gave me the Shilling and Six-pence gain, and swore that that was all that she took up.</p>

               <p>What time was your house attacked? - After six o'clock on Tuesday night the 6th of June.</p>

               <p>How long was it before it was destroyed? - I cannot tell, I was obliged to go off; they threatened to use me ill. They took my books from me and knocked me down. I went away about half after ten o'clock. I saw my house again about half an hour after that; then the front of the house and the windows were broke out, and they were throwing out the goods. Randall looked me full in the face. I said to my son that man marks me, let us get out of the way. The next morning I saw that the front of the house and the parapet wall was all down.</p>
               <p>Who gave you an information of the prisoner? - One Collan, and in consequence of his information he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>On what day was he taken up? - I cannot say; I did not make any remark of the day. I went to his master, the prisoner was coming out with some meat; I said he must go with me. I took him to Collan, and asked him if he was the man.</p>
               <p>He went voluntarily? - Yes, he did, and he went voluntarily to the justice's.</p>

                  </hi>. I went by an omnibus from Whitechapel church last Monday—I was set down at the corner of New Bond-street—the prisoner was the conductor of the omnibus, and stood behind it; when I got out to pay, I took my purse out of my pocket—I had to pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had a few shillings and four sovereigns in my purse—the four soveregns were wrap<lb></lb>ped</p>

               <p>in paper in my bead purse, with the silver—It had a clasp to it—the money was all together—the sovreigus were in paper by themselves—I did not miss them till I got a few doors down—I then thought to myself whether the sovereigns might have dropped out of my purse in getting out—I looked, and they were gone—I went back to the omnibus, and found it stopping at a public-house—Iasked the prisoner if he had picked up four sovereigns—he said, "No"—I saw Robert James, who had seen me get out; and I asked him if he had picked them up—he said he saw the conductor pick them up, and run into a public-house—the pri<lb></lb>soner was taken into custody, and I went into the public-house the omni<lb></lb>bus had stopped at; and behind a pillar there, I found three sovercigns, one above the other, not in paper—the policeman took them—how they got there I cannot tell.</p>

On the 22d of March (Easter Sunday), I and my husband were returning from Finchley in a one-horse chaise; about seven o'clock in the evening we were stopped in <placeName id="t18180506-19-crimeloc105">the New Cut, by the Highgate-archway</placeName>

We were stopped by two men, but I did not see them until they had hold of the horse - I had an umbrella before me which prevented my seeing their faces then; they said, "Stop! your money or your brains, in a moment." They repeated this twice. I got up and gave them what money I had, which was about ten shillings-part of it was in shillings; they did not ask me for mine, but I got up and gave it to them. My husband gave what he had. The man who was at the head of the horse said,"Your watch! your watch! or your brains, in a moment." He held his hat for it, and my husband put his watch into it. They then turned the horse round, and desired us to go back the other road, or they would blow our brains out immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see either of them, so as to know them again - A. I noticed the man who stood at the horse's head the most. The prisoner, Miller, is the man; I have no doubt whatever of it. It was between dark and light, the moon was not up. He stood on the London side of me - I was on the left side of the chaise. I forgot to mention, that when they turned the horse round, one got on one side and the other on the other, and turned my husband's pockets out; I then had a better opportunity of seeing the man who was on my side. I saw him again a fortnight afterwards at Hatton-garden. My husband had seen them before me.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. On the 22d of March I was coming home - I was not at all in liquor - I had been spending the Sunday at Finchley, and was stopped on the highway, as my wife has described. The men were full three minutes at the chaise</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you, during that time, an opportunity of seeing the face of either of them - A. I did not see the man at the horse's head-there was no light to assist my seeing them. I saw the other man - He held a pistol to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060010"></xptr>head, and spoke repeatedly to me. I gave a description of him at Bow-street the next day. I was on the right side of the chaise; he was on that side, either on the step or the wheel-his face was rather towards London. I saw him again on the 17th of April, in custody with two other men at Hatton-garden. Hearing there were two men in custody, I went there to see if I could identify either of the men who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say whether either of the prisoners is one of them - A. Fernandi is the man who was by my side; I dropped my watch into his hat. I have not the least doubt of his being the man. He spoke rather thick while he was in custody-his voice corresponded exactly.</p>

               <p>COURT. If you have any doubt say so - A. I have not the least.</p>
               <p>FERNANDI. Q. Did you not say, when the officer brought me out, that I held the horse's head - A. No. It was seven o'clock; I did not tell the magistrate it was nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards said I stepped up to the chaise, and the other man held the horse, and that you called to the men, and said, "If you are honourable you should return the watch" - A. No; when the men turned the chaise round, I looked back and said, "If you behave honourably, and bring the watch back to me to-morrow, I will give you the value of it," and told the magistrate so. I gave you my name and address when you robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men stopped you - A. Two jumped out of the lane. I did not say there was another man behind the chaise.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you give him first - A. Three shillings. The man then stepped off the chaise. The man at the horse's head then called out, "His watch!" The same man then came to me again, and I put my watch into his hat, they then stepped off. I said, "I may go now" - They called out, "No, no; you must turn round." They turned me round, and then the same man jumped up on my side, and rifled my pockets-the other man got up on the other side. Miller is about the size of the other man. I can neither say that he is or is not the man; he is very much like him in every respect. I never found my watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information of the robbery, and took Miller. He came to the office and said he was a witness for some men who were in custody for stealing lead. I turned him out of the office. It then struck me that he answered the description I had received, and took him into custody. Fernandi was one of the men I saw him talking with.</p>
               <p>FERNANDI'S Defence. Is it possible that two or three highwayman, after robbing the prosecutrix, would stand bargaining about the watch? He says they were not with him above two or three minutes-it must have taken five minutes. I declare to God I am innocent; he would swear to anybody. He said I stopped the horse, and the other man robbed him-who is to believe their stories? Limbrick persuaded the prosecutor and prosecutrix to swear we were the men, right or wrong, at the office. Read noticed it, and blamed him for it.</p>
               <p>MILLER'S Defence. I went to the office to see a man. Limbrick turned me out; he then said I was a highwayman. Read said he was sorry for us, as Limbrick had persuaded them to swear to us, right or wrong.</p>

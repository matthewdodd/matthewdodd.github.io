            . I live at Sheerness; my husband is a labourer; I was present at the prisoner's marriage at Queenborough, on the 25th of November, 1830, with Mrs. Sarah Dunn, a widow; I witnessed it, and am quite sure the prisoner is the man; he was something in the Ordnance; Mrs. Dunn is here now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what became of Mrs. Dunn, after the marriage? A. No; I never saw her at Sheerness; I never knew the prisoner nor her till they came to be married; my father was then clerk of the parish, and the prisoner asked me to be bridesmaid; I was frequently called on to officiate in that way at that time, and if people asked me civilly, I had no objection; but I will not do it any more.</p>

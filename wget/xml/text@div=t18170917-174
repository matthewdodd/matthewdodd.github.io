            . I am a watchman of Holborn, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a bustle, near the top of Shoe-lane; the prosecutor came towards me, saying, he had been robbed of his watch, and the woman had escaped, leaving her cap and bonnet in his hand; I knew the bonnet to belong to the prisoner; I went in search of her but could not find her; I placed myself so as to see all over my beat, and about half-past one o'clock, I heard somebody coming down Robinhood-court, I concealed myself in a door-way, the prisoner advanced to the end of the court, she looked both right and left and went into Shoe-lane; I ran to lay hold of her and as I came up I saw her pull a watch from her pocket, and heard the seal and key rattle against the case; I seized her, and told her to give me what she had in her hand, she screamed out,"Murder," and made a great resistance - She broke my lanthorn - I caught at the watch, she shifted it from one hand to the other, put her two hands behind her, sat down on the ground and dropped it - I caught it as it fell, by the step of a door - She did not know that I had got it - I took her to the watchhouse, she had neither cap or bonnet on, I gave them to her at the watchhouse, she said they were her's - She put them on, and appeared before the alderman on the next day in them. The prosecutor was sober.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the man very drunk, he took me up a court and gave me the watch, he threw me down, I got away with the loss of my cap and bonnet, when I recovered myself I found I had got the watch and went back to the prosecutor to give it to him, and they took me.</p>

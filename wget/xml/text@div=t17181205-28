             deposed that the Prisoner came to the Prosecutors Shop saying she came from one Mr. Bateman in St. Paul's Church-Yard, desiring them to send some Black Mantua-Silk thither by one of their Servants; this was confirmed by two other Persons who were in the Shop and belong'd to the Prosecutor, who swore positively the Prisoner was the same Woman. The Evidence farther deposed, that she carried the Piece of Mantua-Silk, and that the Prisoner went into Mr.Bateman's and having spoke with somebody there, came out and told her the Gentlewoman was gone a little farther, and she must go with her to <placeName id="t17181205-28-crimeloc160">Wardrobe-Court</placeName>

Mr. Risden deposed, that he being informed of the matter, went to make enquiry after the Prisoner, and (supposing she might take Water) was informed by a Waterman that he had at that time ply'd such a Person, who was gone over the Water, and afterwards gave him an account of her and she was apprehended. The Waterman was positive that she was the Woman that he ply'd on the 7th of October about 3 or 4 in the Afternoon. The Prisoner in her Defence denied that she ever was in, or knew, the Prosecutor's Shop, or any of the Evidences that had swore against her; and said that she was not out of her Lodging all the Day that the Fact was laid in the Indictment to have been committed; and to prove it call'd several Evidences. Her Landlord depos'd that he went out at 10 a Clock the 7th of October, left her at home, came home again about one or two and found her there, went out again some time after and staid but a little while, and returning again found her at home. Her Landlady deposed that her Mother had come to see her and an Unkle, who being an Apothecary, and she not being well, told her she must take some Physick, which he accordingly sent her on the 9th; that she was not out all Day the 7th of October. Her Maid deposed that she was not out from her own House from the 4th to the 10th of October. Upon the whole the Jury <rs id="t17181205-28-verdict161" type="verdictDescription">

I changed a fifteen-pound note in the afternoon; I had four one-pound notes in change in my pocket-book; I was certain of it, because my pocket-book was never out of my pocket until I found it in her bosom in her room. She told me to lie down in the bed while she went down to get a light, and when she was gone for the light, I missed my pocket-book; when she came up with the light I asked her for my pocket-book; she took the pocket-book out of her bosom, she threw it of one side of the room; I took the pocket-book up, and looked for my notes; they were gone. I have never found the notes since. I took her down stairs, called the watch, and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in her company before - A. Yes; former voyages. I never had any dispute with her before about money, as I had this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was an old acquaintance of yours; you used to visit her when you came on shore. Are you sure you did not give her this pocket-book to keep for you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He told me I had robbed him of four one-pound notes, that he had in change for a five-pound note of Mrs. Miles. I went with him to Mrs. Miles; she had no knowledge of him; she said, it was his companion that she gave change; not to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your warehouse door in the house - A. It is part of the dwelling-house, the first floor. The warehouse door is an inner door in the house, up one pair of stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got up did you find the warehouse had been robbed - A. Yes. We lost three hundred pieces of bandana handkerchiefs, twenty-five pieces of figured sarsenet, five pieces of gauzenet, and three pieces of silver tissue; altogether of the value of above a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>HYAM ISAACS. I live at No. 50, Cable-street, Wellclose-square. I am a tailor, salesman, and slop-seller. On Monday the 21st of March, Lion Levi (the old one) came to me; he asked me whether I would buy any silk handkerchiefs; he said he had not got them with him, if I would go to his house he would shew me them. I went with him directly. His house is in Guildford-street, Petticoat-lane; it is something of a chandler's shop. He took me into his back parlour, and shewed me four pieces of the handkerchiefs; he asked me five shillings a handkerchief; he told me he had got more, handsomer than them. I asked him to shew them me; he said if I would go with him he would shew them me. I went with him to Baker's-row, Whitechapel, to Harris's house; Harris was at home. He took me into a little bed-room backwards; there stood a deal box full of handkerchiefs, bandana, chocolate, and blue. I told him I could not see them in that room, to shew them me in a room more light. Levi told me to go up stairs. I went, and when I got up stairs, Mr. and Mrs. Harris brought the box up stairs together. They put the handkerchiefs on the bed. He asked five shillings a handkerchief; there is seven in a piece; that is thirty-five shillings a piece. I offered him thirty shillings; he would not take the money, and I went away. I went home to my house again. Soon after, he returned to my house; he brought me a pattern of silver tissue; he then said, look at that, that is much handsomer than you have seen before; and he brought me some patterns of sarsenet with flowers in it; be asked me four shillings a yard for the silver tissue, I gave him three shillings; and I dealt with him for the sarsenet. He asked me three shillings a yard for the sarsenet; I offered him half-a-crown; he took it; I bought the sarsenets; I agreed with him at my house. Then he told me he would let me have the handkerchiefs at thirty shillings if I would call and take them away. He went away, and told me to come directly. About an hour after, I went to Harris's house; I found him there. I took my son and daughter with me. When I got to Harris's house I went up stairs; Mr. Levi was measuring the sarsenets and putting the handkerchiefs together. There were there besides him, all three of them. There was Lion Levi, his son, (Harris was not up stairs, he was in the house), Thrustton was there. Trustton is a partner to Levi, as I understand, to Lion Levi. Mr. Levi tied up some handkerchiefs in my bundle handkerchief; he counted them one by one, and tied them up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bundles were there made - A. Three at a time; one for me, one for my son, and one for my daughter, and we were to come back again each of us. Each of us went again a second time; that made six bundles. There were several pieces of handkerchiefs that I objected to, and likewise sarsenetts; I left them behind. Lyon Levi told his son to fetch some more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out for them - A. They went out of of the room and talked; I did not hear what they said. His son went and brought them in in a basket. The room door was shut; I cannot say where he brought them from.</p>
               <p>Q. When the son brought the second parcel, who came with him - A. The son came first; Trustton brought some more. We went altogether three times; we made three trips, and carried goods home three times each of us.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had done, how did you settle accompts - A. Then it was almost night, and I was tired, it being a distance off our house, we went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060022"></xptr>home, and between eight and nine in the evening Lyon Levi and Trustton came to my house together in the evening; they had each of them a piece of paper, and the accompt was put down, and I took an accompt likewise. The goods amounted altogether, what I purchased, to one hundred and sixty-seven pounds. Trustton cast up the accompt. One hundred and one pounds five shillings I paid in money that same night; I paid it to Trustton; he gave it to Levi; they were close by, sitting together at one table. Truston handed the money over to Levi; that left a balance of sixty-five pounds fifteen shillings, which I put in my book. I have got it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the goods which were afterwards found at your house by the officers - A. Yes; the goods that were taken away by the officers are the very goods that I bought of them.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had bought this did either Levi or Trustton call again - A. About a day or two after Mr. Levi called at my house, and shewed me three or four pieces of sarsenet, a pink, a laylock, and a green shot with white. I bought no more of them. He told me he had some more handkerchiefs, about forty or fifty pieces more. He did not call after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the officers come to your house and find these things - A. On Thursday the 7th of April, the day before Good Friday. They found these things in my house; they found some in the shop, and some in the parlour, and I was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any questions the officers put to you did you give any information against the prisoners now at the bar - A. I did, almost the same minute I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information you gave, did you send your son by the officers direction any where - A. Yes, I sent my son to Levi's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you mean to describe to the jury that these things were all found in your shop and parlour, and that none of them were concealed - A. Yes, none as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not any part of them found behind a picture - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect it. I perceive you are alarmed - A. No, I am not alarmed. There was none found behind a picture; they were in the very same bundles; they were all laying in the parlour; they were in a cupboard; that cupboard door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any hole behind the picture - A. I do not know, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear there is no hole behind the picture - A. There is not; they were found in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up in April, were not you - A. Yes, on the 7th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the same story at the Mansion House that you have to day - A. No, and the reason why, I was not asked.</p>

I, my sister, and my father, took each of us a bundle of things home. We went three or four times. The things that we took home were silk handkerchiefs and sarsenets.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go there slow or fast - A. I went fast; he asked me why I ran so fast, and why I sweated so, I told him my father wanted him; he said he would come directly; I was to go on. I went on towards Harris's, and when I got to Harris's house I found the officers stationed there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Levi come to you there - A. No, he sent his son,

               <p>Q. Do you remember Levi being at your father's house on Monday the 21st of March - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Levi had been with your father, did you, with your brother and your father, go to Harris's house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find going on there - A. I saw some silk handkerchiefs, sarsenets, and silver tissue there, in a white deal box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there - A. Mr. Levi was the only person I saw first; afterwards I saw Mrs. Harris, Trustton, and Samuel Levi. I assisted my father in carrying the goods home.</p>

            . I am a city constable.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 7th of April, did you go to the house of Hyam Isaacs - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find there any goods which were claimed by Mr. Stevenson - A. I did, ninety-three pieces of Bandana and seven pieces of silk. (some of them had been cut), and three pieces of tissue; three pieces Brown found in the shop; the rest we found in the cupboard in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any picture with a hole behind it - A. Yes, that was at the top of the cupboard, in the parlour; that had been fastened up. Brown opened it. There was a picture hung before it; behind was a loose board. The picture was bigger than the board, so that the picture would prevent our seeing the entrance to the cupboard. It was a corner cupboard; the upper part was boarded up. I produce three pieces of handkerchiefs; the rest have been returned to Mr. Stevenson. When the picture was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060023"></xptr>removed the concealed part was easily seen. These three pieces are bandana handkerchiefs.</p>

            Upon your taking Isaacs, did Isaacs give you information of whom he got them - A. He said he bought them of the three prisoners at the bar, with Harris; he said if I would go with him he would shew me where he had them. I remained with him in the coach, and Brown and Freeman, by his information, went to Harris's house. Afterwards, there was a plan; it did not succeed. They sent young Isaacs to Levi's house.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I went to Isaacs' with Freeman and Branscomb; we found the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Isaacs offer to give information where he had them - A. He did. In consequence of his information we sent young Isaacs to Levi's house, to tell Levi to come to Harris.

               <p>Lion Levi's Defence. May it please your lordship - Gentlemen of the jury, I am standing in your presence accused of a charge, if found guilty must affect my life. I trust you will attend to the following circumstance: the man, Isaacs is a well known character for receiving stolen goods; he also keeps a house of ill fame. He has been charged with the offence, he being in possession of some of the property. He first said he bought them of a smuggler, and now he says he had them of me; and to confirm his testimony his son and daughter are the only witnesses called: they, like the father, are bad characters: the son acts in the receiving business, while the daughter conducts a common brothel. I trust with caution you receive their evidence. Gentlemen of the jury,

             was not charged with any share in the transaction. When he was seen before the Lord Mayor as my witness, Isaacs was present; he laid nothing to his charge; and the son and daughter, I humbly presume, came to save the father. I therefore most humbly rely on your lordship's humanity, that the doubtful testimony and character of Isaacs, who was acquitted of the misdemeanor this day, together with the bad character of the son and daughter, will operate in my favour, and in the favour of the other prisoners at the bar.</p>

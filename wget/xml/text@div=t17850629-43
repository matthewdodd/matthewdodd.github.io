            </rs>.</p>
               <p>- NICHOLSON sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Sheldon came in first, and not two minutes after the other prisoner followed her, I thought they did not belong to each other, Sheldon asked to look at some handkerchiefs, I took down considerable quantities , I do not know how many; the other came in before I shewed her the handkerchiefs, and sat down about two yards from Sheldon, close to the wall, where three or four whole pieces of cotton lay; Sheldon was difficult in being pleased with the handkerchiefs, it was some time before we could agree, and I was obliged to attend some other customers that wanted flannel, when I came back, I sold her two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop with you? - Only Mrs. Gibson, at that time, in the course of selling the handkerchiefs the two prisoners talked to each other, and became acquainted, which I was rather surprised at, and she asked to look at some muslin for a cap border, I shewed her some, I counted the quantity as I laid them down by her, there were eight quantities, she seemed very difficult, and we parted, she only wanted one-eighth of a yard, and when they were going out, I counted the quantities of muslin and there were only seven, the little one called the other Mrs. Cooke, and they talked as knowing one another, they went to the door together, and the little one Williams went out first, and made off as fast as she could, the other followed her, but as she was going out I missed the muslin; I says to Mrs. Gibson, you must take care Madam, these people have stole a piece of muslin, and I went after her to the next door and stopped her, and took her into that shop, I told them to take care of her till I came back; I overtook the other about fifty yards off, she was going through a passage, and making off as fast as she could, I brought her back, as soon as ever I brought Williams in, she dropped a piece of cotton below her cloak, she stooped down against some glass and things in the shop, and dropped it, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>What did you find under her cloak where she dropped it? - It was my cotton, it was my mark upon it, the officer was sent for, and the book muslin was found inside Williams's petticoat at the upper part; upon the other prisoner there were two parcels of handkerchiefs, those I found in Mr. Holmes's shop close by her; they begged for mercy, and acknowledged themselves guilty, there was no promise of favour, I am very sure of that.</p>
               <p>Did you see them take any thing? - No, I did not know or perceive that they had taken anything.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you never said, that you saw them take anything? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did you never say that you had laid a trap for them and had caught them? - No, the reason I had to take them, I missed the piece of muslin by the number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is a charge against the prisoners for stealing all these things; It has been held over and over again that two persons cannot do this , in the first place the prisoner Williams is proved by this witness to be in a situation where she might steal cotton, the other where she could muslin, neither of them in situations where they could steal the others.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you mention any circumstance where it has been so held; as to your first objection, I am at the same time aware that there have been cases where two persons have been guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. In stealing from the person, but not the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Nicholson. Recollect and tell us, whether the next morning after the loss of these goods, you did not say you had observed these things taken, but you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290051"></xptr> was advised not to say so, that it might be a capital offence? - No, Sir, I am sure I did not.</p>

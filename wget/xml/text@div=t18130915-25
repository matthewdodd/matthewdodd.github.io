               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it - A. It might be between the hours of six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room when you went first - A. Nobody but Mrs. Denton and her daughter; her husband was dead; she was a <rs id="t18130915-25-viclabel143" type="occupation">widow</rs>

               <p>Q. While you, and Mrs. Denton, and her daughter was in the room did the prisoner come into the room - A. He came into the room about seven o'clock. When he came into the room his right hand was in the breast of his waistcoat, and a bottle of liquor in the other hand. He sat the bottle upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sit down - A. I did not observe him sit down; I sat by the fire place; I am rather deaf; I could not hear what was said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Denton give you any gin - A. We had a friend come in before the prisoner came in she drank some and I drank some.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place between the prisoner and Mrs. Denton - A. There might be, if there was I did not hear it. Mrs. Denton was in the corner against the clock; I saw the prisoner look very stedfast at her, and then he rushed against her; she screamed, and the blood flew into the corner; I saw the knife when his hand drew from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it bloody - A. I did not take notice. The woman ran out directly screaming, the daughter took hold of her: I jumped up instantly and catched hold of the prisoner by the wrist; I said for God Almighty sake, Denton, what have you been doing; he made no answer; I made my escape out of the house, and left him in the house; he was shortly after secured. I ran to Mrs. Denton at the top of the lane, about forty-yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live after this - A. Until the 13th of July. She died in her own house.</p>

               <p>Q. This was Bow fair time this affray happened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The mother and daughter lived together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Denton came in he had some liquor in his hand - A. Yes; he did not offer it to any one, he sat it on the table.</p>

               <p>Q. They had become very much acquainted - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 13th of June, in the morning, had your mother expressed any displeasure to him - A. Not as I know of; he was there in the morning, he went away, and come again in the evening, then Mr. Puddiford was there; he came with a bottle in his hand, he offered the bottle to my mother when he came down again; she refused taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mother give Puddiford any - A. Yes, I brought in a quartern of gin, my mother gave Puddiford a glass. When the prisoner came in he said something to my mother; the words I cannot repeat. My mother told him to go out of her house, for he was a disgrace to his sex, while my mother was winding up the clock. He said, what am I, a disgrace? My mother said, yes, you are. As soon as she said that he ran up to her. I did not perceive the knife until I saw him draw it out of her arm. Then my mother ran to the top of the alley. I held Denton by the right hand while he had the knife in his right hand. He shifted the knife into his left hand. My mother ran to the neighbours for assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your mother live - A. A month, sir. On that day month she died.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had been there the fore part of the day, and there was some difference - A. Yes; he struck a woman of the name of Whitehead; my mother went up to him and told him he ought to be ashamed of striking a woman; then he turned round and hit my mother, I believe on her arm. She desired him to go away. Mrs. Whitehead came into the room; he followed her home. My mother told him not to strike a woman, and told him to go away.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I attended the unfortunate woman until the time of her death. The wound in her arm was about two inches in length, and four inches in depth; it was inflicted by a sharp instrument; it had nearly divided the arteries; that was the occasion of a great effusion of blood; she died of a mortification from that wound and the great loss of blood from the part. In consequence of the disease of the part I attended her until the time of her death; the wound in the side was not the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Q. Another person was called in before you - A. Yes, there was; I found the prisoner laying in the front room, with a wound on the left side, it was only a superficial wound. I went to the deceased, I found her in an exhausted state, it must be a period, from my seeing her from the time of the accident. It was the principal artery that nourished the arm; I never knew that artery to be wounded in a less degree but what it was fatal.</p>

            . I was ships corporal on board the Royal George. While the prisoner was on board his character was very good, only at certain times he was taken with a lightness in his head; the cause was he fell down the main hatchway, and got his scull fractured; that caused him to be wild and mad; once he jumped over board off the gangway; the captain put him in irons; on the next day he had him brought up and was going to flog him, he found out he was in this state, he gave him his liberty; he then cautioned the ship's company never to agitate him any more; he was reckoned a good man in the ship as could be, only when these freaks took him. I and he, and the whole ship's company were discharged together; he was discharged twelve years ago; about four years after I saw him he was much the same, and looked wild in his eyes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did he talk rational - A. Yes, he did.</p>

            . I am sister to the prisoner. Since he has been discharged from the Navy he has resided with me; I am a married woman; I live in Bow-lane-buildings. He has frequently been outrageous; I have not been able to live in the house with him; I have been obliged to hide the knives out of his way. He was particularly so at the time of the full moon; he was light headed and mad frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day this affair happened between him and Mrs. Denton - A. Yes, that morning he came in and struck me with his hand more than once; Mrs. Whitehead was there at the time, Mrs. Whitehead bid him beat me more until I gave him some money; he struck her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know on what terms he lived with the deceased before this affair happened - A. He was particularly fond of her; she has frequently fetched him out of my house to go home to sleep with her; he was so fond of her that he did not follow his employ after he got in liege with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his employment - A. He worked in the East India Docks as a labourer, and sometimes at rigging. I saw the deceased after this accident; I was with her ten minutes before she died; she did not speak to me. On the Thursday before I had some conversation with her, she did not at that time think she should die. On the 26th of December I went to market a little way from our house, I was not gone above twenty minutes from the house; when I came back he was suspended to the bed by an apron of mine; he had slit it down; it was tied round his neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he suffered to walk about - A. Yes, and he had his wages; he gave me his money, and I laid it out for him. I never consulted any medical man upon him. I had it not in my power.</p>

            . I am a shipwright; I live in Cottage-street, No. 8. I have known the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150022"></xptr>about six months; I never saw any thing of him but a peaceful man. On Sunday I saw him near the East India gate with a quart pot in his hand; it was near twelve o'clock in the day I was making towards him to speak to him; he was looking in the quart pot, he dropped it down, he looked up at the sky, and away he ran.</p>

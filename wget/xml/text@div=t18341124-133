On the 17th of June, the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, came and said he was recommended to me by Mr. Raphael, my landlord, who understood I had some jobs to do—the prisoner said he was a tailor, that his name was Thomas, and he lived in Cloth-fair—I asked if he was a housekeeper—he said he was, and had been for years—I showed him my coat, and told him the alteration I wanted at the collar, and he said he would do it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I laid the coat across a chair, while I went to Mr. Raphael's to inquire about the prisoner—Mr. Raphael was not at home—when I re<lb></lb>turned, the prisoner and my coat were gone—I afterwards heard that the pri<lb></lb>soner was seen wearing my coat at Knightsbridge—I went there, but could</p>

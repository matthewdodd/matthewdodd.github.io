                  </hi>. I am a dealer in metal, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Middlesex-street, Aldgate. I have had dealings with the prisoner, and he owed me a little money—he produced a bill of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to me, and asked me if I would let him have the money for it—this is it—it purports to be drawn by the prisoner—I know his writing; the signature and indorsement are his writing—I told him he owed me money, and I would not do anything of the kind—he said, "Sup<lb></lb>pose I get you a good indorser?" and asked me whether I would take Mr. Layell's—I asked him who Mr. Layell was—he told me he kept a public-house in Aldgate, nearly opposite Church-row—I knew the house, but did not know him personally; he took the bill away, as he said, to get Mr. Lay ell's indorsement—he came back in a quarter of an hour with the bill as it is now, with Mr. Lay ell's indorsement on it—I took it, and let him have the money—when the bill was due, it was neither paid by the acceptor or the indorser—I presented it myself at Barclay and Co.'s, the bankers, where the acceptor made it payable—he brought me the person whom he represented to be the acceptor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 71, Aldgate, nearly opposite Church-row. I know the prisoner—he came to me on a Tuesday, about 19th April—I was at the bar, very busy—the prisoner opened the door, and came in to me—he said, "Old fellow," or "Old <hi rend="italic">chap,</hi> I want you to put your name to this bill"—it was a bill for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., like this one—I think he was sober—he was very much excited—he said he was in a great deal of trouble—I said I had never done such a thing; I would sooner lend him the money, if I had got it—I went to the bar, and be came to the front of the bar, and asked if I would do it—I said no, and he went away—the indorsement on this bill is not my writing—I did not give anybody authority to sign it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four or five years. He has used my house six or seven months—he was coach<lb></lb>man to Mr. Nelson—I have found him a honest man—he appeared excited about an accident that he had had, smashing a brougham, and he had to pay some damage, and was afraid of losing his situation; that was what he stated—he seemed much excited, and behaved rather absurdly—I do not remember his saying, "If you won't put it yourself, will you let me do it?"—I was very busy; he might have misunderstood me—I said nothing that might lead him to think so—I said, "No!"—I was at the engine, he was in front of the bar—I had not helped him before in business; he had come as a customer—I had been on friendly terms with him—I rode with him two or three times—I have occasionally had a glass with him when I have been out, and have sat with him in my own parlour, and smoked a cigar—I was very sorry about his accident, and would have assisted him, if I could—I told him so.</p>

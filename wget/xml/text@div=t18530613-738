                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prisoner escaped from my care at Northampton, on 11th May last, and it is my opinion that he is a confirmed lunatic—he does not know the distinction between truth and falsehood, or between right and wrong; he would to-morrow, if he were discharged, commit the same offence again—I do not think he is in a state of mind to make his defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Newgate. My attention was called to the prisoner by receiving a letter from Dr. Nesbitt—he has only been under my care two or three days; I had a long examination of him yesterday with Dr. Nesbitt—I cannot say that he does not know right from wrong, but as regards what he did previously, he said he was quite sure I should have done the same thing under the same circumstances; but when I asked him if he knew he had no right to steal the horse he said, "Why do you ask me such a foolish question?"—although he reasons acutely on some points, I consider he ought not to be called upon to plead.</p>

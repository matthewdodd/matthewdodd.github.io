               <p>Q. Did any body else lodge with you. - A. Ashmore lay with me that night; I got up between seven and eight in the morning, I had thirty-six guineas in my waistcoat pocket in a purse, and three guineas in my pocket pinned over it; I saw the money all safe in the morning, when I got up, I put two of the guineas to the thirty-six, and one I kept in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see you put them in. - A. I shewed him the two, I am not sure that he saw the whole after that I went down stairs, I treated Ashmore with a glass of spirits, and paid my way with Mr. Field; a man was sent for who wrote me a petition, after that we had some more drink, and with my being weak, having just come out of the hospital, the liquor had effect on me; this Ashmore took me up stairs that I might have a sleep, I was put on the bed; after a bit I felt at my pocket, I said I am robbed; Ashmore was then sitting at the foot of the bed, Ashmore said you had but two guineas, I said I had more than that, and I think it is you that robbed me, because I have been in no man's company only yours, and the man that wrote me the petition this morning; I said let me have my money again and I'll give you half a guinea, he said he knew nothing about the money; I went down stairs, told Mr. Field that I was robbed of thirty-eight guineas, Mr. Field came up stairs, with Mack his waiter, and a foreigner, the prisoner was sitting at the foot of the bed then; as soon as they began searching him there was six of the guineas found under him, where he sat on the bed, there were twenty two guineas found on the left side of the bed, by the wall, in the purse, and there was four guineas found in the prisoner's right shoe; there was six guineas wanting, I had thirty-eight.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD sworn. Q. You keep the public house, do you. A. Yes, the Earl of Howard's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I have known the prisoner some years. Ashmore, came to me and said he was broken down and he would be glad if I would give him a night's lodging; I gave him one, the prisoner and the prosecutor both went up to bed together, I did not know they slept together till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect their coming down. - A. Ashmore came down first, for a pot of beer, he said it was for the man that was robbed. I sent the pot of beer up, then Holmes came down about a quarter of an hour afterwards and changed a guinea, they had two or three glasses together, the prosecutor then begun talking why he should not have the augmentation as well as the other soldiers, he sent for a sergeant to write the petition, the sergeant said if he wrote it he was not fit to go before the officer to get it signed; he went up to lay down, in about twenty minutes afterwards, Holmes came down and told me that he was robbed of thirty-eight guineas; I called my man Mack, I says come up stairs, we all went up, and another man a German; I found Ashmore sitting on the bed, I said to Holmes are you sure that you had this money, he said he had, I said I shall search you first; I searched him, he had nothing, I said to Ashmore I must search you, there has nobody been in the room but yourselves; I am certain had two guineas, he had three yesterday. I changed him one; when Ashmore got up, we found six guineas under him, Mack found twenty-two between the bed and the wall, I made him pull off his shoes, and there was four guineas in one of them. I cannot say whether right or left, we researched the room, and the bed, and every thing, but we could not find the other six guineas. The prisoner said a guinea and a half of the money found in his shoes was his.</p>
               <p>- MACK sworn. Q. We understand you was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170062"></xptr>waiter there, you have heard the account Mr. Field gave - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the money was found. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found in the way he has related. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said that the money did not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not hear him say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lodged in Mr. Field's house that night, and the next morning we had three glasses of rum at his bar; afterwards he went in with an old college man to get a petition wrote, he could not stop with the man, he was getting too much in liquor, I was in liquor too, we both laid down on the bed, in a short time this man got up and was counting his money, he laid down again, after that he bounced up and says I am robbed, I got up and put my shoes on my feet, he goes down stairs and calls out to the landlord, the landlord came up with a Dutchman, and the waiter with him; the four guineas fell in my shoes, he was so drunk he reeled against the wall, and I would not move for fear he should think I had got the money.</p>

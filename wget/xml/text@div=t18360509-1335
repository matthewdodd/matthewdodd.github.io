                  </hi>. I am the widow of Dr. Abraham Lamert, who carried on business at No. 10, Church-street, Spitalfields. He was a patent medicine vender—the prisoner came into his employ about four years since—he was clerk and assistant—he was authorized to receive money for medicines that were sold, and to make proper entries of them in the book—there was a day-book kept to enter money received from customers for goods sent out, or medicines sold—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">looking</hi> at one)in which I have always seen the accounts entered—my husband died on the 4th of March, 18936—on the 19th of May. 1835, I left London, and joined him in Dublin, and continued with him until his death—I am his administratrix—the prisoner has not accounted to me, independently of the day book, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received from Zaccheus Hunter, on the 9th of July, 1835; nor for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Alfred Willoughby, on the 22nd of August, 1835—he has never accounted for or paid me the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received on the 19th of October, from Mr. James Knight—two days before my husband's death I authorized my son, Joseph Lamert to obtain the prisoner's account from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This is the book in which the accounts were kept, and in which you have always seen the accounts entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the book that was given to me by my son since I returned home—it it the book that was taken from the prisoner when I authorized my son to take the books from him—it is the book I was to have had the accounts kept in, after my departure from London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your first answer a true one, that this is the book in which you have always seen the accounts entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the book that was given to the prisoner to keep his accounts in after my departure—I might certainly have said that I saw it—that book was given to keep accounts in after my departure from London—I could not swear that I saw accounts entered in it, because it was given to keep the accounts in after I left London—I could have no motive in swearing it—there has been and examination before the Court of Bankruptcy with respect to my husband's effects, and the prisoner was examined as a witnesses—My husband became a bankrupt in November 1834—I remember after Gore's giving his evi<lb></lb>dence his being sent with a messenger to take possession of some secreted goods, of which he had made a discovery—they were my son's—this might have been a fortnight or three weeks before he was apprehended—I think it was as long as that—after Gore's evidence there was a write for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. issued against my son Samual, at the instance of the assignees—I saw Samuel a fortnight ago—he is travelling—I do not know where he is—he set out after Gore's evidence—I do not know any thing about the writ—I have heard of it—he set out after the information I had about the writ—I got this book from my son, Joseph Lamert—I put the greatest confidence in my sons, both before and after mu husband's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, with respect to those sons, did you not invoke your vengeance, and God Almighty's vengeance upon their heads? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that I have—I cannot swear that I have not—no recollec<lb></lb>tion.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183605090214"></xptr>
               <p>I received a letter from the prisoner at the bar, (indeed, more than one or two). saving that my sons were the greatest enemies I had, and he so set the mind of the father and against them, that I believe I repbied with irritated feeling, being incensed at such disobidient conduct—all the letters I had at my husbands's death, I delivered over to my sons—I had destroyed several—the prisoner wrote me a letter, saying that one son would take the bed from under me, and the other acted very badly; and the letter I wrote denouncing my children, was in consequence of a letter of Gore's—I am the mother of these sons—the letter I received was in great cause the reason of my writing as I did; and it was in consequence of my eldest son getting married and his father being too ill to come to his marriage, which was one cause of setting me against him—Mr. Gore's letter and my son's marriage, and little family affairs, was the cause of my being alienated from my sons—the two brothers were not friends for some time—it was not to prejudice the Jury that I said it was Goer's letter that alienated me from my sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the cause still kept back purposely by you from the Jury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoners's letter and my son's marriage without the consent of his father, and little family matters were the cause of it—there might be other causes with the father—to the best of my belief these are the causes with myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not in consequence of a letter from your son, Sarswel Lamet, written with his own hand to you to Dublin, that you did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Indeed it was not—I do not recollect ever receiving such a letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if you wrote to Gore that you had received a latter from your son Samuel, and that while breath remained in your frame the character of its contents would never be erased from your memory—is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I did—I do not know whether the sight of my own letter has brought it to my remembrance—I did write that letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I heard at the Magistrate's of letters being burnt belonging to Gore—I heard Joseph swear before the Magistrate that be burnt some—I was not paying any attention to what he said—I cannot tell what letters my son said he burnt—I did not think this letter was burnt, when I said I was paying no attention—I cannot tell what letters were burnt—I did not hear from Joseph that he had burnt some letters I had written to Gore—I heard Joseph say he had burnt some letters in Gore's possession, but I do not know what they were—that was before Gore was taken into custody—he did not tell me he had burnt papers as well as letters—he said they were letters from patients to his father, and different things, and as there was going to be a sale on the premises, be thought they had better be burnt—I cannot tell when I wrote the letter to Gore, denouncing my children—it was in August, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not what you considered the base conduct of Samuel, in a letter from himself, that caused you to write that letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect any letter from him—I know the letter from the prisoner was the great means—Samuel's letter and the prisoner's together might have caused my denouncing him—I do not recollect the contents of my son's letter now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say, that while breath animated your frame the cha<lb></lb>racter of Samuel's letter would never be erased—that to all the world you would show the infamous manner in which he threatened to reduce to the street his unfortunate parents—but that you never would acknowledge yourself a parent to such an unnatural tiend—did not forget that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to Gore "He says, if I do not remit 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by</p>

               <p>return of post, that without any further notice, he will sell off all our furni<lb></lb>ture to pay himself"—did you forget that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I acknow<lb></lb>ledge having received a letter from my son—my sons were continually threatening to sell me up, if I did not repay the money we owed—Samuel threatened to come to the house and take the property by force, and sell it—both might have done so—I say Samuel, I did not mean to exclude Joseph—they might have both done it—I do not know—I did give Gore directions, if he dared to enter his father's house, or to touch any article, to eject him by law immediately. Dr. lamer's affairs were in a very bad state—I do not know that Miss Blits, the housekeeper, was obliged to pawn her clother, to support the current expenses of the household—she showed me the duplicates, but she did not say it was to pay the household expenses—I do not know whether it was for the household expenses or herself—I never told the prisoner to keep money which he had received to pay up the arrears of his salary, which the embarrassed state of the firm would not enable me to do—it might be so, but I do not remember it—all monies that he was authorized to receive in the shop business, he was desired by my late husband to enter in the book—he always wrote that he did not get money enough to pay up the arrears of his salary—I have sent him money, not to pay other per<lb></lb>same but I have to pay Miss Bilts—I have not written to the prisoner to shot up the house, and to sell the things, that I recollect—the furniture was to be left in the house—the furniture was not mine—I do not know of his removing any property—I do not know whether it was the custom of my husband and the prisoner to pot down on bits of paper, the sums they received in town and country, and at certain chronological times to enter them in the book—I travelled with my husband, he kept a book, but he past down person's names and residences on papers—he might have put down suns he received also—I cannot swear that he did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there nothing removed before the bankruptcy from your hus<lb></lb>band's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten or eleven months age, Dr. Lamert gave to his son ten or twelve very old chairs, a table, and a few little things; these things were seined at my son's house; and the gentleman of the Court came down, and went through all our house—a great many things were pointed out by Mr. Gore that did not belong to us—on looking over the inventory, they were all there—they came back and searched my trunk—the prisoner said I had a box of jewels; and all they found in my trunk, was a little locket and some seals—Gore has been three or four years in the employment of my husband—these letters are all in my own hand-writing (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

I was porter to the late Mr. Lamert for eighteen years—it was my business to carry out medicines ordered from him to the customers—Mr. Hunter lives in Blackfriar's-road—on the 7th of January, 1835, I received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him—I paid it over Mr. Gore when I got home—I took a bill and receipt which the prisoner gave me—on the 19th of October I received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from James Knight, and gave it to the prisoner—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my trouble.</p>

The real object of this prosecution against me is for the express purpose of invalidating evidence given by me, and to be given by me before the Commissioners of Bankruptcy—a quantity of jewels and valuable things were secreted by me under the direction of the bankrupt, and the prosecutrix in particular—a fellow clerk gave notice, and I was summoned to give evidence, and when upon my oath was obliged to give conscientious evidence which was the means of recovering these goods and jewellery and other things, and it is to be proved whether my evidence will enable the Commissioners to get a sum of 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. obtained by Samuel Lamert—it will be proved that Joseph and Samuel Lamert came to the house during my absence—that they had gone over the house, and Joseph had put my letters, correspondence, and accounts into his hat—I went to the cupboard</p>

I had paid only a few days before—he stated they were in a little box sealed up—I ran to the box and cut the string—they were not there—I ran back and told him, and insisted upon having my letters—the two brothers went out with my letters in their hats—I followed them out think<lb></lb>ing to go to the magistrate for advice—I overtook them and passed them both—I turned my head and they had returned to the house—I went to the house and rang four times, and not being answered, I jumped over the kitchen rails, and got in at the kitchen window, the servants said they had orders not to open the door till the letters were burnt; and Joseph Lambert took me tot he ashes and showed me the ashes of the letters, and he said to Rebeccs, "You are a witness that I burnt them."</p>

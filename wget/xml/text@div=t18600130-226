                  </hi>. I was formerly a soldier in the 2d European light cavalry in India—the prisoner was in the same regiment—we were both discharged—we returned to London on the 24th of this month, and went together to take a lodging at a coffee-house, in Queen-street, Tower hill—I had 13 sove<lb></lb>reigns and a half in gold, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., when I came into London—I can't say exactly to a shilling; and I had a rupee, and a quarter-rupee—when I got my money from the officer, I noticed a George the Fourth sovereign amongst it—I kept the money in a bag with a string tied round my waist, under all my clothes—a bag was afterwards shown to me by Reed the police-constable—I would not say whether it belonged to me, but it was a similar one to mine—during the time I was with the prisoner he had not a bag similar to that, as far as I know—after we had taken the rooms, we went out, leaving our packs in the house—it was between 5 and 6 when we returned—we had some drink in the course of that time, and I had my bag and all the money in it—the prisoner gave me his purse, he said he was going out with a woman—the purse was cloth, tied round with a piece of string—there were two sovereigns and a half in it—I had not got the purse when we returned be<lb></lb>tween 5 and 6—I returned it to him when we came away from the woman—that was just before we were returning to Mr. Crafford's—when we got back, we sat there a minute or two, and then proposed to go to bed—I was a little the worse for liquor, but did not feel it till I came into the house—we went up stairs to No. 11 room and there I got very sick, and began to vomit—the prisoner pulled off my clothes, and put me to bed—just as I lay down, I felt him pull the string round my waist; and I asked him what he was doing; he said "Nothing, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, go to sleep"—I soon fell asleep, and did not awake till 11 or half-past 11 that night—the prisoner was not there then—we had arranged to sleep together—I felt for my money, and it was gone, and the bag also—I made a complaint to a boy—the next day I went down to St. Katharine's wharf, and went aboard a steamer that was going to Scotland—I had my passage granted by Government—I was going to my own place—the prisoner was a countryman of mine—he was going to Ham<lb></lb>borough, and I was going to Glasgow—we were going part of the way to<lb></lb>gether—the prisoner came shortly after I got on board—this was in the morning about 9 o'clock—I went up to him and said, "Give me my money" he said "What money?"—I said, "The money you robbed me of last night"—he said, quite surprised, "Why I was robbed myself, and lost everything"—I told him I would go and give him in charge if he did not give it me, and I went and got a constable—the bag that I lost was a similar one to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper—I have got a place at 20, King-street, Tower-hill—on the morning of 24th January the prosecutor and prisoner came to my house and took beds for the night of the 24th—they paid me, and I put their names on the slate, the room they were to sleep in, and the number of the bed—they went out and returned between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I thought them both sober when they came into the house, but the prosecutor became stupid after being in a little while—he could not walk straight—the prisoner was perfectly sober—he said "Well, my friend has been drinking, and I will take him up to bed"—I went up between 11 and 12—the prisoner came down stairs between 8 and 9 o'clock—I was told that he was going out, and I went and spoke to him—I remarked that it was rather extraordinary that he should want to leave after having gone to bed—I took his pack from him, and took it into the bar—I took the slate down and said "What name did you give?" he said, "I gave you the name of Reed"—I then looked on his pack to see if the name of Reed was on it, because it is invariably the case that they steal one another's packs—I found the name of Reed on his pack, and delivered it to him, of course—he said he was going to some friends at the West End.</p>

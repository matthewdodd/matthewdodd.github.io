(Produces them.)</p>

               <p>JOHN COLSEY sworn. - I am a soldier in the Tower Hamlets militia, and was going on duty at four o'clock; the ladder stood opposite where I live; I saw the prisoners come under the ladder standing in the street; I saw Welch go up the ladder, the other remained at bottom, and said, you go up, I'll look out; Welch went up, and jumped off the parapet into the gutter; he attempted to pull the window one way, and it would not open; he then pulled it the other, got it open, and went in; in the course of a minute he brought out these furs into the gutter; I run down, and opened the door gently, and secured Collins; I saw Welch above three paces from the window; seeing me secure Collins, he threw the things towards the window he brought them from, and laid himself down in the gutter to hide himself; I then knocked at the prosecutor's door; while I was securing Collins, the other came down; I saw him come out of White-Lion-passage; the moment I gave the other in charge, I pursued him, and caught him by the New Church, in the Strand; I am sure Welch is the person I saw go up the ladder; when I took him, he said, you'll recollect you took me in the Strand, and I have no property about me; when Welch came out of the passage, Collins said, that is he who went into the window.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM ROBINSON sworn. - I am a staymaker; I got up at four o'clock, and heard a noise in the street; I saw the last witness and Collins scuffling together; I run down, and assisted him; a few minutes after the other came down White-Lion-passage, Collins said, that is the thief; I held Collins while Colsey fetched the other back; I am beadle of the parish, and locked them up.</p>

               <p>Welch's defence. I was going up quick to Tottenham-court-road on an errand, and that man caught me, saying, he was looking for a boy, as he had one in custody who had committed a robbery.</p>

               <p>Collins's defence. I was going to work in Newgate-market, and that man took hold of me, and held me for half an hour, and said there was a man at the top of the house, and then brought this boy to me I never saw before, and took us to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Welch called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to live with Mr. Hughes - A. I do, it was about the month of March. On the second or third Sunday after he came in the service, as near as I can recollect, about ten o'clock, I saw him in the back warehouse; I was able to see him from the front warehouse; I saw him take some chips from the tub in the back warehouse, rolled them up and put them in his left hand inside coat pocket; on my observing that I communicated it to the cook, Mary.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had communicated it to her, where did she and you go to - A. We went to the street door, I and the cook stood at the door; we saw him walk to the square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever communicate it to your master - A. No. I went into the country shortly after and did not return till lately; I communicated it to Mr. Bristow, I think on Friday, in the other week.</p>

               <p>Q. He told you the cook had told - A. Yes, I was willing to tell if in case I had gone back to Mr. Hughes; I would have told it lately if Mr. Hughes had sent for me; but I was desired not to go by several people.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you told us just now that you had not told it to any - A. I have told it to different people where I have lodged; they told me not to go for fear I should get myself into trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the boy come and tell you something - A. He did; it was on a Sunday morning, in the latter end of March, or the beginning of April; after the boy told me Mr. Pratt came out of the warehouse; I and the boy were at the street door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you observe Pratt come out of the warehouse - A. Yes, he passed by the side of me, as he went out of the door; I was as nigh to him as I am to you; I observed a roll of chips inside of his coat of the left side; I saw the rims of the chips in his bosom; I saw only the end of the bundle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Are you perfectly sure that at the end of the roll you saw chips uncovered - A. I did; Mr. Pratt went out of the house, nothing was said to him by me, nor by Hazard; I saw nothing more of him till Sunday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you, or had you not, reason to suppose that the chips had been stolen - A. Every time I went to the chips I thought that they decreased faster than they came out; I thought it was my fancy, I did not suspect any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine the chips and find whether any quantity was missing - A. I did; and found there was the value of between sixty and seventy poundsworth missing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Hughes mention it to the prisoner and the other servants - A. He did, in the beginning of August; Mr. Hughes consulted me and the prisoner together. When we found they were missing Mr. Hughes asked the prisoner whether he suspected any person; the prisoner told a long story of living with persons who had been robbed, and he told of one person that he had been the means of bringing to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he remain in Mr. Hughes' service after that - A. I believe, till the latter end of August, or the beginning of September; I was in the country at that time; he went to live with a furrier in Gough square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the United Service public-home, Charlton-pier, Woolwich. On the 31st Jan., about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners and another with them, at my master's, in the tap-room—they called for some been, which they had—I had a waistcoat, trowsers, and shirt lying on the table—I shifted them from there to my bed-place, I slept in the tap-room—there were four half-crowns, eight shillings, a sixpence, and a fourpenny-piece in the waistcoat pocket; 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. alto<lb></lb>gether—the money rattled as I moved the clothes—there was no one in the room but the prisoners, the other man, and myself—I left the room to clean the bar, leaving them there—they went out, and three marines came in—I followed them into the same room—as soon as I got in I searched my clothes, and missed four half-crowns and four shillings—the three fresh men were in the room—I searched. them, and found a shilling, a sixpence, and a few halfpence on them, but no half-crowns—they were willing to be searched—I let them go—I got a constable, went after the prisoners, and came up with them in High-street, Woolwich—Lee ran away, the other two stood still, and were searched, and taken to the station—Lee was taken about two minutes after he went down an alley, and a policeman went up and met him—he was searched, and three halfpence farthing, and three half-crowns were found on him—I knew one of the half-crowns—there is a cut across the head, and a dot against the eye—there was hald-crown found on Runnett, the man who has got away. And on Southam, a sovereign and a fourpenny-piece—no person went into the tap-room while the prisoners were there—I was cleaning the bar, right opposite the door, and should have seen if anybody had—I know this half-crown which was found on Lee—I have had if better than six weeks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 229.) About eight o'clock on Sunday morning I received information, and went in search of the prisoners—Edwards was with me—we came up to them in High-street—when I was fifty or hundred yards from them, Lee made off and ran up an alley—I apprehended Southam and Runnett—I told Southam the charge was for stealing some half-crowns and four shillings from Edwards—he said he knew nothing about in—I asked what money he had about him—he said a fourpenny-piece—I said, "I should like to see it"—he put his hand in his pocket, and said he had half-a-crown—I took it—I asked Runnett what he had—he said, "a shilling"—I took that, and went five or six paces down the alley, and took Lee—he said he went there to ease himself—I asked what money he ha—he said, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he put his hand in his pocket, and took out 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half-crown, changed the half-crown into his left hand, and clenched it—I took them to the station, and searched their boots—Lee had some rag wrapped</p>

               <p>round his foot—he said his heel was sore—I assisted in taking the rags off, and two half-crowns slipped from them, which I kept separate from the others, but I have mixed the others, and can not tell which I took from Lee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lee's Defence.</hi> I went to a shoemaker's shop, and bought a pair of boots, and afterwards sold them for three half-crowns. I met Southam; we went into the public-house and had two pots of porter; there were five of us there; afterwards two more men came in, and a man who looks after the steamers went and washed himself there; we left the place, leaving three marines there, and the things on the table; I had been confined ten days, and that was the reason I had got the money, as I could not get out to spend it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Rymer, currier, Nassau-street. These thirteen pairs of boot-backs, and twelve pairs of boot-fronts, are his, I am positive—I have not sold them—I know the prisoner well—he came to our shop two or three times a-day—he was there on Friday, the 12th of December, in the afternoon, and purchased a small quantity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Greek-street, Soho. I have known the prisoner some years—on Friday, the 12th of December, he brought thirteen pairs of backs and twelve pairs of boot-fronts—he asked me to buy them—he asked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the backs, and 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the fronts—I said I would have them; but I had before had some communication with Mr. Rymer—I sent my boy to him—he came, and took the prisoner—the property was given to the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far are your premises from Mr. Rymer's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three hundred yards—the prisoner professed to make children's shoes—I had bought some Wellington fronts of him on the 10th—he said he had them to sell himself—and then on the 12th he brought those others—between the 10th and the 12th I had had a communication with Mr. Rymer—I prosecuted a man here—I could swear to the backs and fronts that he stole—if any one brought these to me, I should say they were Mr. Rymer's, by the shape of the block—scarcely two persons' blocks are alike.</p>

            . I am a proctor of Doctors' Dommons. On the 7th of July, the prisoner applied to me for a probate of this will - I prepared it for him, also the jurat to swear, and was present when he swore it before Dr. Clark, who was authorized to administer the oath; he described himself as stated in the jurat - I took it from his own mouth. He said that he was executor to the will, and wanted a probate. I observed that the name was spelt Anderson at the head of the will and that it was signed Andreason, therefore, I must alias it, which is nothing unusual.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about the testator - A. He said he died last year, on board the Batavia. A probate was granted him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say he died in Bombay hospital - A. I do not recollect. I told him there was a caveat lodged against the will, and he was to call next day for the probate. He insisted that it was a good will, and likewise upon having the probate. The caveat was lodged in behalf of a creditor, but was withdrawn, as he could not hold it.</p>

             for eight or nine years. I first got acquainted with him in 1809, on board the Bombay seventy-four gun ship. We shipped ourselves on board her off Sheerness, and were both on board together for six years.

I stopped ashore nine or ten months, but Anderson went to the West Indies in the Shannon, and then shipped himself with me, in 1818, on board the Batavia, which sailed to New Holland, and then to Bombay. He died in Bombay hospital about nine months ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was Anderson in England - A. At the latter end of 1816, my Lord. He was only on shore four days, and lodged at the Waterman's Arms, Wapping. I never heard of his living in Prince's-square.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he in England before that - A. In 1809. I knew him from 1809 till his death.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent in the Shannon - A. Nine months, and arrived at the Watermans' Arms from the Shannon; I was acquainted with him while he was in England. He did not lodge in Princes-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent from you in England - A. Not two days.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were at Bombay did you lay near land - A. About a mile off - he was the boatman; he went sometimes ashore, and staid a quarter of an hour - I was mostly with him. When he went with the boat he could not leave it. I knew all the crew.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have witnesses to prove that such a man was in my house. I have plenty of wills. People lodge at my house. I persuade them all to make their wills. I can neither read nor write. One of the witnesses to the will has left the country, and the other travels about. Two people were in the house at the time the deceased made the will.</p>

            . I live at Poplar. I have seen Arkinstall at Fonsick's house several times - he came with Fonsick as a passenger from Bilboa, three or four years ago. I never saw him afterwards, and do not know his Christian name. I never saw him write. He travels about. Vodriguej is a seaman; he was often at Fousick's, and transacted business for him. I have not seen him for three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he in March, 1816 - A. I think at Fonsick's house the whole of 1816, I am almost sure of it - the prisoner was ill at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could not have been in the East Indies - A. No, I have often seen him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this will - do you see his hand-writing there - A. I am almost afraid to say, but I think it is like it.</p>
               <p>Q. If he signed that it must have been in England - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. When was the prisoner's wife ill - A. In 1815 and 1816 - Arkinstall was there then. I think he was introduced to me as a stranger from Bilboa - I think Vodriguej and him were there together in 1816 - the prisoner then lived in Princes-square. I did not know Anderson.</p>

            . I have known Vodriguej four years - he lived off and on with the prisoner. I have not seen him for eighteen or twelve months, and believe he is not in England. Fonsick went to live in Prince's-square about ten years ago, and I am not certain whether it was the first summer, or the summer after that, that I made Vodriguej a suit of clothes; he acted as assistant to Fonsick.</p>
               <p>Q. That was nine or ten years ago - A. Yes. I think Mrs. Fonsick died in March, 1816.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Vodriguej remain there after her death - A. About two months. I do not know where he went to, but I saw him in different parts of the town for twelve months after her death.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not have gone to Bombay and back in that time - A. He might, from the time Mrs. Fonsick died until I next saw him. The prisoner's effects were sold off in May, 1816. Vodriguej remained there all the sale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you know Arkinstall - A. Yes, he came from Bilboa with Fonsick, about a year before his wife's death, and remained at Fonsick's, off and on, for two years. I saw him last about two years ago. I never saw the prisoner write - I have seen Vodriguej write.</p>

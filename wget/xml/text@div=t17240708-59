             depos'd, The Prisoner came to her Shop, about 10 a Clock at Night, without Hat, &amp;c. and pretended to be in great Haste, pretending his Lady was in great Haste for the Tea, and gave her a Piece of Money for a broad Piece, but pretending not to know whether it was a 23 s. Piece, or a 25 s. Piece, that thereupon she weigh'd it against a 23 s. Piece, and it was something heavier, whereupon he said, he believed his Lady gave it him for a 24 s. Piece, that then she offered to send her Maid, and he reply'd, that then she might send that 23 s. Piece of her own, and that would convince his Lady, but she not willing to do that, he said, she might give him Change as a 23 s. Piece, and if his Lady said it was a 25 s. Piece, he would come back immediately. That however she sent her Maid, and when she had gone with him to a certain House he pretended to go to, he bid the Maid go away, and said there was no Occasion for her going in.

             depos'd, That he used to go with the Prisoner to put off such sort of Money, South-Sea Shillings and Six Pences gilt, that he used a House on Snow-Hill, where he got that Sort of Money, but he never would let him go along with him thither. That he has gone with him, when he stood at some Distance while the Prisoner went into a Shop to buy something, and would throw down one of those half Guineas or Guineas, and then would ask the Price, and object against it, and demand his Money again, and by that Means get good Money for it, but he could not very well tell how he managed it. That he this Evidence used to carry the Money, and when he went into a Shop, he would ask this Evidence for one Piece, and he used to stay a little way off, waiting for him. And also, that sometimes he would ask him to change Clothes with him, and that he did so; and that he was with the Prisoner when he went to Mrs. Young's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172407080006"></xptr> Shop, and he did give him such a Piece of Gold, as she produced in Court, and he verily believed it was the same Piece, which is a King Edwards Shilling gilt, and that when he came from Mrs. Tonng's Shop, he gave him Tea and Sugar, but did not tell him what Money he had in exchange. He called several Persons to his Reputation, but they were not capable of giving any Account of him, much to his Service, and one of his most hearty Friends did own, that he had before this Time been reviled for putting off false Money; and so upon a full hearing of the Matter, the Jury found him <rs id="t17240708-59-verdict299" type="verdictDescription">

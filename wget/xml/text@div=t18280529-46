               <p>Q. Take these papers in your hand, and state what are the stamps imposed on paper, first in the hands of the manufacturer, and afterwards in the hands of the stainer? A. The stamps used by the manufacturer are not here; here are the duty stamps, which are made on stained paper - the duty on stained paper is seven farthings on a square yard; about 1s. 0 1/2d. on a piece - there are nearly seven square yards in a piece; here is an impression taken from what we call the first account stamp, which is imposed on the paper - for which we have authority, from seeing the label on the wrapper of the manufacturers, that is imposed without a charge; this bottom impression is the second stamp, and is called the frame-mark - here are several compartments in it, one shews the number of the stamp, 69, and on that is a moveable letter to check the trade; the next is for the purpose of inserting the progressive number of the piece - we take an account in a book of the papers so stamped; the number here corresponds with the number entered in the book - the next compartment shews the length of the paper which here is 12, meaning 12 yards long - another compartment contains the breadth, which is 58-100th of a yard; that multiplied by the length, would be nearly seven square yards, and by that we ascertain the duty to be calculated; the next compartment shews the year - this enables us to know what the duty should be hereafter; the third stamp is called the duty, or charge stamp; that is imposed after the paper has been framed, and denotes that the duty has been paid - that is the stamp respecting which we receive the duty ultimately. On the 16th of February last I went to Martin's premises in Regent's-street, with Mr. Hall, our general surveyor, and Mr. Notweller, a surveyor of Excise - I directly sent somebody to take charge of the premises in Smith's-yard; I saw Mrs. Martin at Regent-street, and enquired for Mr. Martin- I did not find him there; I examined the stock in the work-shop and selected some bits of paper, which I left in Hall's possession I think - but there was paper selected from both places; I afterwards went to Smith's-yard with Mr. Notweller, and selected some there - some pieces there were wet and had just been printed; they could not be moved - Kennedy was with us at both places backward and forward; he remarked that the wet paper would be disturbed if I took them away, and I left them; I told him we considered the pieces to be seized, and it would be at his peril to remove them; that I seized them because the impressions of the duty-stamp and the framestamp were forged - we seized sixty-seven pieces at Regent-street, and ninety-eight at Smith's-yard, exclusive of the wet ones; by the request of Mrs. Martin and Kennedy they were removed as privately as possible from the premises - Kennedy and some boys removed them; we took them to an Excise chamber in Great Pulteney-street; Kennedy, as he was moving some of them, said, it was a rum start-the pieces seized on the 16th are here; these are part of them - here is them stamp on them; I found the wet ones again on the premises - I can swear to them by the pattern; I took them away on Monday, the 18th - the stamps on these papers are forged; I have not the least doubt of it - here is a forged date-stamp, and a forged frame-mark; here are two pieces, and the stamps on both are forged - the stamp on this piece is not so perfect as the other, but still, I can swear it is not my stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the custody of the duty stamp? A. The surveying officers, Clutton and Claggett; their stamp is only used at one paper-stainers besides Martin's - his name is Henderson; it is the duty of Clutton and Claggett to affix those stamps; the surveyor may do it if he thinks proper, but it must be done in the presence of one or both of those persons; here is another piece of the wet paper - the stamps on it are forged in both respects (here the witness examined several other pieces of paper, which he deposed to have forged stamps on them) - all these were seized on the 16th, and taken away on the 18th, being wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at some of those you removed on the 16th? A. Here is some - I have examined them all; they bear the impressions of forged stamps, and appear to have been impressed with the same false stamps as the wet paper - one stamp has been used on them all; the compartment, shewing the date and frame-mark, is rather larger - the letters are rather irregular and larger, and stand at a different distance to those on our stamp; in the space which shews the lengths of the paper there is a very slight difference - they are very nearly alike in size; the difference is in the year - there is no year to be seen; there are two characters which run alike through the pieces, but I cannot tell what it is; when we fetched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290038"></xptr>away the wet paper on the 18th, I think part of it was rolled up, and part hanging up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you, yourself, mark the papers? A. No; I did not put any mark on what I brought away on the 16th - I only know them by the pattern and the forged impressions; I stated to Kennedy on the 16th, in Smith's-yard, that I seized them because they were forged stamps; I did not see Martin at all - I told Mrs. Martin so on my return to Regent-street; the business continued to be carried on by Mr. Martin till they were taken into custody on the 1st of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that in that interval Martin presented a petition to the Board of Excise, to have the matter investigated and the paper restored? A. I do; I cannot say whether he attended to be examined - he was not examined; he called on me two or three times afterwards - it was partly to know what answer there was to his petition; I told him it would meet with every attention from the Board - I believe the matter was referred to me by the Board, but I have so many referred me I am not certain; if the report came into my hands I went into the investigation; I had no occasion to send for him, he came to me - the Commissioners generally refer these petitions to the reporting officers.</p>
               <p>Q. They, having a petition presented against the act of the officer, refer it to the reporting officers themselves? A. Yes. (The petition was here produced by the Counsel for the Crown.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you seen that petition? A. I have - here is my report upon it; it was referred to me, but it is not with reference to the seizure of the 16th, according to my report.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make this impression (producing one)? A. I do not know - I have made several - it is a genuine duty-stamp; many of the impressions on the paper are very faint, and it will occur at times that genuine impressions are faint - that sometimes happens from the hurry of the officers, and from the manner the trader hurries the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that stamp is sufficiently distinct for you to say it is genuine or feigned? A. From the character of the impression I believe it to be forged; I can only see part of it - it is sufficiently distinct to enable me to say it is forged; that part which is perfect, is forged, (here the witness pointed out the part he could ascertain to be forged.)</p>
               <p>Q. This you swear you can tell is a forged stamp? A. From my belief it is forged - I swear that; it is not so regular, and the letters are not so upright - our letters are all fixed, and must be even and upright whatever way it is turned; I do not keep the stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this piece of paper (producing one), has the duty been paid on that? A. From the appearance at this end I should suppose it had, but I do not see any impression of the date mark on the other end - this end, as far as I can see it, is a very good impression of the duty stamp, and I should consider it genuine; but if I was in possession of a genuine stamp I could better tell- the number of this stamp is 233, and is not my stamp; it is not Martin's number, and would not be his manufacture.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it is not manufactured by Martin, and stamped by the officer who stamps his papers? A. I believe he has a manufactory at Starch-green - it may have been made there, but that is not in our district; the frame-mark here is certainly imperfect, and the duty stamp is not so perfect as it ought to be, in consequence of it being placed over the account-stamp, but the part I can see of it is genuine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you find any paper resembling that mark on his premises? A. I found paper there bearing good impressions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are those papers made at either of those two places? A. I say from the number of the stamp they are not; they do not belong to Regent-street nor Smith's-yard.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. On the papers you seized are not many of the stamps exceedingly imperfect? A. Yes, and genuine stamps are very imperfect at times; I judge whether they are genuine or not by comparison, and the number of the stamp - it takes four or five days to dry the paper; it depends on the nature of the place they hang in.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you use a comparison at the first seizure? A. Yes; the first seizure was on the 1st of October; the whole paper was found in entered rooms; the officers could go there at any hour in the night, and it is their duty to go there sometimes.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You stated that you informed Mr. Martin and Kennedy that the stamps were forged, and that the prisoners were not apprehended then? A. No; I apprehended them on the 1st of May; I made no seizure then- I made one on the 28th of February; I brought away what I considered forged, and left the genuine stamps - I gave information to the Excise, leaving them to act for the best.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the genuine stamps are not always perfect, not withstanding the stamp is not complete; can you distinguish by that which really exists on the paper, that one stamp is regular, and the other forged? A. Yes; some are not so perfect as other - still there is sufficient difference to enable me to say it is forged.</p>

            . I am an Excise-officer. On the 16th of February I was sent for and went to Martin's, in Regent-street; I found Mr. Bird, Notweller, and Hall there; and I believe there was some of Mr. Martin's men; I cannot say whether Kennedy was there - when I arrived they were examining the paper, some of it was seized - I did not examine the stamps; I have got the genuine stamp here - there are four stamps; the first account - the frame-mark - the charge - and the remmant stamp; the duty-stamp used at Martin's, is No. 99 - there is one paperstainer in that district using that number; his name is James Henderson - I think it was in the afternoon when I went to Regent-street; our usual time of going to stamp there, is from nine to twelve o'clock in the morning generally; the stamps are kept in a box which I keep, but Clagget has the key of the box, and I have the key of the place the box is kept in - I am obliged to send for Clagget before I can get at the duty or first accountstamp.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLAGGET here produced the stamp, No. 99, from a box.</p>
               <p>Witness. This is the duty-stamp, No. 99; I have surveyed at Martin's between five and six years, and have had no other duty-stamp for him besides this.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290039"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often in a week do you go to Martin's? A. Every day, Sunday excepted; Martin has been very little in Regent-street, or Smith's-yard for a long time before the 16th of February - it was my duty to notice what paper is there, and see what is in the process of manufacture, but not to take an account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have escaped your observation if 140 pieces of forged stamped paper, had been added to his stock? A. His stock was too large for me to perceive the increase; the duty is paid at the Excise-office - the paper produced is very like a paper that many makers may have.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Other paper-stainers have the same pattern; but no other maker has the same number? A. Except Henderson.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you ever lend your stamps to any of the work people to use? A. No; they have been in their possession to use in my presence; but they never went out of my sight - they have worked them on one side while I was at the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see them work with any other stamp than that which you lent them? A. No; that must have made a genuine impression.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Have you not invariably gone to the premises in the morning, during the hours you have mentioned, except at the time in question? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you ever been between one and four o'clock? A. I might, as I pass the house so much; my regular hours were from nine to twelve - I have no recollection of going out of those hours.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to JOHN CLAGGETT. Q. Are your usual hours for attending to stamp in the morning? A. Yes, from eleven to one is the general time; I have not been after those hours, till after the seizure - the premises are open to us at all hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been frequently sent for to stamp at one hour, and come much later? A. I keep to my time as well as possible - I might have been an hour later at times; I never charged in the afternoon, to my knowledge - I have been sent for to go there and stamp, but not in the afternoon; I do not recollect charging in the afternoon; - I never recollect going three hours after I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not frequently made the impressions at so rapid a rate, that you could not tell yourself whether they were your impressions or not, when they were dry? A. The impressions were always correct, as far as I knew - I could always tell they were genuine impressions: the colouring would alter them at times.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could you always tell without comparison? A. I could always tell whether it was our stamp or not; I never knew an instance to the contrary.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not you know, on your oath, that there have been many? A. To the best of my knowledge there has not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever seen impressions made by you, and you did not know whether they had beed made by the right stamp or not? A. I could tell if they were made from our stamp.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You mean to swear that? A. I can, to the best of my knowledge; I should always know my own stamp; I never saw an impression on paper in his manufactory, that I could not tell whether it was from our stamp or not; I have sometimes examined impressions after they were dry occasionally, just by chance; I could not always distinguish them; sometimes they get obliterated a little.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. But from the state they were in, could you say whether they were from a genuine stamp or not? A. To the best of my knowledge they were; according to what I had seen, that was our stamp.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On your oath, has it not happened more than once, twice, or thrice, that after you have stamped paper on Martin's premises, when they have become dry, and you inspected them, you could not tell whether they were genuine or not? A. I have seen the stamps and all perfect, to the best of my knowledge; I have never, when I have been on duty, doubted about stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why have you hesitated so long in answering? A. I was considering about the seizure - I was not at the seizure; I thought you were speaking of the seizure. - When the paper gets dry we cannot see it so perfectly; there might be here and there a piece which I could not distinguish, but I have always found the genuine stamp, whatever I have seen; it might be obliterated, but I could make some of the stamp out to see that it was a genuine impression.</p>

            . I am engraver to the Board of Excise. I have examined impressions of the duty-stamp on several pieces of paper which were seized at Martin's - (looking at one) this is a forged duty-stamp - it is No. 99; here is another - the duty-stamp on that is forged, and on this also; the 99 is not very clear on this, but it is a forged stamp; here is another, which is also forged; I have examined them before, or I should take more time to examine them; the letters are not in the line, and the crown is very cramped; I call it a very bad impression; the letter Y seems tumbling down; I engrave all the Excise stamps with my own hands, and am quite positive I never made the stamp this is impressed from. (Looking at the paper produced by the prisoner's Counsel) this is a genuine stamp - it is No. 233, not 99.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You make the stamps with your own hands, but do not fix them to the paper? A. No; a negligent manner of impressing them would make a varied appearance, of course, but I must know them to be genuine, even if only a small part is impressed - if that part was clear I could not be deceived. I was questioned about this by the Board in October, and I think twice afterwards, before I went to Bow-street; I examined different papers each time; these were the second I examined, to the best of my recollection; I had no hesitation in declaring them forged, either in October or at any time; I went to Bow-street in May; I know nothing of Martin presenting a petition; Bird did not call on me about that.</p>

I accompanied Bird on the 16th of February to Martin's, in Regent-street; I found a quantity of paper in the front shop, which Bird told me to take charge of; I cannot say how many - I was not at Smith's-yard: one hundred and sixty-five pieces were carried away from the two places, to Great Pulteney-street; Martin's men carried some - I fol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290040"></xptr>lowed them behind; I took it from their to the Excise-office in Broad-street, and locked it up.</p>
               <p>GOLDING BIRD re-examined. I left Hall in Regent-street; the paper seized in Smith's yard was brought direct from there to Great Pulteney-street; the whole was then delivered to Hall; there were one hundred and sixty-five pieces in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a Mr. Hall, a stamper? A. No; I never saw paper stamped at Martin's; I only went there in consequence of these seizures.</p>

            , a paper-hanger. I was apprenticed to Mr. Martin, and have been about two years with him; I have had some quarrel with him. I know the manufactory in Regent-street and Smith's-yard; Kennedy was the foreman; I went to live there about two years ago this Whitsuntide; shortly after I went I saw the paper come in, tied up, with strings round both ends; we only had one shop  then; that was in Smith's yard - I looked at the stamps, and saw there was a difference in them, but I did not then know what was the officer's stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards observe anything going on? - A. The youngest apprentice first called my attention to it- his name is Wilson; he pointed out which was the offcer's (the fourth stamp) when I first went there; the small G. and the date was not to be perceived; a quarrel had taken place between Martin and Kennedy before the 1st of October; master was going to part with Kennedy, and Kennedy came into the shop in Smith's-yard, with thirty pieces of plain paper under his arm, and laid them on the table, and in his other hand he had a handkerchief, with something tied in it; this was about the latter end of September; he was stupidly drunk, and I do not think he knew what he was about; he came up into the upper shop, where I was at work, and began playing with the boys; I went down, and opened the handkerchief, and in it were three stamps; the frame-mark, the duty-mark, and the first account-stamp; I compared the frame-mark with the impressions on the papers, and it was just the same; they must have been made with the stamps in the handkerchief. After the 16th of February (and after the third seizure) Kennedy said it was me who had informed, and if I had not informed, nobody would have known the difference; I denied it then, and said it was not me - he then blamed me for it all, and said it was me that informed all about it; he used a great many oaths, and blackguarded me for it all; I told him I had seen the stamps, and he said it was a d-d lie, I never had seen them; I said there was not one in the place but what knew it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever see them use the stamps? A. No - I never saw them afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. There were three seizures; after the first seizure did you see any impressions of the stamp which you had seen before? A. No - the greater part of that was seized; the forgery was stopped; there was no more forgery carried on till after New-year's day, and then it began again, but it was a different stamp; they had altered it - it was not the officer's stamp; the only difference in the stamp was the date; the date was not to be seen; I could not make the date out; they date the frame-mark by the year; the officer generally stamped about one hundred and twenty pieces a week; there were as many as five sixties in a week which were not stamped by the officers; there are sixty in a bundle; they were stamped, but not by the officer; I had to work on it - it was given to me with that which was properly stamped. The day the third seizure was made was the first time I gave information that I had seen the stamps; I did not see the officers till after the second seizure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When was the first time you quarrelled with your master? A. I quarrelled with him several times; I do not exactly know the first time; my father came into Martin's employ after I became his apprentice; it was above a twelvemonth after; he remained there a good bit, at paper-hanging - I lived with my father; he was working there on and off several times. Martin did not turn him away till after the first seizure - I told nobody in the factory of my having seen the stamps in the handkerchief; I did not say everybody knew of the stamps, but of the forgery; I had talked about that - only one person is here who I told of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps none of them quarrelled with their master? A. They have had petty quarrels - mine was no great quarrel; I respected my master, and Kennedy also; I never said I would do anything that would get Kennedy transported, nor anything like it; I know the servant of the house - I never told her so; I never worked down at Regent-street to talk to her about it; I saw her sometimes - I never talked to the gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. What suggested to you the propriety of telling of this? A. I met the Excise officers, and communicated it to them - I never saw any but the two who came to survey. I met Bird and Hall in Rose-street, and told them.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you select the day of the third seizure to inform of it? A. I had no particular reason; my father had seen Bird, and Bird wished to see us - my father had not seen Bird till he was turned away. I saw the stamps in February, and told my father of it, but nobody else; I told him of it the day I saw the stamps; I never talked to the servant in Regent-street about the stamps - I worked down there three weeks after the first seizure, but never said anything to her about either Martin or Kennedy; my brother quarrelled with Kennedy; I never heard him say he would do what he could to transport him. After Bird made the seizure I shewed some forged paper to Mr. Slowman; I said."They are going on with the old game again;" he said, "Put them under the table, and I will have the officers here in the morning." I took the stamp off the paper and kept it till the morning: I said I thought it was forged, and tore off the end to ascertain the fact; the officer admitted that it was genuine. I told him Bird had told me if I saw any forged to let him know; if it had not been for Slowman the officer would not have known it - it is very easy to discover forged stamps; I am speaking of the frame-stamp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290041"></xptr>(pointing it out) I never saw any difference in the chargestamp; there is no difference between that charge-mark and the officer's charge mark.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were the three stamps you saw in the handkerchief, similar to the one you pointed out as being forged? A. Only the long one (the frame-mark.) I had about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to look at the stamps; the stamp I tore off and fancied was forged proved not to be so - the stamp I tore off was at Starch-green, and a different frame-mark altogether to that in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The frame-mark appears to be much easier to imitate than the duty mark? A. Yes, the duty mark in the handkerchief was exactly like the original, and the first account stamp; any one might see the difference in the frame-mark, if they had the two impressions laid together: my observations have been confined entirely to the frame-mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this sort of stamp like one of them? A. That is the sort of stamp - it is not the same; the difference is, it is clogged up with colour, and this handle is larger; when the impression was made on the paper I could see no difference between the officer's mark and that; I observed no cramping in the crown; the letters were not tumbling down - I never saw any difference in the duty-mark; it was all in the frame-mark; no duty is payable on the frame-mark; no benefit is attached to that, but there is to the duty-mark. My former master's name was Wiltshire - I was apprenticed to him for seven years, and was about eighteen months with him; he had nothing to do for a long while, and we quarrelled; I was an in-door apprentice; he was always telling me I did not earn my victuals; he had to find me in clothes; I could not get any, and wished him to give up my indentures; he would not, but he burnt them; there was a fire at Martin's premises in Regent-street; I did not work there at the time - my brother did; he was not the cause of the fire: my father does not go by the name of lying Duffield, that I know of; I have heard it from several persons in Martin's employ. - When I showed the officer the paper at Starch-green, he showed me the difference, how they altered the frame-mark - he told me I was doing wrong, but not that I ought to be hung; his name is Cole - he said, "Don't you know I could send you to prison for this, and if you do it again I will;" I said, "I have seen the thing carried on so long;" the mark was afterwards pasted on again - it was not destroyed.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You are not an engraver? A. No; what I know of the stamp is from memory; the duty mark is not put on till the frame-mark is.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever tell John Kearns that Kennedy was the cause of your having so many stoppages in your wages? A. I did, and said, perhaps I should have the laugh at him some day - this was before I thought of informing; I also said revenge was sweet, and I would do all in my power to have him transported - I never said to Henry Williams that I would transport Kennedy, nor did I tell James Fanning that or anything like it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. At what time of the day did you see these stamps in the handkerchief? A. In the afternoon, between three and four o'clock I believe; there was only one man at work in the shop besides me - I do not know whether he saw him come in with the handkerchief; he was at work up stairs, and this was down stairs in the lower shop.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many men had Martin on his premises the day you saw the stamp? A. Only me and one man - there are four on the premises at one time, but not at that time.</p>

            . I was apprenticed to Martin, and lived with him not quite a twelvemonth; I have not left - he holds my indeatures now; I worked at the premises in Regent-street - my duty was to join the sheets of paper; Kennedy used to give them to me - the officers used first to account them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever join any sheets that were unfirst accounted? A. Yes - on the Saturday after the seizure was made, I joined a ream at that time; some first accounted paper was joined with it - that was placed mostly at the beginning, the back-end and the head-end; on the Saturday after the second seizure, which was in February, Kennedy brought me down this unfirst accounted paper - the ream was open when he brought it down, and on Monday he brought down another ream; he cut that and laid part of it out, and set the boy to lay the rest out - he told me to join it; I had joined not quite three reams altogether when the officer came and seized them; I think I have seen Kennedy with a stamp in his hand, but I will not be sure - it was about a fortnight before the second seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you that day? A. Mr. Kennedy sent me out about four o'clock in the afternoon to Turner and Co., Bond-street, and when I came back I ran down stairs into the shop - Mr. Martin came to me at the bottom of the stairs; I could see quite plainly into the lower shop- I was within four stairs of the bottom, and could see about half over the shop; I saw Kennedy there - Mr. Martin came to me, and told me to go down to the other shop for a tub; I saw some paper laid on the table waiting for drying - directly I went to the bottom of the stairs Kennedy had something in his hand, and directly Martin came to me, Kennedy held his hand below the table; I was about a quarter of an hour gone for the tub - when I came back I went into the shop again; I saw this paper, which was on the table, charged and ready to roll off - it had got the duty stamp on it; if I recollect right there were two sixties - I had joined part of that paper myself in the morning; I did not notice whether it was first accounted, but when I came back it had the first account-mark, the frame and duty-mark on it - this was about a fortnight before the second seizure; when I went into the shop after the third seizure, Martin said to me, - Duffield, ayn't you ashamed to come to the shop again after joining the sheets in and then going and informing against me?" - I said, "Sir, it was not me that mixed the sheets. it was Mr. Kennedy:" he said, "I will have both you and Kennedy up" - he did not take me before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where was Kennedy standing with something in his hand? A. In Regent-street, on the side of the table in the shop under the show shop; the Excise people go to that shop - there is a gate and stairs to go to it; I am certain neither the charge nor the frame-mark were on the paper when I left; I had been join<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290042"></xptr>ing paper there that day, and Kennedy was working there; but nobody else - now and then a boy might come down from the other shop, but nobody worked there constantly; Kennedy and I were not very good friends - I believe he hit me two or three days before that, but we made it up; we have had several quarrels, but he never hit me before, and I have quarreled with him since I have been working at Starch-green - I cannot exactly say how long ago; we were not continually quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear anything about a fire? A. Yes; some paper caught fire under my table while I was out - that was in Regent-street; it was in the morning - I had a candlestick against the wall; it burnt down to where it was stuck and fell while I was out - there were papershavings there, but no wood-shavings that I am aware of; I had left the candle burning, and was out about a quarter of an hour - there was no one working in the room; Kennedy was gone down to Brewer-street - I believe the wall was not wood, but brick.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you leave the candle there to burn the house down? A. No; it was always put there.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live at Shepherd's-bush. On the 3d of May, I saw Joseph Duffield at the factory, Starch-green; Mr. Martin is my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Duffield say to you that he would do anything to do the fellows up as he had been ill used by them? A. Yes: he said he had been used very ill, and would do anything to do the b - g - rs.</p>

            . I am a block-cutter, and cut blocks for paper-stainers; I am employed by Mr. Martin - I knew Joseph Duffield. On the 14th of May I saw him at the manufactory at Starch-green; I work at the next table but one to him - he at first told the men they were carrying on the game as usual, and that there were forged stamps; a person came to me with the framemark of the stamps, and said he was afraid to work - I put on my spectacles, examined it, and found a little variation; I went to Duffield's table, he pointed out one piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at any time what he would do? A. That was on the 15th; some of the boys were talking about his turning informer, and he said Kennedy had served him out so, he would say anything to transport Jem Kennedy, for he had often caused him to be docked many a shilling.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW Q. They were observing that he had given information? A. They were calling him an informer, and he said this; he had before that produced paper to us which he said had not the regular stamps, and I saw a difference in them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Those you had seen a difference in, the officer pronounced to be good? A. Yes, that very day; Joe said, "I am wrong for once;" three officers were there, and examined them by the dividers.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. That was the frame-mark? A. Yes; the officer said it was all right, and blamed him very much.</p>

            . I am Mr. Martin's servant; Joseph Duffield told me he would go twenty miles to hang Mr. Kennedy; that was about twelve months ago - he has said nothing of the kind since.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COLE. I am a supervisor of the Excise. I was sent for to Martin's premises at Starch-green; the persons of the factory took me there to see some stamps, alledged to be forged - it was a frame-mark which had been torn off: I examined it, and it agreed with the genuine stamp; I understood that Duffield had torn it off; I found fault with him for it - it was a perfectly honest and fair mark.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290043"></xptr>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long have you surveyed paperstainers? A. About a twelvemonth; before that I was not acquainted with the duty; the figures 28 in the stamp were moved out a little distance by the wedge; being moveable figures, the appearance would depend on the size of the wedge placed between them - it had been placed in a different way to what it had before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it produced a different appearance? A. It did - that might produce a mistake, in his opinion; I found by putting the wedge right it would be as before.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could any person, using a fair observation of it, suppose it to be forged? A. It struck me the moment I saw it how it happened; Duffield did not tell me he was sure it was forged.</p>

            . I am an Excise-officer. I have surveyed Martin's factory since the 5th of April; I never was employed in such work before - I was called on in consequence of some complaint, and saw Joseph Duffield- he did not produce anything to me; a piece of paper was produced to know if it was our charging, or not - I said it was; I found no difference between that and our stamp, with the exception of the figures being turned; I asked to see the other end - Duffield said there was no stamp on the other end; I asked where it was - he said he had it, and gave it to me from his pocket; he said the stamp was not right, and he would swear it was not the officer's doing.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was it not the frame-mark that was pointed out as incorrect? A. Yes - not the charging-stamp; the figures were not placed straight - other papers were produced to me, and the figures were straight; he might suppose it to be wrong, certainly - I do not recollect whether Abraham Duffield was present.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN CLAGGETT. Q. Was there never an occasion when you and Clutton had both keys? A. No - I keep the key of the box, and he of the cupboard; I never had that, nor had he ever the key of the box.</p>

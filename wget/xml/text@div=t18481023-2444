                  </hi>. I live at 1, Elliott's-place, Lambeth, with my sister, who is the mother of the deceased boy, Robert Woodrow—he would have been thirteen years old next Jan.—he came home on Saturday evening, 9th Sept., from Mr. Randall's, his master, a boot and shoemaker, at Camberwell—he sat down on a chair, and complained of his head aching—I asked what made his head ache, and he said a boy had struck him at the back of his head, and he said to me, "Aunt, feel what a lump I have got?"—I felt a lump, about the size of a nut, behind his ear—I did not think it of any great importance; I thought it was only a cold—he told me his nose had bled at his master's—he went to bed—he awoke me in the night, and his nose was bleeding violently; it poured out all over the bed, I suppose it was more than ten minutes before I could stop it, he went to bed again, it bled again about ten o'clock on the Sunday, and again twice that day, equally violent—he complained of pain in his head—he went to his employment on the Monday, and every day up to the Thursday, but he complained, and was getting worse every day—on the Thursday he came home earlier than usual, and said his head was so bad that he could not do anything at his masters—he went again in the morning, but came home directly, and went to bed—at went again on the Saturday, but he was still very bad, and his master let him come home very early in the evening—he was then very ill indeed, still com<lb></lb>plaining of his head—he never went to work after that—his master asked him to come on the Monday, and he went, but could not stop—on the Thursday following we called in Mr. Thomas, and he attended him till he died, which</p>

               <p>was on Friday, 6th Oct.—I was speaking to him a short time before he died—he told me he was sure he should die that night, and he did die that night—I said to him, "My dear, you are on your death-bed now; are you sure that what you said to those gentlemen, (meaning Mr. Norton, the Magistrate, and his clerk,) was the truth?"—he said, "Yes, aunt; was I to die this moment, what I said was the truth"—several times in the course of his illness he said if he died that boy would be the cause of his death who he had pointed out to me as we were going to Camberwell—the prisoner had passed us, and he said, "That is the boy that hit me on the head."—he did not say that loud enough for the prisoner to hear—he took an oath, when the Magistrate was there, that he never knew a boy of the name of Cole, or Coles—he repeatedly told me during his illness that he never knew nothing of a boy named Cole—he never, at the time he was dying, said anything about a boy named Cole—about half an hour before he died, I asked him whether he had been fighting, and he said, "No, I never have; I never fought with any boy"—I mentioned the name of Cole to him, and he said he did not know a boy of that name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the London-road. I was seat for, and first visited the deceased on 21st Sept.—he complained of great pain in his head and behind his right ear—I examined it, but perceived nothing, and considered it was a disorder within the head that caused him to complain of pain there—there was no discharge—I went again on the Sunday follow<lb></lb>ing, and he then complained of having received a blow—the aunt told me first, and the boy himself afterwards—in consequence of that I examined the parts behind the ear, and on shaving the hair, found a small tumour on the projecting part of the bone—feeling there was matter or some fluid there, I made an incision, and there flowed a small quantity of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi>, or matter, very foetid—I saw him daily after that—on the Tuesday following, not considering the incision free enough, I made a larger one, and a small quantity more matter escaped, still very foetid—he gradually got worse—I attended him till he died, which was about twelve, or a little after twelve, on the night of 6th Oct., so 1 was informed—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on dividing the scalp, I found that portion situated over where the abscess was, in a gangrenous condition, and the pericranium was separated from the skull—it did not adhere as it ought to do—that was precisely over the tumour—the skull beneath the bone, beneath the section of the tumour, was in a state of <hi rend="italic">necrosis</hi> or mortification—on examining the inner portion of the skull more particularly, which contains the passage to the internal ear, it was in a very much more advanced state of mortification—the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> had a large patch of ulceration upon it immediately beneath the affected portion of the bone and scalp, and on removing the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> I found a portion of the bone in a slightly inflamed state—there was a small quantity of reddish white matter on the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, not like that which had escaped from the tumour—that was evidence of decomposition, arising from extended inflammation or fever—in my opinion death was caused by irritative fever, the result of this inflamma<lb></lb>tion and destruction of the parts—there was a small quantity of fluid in the ventricles of the brain, rather more than natural—hearing that he had received a blow, I should ho inclined to suspect that that was the cause of the disease under which he laboured, the fever, the inflammation, and the destruction of</p>

               <p>the parts—it might have occurred from spontaneous <hi rend="italic">necrosis</hi>, it does so some<lb></lb>times, without any external injury, if it is in the system—I cannot say that this was caused by external violence, I think it probable, but I could not say so positively—a very slight blow will sometimes produce <hi rend="italic">necrosis</hi> in an unhealthy subject—<hi rend="italic">necrosis</hi> does not affect the head so frequently as it does other parts of the body, as the legs or arms—the effect of a blow behind the ear would be very sensibly felt, because a variety of important nerves and veins pass in that direction—the discharge from the ear could not of itself cause death, but it might have been the result of a disease which would—he died of mortification—I did not take blood from him, he was not in a con<lb></lb>dition to bear it, the disease had gone so far—there was no symptom of any discharge in the other ear—I discovered nothing in his system to show a predisposition to any complaint in the ear, but I was not acquainted with his previous history—if he had disease, a blow would probably render it worse and accelerate death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Was the boy a <hi rend="italic">strumous</hi> or scorbutic subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I cannot tell either one way or the other—if there is a purulent discharge from the ear, that must arise from some disease either within the ear, or deeper—irritative fever is sometimes accompanied by deli<lb></lb>rium—I only perceived that he was light—headed on one occasion, five or six days before his death, but I heard that he had been delirious in the night—I gave a very small quantity of soothing medicine, not so much to subdue the irritation as from the great disturbance of the bowels—he was suffering from profuse diarrhoea—that would not, if it did not act as intended, produce wan<lb></lb>dering, not in the small doses I gave it, and combined with other medi<lb></lb>cines—it will do so sometimes, but the medicine did act as I intended—it was only administered on one or two occasions—I cannot say that the mark behind the ear was produced by a blow—the gangrene covered a space of four inches in length and two in breadth—all the symptoms were those of inflammation.</p>

I am a surgeon at Camberwell—I assisted Mr. Thomas in the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have heard his evidence, and concur with him so far as this, that I consider the boy died from irritative or hectic fever, caused by an abscess which had formed on the brain—apart from what we have heard as to a blow, it might have arisen from natural causes, from an abscess generated in the system, without external violence, particu<lb></lb>larly in a <hi rend="italic">strumous</hi> habit of body, or one of delicate formation—if there was a predisposition, a blow would accelerate it—in my opinion disease was ex<lb></lb>isting prior, probably, to the receipt of any blow, and that was indicated by the discharge from the ear—if he had received a blow, and this had been a consequence, I should have anticipated more disturbance of the head, bis intellect would not have been so good as it was, and there would have been vomiting—he ought to have been kept perfectly quiet—if the abscess was caused by a blow, it must have been a very violent one, and in a very bad state of constitution—I should not think a blow from the hand of a boy like the prisoner would produce it.</p>

On the 27th of July a neighbour of mine came and told me if I would look about I should miss some lead, and that the two men that stole it were at the Sun Alehouse, in Clement's-Lane. I went to the place, and found the lead was missing near the side of a still, then went to the alehouse, and found Lightholder there, and charg'd him with it. the other was run away. Lightholder said, if I would be favourable to him he'd carry me to the place where he had sold the lead.</p>

I took it away, sent for a constable, and took the woman and Lightholder to Justice Fielding's; there was Justice Bedwell; when I came there Everard was there also. They both confessed they stole it in my hearing before the Justice; the woman had owned before she had bought it of them for 13 d.</p>

               <p>Reading. I believe the woman is more to be than they, and if it had not been neighbours desiring me to prosecute her, I not have done it.</p>

On the 27th of July in the afternoon about four o'clock, I was standing at my I saw the two prisoners go by me, and Lightholder had a tool bag on his shoulder, he it the other; shoulder, it seem'd to be pretty heavy, I followed them to E. Shepherd's house, there I heard them throw it down in the shop, without asking any questions at all. I saw them come back again empty, putting money into their pockets; then I followed them to the Rising  there they call'd for a pint of beer; I asked the landlord where hey work'd; he said, they work'd at one Mr. Barnard's, a distiller, in Clare-Market: thinking it was Mr. Barnard's, I went there, and he informed me it was at the next door, at Mr. Everard's. After that I went to the woman's house, and there we found the lead, 30 pounds. We took Lightholder and the woman before the justice, and when we came there, the other prisoner was there; they both confess'd it, and the woman said she gave half a crown and two pence half penny for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the men the look of thieves ?</p>

               <p>Eliot. Because lead lies closer than tools.</p>

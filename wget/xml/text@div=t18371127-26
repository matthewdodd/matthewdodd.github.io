                  </hi>. I live in Cottage-grove, Mile-end. On the 3rd of November I was in High-street, Wapping, at a quarter before ten o'clock in the morning—my attention was called to a public-house, and on looking at my pocket I missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner at that public-house, standing in front of the bar—Endersbee pointed out my handkerchief to me, and I gave it to the officer when he came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Wapping. I was at my door on the morning of the 3rd of November, and saw the prisoner dodging behind the prosecutor, and endeavouring, while some horses were passing, to draw his handkerchief, but between the two horses I distinctly saw him take the handkerchief from his pocket—I believe he saw me—he went into the Queen's Arms public-house, and threw the handkerchief behind the bar—I charged him with stealing it—he took his hat off, and said, "It is my own handkerchief," meaning one in his hat—the prosecutor said that was not his—the landlady came out, and said, "Here it is, behind the stone-bottle," and the prosecutor claimed it</p>

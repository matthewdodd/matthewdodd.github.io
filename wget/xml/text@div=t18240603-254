            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 22d of May I went to the shop, No. 84, Fleet-street, City; the name of</p>
               <p>"R. Carlile" is over the door - having received instructions from persons in the office of the Solicitor of to Treasury - it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - I saw the defendant in the shop - he was alone, standing behind the counter - I went in and inquired for the last number of</p>
               <p>"The Republican" - he took it from a small place behind the counter, and gave it to me - this is the pamphlet (producing it) - I paid him 6 d. for it - I marked it before it went out of my possession - I have put my initials, and the date on which I bought it, on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember asking me for any thing else - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath - be particular - A. Yes, I did; I asked for</p>

               <p>"Palmer's Principles of Nature." - A. On my oath I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say I need not be afraid, for you were going into the country - A. I did not, on my oath - I know that you knew me - you asked how a person belonging to our office was, and said you owed him 3 s., and told me to tell him you would call in the evening and pay him; and said,</p>
               <p>"I shall, perhaps, be able then to put you or him into some information that you are not aware of."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the reply you made - A. The reply I made was for you not to tell the person you spoke of that I had been there buying this work - I said I did not think I should see him till late that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher in Hungerford-market—the prisoner has been in my service about fifteen months. On the evening of the 26th of Oct., about half-past six o'clock, I left my counting-house, which is at the end of the shop, for about a minute or a minute and a half, leaving the prisoner in the shop—I locked the cupboard, and left the key in it—when I returned I found the prisoner still in the shop—about an hour afterwards I went to the cupboard, and missed a sovereign, which I am certain had been there when I left the cupboard—there were four in one place, and one in another—it was one of the four that I missed—I had left no one there besides the prisoner—I asked him if he had been into the counting-house—he said "No"—I said he must have been, for I had lost a sovereign, and I had suspected him for the last fortnight—he denied it—I sent for a constable, and, just before he ar<lb></lb>rived, the prisoner pulled the sovereign out of his pocket, gave it to me, and begged pardon.</p>

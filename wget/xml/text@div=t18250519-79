On the 6th of May I missed some articles from my apartments in the house of Mr. Steitman - the prisoner lived there, and I spoke to him about searching his box - I went with him to his room and saw his box - he tried several keys on a bunch, but they would not open it; a carpenter was then sent for and the box was open; I found there a shirt, a silk handkerchief, and a neckcloth, which I had not missed, but they were mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the box unlocked the second time you saw it? A. Yes; any person can have access to the room; it is not locked - there are twenty-three scholars in that house.</p>

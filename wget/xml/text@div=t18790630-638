                  </hi>, I am a weigher in the employer of Bryant and Co., coal-merchants—they sent me to see about weighing some coals which had been delivered to Mr. Howe, and testing whether they were short weight after they were delivered—I went to 8, Wyndham Road, Camberwell, and saw Howe—I said "I have come from Mr. Bryant to have the coals weighed up, as you said they were short weight"—he said "I will not have them weighed up"—I said "For why?"—he said "I had got about a hundredweight in the cellar, and I shall not think of such a thing"—I said "We will allow for the hundredweight in the cellar and for what little you have burnt"—he said "No, I shan't have them picked up"—I went away, and went again in a day or two; I saw him after he took out the summons, and said "I have come down to see you about this short weight"—he said "I don't want to be talked over by a parcel of fellows like you"—I said "I beg your pardon, I have not come to talk you over at all"—he came out of his house, and said that he had some business to attend to, and went to the corner of the street; he asked me to have a drop of ale, and I went to a public-house with him, and he told me that such jobs as these paid him—I said "Why?"—he said "I have got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of a merchant before, and I shall get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for reporting this job; Mr. Bryant is bound to be fined 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "That will be 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "The Clerk of the Court told me I shall be entitled to half the fine"—I said "That is 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for reporting and half the fine—I said "I don't believe you if these jobs pay you"—he said he had to get to business, so I left him—he said the coals would not burn long as they were rubbish; he also said "I took the summons out"—I said "I am sorry for it, as you have your weight of coal"—he said "Why?"—I said "I weigh the coals for more than one merchant, and one merchant will oblige another; you would be likely to get me into disgrace"—he said "I am sorry for you, but I shall let the matter take its course"—I then left, and went to Mr. Bryant—I had weighed the coals before they went out, and they were the correct weight.</p>

It was arranged at Hammersmith Police-court that I should prove the notes of the hearing of the summons against me, to save the clerk's attendance—the clerk checked the copy that was marked by the Magistrate—I am prepared to say that those notes are correct—it was the hearing of Saturday, 22nd March.

Jones Thackeray was here put in and read, in which he stated that he ordered the coals in question, weighed them, and that every sack was short weight, and that he signed a receipt for them, less</hi> 92 <hi rend="italic">lb. short. The summons was marked "Dismissed</hi>, 10 <hi rend="italic">guineas costs to defendant; Distress or Two Calendar Months."</hi>) I carry on business in Westbourne Grove, Bayswater—I knew of this order before it was executed, and waited till it was executed—the first information I had about it was a policeman serving me with a summons—I was not present at the interview between Jones and Hinchliffe—I em<lb></lb>ployed Mr. Roach, my solicitor, to defend the summons, and Mr. Montagu Williams appeared for me at the police-court—I was summoned by Jones, and Mr. Roach cross-examined him—after the summons was dismissed I commenced proceedings by my solicitor's advice, and they have been carried on by me entirely—Jones and Pike did not appear to answer my charge of conspiracy, but Howe walked into the Court, who I did not know was mixed up in the matter, and told the Magistrate that he was very much surprised that they were not present, as he had very recently left them, and expected them to be there—he left the Court to look for them, I understood, and my Counsel and I waited there some time for them—a number of other cases were taken, but they did not come, and I got a warrant at once—Thackeray has never been found—I am told that Pike surrendered to the warrant—Howe was bail for him, and then I discovered facts and Howe was charged—since this charge was made coals have been weighed very much more; it was very rare indeed that they were weighed before—the prisoners have been partly on bail and partly in prison—I never heard of any short weight in my life except in this instance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman employed by Mr. Cole, coal-merchant—I took a ton of coals to a private house 8, Wyndham Road, Camberwell, on 8th January—Howe opened the door—I gave him the ticket already receipted, "Received per the carman," with the address at the back—he said "I want to see them weighed"—there were 10 sacks—I pulled the scales out, and weighed them—the first sack was a little overweight—I took a bit off, and carried the sack round into the yard, and shot it into a bin—Howe went with me—the second sack was weight, and he showed me another place in a shed in the yard to put that one, and he then went back to the van—the third sack was not quite weight—I said "Well, it's strange if that is not weight and the others are," so I put on the bit I had taken off the first sack, which nearly made it right—I shot that in the shed with the second sack—it took me seven or eight minutes to go there and back each sack—the sacks were all short weight after the first—I kept on putting coal out of another sack to make up the weight; there was about three quarters of a sack short out of the ten—I said "It's a curious thing, the two first sacks were right enough; I cannot carry these, they are too full"—he said "Oh, I understand weighing coals if you don't!"—he weighed them, and I put them on the scales—I put the weights on first—Howe did not produce any weights; he held the sacks on the waggon to keep them from falling while I got down—after I had done loading I went into the room, and asked him to sign the ticket—he wrote this on the back: "Received 18 cwt., less weight of one sack, George Howe, not paid"—I cannot write or read—Pike was with him in the room; I had not seen Pike before—I did not get the money, and I took the ticket back to my master—I had no more coals in the van.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had 10 sacks in all—I had to use about three parts of a sack to make up the others—the first was over weight, the second was right; I did not say at the police-court it was short—the third sack was short—I said it was a very strange thing that all the sacks should be short after the first two—I told the Magistrate of that conversation—if I said that the second sack was short it was my mistake—Howe's hands must have been dirty, as he held the sacks while I got off the waggon—I never heard of "tailing" a van by making the first sack over weight, or of "heading "a van; I am sure it is not done in our firm—I never loaded a waggon.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300099"></xptr>
               <p>they weighed after that—the second sack was about 1 1/2 lb. short—I carried that round, and put another on; I told them they had no business to shift the weights, and should leave them where I put them; they said they were not put right—I said they were—then the dark man fetched a policeman, and some little weights—the policeman came, and stood about 4 yards away while they weighed the third sack—the third, fourth, and fifth sacks were short; I do not know how much—they put the small weights on the top of the sacks—no money was paid—they said they would see the collector, and Pike signed the ticket.</p>

Pike, 6, Station Road, Camberwell," and gave it to me as his reference—he gave me no address—the coal-cellar is a shed at the bottom of the garden—I saw Pike outside waiting for hir—I did not see him again—I moved away and was not there when the coals came—I saw no furniture brought—I am not aware that either Howe or Pike slept there—I saw some coals in the shed after the key was sent me through the post—we went twice to get the reference but could not find it—I found Mrs. Pike, but could get nothing about Ferris—my husband then wrote this letter and received this reply: "April 5, 1879. Mr. W. J. Penley. Sir,—Mr. Ferris is laid up with a very bad foot, both bunion and gout' He requests me to send you the key of room, the only key he had, and says he cannot possibly get out to pay his money for the next few weeks.

As I am informed you make a regular practice of sending short weight, I intend to-morrow to apply at the police-court for a summons against you, as I consider coals are quite dear enough without your swindling poor people out of 2 cwt. or more per ton. I thought perhaps you would consider me uncourteons if I did this without giving you due notice, so that you might attend and resist the application, as you may consider your defence on the day of hearing quite sufficient.—Yours, &amp;c, George Howe.")

To Robert Capon Cole, Esq. Sir,—One of our friends, a Mr. Ferris, ordered some coals of you this week, and desired me to attend and see them weighed and delivered. I did so, with the following result The first sack was about 21b. short weight, the second correct, the third 21b. over weight, the fourth 141b. short, and the fifth 41b. short, and on looking at the coals delivered I find them very far from the quality described upon the delivery note. I have therefore arranged to call at Hayes Place, Lisson Grove, to-morrow morning, to arrange course of proceedings to be taken. Our agent at Kensington sent me word during the week that the previous Saturday's proceedings had frightened Cole's people, and they were sending them out better but not quite right, as they were working in a light sack whenever it looked safe to do so. I knew you had nothing better than Silkstones, and should have advised that description to be ordered, but as you have discontinued the advertisement, did not know your address. I am afraid your sending them as best Wallsend, and charging extra for them on account of the name you bestowed upon them, will be likely to cause you trouble. I am determined to put an end to the robbery to the public in the matter of coals; am thereform forming an association for the purpose. We purpose issuing 5,000 circulars, and intend, if possible, to have at least one conviction each week to publish. I intentionally tell you this, as I am told one of your neighbours say that you must all combine to put an end to this weighing job.

If I a trifle more"—the "X" means full weight, and coals not marked I were light weight—but they were Pike's coals, not mine—I supplied coals to his customers light weight or full weight, and he was responsible—it was a regular practice for Pike to send out light weight in his own trade—he was not my agent four years ago—his coals were delivered in one of my vans without our name being displayed, only the Government name as we call it, because he would not like his coals to go out with another merchant's name displayed in front—they were sometimes delivered in his vans till I stopped it—I paid two sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one in January and the other in February—I had not heard of Whiteley's case then—when I first saw Howe I offered to give him the deficiency in the coals to make up the weight—he said "No, I expect a ton, and shall summon you"—he did not on that occasion demand money, nor did I promise any—I never saw him again—Mr. Mead saw him—no one else was there but Pike, to whom I sent regular deliveries of coals not properly weighed—that has ceased for four years, and Pike owes me money—Mr. Mead was too ill to attend the police-court, and has only recently recovered—I said at the police-court "I instructed him to pay the money as I did not wish to be summoned—I could not fight that case—the coal was not weight on being sent out—the bag was merely filled from pressure of business, and there being no one at the weighing machine."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That refers to the loading of the coals for Howe—I found the men loading the coals like that, and they had formed a gang—I warned them and said "Be very careful you have the correct weight in the sacks"—I have no sacks holding less than 2241b.—they are all the same size—I saw them, and believe they were full weight.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my three brothers carry on the trade of coal merchants at 47, Euston Road, and the Elephant and Castle Station—we received an order on 10th April for one ton best coals for Mr. Farrer, 8, Wyndham Road, Camberwell—this is a copy of the bill sent with the coals—the original was at the police-court—there were three summonses against us, one for short weight and defective machine; another misquoting the Act of Parliament, 104 instead of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and another to correct that error—I was fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and have appealed to a higher Court on the ground that the Magistrate found as a fact that there was no fraud in the matter, and the other two summonses were dismissed—I received from our manager at the Elephant and Castle on 15th April, when the carman returned from delivering the coals to 8, Wyndham Road, this card: "George Howe, Secretary, Coal Consumers' Protection Association"—I went on the follow<lb></lb>ing Friday and again in the evening to Wyndham Road, but could not see Farrer—I had seen Whiteley's case in the newspapers the week before, and observed he was prosecuting two men—I went to Hammersmith Police-court the week after while that charge was being preferred—I instructed my solicitors, Messrs. Roach and Sons, to appear for me at the Lambeth Police-court—the scales were perfect when they went out, and the coals full weight—I did not see them weighed, but have no doubt my men did their work properly—I have never permitted short weight—the coals from Euston Road are drawn from the King's Cross sidings, Great Northern Railway, and all coals weighed on the weighing machine of the King's Cross Company—on</p>

               <p>the back of this card is written, "Received one ton, less 581b. short Not paid, 581b. short"—the Magistrate dismissed the summonses for short weights and defective weighing machine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fine was for not setting out the Act properly, that was a printer's error—I said at the police-court "The chapter of the Coal Act was misprinted on the ticket The printer was sworn and said he and my manager consulted and agreed upon this form as more convenient than those we had in use before. The ticket left out the number of sacks and the number of pounds in them"—the other two summonses were dis<lb></lb>missed four or five weeks ago—I had given evidence at Hammersmith—I said at Hammersmith "There are now two summonses hanging over my head for imperfect scales"—in that case a constable and a scavenger swore to short weight in the last of the defendant's sacks—I am manager to the Tyne Main Coal Company; it is not a limited Company—there are other persons in it besides myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The three summonses were taken out after I had seen Howe at the police-court on Whiteley's case—I was keeping the scales for inspection—I attended at Lambeth—the other scales were cheesemonger's scales on which the charge of short weight was made—I did not believe they would weigh 124 lb., and I examined them and sent a practical manu<lb></lb>facturer to look at them.</p>

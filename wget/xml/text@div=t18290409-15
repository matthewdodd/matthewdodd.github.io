            . I am an officer. I first saw the prosecutor in Eastcheap - the prisoners were then following him, and I watched them; they followed him up Philpot-lane, into Fenchurch-street, and opposite Ironmonger-hall, Berton took the handkerchief out of Mr. Grantoff's pocket; he looked round several times to see if he was watched - Stay was close behind him; they both turned round, and were coming back - I was behind them, and went to lay hold of them both, but Berton threw the handkerchief down, and run away; I laid hold of Stay - White, who was with me, followed Berton, and brought him up in about three or four minutes.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

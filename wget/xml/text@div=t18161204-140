On the 4th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was rather intoxicated, and a woman enticed me home with her. I fell asleep. I do not know who took it.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL NATHAN. I am a slop-seller. I live in East Smithfield. The prisoner came to my shop, on the 5th of November, and offered the watch for sale. I asked him, if it was his own; he said, it was given to him by a man on Tower-hill, and he had come to sell it for him. I detained him, and sent to Tower-hill; he then said, if you must know whose it is, it is mine. I searched him, and found the chain and seal on him. I had asked him before, if he would sell the chain; and he said, he had not got it.</p>

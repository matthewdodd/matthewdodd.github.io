               <p>I am a constable of Mile-End Old Town. About three in the morning of the 6th of February some people came to the watch-house and enquired for an officer. I was sent for. They said somebody was stealing hay from a stack. I went down with them to the World's-End Stepney; there I saw the two prisoners, and the son of Stevens, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220020"></xptr> keeps the World's-End, who is now sick in jail, lying upon some hay, in a kind of an hovel; they were asleep; I waked them; they said they had been locked out and that was the reason of their sleeping there. I asked where they got that hay? Stevens said he bought it of two men. Neither of the prisoners said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Do you know what the prisoners are? - No, I never heard any thing before of them.</p>
               <p>Whose hay was it? - It belongs to the assignees of William Green, a bankrupt at Stepney.</p>

I said, Very well, and went away. I saw the prisoners there; they were putting the hay into the hovel.</p>
               <p>Did you know them before? - I have seen them before at a publick-house. They lived in White-Horse-street, I believe.</p>

               <p>The watchman who saw these people coming along with the hay, came to where I lodged, and called me and said somebody was stealing my master's hay. I got up as soon as I could and went down to the field with him; I saw the hay was tumbled about. They were gone. It belongs to Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>Was he in possession of it at that time? - No, the assignees, the persons mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Glenton. Murray said, as he was going to the watch-house, I should not have been here if I had not been led into bad company.</p>
               <p>What were they doing in the hovel? - They were lying there; the officer put in his hand, and pulled them out by the legs. I gave one in charge to Lloyd.</p>

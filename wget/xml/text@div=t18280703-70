Last Sunday, I went to see a friend, and left him about twenty minutes after two o'clock in the morning - I then met the prisoner in Oxford-street; she asked me to go home with her - I went with her down some back streets, and she went to a door-way and could not get in; I was ashamed to go home to my wife as it was so late - I should have been knocking or ringing a long while; the prisoner then took 10s. from my waistcoat pocket - I am sure I had it there; I did not take hold of her, as I was afraid she would say I was robbing her; I went and looked for a watchman - I was sober- I told the watchman of her, as I had taken particular notice of her person; he said he thought she was gone down the square - I went there, but could not find her; I afterwards met her in Oxford-street, and I said "My good woman give me my 10s. before you and I get into any bother;" she said she would see me d - d first; I gave charge of her - 9s. and some copper was found on her; I had 10s. in shillings, and a half-crown in my pocket; two half-crowns were found on her; I had not given her this money - I intended to have given her 2s., but I had not taken it out of my pocket.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner, and found on her two half-crowns, and 4s. in silver, and 1s. 1 1/2d. in copper - she said she had been with the man and did not deny that it was his money.</p>

I had got some money from some gentlemen; I met this man after two o'clock - he said he would like to go and take a walk with me; I said he might- he did so, and then I said I would not be made a fool of, he had been with me and I would be paid for it, and I would have my money.</p>

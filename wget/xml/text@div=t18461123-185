                  </hi>. I am master of St. Mary Lambeth workhouse, and an officer of the Guardians of the Poor of that parish. The prisoner, Henry Shergold, was employed to drive our cart, with supplies of bread and meat, to Norwood, where we keep the infant poor—he did not live in the work-house—his food was found him in the house, and he was generally from two to four hours a day in the house—he lived in some lodging with his wife—the cart that went to Norwood was always in the workhouse yard—it was loaded there—on Friday, the 13th of Nov., in consequence of information, I gave Henry Shergold into custody—I afterwards went with the constable to where he lodged, and found his wife, Mary Shergold—the constable found forty-six duplicates there.</p>

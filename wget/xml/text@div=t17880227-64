               <p>To Robe. When did the prisoner first come into your family? - About three weeks before the things were stole; we did not miss any thing till the 7th of February, the morning she went away; the things were there the night before; she was taken up eight days afterwards, when she gave me an account of those things which I have found.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the things he accuses me of, which are not found; when he met with me he desired me to let him know where the things were, and promised on the word of a man that he would not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said if she would shew me the duplicates of the things, I would not be hard upon her; she said she had no duplicates; when she came to the bottom of London Bridge, on the other side, she tried to get from me, and ran down an alley, on that I called a constable directly.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promise? - No, none at all; I said I would not trouble her; those were the words, if she would give me the duplicates; she said she had no duplicates.</p>

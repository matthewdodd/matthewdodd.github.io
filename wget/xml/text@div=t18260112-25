We used four sorts of letter on Eagle and Young's book; Freeman's Reports had small pica and brevier. While he was in my service I missed the type of three pages of Archibald's work, which had been set up - and I observed that long primer got scarcer than usual.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you the bill-book in which the compositor's work is entered? A. I have - (producing it) - he came into my employ in the beginning of September; I charge you with stealing long primer and brevier not in the cases; a person named Pittock was also employed on this work: Bird, Smith, and Hamilton were compositors, working at the same time as the prisoner. Hamilton was overseer, and generally worked in another room. I have the upper part of two houses; there is a staircase to each house. I have five apprentices - four of whom were employed on Freeman's Reports, at different times - I have taken two of them before the Chamberlain, for misconduct, but never charged them with robbery. The brevier type was cast by Austin - he supplies other printers. A man could take out 20lbs. of type at a time without being seen.</p>
               <p>MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Austin makes for other printers, but he makes the letters singly, not in words? A. No; no other printers were engaged on this work. The prisoner charges in this book for composing signature 4 L., and correcting it; he would have all the type of that sheet before him - it was his duty to distribute it after printing, and put it into the proper cases.</p>

            . I am a printer. The prisoner called on me - I bought of him the type produced - this is exactly in the same state as when I bought it - it is set up - here are 4000 letters in this part; I am certain of two parcels, which contain about 8000 letters; I bought them on the 17th of December - I have his receipt for it - here are other parcels; the two parcels are brevier - here is another piece, of about 1000 brevier letters - it is all in the same state as when I received it; I bought all the brevier on the 17th; in all here are 5000 brevier and 4000 long primer letters; the weight is about 16lbs. I live at No. 45, Hackney-road. I bought the long primer on the 20th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I ever shew you specimens of any type? A. Yes, on one occasion; I did not buy it; I think it was small pica. I once bought some pica of him and some leads.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever ask him where he brought this type from? A. He came to me about the middle of the month, stating that one Taver, whom I knew, had informed him I was buying type for a printing-office - that he had bought a quantity under an execution, to go into business as a master printer; but having changed his views he was determined to sell it; I knew him four years ago as a journeyman printer, and did not hesitate about it, having heard that he had been in business; I gave him 1s. per lb. for the brevier, and 7d. for the long primer.</p>

               <p>MR. M'DOWALL here handed to the Jury the works in question - he himself reading from the type, which exactly corresponded with the impression - among which was signature 4 L, which the prisoner had composed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long Defence, complained of the prosecutors having influenced his friends against him, and persuaded them not to come forward on his behalf, and con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120018"></xptr>tended that there was no proof of the property being Mr. M'Dowall's - that he had purchased it fairly.</p>

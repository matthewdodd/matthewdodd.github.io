On the 19th of August, at one o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner in the shop - nobody was with him; he was in the shop when I first saw him - I saw him standing in the shop, and went in; he was standing by a chair, on which a tray stood, containing rings and brooches; his hands were on the tray: I did not observe him take any thing - he said, "Is there another No. 45?" and ran out - I heard something chink as he ran away, and followed him out of the shop, calling Stop thief! I saw some persons run after him - he was brought back in two or three minutes, and I knew him to be the same person - some property was given to the officer; the prisoner did not ask to buy any thing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had left my place a week, when I met a porter in Parliament-street; I asked him if he knew of a situation - he said he did, at No. 45 in the next street - I went to No. 45, Bridge-street; I did not see a bill in the window, which he said I should see - I asked if there was another No. 45, and she said not; I immediately went into the stone-yard, as I had occasion to go there - they came and charged me with stealing property; I had not left my place a week, and had no occasion to do it - they say I went in and took a handful out; was it possible I could snatch a handful of things, and run out with them, if they were properly placed in the shop?</p>

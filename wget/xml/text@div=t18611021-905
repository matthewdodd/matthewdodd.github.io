                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe your brother was in the employ of the Company at Southampton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—I had nothing whatever to do with him; no duty of making any report about him—I learnt that he was deficient, and I let him have the money—the prisoner had a pony and trap—he never complained, so far as I know, that his duties were greater than he could perform—300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the balance in favour of the Company that I found in my bands—that was not the exact sum—I have looked to that matter since the last trial—I should have in the course of my business a quantity of vouchers, showing the receipts of money by me—at the time I have spoken of I found that there was a balance of money beyond the amount of the vouchers—that was the way in which the sum of money Was</p>

               <p>made up that I gave in favour of the Company—I have satisfied myself to a certain extent as to how that happened—I conclude that it was from inaccuracies in the entries of the clerks at the Nine Elms station; not at any other station—finding that sum of money in my hands I represented it to the traffic manager—it had been accumulating about eight years—the prisoner had nothing whatever to do with that accumulation; it did not affect him at all—the desirability of laying aside 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to meet deficiencies was not at all applicable to the duties of the prisoner—the prisoner has never throughout the investigation suggested that he has paid any one of those sums to my servants—I have now all the books to which I was desired to refer to come to a conclusion on the subject of this affair—this book which is before me, and my rough cash-book, would be the books pre<lb></lb>sent before me at the time I received that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of 20th April, on the Saturday night—the book I have by me is the register of accounts to be collected—I should have a list of accounts handed to the prisoner for the purpose of collecting, and when he paid me over what he purported to collect, I should have that account then before me—I used to call out every item that was standing over, so that in the ordinary course of business I should call over Pantin's account; the prisoner having this book at the time with him—it was at the time I did so that he said Pantin's account was not paid—I did not hear Crouch desire him to collect the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that account did not pass me—the writing at the bottom of this page is the prisoner's—that entry shows that he was desired to make that collection by Crouch—having been so desired it would be his proper duty to account to him for it, and, being so, it would not be called out from the collecting-book—there is, in Fry's writing, No. 455 against thin item of Pantin's, and there is a reference to this entry in my book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the down office of the London and South Western Railway Company at Nine Elms—I gave two bills to the prisoner to collect these amounts, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has never accounted to me for either of these sums.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect when you gave them to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only by the bills, they are dated 2d April and-15th April, and I gave them to him within three days of those dates—I know that because I always make it a custom—I did not make it out on the 15th—I dated it the 15th because that is the date that the goods were for<lb></lb>warded—I made each of them out on the following day, I am quite sure of that; that is the custom which I have invariably adhered to—there may have been a mishap when it has been made out on the 2d day, or perhaps we could not do it the same day—I did not hand him other bills that day; I have no entries—I did not hand him these two at the same time—on the 2d or 3d, I handed him that bill which you hold in your hand—I cannot call to my recollection whether that was the only one—I keep no book which enables me to say what bills I handed to him that day—when the debt becomes due I make out the bill and hand it to Fry—I only handed him one that day—I am able to swear that because these two accounts were the only accounts he had to transact during the whole of April—there might be one or two small sums, but not one in a month—he paid me on the day or the day afterwards that he received it—I have not the book here in which he made the entry—he generally paid me in my office in the evening; after 6 o'clock when he returned from his collection—I have an office to myself—I have no recollection that he paid me any money in April; I cannot swear he did not—I cannot say as to March,</p>

               <p>because I have not got the books here, but those documents which you have in your hand were not paid to me—I know that, because I have referred to the book—I was not desired not to bring the book here—I cannot say whether these are the only bills I gave him in April—I never had any deficiency or mistake iu my accounts—there was not a mistake of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my accounts—I was not in Court when Mr. Hagreen gave his evidence—I was not a defaulter of 257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have never recognized such an account—I heard that the amount was 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not aware that Mr. Hagreen has said that it was 257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was said to be 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is about three months ago—they said that I was deficient 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the accounts have not been in<lb></lb>'acvestigated, and that matter remains in obscurity still, I believe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you give him this account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; one of Mr. Hagreen's clerks did—it is the usual way of business to pay the up office accounts to me—if the prisoner paid it to me I should have given him a receipt in his collecting book—I have no book of my own in which he would make an entry; this is the book that I always sign—it is the prisoner's book for entering up office accounts—the small one is the col<lb></lb>lecting book, and the large one he keeps in my office—he made entries in it on Friday evening or Saturday morning, and he generally paid me on Saturday morning—Tuesday was the 23d—if he received it on the 23d it would be entered in the cash book on Friday, and he should have presented it to me on the Friday or Saturday, because he always paid me once a week—he does not put down the date when he receives the money—he paid me no money after the 20th; I know that because I should have it entered in his own book—I have no book in which I enter it—when I get the money I pay it over to Mr. Stanford, who has been convicted—I keep an account in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) if I received money from the prisoner I used to enter it here—on 19th April, I received 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the prisoner—I have no means of telling what items that was composed of; the book tells me that it was made up of six items—I mean to say that that is the last sum he paid me—Mr. Stanford was in the office when he was in the habit of paying me—I made these entries at the time I received them from the prisoner—this is my book; it is copied from something else—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">here stated that he should withdraw this part of the ease, as the books were not present.</hi>—I may have made some mistakes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got the small collecting book there for the 20th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—these entries were made by the prisoner in the morning before he went out to collect—there is nothing to show whether he has received the money—he does not put "paid" by the side; but I call over the amounts, and ask him whether he has received them or not—he would take the bills out with him, and whether the money was paid or not he would leave the bill with the customer—he would come back without any bills, unless there was a disputed account.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he say that he was a very bad accountant and found it very difficult to keep his accounts correct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know that he had been going over the accounts; he appeared to be doing so—he said that he was making up his accounts—I am in the Company's service—I was not directed to look over the books, but it was part of my duty to do so; but not the prisoner's books, the books of the Nine Elms station—I had never gone through his books, but I had gone over the books of the station three months previously—I do not find a great many entries at Nine Elms—I have been employed by the Company fourteen years to-morrow.</p>

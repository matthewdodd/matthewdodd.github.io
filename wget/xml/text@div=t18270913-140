            . I am a constable. I was sent for on the 23d of August, and took the prisoner - she gave up some duplicates of this property, and said she intended to redeem them on Friday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had she been with you? A. Between four and five months: she might be poorly, but never had any medical attendant - there was 2l. 13s. due when I spoke to her; she had given me notice to quit, and the expiration of the notice would have been in two days. I will swear that the first time I missed any thing from her apartments, was on the Tuesday night previous to the Friday on which the notice would have expired. I spoke to her of it on the Wednesday - I gave her into custody on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My remittances did not come in, and I pawned some sheets, which the prosecutor knew of- and the day I was committed here, she told me she was not a fool, she knew I had done it. Poverty alone induced me so far to forget myself.</p>

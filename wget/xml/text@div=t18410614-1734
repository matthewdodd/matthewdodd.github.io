                  </hi>. I am a baker, living in Goswell-street. The prisoner was my journeyman—it was his duty to take out the bread to the cus<lb></lb>tomers—I received information, in consequence of which I desired the pri<lb></lb>soner to be watched—on the 19th of May he went out as usual, at a quar<lb></lb>ter after nine o'clock in the morning—he had a basket of bread to be delivered to the different customers—in a few minutes he was brought back by Brannan—he was searched, and some bread found on him, part in his hat, and part between his shirt and a third part, which made a perfect half-quartern loaf.</p>

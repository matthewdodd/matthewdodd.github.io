I perceived the lid of my basket move up, turned round, and saw the prisoner by my side. I asked if he had got anything of mine, he said,</p>
               <p>"No." I said,</p>
               <p>"I am sure you have," took hold of him, and found my pocket-book, with my purse and money in it under his jacket, in his hand. Brown came up and took him.</p>

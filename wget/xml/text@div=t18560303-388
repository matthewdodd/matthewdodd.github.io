                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. George Broad, a wool stapler, of Bellevue Villa, Peckham Eye. On Thursday night, 7th Feb., I went to bed about half past 11 o'clock, and left my mistress and one of the young ladies in the dining room—I fastened all the doors and windows, and left the place down stairs quite safe—I got up about 7 o'clock in the morning—about half past 7 o'clock I went into the pantry and found the pantry window open and the cruet stand gone—that window had been shut quite safe the night before and had not been opened for three months—the police afterwards showed me some meat, some cruets, and a coat—the meat was beef, pork, and mutton, such as had been in the pantry the night before—this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was hanging at the top of the kitchen stairs, and these goloshes were between the two pantries.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bellevue Villa, Peckham Bye, in the parish of Camberwell On this Thursday night the house was closed at half past 10 o'clock—I recognise these knives, goloshes, cruet frame, and coat—the coat belongs to my brother—I cannot identify this snuffer tray, but I lost one like it that night, I believe it to be mine—the prisoner Jackson was formerly in my employment, from about May, 1853, till Sept, 1854—since then he has never been to the house, to my knowledge—previous to that he was in our employ in Bermondsey-street—he did not sleep at the premises, only on one occasion for nearly a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jackson. Q.</hi> Can you swear to that coat by any particular mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not long before examined it very minutely, my attention was called to it from the material being composed of such fine wool, and at the same time feeling so coarse—I am not aware of any others being made of the same material—I identify it from another thing, it has suffered a good deal from rain, and the lining has got rather below the cloth—I am prepared to swear to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Walker. Q.</hi> Can you swear to the cruet stand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—by the repairs it has undergone, and its general appearance—I cannot say when I saw it last, it is generally put on the table each day—I can swear to it.</p>

About ten minutes, or quarter to 6 o'clock on Friday morning, 8th Feb., I was on duty in Grove-lane, Camber<lb></lb>yell, about a mile and a half from Mr. Broad's, with Turner, another con<lb></lb>stable—I saw the prisoners coming in a direction from the prosecutor's house—I stopped Walker—Turner stopped Jackson, who was behind—I asked Walker what he had got in the bundle—he had a bundle in his hand—he said some beef and mutton—I asked where he got it from—he said he had been to see his brother, at Sydenham, and he had given it to him—seeing that he had something bulky in his pocket, I asked what he had got there—he said "Two bottles of wine"—I asked him where he got that from—he said his brother gave him that also—I told him I should take him to the station—I did so and there searched him—in the bundle I found a piece of beef, about 71 bs. of loin of mutton, a piece of boiled pork, and a Pair of goloshes; and on his person a bottle of port wine, a bottle of gin, a cruet stand, a bunch of keys, a latch key, two tope of pepper casters,</p>

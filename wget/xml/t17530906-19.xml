            . I live in Whitechapel road, my husband is a shoemaker. I saw the prisoner go by without a child, and after that I saw her with a child crying very much; she was telling the child she had brought her up to good manners, and she said she should use such; then she call'd to some soldiers to take her. This was at the great garden gate; the child cry'd in the road. Then I went home after that. I saw her again and observ'd her; this was about half an hour after nine in the morning; the child was sitting her crying, I said, child, do you know that woman? the child said no: I said where do you live? she said at a baker's shop: I asked the child if she'd go with me, a woman coming by said it was Mrs. Tottey's child. I took it by the hand, then the child cry'd for its skirt, saying, O! my skirt, my skirt; then I took it from under the prisoner's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the child's name?</p>

               <p>Q. How was your child dressed that morning.</p>
               <p>M. Tottey. She had that skirt on, and a ribbon of about 3 qrs. of a yard on her head. I dressed her myself that morning; but when she was brought back she had neither the skirt nor the ribbon on. I had sent this and another to school together that morning.</p>

               <p>I am a poor working man, had been at the harvest at Kent, and was going down to Sussex, and as I passed through London I thought I would go to the fair and buy some wearing apparel; I had been bargaining for a pair of breeches, and pulled my purse out to pay for them, the prisoner asked me if I wanted a coat, I said I believe I should buy one before I left the fair; she said she would take me to her brother, where I should get a good one; I went, but did not like any one; I went out, and at another place was bargaining for a waistcoat, and she took the waistcoat out of my hand, and said she would double it up; I said she had no business with it, it belonged to me, so I took out my purse to pay for it, and took out the silver and put the purse into my waistcoat, and while I was feeling for three-penny-worth of halfpence, to make up the money for the waistcoat, she took the purse out of my pocket; I took hold of her hand to stop it, and a man ran between us, and I took hold of her immediately again, but the purse was gone.</p>

               <p>I searched her, and found nothing upon her; the man charged her with taking 1 l. 19 s. 6 d. upon the whole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a poor girl; I have lost all the use of my limbs on one side; my business is to stop at the shop door to bring in customers; I took this man to the Ship alehouse, and he did not deal, and when he came out he bought a waistcoat, and the people were jostling him about, and I went to him to double it up and to advise him to take care of it; no, says he; you b - h, I will put it in my bag; and presently he cries out, where is the woman; that woman, says he, you b - h, you have robbed me; they took every thing off me and left me as naked as I came from my mother, to search me, and found nothing; now, gentlemen, guilty or not guilty use, your own pleasure.</p>

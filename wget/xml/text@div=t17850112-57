             came to me in the morning, and he said George, I have found a watch, he gave it me, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Where is he? - He was a prisoner till he was released.</p>
               <p>Beckwith. Between five and six on Wednesday evening, the 29th of December, the prisoner came to our house, that was after the house was broke open, he said he could inform us of the person that could give a discovery of the robbery, I went with him to the public house, there was his brother, we took him before Justice Wilmot, the prisoner declared in my presence, that he gave the watch to his brother.</p>
               <p>Court. But that brother is not here, to shew that was the watch he gave to him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had another man taken up, that was released by the prisoner's confession; it was not signed, there was no pen, ink nor paper.</p>
               <p>What did he say before Justice Wilmot? - He said he concealed himself in the house.</p>
               <p>Did any body tell him it would be the better for him to confess? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What was his inducement to confess? - It was open free confession, he said he concealed himself about six in the evening, in the cellar, and after the man was gone to bed, he went into the parlour, he heard some watches going, which lay on the mantle-piece, and that induced him to take them; he did not go into the shop, but wanted to go out, he then went out, and left the door open after him.</p>
               <p>Was he threatened if he did not confess? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have to say as far as this, I was in bed and asleep at my father's house, at half after eight that night, and did not get up till eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. I take it to be an established rule, that confession without some circumstances is not sufficient, unless he should confess it again at the bar; if any of the property had been found about him, or he had been about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120084"></xptr> the place or the house at the time, or had had any knowledge of the place; but the mere confession of a crime without any one single circumstance to corroborate it, is not sufficient.</p>

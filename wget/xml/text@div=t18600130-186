I am an unfortunate girl, I live at No. 2, George-court, Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane; the prisoner, Campbell, who is thedeputy landlord, lived underneath me in the same house—I know Slater and Brown—they lived in the same court, a door or two off, but they had been away some time, and they came back about two days before they fetched away this property—I do not know anything of Sharpe—on Friday morning, about a fortnightago, I recollect Slater and Brown coming to the house where I and Campbell lived—Campbell was in bed when they came in—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock—I was overhead—I heard Slater say to Campbell, "Get up, for we have some property next door, in the parlour"—and I heard Campbell say, "I will get up," and with that he got up and went down stairs, but I do not know whether he went into the room or not—about two or three minutes after, I saw Slater come up stairs with a bundle—I was looking out of my window and I saw him go into the room with the bundle, and about half an hour after that I went down into Campbell's wife's room, and I saw two</p>

               <p>black robes, and I do not know whether it was one or two white robes—they were in Campbell's room—a little after that I saw Campbell in the court talking to Slater and I saw Campbell give Slater separately two half-crowns.</p>

I said I had found them; there was another police<lb></lb>man with him, how could I run away, or chuck the bundle away, with one on each side of me, one of the two must hare picked it up.

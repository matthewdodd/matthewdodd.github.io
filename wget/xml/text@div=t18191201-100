            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at the corner of Cursitor-street, about twelve o'clock, and heard a rattle spring, crossed the road by Lincoln's Inn Gate, and saw the prisoner jammed against the wall by a gentleman with an umbrella; I secured him, and the gentleman left. - I searched him but found nothing on him. I took him to the watch-house. I found the chain within about twelve yards from where I took the prisoner, by the railings at the back of Old-square,</p>

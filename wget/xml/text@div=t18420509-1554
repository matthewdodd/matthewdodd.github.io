On the eve of Good Friday, the 24th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, I was on duty in Silver-street, and saw the prisoner in company with Godwin, who was in his uniform as a policeman—they were pacing to and fro in Silver-street, for about half-an-hour—they then separated—Godwin placed him<lb></lb>self in a dark door-way, and the prisoner placed himself on the opposite side—as soon as they separated, I went to the prisoner, and asked him what he was waiting for—he made no answer—I asked him if he belonged</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 19, Silver-street, in the parish of St. Olave. On Thursday evening, the 24th of March, soon after seven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me for half-a-pound of list-binding, and a pennyworth of string—they came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I was to get them ready against he came again—he asked me what time I shut up my shop—I told him at ten—he said he should not be back at that time, it must be a little after ten—he went away—he had been several times to my shop before, both him and his wife—I never saw him after, till I saw him at the Mansion-house on this charge—Godwin came in that night a little after ten, after the shop was closed—I left the house that night in his custody, but saw nothing of the prisoner or any other person—after going to different station-houses, I got back to my house at two in the morning—when I left the house I had the keys of my street-door, shop door, bed-room, and back-parlour with me—all those doors were shut and fastened—I parted with the keys to Godwin, and had left in my bed room a time-piece, a dark bottle-green cloak with a very large cape to it, and four strings round the front—I missed them, and missed from the back-par<lb></lb>lour a pair of sheets, six yards of calico, a shawl, and apron—that was the sitting-room, the room behind the shop—the things were in a drawer—the shawl was a very dark one, with a very small border to it—it struck two o'clock as I was coming home—on going into the house I found the drawers in the lower room turned all about, and disturbed, and then missed these articles—I gave an alarm that the house was robbed—I have never seen the property again.</p>

On the evening before Good Friday I remember two persons coming into my house whose appearance attracted my attention—the prisoner Reynolds came in, looked round, and said, "It is all right," to a little man who was close behind him—the little man named Potts, had a bundle on his arm, and gave it into the prisoner's hand—it was a good sized bundle tied up in a dark shawl with a narrow border—I should say not wider than this—(<hi rend="italic">shewing her finger</hi>)—I cannot say what was in it—they laid it down with great care, as I thought, as if there was something brittle in it—they did not sit down—the prisoner turned to the little man and asked what he would have—he said a little drop of beer—he had half a pint, and the prisoner had three-halfpennyworth of gin, which he drank with his left hand—he never moved his right hand at all—they stopped a very few minutes—he said to the little man that he was very tired—the little man asked him to sit down—he said no, he was on very unpleasant business to-day, and he was afraid he must have some more, and would make the best of his way home, as he had some things to sell in the morning—the prisoner went out at the London-wall door, carrying the bundle in his left hand—he took it off the seat in front of the bar, and went away with it—the little man opened the door for him.</p>

I declare solemnly I never was in the house, and never saw the little man in my life, and he positively denies bringing me the bundle; he was locked up because he would not say he brought it to me, as they wished; if he did, must he not have received it knowing</p>

It has been said I went there and put some metal on the woman's premises, then sent Godwin there to get it, merely to entrap him, to transport him; now it is proved I did not bring any bundle in, or she must have seen it, which fully proves the falsehood of the report; the trial is to convict me, to get a commuta<lb></lb>tion of his sentence, but the prosecutrix proves he robbed her on the way to the station; I wish to call Leigh Wood, the City policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. On the 29th of March I recollect seeing the prisoner in Fenchurch-street between eight and nine o'clock at night—I was in the tap, at the Corn-market, afterwards—several persons looked in and nodded to me—I nodded in return—I cannot say the prisoner was one of them—I never saw him in Godwin's company—I never knew him by the name of Reynolds—I was sent with a police-ser<lb></lb>geant to find his residence, but could not find it—I went there afterwards but did not find any of Mrs. Lewis's property there.</p>

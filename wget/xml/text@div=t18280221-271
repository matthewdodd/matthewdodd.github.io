Last Saturday week I was at the prisoner's father's apartment from half-past one o'clock till half-past four - his father is my brother; I went there in consequence of a letter I had from Ireland - the prisoner was there; I believe his brother knew Mr. Bell; the prisoner was not sitting with his mother and me - his brother is older than him.</p>

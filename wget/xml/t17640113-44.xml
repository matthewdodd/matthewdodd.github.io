On the 22d or 23d of last month, there were about 200 hogsheads of tobacco: I saw the prisoner and two more, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the forenoon, behind the crane: I got upon a hogshead, and saw a lad that was with the prisoner take out a knife, and cut open the bar of a hogshead; the prisoner and he pulled tobacco out, and put it on the ground, till they thought they had enough; then they went to putting it into their pockets: I went and took hold of the prisoner, and took some of the tobacco from his pocket, and some from off the ground, (produced in court); this is it.</p>

Yes; I remember letting him into my mistress's house; I cannot say how long it was before my mistress was taken up; Mrs. Barnet was not up when he came; I went up stairs and called her; when I came down stairs, then he asked me for a pen and ink; I told him we had none in the house, if he stopped a bit I would go over the way to the chandler's shop and get him one; when I returned with it, I told him to be as quick as he could, for the people would want it; he pulled out of his right hand coat pocket a shawl, and blotted the corner of it. This is the shawl, there is a blot on it. My mistress came down in the kitchen; he was desired to step up stairs; he doubled up the shawl, took it with him; they went into the parlour together.</p>

I took him on the Friday evening; on the Saturday he had a hearing before the Lord Mayor. When I produced the warrant he said that he did not know Mrs. Barnet, or something to that purpose.</p>

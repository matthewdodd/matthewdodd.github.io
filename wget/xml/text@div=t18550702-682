                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the King's Arms, at Uxbridge; it is kept by my uncle, Robert Lemon—the prisoner was waiter—he came about 10 o'clock in the morning last Thursday—there are two tills in the bar; we keep silver in both—the prisoner did not go into the bar on Thursday; the money was taken on Friday—on Friday morning there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in one of the tills—there were three half crowns, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and the rest in shillings, fourpenny pieces, and sixpences, all silver—the prisoner went into the bar to clean the counter and the taps which are inside the bar—at the time he was there I was in the bar parlour, next the bar—he was in the bar about twenty minutes—as he was going out of the bar I went in—I went to the till, and discovered I had lost money out of the till, I thought from 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know I had lost two half<lb></lb>crowns, two or three shillings, and some sixpences and fourpenny pieces—I knew one of the sixpences, and that was one that was missing—it is here, the officer has it—I marked it, and know it particularly—it was in the till when I examined it before—the prisoner was going away—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—he was brought into the parlour—I saw the officer take money from him—this was on Friday—on Thursday the prisoner asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said he had no money—I told him my master did not allow me to lend him any money—from the time I left the bar till. I went in again, no one could have gone in but the prisoner.</p>

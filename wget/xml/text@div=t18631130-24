               <p>Mogul Tavern, in Drury-lane—before that I pawned a coat to lend him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked his wife to have some drink—the prisoner gave her a kick on the shins—I asked him was he mad, or what ailed him—I got ashamed, and left the private bar, and came out—I met him about five minutes after<lb></lb>wards, and asked him for the ticket of my coat, as I should be going home—we went up stairs to fetch it—he followed me down stairs—my wife was outside in the street, and he came out after me, and abused me and my wife—he followed me under an archway, came over right me, and stared me up in the face, and abused me—I said, "Go away from me, I want nothing at all to do with you; "<hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> him away—he came in at me again directly, stood <hi rend="italic">over right</hi> me, drew a knife out, and stabbed me in the eye—it cut my eye open there and then—my eye is quite gone—I struck out and hit him, and knocked him down, and then I fell, and somehow or other he rolled a-top of me, and he stabbed me in the arm—a lot of chaps came up, and pulled him off me—he saw my eye bleeding, and the sight running down with the blood—he ran away up Drury-lane—his wife knocked me about most fearfully—they got me upstairs in their place for fear the police should hear of it, and there I lay bleeding nearly to death—the prisoner came to me again with a candle and a knife in his hand—I was afraid he would cut my throat, and I got up and went to the door—he made several stabs at me, but did not touch me again with the knife—I lay there in fits all night and for two days after he deserted the house, with no one to give me even a drink of water, and not twopence in my pocket—at last, I wrote a letter to a woman and gave it to the prisoner's child to post, and she came and took me to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 1, Bedford-square—On 26th October the prosecutor came to the hospital; he was suffering from loss of blood, and had been lately labouring under the influence of drink—his eye was then hanging on his cheek, and erysepital inflammation was threatening to set in—I removed the string of the eye—he had a very severe illness; his life was in great danger for some days—the wound had been inflicted by a knife or some sharp instrument—the hard substance of the cornia was cut right through; it could not have been done by a fall; it must have been by a sharp instrument—he has completely lost that eye, and the sight of the other is seriously injured by sympathy—I remember the prisoner coming to the hospital with the prosecutor—he seemed to be his friend; there did not seem to be any unfriendly feeling on his part—he seemed to be anxious about his welfare, and I believe went up into the ward with him, and was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller and publisher, carrying on business at No.169. piccadilly. I have only one partner—I had a porter named Dennis Holland, in my employment lately—In consequence of information, I got a search-warrant and accompanied by Clements and Avis, the Marlborough-street police-officers, I went to the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>mises, in princes-street, St. James's—I saw the prisoner there—Cements was with me—I told the prisoner I had taken out a search-warrant, in consequence of being informed that there were stolen books of ours in his possession—I think I asked him if he had purchased any books with our names on the title-page—he sad he had—I then asked him if he had any of them—he said he hod—I requested him to produce them—he then took two or three volumes off the floor in a corner of the shop, from under some others, which I examined, and stated that I be lived them to be part of the property stolen—I inquired if he had no more—he them pro<lb></lb>duced two or three others—I inquired of he had no more—he began to look about the shop, and produced some others—he then assured me that he had no more on the premises—we went up stairs and searched, but found no others—do not remember the date of this visit, but it was last Saturday three weeks, or fortnight—on the Monday following we of a stranger, without making any inquiries—he stated that he had not—that he had purchased them of Dennis Holland, who said he was a binder, in our employ, and that we had paid him with these books, for his labour, in lieu of money—I then said it was an improbable story, and we went to the police-office—we paid a second visit on Monday—the first person we saw was peter Mudie—"Sweet's flower Garden" was then produced, I belive seventy-six numbers of it—and tied up in the same parcel, were found ten numbers of the "Botanical Register"—on the first visit we found one set of "Canning's speeches" in boards, perfectly new, and uncut—the selling prices of them is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the six volumes—we are the publishers—the prisoner said he paid Holland 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for "Sweet's Hortus</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Messrs. Ridgway. I am now a prisoner in Newgate. I knew the prisoner before I went into Mr. Ridgway's employ—the first time had spoken to him was about January last, and I went into Mr. Ridgway's employ about nine months ago—I had seen and spoken to him about two months before, in princes-street, where his shop is—he spoke to me—I had a book with me, as I was passing his door, and he asked what that was I had—I told him it was "Dr. Lindley's Lady's coloured Botany"—he asked if it was for sale—I said, "No"—he said, "Could You get me one?"—I said I would try—I had seen him before, when I had some waste paper; he asked what I had—I said, "cancelled pages"—he said, "If they are books I can give you a good price for them"—I had been about seven months in Messrs. Right-Ways'Employ—when I went past with the book—he asked what I had go and the price—I said, "12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., "—he said no, he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I said I would not take 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he said, "You bring me the book, I dare say we shall style about the price"—so I brought him the book; I think the same day, late in the evening, to the next morning—he gave me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and asked if I could bring him a plain one—the one I sold was coloured—anyone who saw it could she that it was published by Ridgway, and the price was marked on the back—I got him the plain one about the next day, and when I went he asked if I had got any more, as he had a customer that wanted one of each, and asked me how soon I could get him them—I said I did not know, but I would endeavour to get him one of each as soon as possible, which I did—he bought them of me, out gave me a small price, in comparison with what they were published at; and more than that, he did not pay me all the amount at once—he asked if I could get him any speeches—he named Canning's and Erskine's—Fox and Windham's speeches—he said they were very valuable books, "Lindley's Botanical works, "the 20 vols., the old series, and the new—and the "Sweet's flower Garden"—I brought him some of the peaches in quires—he gave 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for canning's Speeches, inn quires; 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Erskine's, in quires; and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Canning's, in boards—that was one shil<lb></lb>ling more that the sheets—he did not pay all at once, but kept a running account—I should think I have visited his shop a hundred times and move—I took him books a few days before I ran away—I have had dealings with him for about eight months, and visited his shop sometimes three times a day—I used not to go in, because he stood at the door and stopped me—I sold him books to the amount of about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but I used to spend</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By a <hi rend="italic">turn-out</hi> I understand you to mean that when a pub<lb></lb>lisher finds a work heavy he sells them in a lot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and those books would be sold at a very low price; we should not get them cheaper at the pub<lb></lb>lisher's—if the book had become ever so common, they are sure to charge the full price for their own works—If a person brought new, clean, and uncut works for sale, it would not lead me to suppose that he was connected with the publisher, and by going to the publisher's, I should not get it at a de<lb></lb>pressed price.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known gentlemen to sell their books in sheets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not unless it was the author—If a person came to me time after time with new and uncut publications, if he told me he was in the employ of the publisher, I should feel it my duty to go to the author.</p>

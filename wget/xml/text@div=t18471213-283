                  </hi> I am the daughter of James Saunders, who keeps a public-house in St. Martin's-lane. On Monday, 15th Nov., about seven in the evening, the prisoners came there—Sullivan asked for a pot of porter and gave me half-a-crown in payment, which I gave to my father, who was in the parlour—I gave Sullivan the change—she said I had given her sixpence short; she was very abusive, and my father came and asked what was the matter—he examined the half-crown and said it was bad—he fetched the inspector, and Ward said it was not a half-crown, but a shilling they had given me—I am sure it was a half-crown, there were no others in the till—I had placed it in the corner of the till on a piece of blue paper—I saw my father take it from that place.</p>

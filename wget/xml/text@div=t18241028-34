I had my shoes, hat, and coat off. I went to sleep between twelve and one o'clock, and awoke between three and four - she was then gone, and my things also.

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor came to me about four o'clock, without coat, hat, or shoes, and asked if I had seen a woman pass with them - he said he had been with her, and she had taken his things. In about half an hour I saw the prisoner with the coat, and asked her where she got it; she crossed over; I went to her, and said a man had complained of being robbed of his coat, hat, and shoes - she threw down the coat, and said.</p>
               <p>"Let me go;" she afterwards told me where to find the shoes and hat.</p>

I met him in the Edgware-road; he asked me if I would live with him, and asked if 18 s. a week would keep us; I said with the little I earned it might do - he gave me some halfpence to get some liquor, and gave me the coat to put on. I went to the Waterman's Arms, public-house, and there the watchman saw me.</p>

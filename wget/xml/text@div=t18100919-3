            . Q. Have you got a watch here belonging to Mr. Bask - A. No; I believe it is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner - A. If ever I saw him, he is in a different dress now, I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Did you ever see the prisoner - A. Yes; he came into my boat and went sixty miles with me, up to Uxbridge, and there he left me. When he first came he engaged to go to Paddington, he left me at Uxbridge between five and six o'clock. When he was gone, I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with the prisoner about the watch - A. Yes; I saw him sitting at a door. I told him if he would give me the watch or the money it would be better. He took us to the watchmaker where he had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Handy.) You say you do not know the prisoner; was a watch brought to you any time, and when - A. On the 20th or 21st of last month, about one o'clock, it was brought by a person about the prisoner's height, I gave him ten shillings for it, that watch was in my possession till the Friday following, and then three or four men came into my shop with a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there then - A. I do not know that he was; some man asked me if I had not bought a watch lately. I said I had. I brought the watch out of the case; I said is that your watch; the prosecutor said, yes, he believed it was, but I had put new cases to it. I had repaired it and beat out the dents in it, they were not new cases. I asked him the watchmaker's name, he said, Cook, Oxford-street, I then said, this is not your watch, and put it in the case again, and they went away. After they had been to the magistrate in the evening, the constable came, and I delivered the watch to him.</p>

I went to Mr. Handy's, the prosecutor mentioned a name that is not in the watch, he said it was cracked in the face, and the watch Handy produced is cracked in the face.</p>

I found a blanket and two pair of stockings, with the marks on; I believe I had never worn them; I never gave her any stockings; they were tied up in a pair of stockings belonging to a man who had formerly lived with me. A cravat of mine had been cut in two; I found half of it on her neck with my name on it at full length.</p>

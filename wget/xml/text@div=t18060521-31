             sworn. I am servant to Mr. Hubbard, poulterer, a neighbour opposite to Mr. Thomas: I was at my own shop, I saw this here prisoner take the flat of butter up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it. - A. About twenty minutes before nine o'clock at night; he walked gently down the left hand side of Trump-street with it, I walked after him, hearing his shoes, another behind whistled, as soon as he heard the whistle he dropped the flat of butter, I hallooed out Stop thief; soon after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him. - A. No, he was brought back and the butter too, there was no soul in the street but him and another man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think he is swearing very false.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM M'DONALD sworn. I am a constable; on Monday, the 12th instant, I was sent for by Mr. Thomas to come to his shop, the prisoner and the butter was in Mr. Thomas's shop; I produce the flat and the cloth. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have just come from Ireland, I have been out of the kingdom twelve years, I have been in Egypt and every where, as I was going down this street, when the word Stop thief was cried out, I ran as well as the rest; this boy swore that he never lost sight of me, he said to the alderman that he lost sight of me for ten minutes, and that I had a white coat on; there were two hundred people in the street besides me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is a short street, there could not be two hundred people at that time of the night. - A. This boy will swear any thing.</p>

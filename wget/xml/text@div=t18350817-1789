                  </hi>. I keep the Portland arms, in Wilson-street, Dorset-square. On saturday, the 4th of July, between Five and six o'clock in the evening, the four prisoners came to my house, with another young man not present; they went into the back parlour—two young men, (Cope and Hurd,) had been in that room that day, besides my own family; they were in the room when the prisoners entered—nobody else had been in the room that day—they had a pot of half-and-half, and, I believe, a pint of half-and-half—Hurd and Cope came put of the room soon after the prisoners went in—Newcomb afterwards came out, and went away—after that Stokey, and the man who is not here, came out and went away; and after that Hooker and Goodwin came out, and drank a pint of half-and-half at the bar; but before they came out, they rang the bell, and I answered it—I went into the room, and they ordered a pint of half-and-half—I did not immediately leave the room to get it; and they said "A pint of half-and-half" two or three times, in a hurried manner—I left the room to get it, and they followed me to the bar, and drank it—I observed nothing particular when I went into the room—they went away immediately—I went into the parlour the mo<lb></lb>ment they left, having suspiction, and observed a small piece of bombezin and a piece of crape on the floor, and a piece of silk hanging out of the drawer—I could not have seen the drawer from the part of the room I was in when I answered the bell; and I cannot say whether these things were there, as the drawers were on the other side of the bagetello-board—I could not see any thing if it had been on the floor, where I was—I went to the bar to Mr. Roberts, and informed her; and then we went together to the parlour—I found all the drawers locked except one, and the key was not there—I believed it had been left in the drawer that morning—I sent for a locksmith; he opened one drawer, and Mrs. Roberts missed several things</p>

               <p>from that drawer—I then went to find Hurd and cope—I knew where they lived—I made inquiry of them, and went with them to the Waterloo Arms, High-street, Marylebone—that was about eight o'clock—I saw all the prisoners there, with the other man, who is not here—while we were taking the prisoners, he managed to escape—I had an officer who took them into custody—Hooker was stopped at the door, and the other three in the skittle-ground—the officer told Hooker at the door what he was taken for, and I believe he said he knew nothing about it—I did not here the others wake any remark—they did not ask, in my hearing, what they were taken for—they said "Very well, we can go," or something.</p>

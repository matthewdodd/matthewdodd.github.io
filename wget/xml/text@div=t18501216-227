                  </hi>. I am in partnership with William James Lewis, as pawnbrokers; we occupy a shop and two kitchens as a warehouse, at 24, Eyre-street-hill, and carry on our business at the bottom of the street. On 2nd Dec. we had fenders, vices, and other things there—on Wednes<lb></lb>day the 4th, I found the kitchen broken open, and missed fenders, vices,</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Payne's-court, Cold Bath-square. On 2nd Dec., about half-past six in the evening, I saw Parnell go into the passage of 24, Eyre-street-hill—I heard him knocking, looked down the area and saw him in the kitchen of Messrs. Thompson and Lewis with the door open and a candle in his hand—a boy was standing at the street-door, to whom Parnell handed some vices, and he handed them to Prince, who was at the other corner of the street, about four yards off, exactly opposite the house, he could see it—he took them home to his house, and also some fenders—they were about two hours doing it—they asked me to go with them to Prince's house—I went and saw Prince, Parnell, and the boy put the things in a cupboard under the stairs—Prince and Parnell both said they were going to pawn them in the morning—I said I would go and tell of it, and Prince knocked me about, and Parnell said he would run a knife in me—1 did not hear them say anything about money; they wanted me to come next morning; I bad no work and went—the prisoners each took a vice on his shoulder and went up Turn mill-street to a pawnbroker's, who would not take them in—they went to several pawnbrokers, and at last got rid of them.</p>

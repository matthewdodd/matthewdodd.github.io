On the 24th of December he went into the cellar to fetch up some wine; from suspicion I went into my cellar to fetch a bottle of out; my cellar is of great length, there is five vaults in it; it is the corner of <placeName id="t18080113-20-crimeloc119">Fleet Market</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had he a candle. - A. Yes; I was about six or seven yards from him, I saw him with his hands under his apron, fumbling with something, I could not tell what; he took his hands out and pulled his apron down to make it appear as if there was no bulk there. He then began to proceed toward the stairs; I walked backwards in the dark, he could not perceive me nor hear me; I asked him for the candle to reach down a bottle of stout. When I came to the foot of the stairs he was standing, he offered me to go first, I told him to walk up first; as soon as he was up stairs he asked me for the change that he was to take to the gentleman where he was going with the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going to carry some wine out. - A. Yes, a single bottle; I told him the change was ready, but I wanted something with him first; I laid hold of his leather apron, I said what have you got in your small clothes, you have got a bottle of wine here; I told him to pull it out, he resisted and shook his apron over it again. I went for the constable, and while I was absent he took it out, my wife saw him, she is here; when I came back I asked him what he was going to do with it, he said if I must tell the truth, he meant to have a bottle of wine for his Christmas day's dinner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not intend to take it away, I only brought it up to save me the trouble of going down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you bring the bottle of wine up in your breeches. - A. It was in my coat pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son, and am ten years old—we live in Grove-street, Hackney. On Sunday the 30th of Aug., my brother went to the Forest—my father came home about seven o'clock, I came in directly after him—the cloth was laid for supper, and the knives and forks, and food on the table, my brother came in from the forest soon after—my father was then at supper, and said my brother should not have any—my mother was in the wash-house, in the back yard—I do not know whether she heard this—she came into the room and saw my brother standing up and me sitting down to supper, and she told him to sit down to supper—my father then got up and struck her with a knife which he was eating his supper with—my mother was leaning against the drawers, about a yard and a half from him—he was angry when he got up—I did not hear him say anything to her when he struck her, or at any time—he struck her on the left side of her neck, he was not sober—I did not see him fall against her—he got up from his chair, I did not notice whether he stumbled, the blood flowed from the wound—my father wanted to put some strapping on it, my mother would not let him—she held an apron round her neck, and sat down—my brother went for a policeman, but Mr. Pain called him back, and told him to go for Dr. Harris—my father sent me for a doctor, and when I returned my father was gone for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my mother was in the kitchen—I had heard her tell my father to go for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to take her to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. On the 30th of Aug. husband came home between six and seven o'clock—he was not sober—I then laid the cloth and put the knives and forks, on for supper—my elder son, who is seventeen years old came home—my husband upbraided him and asked him who gave him leave to go out—he said, nobody—my husband said, then you will have no supper, go to bed—I begged him to let him have supper—I was very audacious towards him, and he got up—he stumbled, and the last I remember was hearing the knives and forks tingle—I was wounded, I was standing against the drawers at the time—he was not attempting to do any<lb></lb>thing—I was very domineering, and suppose he was getting up to frighten me—I am sure he never would have hurt me if sober, there is not a better father or husband—I said, "You have no business to binder the child having his victuals"—that made him angry—he got off the chair with the knife ih his hand—he did not take it off the table, he made towards me threatening something, and stumbled against the leg of the table and fell down on me—I then received the wound.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 247) I went to the house on this night, and saw a pool of blood in the passage, at the back room door—I went into the back room, and saw the prosecutrix wounded—the prisoner came in while the surgeon was closing the wound, and brought a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, but it was agreed, agreed at last she should not go to the hospital—I said he must consider himself in my custody—he said he was quite aware of that, and on going to the station he said he had committed the deed, and must suffer for it—there is a stain of blood on this knife, which I received from the son.</p>

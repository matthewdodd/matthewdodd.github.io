            . I cheapened the Horses of Talton; he asked me 7 Guineas for the Colt, and 3 Guineas for the Horse, at the Blazing-Star, Feb. 26. I am positive they are the same Horses that Page owne'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knight. The Horses being lost from Penn, I had a Letter from Page to advertise them. I printed 500 Bills, and distributed them in Smithfield and proper Placs, and presently I receiv'd Notice that the old Horse had been put up at the Blazing-Star. I went and view'd him, and made Oath before a Justice, that I believed the Horse was the same that Page had lost. After this I had Information that the Colt was in the Pound at Shoreditch, and the Man that keeps the Pound brought him to me; for I had offer'd half a Guinea for one, and a Guinea for the other. I did not see either of the Horses at the Blazing-Star; the old Horse I saw at the Man's House who bought him, next Door but one to the Blazing-Star. Having been inform'd who he had the Horse of, I took one of the Witnesses with me, and went to New-Prison to see him, for he was sent there, for stealing the Countess of Harold's Turkeys: I found he was to be carried down to Justice Chandler about this Affair. I went to the Justice's, and gave him an Account of the Horses; while I was there, Talton was brought before him, and while he was under Examination, Bully, the other Prisoner was taken. Talton made a Confession before the Justice; and after it had been read to him, I saw him sign it.</p>

               <p>Q. You did very wrong, do you know that there was this leaden pipe missing. - A. Yes. We found the lead where he said he had sold it, to a plumber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Had you ever seen that lead affixed. - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards look at the place where it was taken from. - A. Yes; it was taken from the front of the area wall; I matched it with the place, I could not make it fit; I cannot swear it is part of that lead.</p>

            . I am a plumber. The lead in question was brought to my house on the 13th of May, I bought the lead for thirty-two pound weight, I gave seven shillings and seven pence for it; I went with Mr. May to the place; we could not make it answer to the place; there was as much as twenty feet deficient in the whole; he sold me twelve feet.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, it may be part of of the same lead, some part belonging to it might have been disposed of. - A. It was the same bore and the same sort.</p>
               <p>- DOWELL. At four o'clock on the 13th of May we went to beer, me and the prisoner and the plasterer; I and the plasterer came to the house in half an hour's time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him about the lead. - A. Yes, between five and six o'clock; he was bending a leaden pipe; I did not see him cut it, nor take it out of the premises; I only saw him bend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this at Mr. Gilliard's house where you saw this. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any of the leaden pipe was missing that day. - A. Yes (the lead produced).</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to be the same sort of pipe as was in the house. - A. I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Stevens) Did you compare that pipe with any part that was left in the house. - A. Yes. To the best of my knowledge it was the same bore, a three-quarter bore.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a three-quarter bore that remains in the house. - A. Yes. To the best of my knowledge the prisoner brought the lead to me between four and five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

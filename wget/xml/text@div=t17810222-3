I was going home to Kensington, on Saturday evening the 27th of January, about a quarter after seven o'clock. Four men came up to me, the prisoner Webber, was one; Webber presented a pistol to my breast, and bid me stop! I said I had very little money. Then the other three got round me; one took a silk handkerchief off my neck; another put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket and took out a guinea, two half guineas, and nine shillings and six pence in money. Webber stood with a pistol towards me while the other persons took my money. It was a clear moon-light night, and I saw his face very plain, for he had no disguise but a flapped hat. I am positive to his person. They were about two minutes committing the robbery. When they were going off, one struck me on the bur of the ear, and knocked me down; it was a bludgeon I believe, or the but-end of a pistol with which he struck me. I saw the prisoner in Bow-street, on the 5th of February. I said when I first saw him there, that I believed him to be the man to the best of my knowledge in every respect. I picked him out at the publick-house, the

               <p>Prisoner. He said before the justice he only knew me by my surtout coat and round hat? - No, I knew him by his coat, his hat, his stature, and by his face too. I took his stature to be five feet eight or nine inches.</p>

               <p>Was you in Bow-street? - I went there on Tuesday. I was put by my brother for the man to look at me as well as him. I was kept there a prisoner. The prosecutor said he believed the man who robbed him was about five feet seven or eight inches, but he could not tell. He looked very hard at me as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220010"></xptr> stood there, after they were taken away. I was dressed then just as I am now.</p>
               <p>Did Gulliver challenge your brother or any of them? - He looked round; he could not fix upon the man; at last he said that is the man; he thought he might be the man. He said he was a man of about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of age.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Was the Tuesday when you was in Bow-street the first time you challenged the prisoner? - It was.</p>


               <p>Had you any doubt whether the prisoner or his brother was the man? - I went down to the bear immediately and clapped my hand upon the prisoner, and said that was the man.</p>
               <p>Had you any doubt at that time which was the man? - No; I clapped my hand upon his breast immediately, and said that was the man.</p>
               <p>You did not say, of the two you thought the prisoner was the man? - No, no such a word.</p>

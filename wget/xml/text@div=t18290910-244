No; he was foreman to Mr. Smith; he has not lent me his tools - he has none; he lent me a bead plane once - I never lent him any: I did go with him to Bartholomew fair, but not on the night of the robbery - I did not lend him these tools, nor go to my master to get him turned out: I have not said, "I have got master Verryard now, and I am d-d if I don't transport him." - I said, if I could find who had the tools, I would.</p>

I can safely say, with a clear conscience, that he lent me the tools to get half a gallon of beer, and he drank with me; when he came to the fair he spent his money with me - I left him at half-past ten at the top of Holborn, and little did I think that a man I had treated as a brother would be my prosecutor.</p>

I went to the fair with him the night afterwards: I paid for every thing I had there, and he paid for what he had - I never lent him these things, nor did I know it till one day I met his wife, and she said he had between 3l. and 4l. worth of duplicates - that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100121"></xptr>led me to suspect him; all the other men's tools were gone.</p>

You have not been susficiently careful in this case, it was extremely imprudent, at least, to grant such a certificate as this; if ever you fall into a situation to give such a certificate again, you must be very careful to know of your own knowledge that it is the man; or else you expose the party to be defrauded, and assist the other party in the further prosecution of the plan he has in contemplation.</p>

                  </hi>. I was stationed to watch a house in Strutton-ground which had been taken possession of by the Commissioners of the Westminster Improvements. On 14th July, about twelve o'clock at night, I heard some person on the roof—I gave information to the policeman, and brought him with me to the building—I got George Wall to get on the roof, and he handed me some lead—I went to another house at the back, in Duck-lane—I saw three persons standing on a wall—the policeman told me to stand at the door of a shed which is at the back of the house in Duck-lane—persons can go from the roof of the house where I heard the noise, to that shed—I then went to another house where King lives—there is a trap-door there which leads to the roof of the house—I found King and Condon in the room, and the other prisoner was on the roof.</p>

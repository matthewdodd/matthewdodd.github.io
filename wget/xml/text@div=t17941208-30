               <p>Q. By looking at the certificate, are you enabled to say, when you first saw it at the office? - No, I cannot positively say, by an entry at the bottom P. H. with the date under the 11th of September, 1794; I conceive it was made out that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The navy bill was made out after this of course? - When was the navy bill made out? - I cannot say exactly the day, after that, and then they are registered; and they are said to be made out when they are past.</p>

               <p>Q. When does it appear to bear date, as indorsed by you? - There is no date to it, it was done on my examining the bill; the certificate within mentioned, is indorsed by Edward Wilson, payable to

            . - T. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. You have looked at the certificate, and seen to whom that certificate was indorsed, what is to be done with that; and what is the particular force of your indorsement in that part? - For the information of the pay office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that being done, is it capable without more of being carried to the pay office? - No, it is regularly carried to the clerk of the acts office, where Major Wollard is.</p>
               <p>Q. What office is that? - It is a particular department.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it taken to that office for? - They are entered in his office, from where they are delivered out to the parties, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the clerk of the acts? - George Marsh.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you have so indorsed it yourself, that is, it self sufficient to entitle the person to carry it to the treasury office to demand the money? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing further to be done in the office, after you have witnessed it by your subscription, that the certificate within mentioned, is indorsed by Edward Wilson, payable to Mr. William Thornton? Is there any thing more necessary, than that Thornton himself, should demand it and sign a receipt for it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you immediately transmit it when you have done this? - It goes in the clerk of the acts office, to be entered there? and delivered to the parties, or their agents.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is necessary to register it in the clerk of the acts office? - I conceive so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You conceive it necessary to register them in the clerk of the acts office? Be so good as to tell me what is the meaning of that at the bottom T. D. - To shew that this bill has come down again to me, in order to be set off again with the assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the course of office,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080124"></xptr>what is Major Wollard? - He is a clerk, in the clerks of the acts office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that written by him, as the clerk, of the clerk of the acts office? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that T. D. your's? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can tell us why it is put there? - It is to shew, that it is brought down, after it has been assigned, to have the assignment set off against the entry of the bill to make it compleat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a necessary official act done by you? - It has always been done; and I have been there upwards of fifty years.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose that bill could not pass unless your name was there? - I think it is necessary to authenticate the paper, to make it negotiable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. All that Major Wollard does, and your initials there is done after the commissioners have dispatched it all out of their hands? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Is not that D. to be written by you in the course of office, before the party entitled to receive it, gets it out of the office, to get the money for it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. And that you have generally done? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And for what purpose? - When it is assigned for payment, the bills are sent back again to the comptroller's office and then I put T. D. at the corner, and direct them forward to the clerks, to have the assignment set off against the bill in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. This is your initials to signify that it has come regularly from the commissioners, and for that purpose? - It is.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether the progress of this navy bill would be stopped in the course of it if it had not this initial letter at the soor of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you look on your initials in that place as essentially necessary to the validity of the thing? - How far it may be considered as necessary I do not know, but it is the custom of the office always to act so; but whether the bill can be considered valid without it, that is to be considered by them that pay it.</p>

               <p>Court. I understand that if in case this bill was brought into the acts office, it would stop there, if your initials was not there? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. In all the course of time that you have been in the Navy Office, have you constantly put your initials T.D. as on this bill? - There has been an omission, but I always considered it as a part of my duty to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a part of the bill? - No, it is no part of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Or is it a part of the assignment of the bill? - No, by no means.</p>

               <p>Court. It is a mark on the bill in order to make the bill authentick.</p>

               <p>Q. You was at the time this matter took place? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill (The navy bill shewn him) it is my writing, the body of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the time you filled up that the junior clerk at the same office in which the prisoner was? - I cannot say I was the junior clerk; I was a clerk there.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had filled it up, in whose care was it put then? - In Mr. Hunter's, I should think it was; I used to make out these bills for the assistance of Mr. Hunter.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you had made them out, in whose department was it to take care of them? - We used to take care of them till they went to the board to be signed; after I made them out I suppose Mr. Hunter used to look at them, and then they go to the chief clerk to be examined, Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You suppose it was under the care of the prisoner; you had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080125"></xptr>been in the office a very long time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were many persons in the office that had been in the office a great many years longer than you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose is that put in your office? - For the purpose of assigning the bill; I believe it is always customary in the office belonging to the navy board, that the initial of some person's name is put.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose is it brought in your office? - As a record, to be entered in that office, and to be assigned to the treasurer of the navy for payment.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell me to whom that bill is delivered out of your office? - It is charged to Mr. William Hunter, because there is more Mr. Hunters than one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I ask you whether you did or not give that bill into the hands of Mr. Hunter? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe? - I believe it to the best of my recollection, but I cannot speak on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not always the party that brings it that takes it away? - Somebody comes for them sometimes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You have told us that you are clerk to the clerk of the acts office, and by the course of the office, these bills before they are issued for the money pass through your office? - They should, they do not always.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with them when you have them in your office? - We enter them first in the pilot book, and then in this book, which is the delivery book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a regular official act of your's? - Yes, but I do not think I signed this, sometimes a gentleman does it for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a regular and official act; is the money regularly offered into the man's hands, unless it pass through your office, and have some signature to it? - No, it is not regular.</p>

               <p>Q. You say it has always been customary to put your name on it, and when it comes to the pay office, would it not be stopped there for the want of that circumstance? - No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known any navy bills paid without that circumstance? - Several.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. If I understand you, the pilot bills have been paid at the navy office without that signature from your office, but they frequently have a signature at your office? - Yes, always when they are brought.</p>
               <p>Q. It does not pass your office regularly without a signature to it, from your office? - It does not.</p>

               <p>Q. There you saw the name of William Thornton, and you paid it on that authority.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You are cashier and payee of these bills? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you liable to refund to government for any improper payment that you make? - I have never known such an instance done, I pay for the treasurer of the navy, I am his cashier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The ground work on which you make your payment, is the signature of the commissioners, and the indorsement of Mr. Davis? - Certainly it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In your situation as cashier, do not you give security? - No, there is no security equal to the custody, if I was to give a million it would not be equal to the custody,</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I would take your Lordship's opinion, whether Mr. Slane is a good witness under these circumstances, as a cashier, it strikes me that Mr. Slane would be liable to refund to the treasurer of the navy, any payment that has been improperly made.</p>
               <p>Court. If a banker's clerk pays with out proper authority he must refund, but not otherwise.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Looking down that bill, you having paid a great many of them in your life, what is the authoritative part of that instrument, does it stop with the signatures of the commissioners, and the indorsement on the other side? - Yes, it does.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say that the authoritative part of that instrument is the signature of the three commissioners, to the last assignment, and the immediate part is that indorsement on the back, and the signature of the name to which it is to be paid, on the stamp? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it Mr. Hunter called on you with this? - Between two and ten.</p>

               <p>Q. Now you see Mr. Hunter's name is there, it was there when it was brought to you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before that you looked at the assignment, which was Thornton; how came you to pay it to Hunter? - We always make it a practice when the bill is endorsed, to pay it to the person that brings it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have paid that bill unless it had the name of Thornton to it? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the import of those names being on that stamp there? - When Thornton's name and Hunter's name were both on this piece of paper, I looked on it as a receipt and discharge of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the office a good many years? - Six and thirty years and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the custom with you, and has it been the custom of the office to pay on that sort of a thing? - Before the stamp act was introduced it was paid by simply signing the name under the sum, to which the bill was made payable, but since the receipt act has been required it has been always the usual custom to sign it as that is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the word receipt made use of? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the name put? - Where you see the stamp now</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose before the receipt took place it was on the same paper on the bill? - It was, and we have no other way of putting the stamp on, but by wafering it on the bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now I observe that this navy bill has at the bottom of it in red ink, the name Wollard with the initials of T. D. - I have no authority to look to that; it is no authority to the treasurer of the navy, it is done quite in another office from ours, quite distinct.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you are acquainted with the hand writing of Hunter himself; whether you have ever seen him write? - I do not know that; I cannot speak to his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you pay that money? - By a draft on Coutts and Co. I have got the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever paid any bills that you can say to a certainty that no name of Wollard, in red ink, was ever there? - It is a very late thing that his name has been put there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080128"></xptr>Mr. Shepherd. I take it for granted that sometimes you pay bills without any assignment? - I do not understand the question.</p>

               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Wilson had come with this bill himself? - If Mr. Wilson had come for the payment without the assignment I should have paid it Mr. Wilson.</p>

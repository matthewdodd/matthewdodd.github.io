                  </hi>. I am in the employ of James Wyburn and others, in Long Acre—the prisoner was their labourer. I suspected him, and on the 2nd of April I felt in his coat-pocket, and found these two clips, and other things—I took them out, and showed them to one of my employers—he marked them, and they were returned into the pocket—the prisoner put on his coat, and went about a quarter-past nine o'clock—he then went to a shop, where he was about to sell them—I went in, and said I was sorry that I should have to come after him for stealing his master's property—he said, "Don't make a noise about it, it is all over"—he had the property with him which I had marked—I searched his lodging, and found other pro<lb></lb>perty, which was identified.</p>

            . I am a ship-breaker, and live at Brentford. I bought the barge in question from the prisoner, on the 26th of October; he told me he was employed by another person, and was to have ten shillings and six pence commission. I did not ask him whose barge it was; Ovingdon was the name upon it; I agreed to give him seven pounds for it; but only paid him four ready money; she was a very old barge, and I bought her to break up. I have a wharf upon the Thames. That barge was claimed by Mr. Church. The prisoner was to have the rest of the money on the Saturday. I did not see the prisoner again until I went and took him. He did not mention any name at first; but he afterwards told me a man named Smith told him to sell it. He rowed her up to Putney, and told me it was there. I brought it up the river to my wharf.</p>

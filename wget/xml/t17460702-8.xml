               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Marsh. He said, will you buy these Chains; I was indifferent about it; they were worth no more to me than old Iron. He stood for a Penny a Pound; I said they were worth that and more to those that want them.</p>

               <p>Marsh. Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon what Occasion have you seen him before?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I had bought Part of a Grate of him which I was assur'd was his Father's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine him about these Things too?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I did ask him a Question or two, but not very strict.</p>
               <p>Court. I believe not. A mighty little Boy to deal in old Iron! 'Tis pretty odd for you to give three Farthings a Pound for these Chains for old Iron; in my Opinion you are more guilty than the Boy. The Jury desires to know what you would have a Pound for a Chain.</p>
               <p>Marsh. I don't make any such.</p>
               <p>Court . 'Tis such as you that incourage such little Thefts, in the Receiving of Stolen Goods.</p>

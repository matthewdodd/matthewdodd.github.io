                  </hi> I am in the employ of Henry James Ditman, a licensed victualler, of Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square. On Saturday night last, about ten o'clock, I was near my master's door, and saw the prisoner drawing a bundle of cigars from a broken square of glass in Mr. Henry Cooke's shop<lb></lb>window, in the parish of St. Marylebone, immediately opposite my master's—I crossed over, and stopped the prisoner with the cigars—he immediately dropped them—I took him back to the shop, and he was given in charge.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tobacconist, and live in Mortimer-street, Caven<lb></lb>dish-square. About ten o' clock last Saturday night I was in my parlour be<lb></lb>hind the shop—a communication was made to me—I examined my shop<lb></lb>window, found the glass was broken, and a bundle of cigars was gone—I went out, and picked them up on the pavement—they are my cigars, and are worth about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was then in Cox's custody—I had been to my shop<lb></lb>window not two minutes before, to serve a customer from the window—I was not above eighteen inches from the glass, and can positively say it was whole three minutes before—it is a corner window—there are ninety-six cigars—they are tied in bundles of 100.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The petition of John Hill, dated</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th November</hi>, 1869, <hi rend="italic">a prisoner in Whitecross Street, to be allowed to file a petition in Bankruptcy, was here put in, signed by John Hill, in the presence of J.

Mark Beckett and Henry Teece were in the room with me, and I saw them sign papers—I heard no explanation given to them of what they were signing—next day I went before the Bankruptcy Court, before Registrar Bacon—I do not know Henry Brooks, of Chatham, who was mentioned as my detaining creditor—I owed no one the sum of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; my largest debt was 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to Bassett &amp; Co., of Sheffield.

(<hi rend="italic">In the list of creditors appeared the name "Brooks, H., Chatham</hi>, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."). I did not tell Harris that Henry Brooks was to be put into the list, I did not know the name; I gave him the list of my creditors, but not that one—after I had been before Mr. Registrar Roche, I got out of prison the same day, as no one opposed me—I saw no one there but Mr. Banks; he answered the questions which the Registrar, I suppose it was, asked—my bankruptcy proceeded, and I got my final discharge—Beckett, and Teece, and myself, were taken before the deputy-governor, and none of us knew who our detaining creditor was—after my first hearing, I think it was in December, Banks told me that there was a society for the relief of debtors, and he believed I should get a donation of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and would try and get it for me—after my dis<lb></lb>charge two petitions were drawn up in Banks' office, one by him and one by the boy—it was obliged to be presented in duplicate—this is it (<hi rend="italic">This was dated February</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, 1870, <hi rend="italic">to the President and Governors of the Society for the Discharge and Relief of Persons in Prison for Debt, signed John Hill</hi>,</p>

I said "No, not much over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "You will stand for the charity"—on the same day I saw Banks at his office, with Lawrence; a small paper was written out, and I put my name to it—(<hi rend="italic">This was a consent for the plaintiff, H.

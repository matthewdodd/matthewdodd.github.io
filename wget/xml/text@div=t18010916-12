               <p>Q. Do you know to whom this butter belonged?- A. It belonged to Mr. Francis Inman.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. By the mark; the Lord Mayor ordered it to be delivered, it being a perishable commodity; the constable has the cask.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH BENNETT sworn. - I am a constable: I took charge of the prisoner; the cask was knocked to pieces by being thrown down; the prisoner told me a man had given him sixpence to carry the cask of butter up the quay.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Inman.) Brewer's quay was where your butter was? - A. Yes, it was landed there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man ordered me to take the firkin of butter to the top of the gateway, while he called a coach; I took it to the top of the gateway, and never saw the man afterwards, and this man laid hold of me; I know the wharfinger's clerk, and saw him pass me, and therefore it was not likely that I should stand at the top of the gateway after I had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Englebart.) Did you see any gentleman near the prisoner? - A. No, I did not.</p>

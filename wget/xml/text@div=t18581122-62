                  </hi>. I live at 10, Warren-lane, Woolwich. On Friday morning, 29th October, about a quarter past 4, I was in bed in the lower back room of 10, Warren-lane, in the parish of Woolwich—I was asleep—about a quarter past 4 I heard a noise like a footstep on the boards—I got up, looked round, and saw a man at the foot of the bed, dressed in dark</p>

               <p>clothes—I asked "Who is that?"—he never made any answer—I called my sister and got a light—I saw that the things that had been on the line had been removed—I saw them safe the night before, when I was going to bed about 10 o'clock—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I dressed myself and came into Warren-lane—I got into Harding's-lane—I heard a little noise there and I waited a little while—presently I saw the prisoners—Cael was carrying a bundle of clothes wrapped up in a red handkerchief—it turned out to be these—that was about ten minutes after I heard the noise in the room—I got out before my father—the red handkerchief was also safe on the line the night before—I saw them apprehended at the corner of Warren-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Warren-lane, Woolwich, and am a labourer. On the morning of Friday, 29th October, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was called by my son—I had seen these clothes safe on the previous night; they were missing when I came to look at the line—I went with my son into the street my son got out before me—I saw both the men—I saw no bundle at the time I saw them I went for a constable—I saw the bundle taken up at the end of Meeting-house-lane—tthere are three women's articles of dress there, and some other things—they belong to my wife and children.</p>

On the morning of 29th October, about 5 o'clock, the last witness sent for me, and I took Cael in custody—I took him down a passage at the top of Warren-lane—I there found the bundle of clothes, which was identified by Haggerty, senior—I asked him why he had thrown the bundle of clothes there, and he stated that it was on seeing the police approaching—I then took him into custody, and on searching him, I found under his uniform the black cloth coat and the black satin waistcoat which I now produce—I saw McRath on the same evening about 5 o'clock—he eluded my pursuit—after he was at the station, he said, "I have done this for the purpose of getting out of the service"—Cael stated that McRath had given him the bundle to carry—I am quite sure he said that—this was said as they both stood at the bar of the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29, Meeting-house-lane, Woolwich, and am a labourer. On the morning of Friday, 29th October, last, soon after 4 o'clock, I had occasion to go to a water-closet in 7, Warren-lane, the adjoining premises—it is a little lane that leads out of Warren-lane—whilst I was there, a bundle of clothes came over near the water-closet, from the adjoining premises—I could not say whose premises they fell from—there is a wall there that belongs to the back premises of three or four houses—it is not above six or seven yards from Mr. Haggerty's—Haggerty's is one of the three or four houses that the wall belongs to—after the bundle came to me, McRath got over the wall, and brought part of the bricks of the wall with him—I said, "Halloo, neighbour, what in up?" or some words to that effect, because it startled me at that time of the morning—he replied, "Oh, the blasted drink!" and then he picked up the clothes, loose as they are now, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them over the adjoining premises, and away he went.</p>

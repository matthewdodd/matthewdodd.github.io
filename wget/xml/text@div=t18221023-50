             is my partner; we rent the house between us. On Saturday night, the 11th of October, I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock; the house was properly secured; I was not disturbed in the night; I got up about eight o'clock in the morning; I went to a place of worship in the morning, and on returning Mrs. Robson said the house had been entered in the night. I examined the counting-house, the door of which opens into the private passage leading into Tower-street - I found the door leading from the warehouse into the counting-house open - it was closed overnight. I went to the iron safe which was in the warehouse, and where we kept our stamps; the the cash box used to be kept there about a month ago, when the prisoner lived with us as errand boy. I found the iron safe door open, but nothing gone. I went into the dining room, where the keys of the premises were kept, and the brass chain they were kept on was broken, and the keys of the iron safe and warehouse taken from it and returned again; there were no marks of violence about the warehouse. I suspect the entrance was made through the area which leads to the coal cellar, as the grating had been left unfastened. A person getting in there would get into the cellar, and then by lifting up a trap door could get into the passage. Two fowls and a quartern loaf were stolen. On the Monday, I was in a shop enquiring the prisoner's residence, and he came in; the moment he saw me, he made off, but was secured. I asked where he had been on the Saturday night; he said he went home at seven o'clock, and went to bed about eight. He lived about four months with me.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Robson. About half-past six o'clock on the Monday morning the servant came down and informed me she had found the street door open; I got up, went down stairs, and found the door leading from the counting-house to the warehouse open, as also the door leading from the passage to the counting-house. The iron safe was open. I went up stairs and found the keys lying in the parlour window, and one of the links of the chain broken, and the iron safe key lying loose on the chain.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 12th of October, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, in Lombard-street. I took him to the prosecutors' house, and told him the house had been entered on the Saturday night, and that he was suspected, and he had to clear his character, and say where he was that night; he said he lodged with his mother in Red-lion-court, Minories; that he was at home on Saturday night, in bed at eight o'clock; that he was taken ill about three o'clock in the morning, and did not get up till twelve o'clock on Sunday. I examined the premises; I believe the person must have entered by getting down the area grating where the coals are let down. I found a staple about three feet down there, so that any person going down must have torn their clothes with it. On searching the room the prisoner lodged in, I found a coat which appeared very dirty all round, as if the person had slid down the place; some of it appeared to be coal dust, but I cannot be certain of it. I asked him how his coat became torn (it had a slit in the back); he said he was not aware that it was torn, that it was a coat he did his dirty work in, and had it on on Saturday. I told him he had been seen in the street at the time; he said if any person had seen him it must have been at the Royalty, for he recollected he had been there, and was not in bed as he said at first; that he went in at the stage door of the theatre, and from there to what they call the fly.</p>

I went up stairs to fetch the child from her apartment, when I came home; on going to bed, I went to my drawer for my shift, I missed the shift, a shawl, a towel, and a pair of men's shoes; I went to the prisoner and asked her if she knew any thing of it; in the morning I went into the area of the coal celler, I found two duplicates of a shift, shawl and shoes, of the property I lost.</p>

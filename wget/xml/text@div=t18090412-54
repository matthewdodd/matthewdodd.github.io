            .</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August last, and some time before, was the prisoner in your employ - A. Yes, he had been in our employ between three and four years as clerk and rider.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return from a journey on the 22nd of September - A. I believe he might; I could tell by a reference to the books; I suppose that was about the time.</p>
               <p>Q. In August in that summer was he in Sunderland - A. Yes, we had letters from him.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did Mr. Bullman appear upon your ledger as debtor - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time how much was he indebted to you - 
               <persName id="t18090412-54-person549">A. </persName>
            12 l. 10 s. 1 d. - he is credited for 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. as receive August 25, 1808.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he went out that journey, Mr. Bullman appeared indebted to you 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. and 12 l. 10 s. - A. I must refer to the cash-book, I would wish to be correct - 1808, August 25, 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. before that; he was indebted that since by credit by the prisoner in the journey of August and September, in the cash-book; here is his hand-writing; this is the prisoner's pocket ledger, which he kept at that time, it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It appears there was an article of 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. for goods supplied the 31st of August 1807 - he writes in the last column, bill 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. discharged - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that letter from him in the course of that journey - A. Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter is dated 28th of August 1808, Bedal in Yorkshire - receipts since my last, Sunderland, S. Watson 3 l. 3 s. - W. Bullman 21 l. 4 s. 5 d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is that his hand-writing - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then three days after the money was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120041"></xptr>paid, as he represented it, he writes received this 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. - A. Yes, he entered down in my cash-book as received on the 26th of August 1808.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. had not been accounted for as part of the March journey - A. Oh no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever account to you for the 11 l. 17 s. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your writing to Mr. Bullman for this 11 l. 17 s. did you receive that answer from him - A. We did; that is a letter from Mr. Bullman, dated March 1809; it was laying upon his desk when he returned, it was read by him (the letter read). Upon seeing that he went in tears, he felt himself much hurt, he mentioned many others; he said he would give an account of all the money he had taken up; he pleaded very hard for mercy; this was on the 25th of March; he was taken to the Counter on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he on that day, or on the next day, send you that letter that is dated the 25th, I believe - A. He did, that is his hand-writing. (The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mawhood. You have stated that I never accounted for Mr. Bullman's money, and at the same time you have produced an account where I have stated it.</p>
               <p>COURT. He has stated that you accounted for the 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. but you did not account for the 11 l. 17 s. that you ought to have accounted.</p>
               <p>[A paper read, wherein the prisoner, after being charged by the prosecutors, accounted for different sums that he had received to the amount of 128 l.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Mawhood admits that when I stood charged with having received 11 l. 17 s. that I returned 21 l. - do you conceive that I acted with a felonious intention - Mr. Mawhood. When you entered the 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. you should have entered the 11 l. 17 s. and the 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. should have been entered six months before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will you swear that you do not stand indebted to me for salary - A. Here are the books that will prove it - he is overpaid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had not an opportunity of searching the books, hurried as I was before the magistrate; - even Mr. Humphries, the solicitor, has been to me to flatter me, so that I am left defenceless.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Mawhood. Were the books produced before the magistrate - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time complain that he had not sufficient time to look into them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you induced any body to flatter the prisoner - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Humphreys. The prisoner says that you have been to the prison, that you have flattered him, and he is left defenceless - is that true - A. I saw him once, when I once went to a young man; I asked him who was his counsel; I told him I had prepared the bill, most likely he would be tried that evening; he told me that he should defend himself, he did not doubt but that he should get through it; that is all, I believe, that passed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphreys. I think I did say that the prosecutors would not be rigid, they would be as lenient as they could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have to state what I said before - that I had never any felonious intent to conceal the property. I was hurried off to a jail; I have been frequently promised that I should have assistance to retain counsel; not having that assistance, after being bereft of all my money, and in a prison, where I was filthy, I was ragged, I troubled no friend, still relying on the prosecutor for assistance. I lay to the mercy of the jury to find my verdict. The prosecutor has been and flattered me in jail; the other prosecutors have been and led me on that it was a debt, and I might discharge my attorney and my friends, that I needed no money of them, nor need I put myself to any expence; I have no wish now to deny any thing but my felonious intent. If I had been a desperate character, and intended to conceal any thing from my prosecutors, I could have done it from one to ten thousand pounds; that there is an error in my accounts I admit. I have been asked to give security in this unfortunate place; I said I will not negociate in this unfortunate place; I have a respectable family. Having said this, I believe I have nothing more to impress upon the jury; - if they acquit me of the felony, they perhaps will not acquit me of the debt, nor do I wish to be acquitted of the debt, if a debt arises upon the two accounts.</p>

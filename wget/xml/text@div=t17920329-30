I knew the prisoner last year at Brighton and at Richmond. The prisoner was out of place, and he came to beg a bit of victuals; and I left my watch with my fellow servant to get myself ready; the watch was sold to another person; I never saw it in the custody of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came last Saturday was a week, about nine o'clock, to my shop, No. 11, Cockspur-street, and offered this watch; I was called, and refused to buy it; he cried, and said it was all he had left, he been indiscreet enough to lose all his money by insurance, and wanted to go to his friends; I bought it of him, and gave him a guinea and a half for it; that was the full value; I am certain I bought it of the prisoner.</p>

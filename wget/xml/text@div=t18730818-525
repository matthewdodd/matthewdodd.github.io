               <p>the prisoner was on her—she had not been ill some time before this—she always kept to her business—she went to her work till Tuesday, and died on Sunday—I don't think she was as well as she had been, but she did not keep her bed—this was on the 19th of July—she complained of pain in the top of her head and in her throat—there was no beating or ill-treatment after that—she was ailing, and on Tuesday evening she came home and went up to bed, and never got up again—a medical man was sent for on Thursday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, of Essex Road—on Friday morn<lb></lb>ing, a little after 12 o'clock, I was sent for to the prisoner's house and found the deceased in a very exhausted state—she complained of pains in her throat, back, and side, and put her hand in various places, but she was in such a low state that I could not examine her with safety—I prescribed for her, as I thought she was suffering from pleurisy—I prescribed beef tea, but no stimulants—she died en 3rd August—I believe the primary course of death was pleurisy, accelerated undoubtedly by what I found after death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Tuesday, two days after<lb></lb>wards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180142"></xptr>
               <p>and found the body very much emaciated, and on the left side, from the arm up to the ninth rib, were several severe bruises, extending from the outside of the nipple backwards to the spine—on the right side I found very much more severe bruises, so much so that the skin was separated from the parts beneath, and was puffy and doughey to the touch, and there was a recent scratch on the shoulder blade—on the point of each shoulder I found ecchymosis, but more particularly on one shoulder—there were considerable bruises on her throat, but it being warm weather decomposi<lb></lb>tion might have begun, and I should expect it to begin sooner after an injury—I can't say whether they were finger marks, they were darker in some places than others, but it was almost one mass of bruises—if the bruises on the ribs were produced by a man's fist I should expect the ribs to be fractured—the back was one mass of bruises, from ene side to the other—I should think it more likely to have been done with a stick—the bruises on the right side were very much more severe than the left, more especially from the fourth rib to the ninth, where the skin separated from the muscles—the heart was a little soft, but healthy, and the internal organs generally were healthy, except one of the kidneys which was a little diseased, but that had nothing to do with death—there was inflammation of the pleura, and under the part corresponding to the more severe blows there were adhesion which were easily broken down and therefore recent—I found con<lb></lb>siderable effusion in the chest, of serum coloured with blood, arising from the inflammation of the pleura—she died from pleurisy in a very weakened constitution, and accelerated by this treatment—I believe such treatment would cause pleurisy, but it might also arise from other causes; anyhow, such treatment as I saw the signs of, would accelerate death—she would, I think, have been much less likely to die of pleurisy if she had not had that treatment—she was a very weak, thin woman, and more liable to disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If I had examined the lungs and observed the extensive inflammation of the pleura, having heard nothing of the ill-treatment, and not having seen the external bruises, I should have said that the inflamed state of the pleura was sufficient to account for death, and that she died from pleurisy—when pleurisy is produced by violence you generally find a rib fractured—adhesions of the pleura to the chest are frequent after active inflammation of the pleura—I do not think the pleurisy was of long standing—I have heard that from 19th July to the Tuesday week following she was not confined to the house—I was called in after midnight on Thursday—if a violent attack of pleurisy had set in on the previous Tuesday it might arrive at a crisis which would cause death on the follow<lb></lb>ing Sunday—we had unexampled hot weather at the time I made the examination—the state of the atmosphere, and the length of time after death, sometimes causes extraordinary appearances on the outside; but not being satisfied, I went on Monday morning to examine the body, and found the bruises there—they were in places where I should not expect to find cadaverous marks, on account of the gravitation of the blood—the left side, from the collar bone down almost to the ninth rib, appeared to be entirely discoloured; there were some very small places, not the width of this pen, which were not discoloured—it is a fact that marks supposed to have been given by a stick have really been produced by the pressure of the folds, if the body has been enveloped in clothes and sheets—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180143"></xptr>
               <p>patches were dark blue on the right side, or you might call it purple and reddish in other places; they were more or less continuous on the left side, and went round almost to the spine—I have made many <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations; I know mistakes have been made in <hi rend="italic">cadaveric</hi> appearances, bruises have been mistaken for natural appearances sometimes, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, so much so that it is necessary to be extremely cautious not to be led into error—the <hi rend="italic">cadaveric</hi> appearances are produced by the cooling of the body; it is the fact that when after death the capillaries have lost their contractibility, that livid appearance is produced, and although the skin is pale, it becomes covered with patohes of a bluish or slatish colour, diffusing themselves over the greater part of the trunk and limbs—from what I heard and saw I think the appearances were the result of bruises; if it was uniform I should expect gravitation had something to do with it—I saw the body ten hours after death—I did not examine the surface of the body during life, but not being satisfied I went ten or twelve hours after death to make inquiries—most terrible mistakes have been made with respect to bruises—it is one of the characteristics of these patches that they are excessive, but in this case the bruises had nothing to do with gravitation—a person suffering from pleurisy Could not have gone to her daily work from the 19th to the next Tuesday week, it must have come on, since it was almost at its zenith when I saw her, or I should say that it had then existed several days, or there could not have been the ad hesion—I believe it came on before the Tuesday, because there were ad<lb></lb>hesions which could not have formed rapidly—if she had had pleurisy and gone about her work she would have suffered from shortness of breath and inflammatory action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The bruises on the right side were—worse than the left, the skin was separated from the muscles, which was not consistent with <hi rend="italic">cadaveric</hi> appearances to that extent—days must have elapsed before that, it could not occur in 48 hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any doubt now that what you saw was the result of bruises inflicted during life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt, certainly, those on the right side, I have not the slightest doubt about them—if the injuries had been inflicted a fortnight before, the bruises would still remain longer than a fortnight—I did not see her body while she was alive, but I did ten hours after death; there were then appearances of bruises which might have been a fortnight old, and there was a recent scratch on the shoulder, but that might be accidental—pleurisy may be the result of a blow or a Cold, and it is quite as likely that you may take cold in summer as well as winter, and cold, undoubtedly, will bring on pleurisy, especially if a person is weak, as she was, and standing about on the cold flags; she could have had pleurisy and gone about her work, but ft would not be to any extent—slight pleurisy will sometimes get worse without any assimilating cause, especially if the person moves about—squeezing the throat would not have any tendency to cause pleurisy, but kneeling on a person would, there must be some injury held in the throat, the attack must have existed some days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother—I have lived with him since his marriage—I recollect this disturbance of 19th July—after it was over the servant Collins said to me that she would hang her master if she could, because he ill-treated her mistress like that—the prisoner and his wife were very fond of each other, and very kind to each other, except at those times when they had quarrels—on the Tuesday before Mrs. Le Fuelle died I put mustard and linseed poultices on her shoulder.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they quarrel occasionally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; sometimes they have fought, and he has struck her—she aggravated him so much that he has lost his temper, and then he beat her—he did not beat her exactly, he frequently said if she would not hold her tongue he would—she never did hold her tongue, and sometimes he has struck her—she would call him all the names she could think of—I have begged her to come away—she was very passionate—she was not very often in this aggravating way; if he said anything to her, she would always aggravate him as far as she could—they may have had two falls out this year, one before this last one—they may have had quarrels, but no beating that I recollect—when he struck her before this he gave her a slap in the face or bead, nothing more, not with his doubled fist—I can't tell how many times altogether I have seen her beaten, not a dozen, several—there have been a good many falls out since they have been married—I can't say he has not beaten her twenty times—I was at home at the time of this disturbance—I was down in the kitchen—I went up stairs, and saw him having hold of her by the neck—I did not see him kneeling on her—she was on the floor, he was stooping over her—after he was taken to the station, she wanted to go and get him out, and wanted me to go with her at 11 o'clock at night—nothing was done to her that night—next day she ate her food in the ordinary way, nothing seemed the matter with her—she went to business after that—she had been ill a long time, ever since last April—she took to her bed on the Tuesday before she died—she came home ill—I put poultices on her shoulder—I did not notice any bruises—I did not take her things off—I did not notice anything the matter with her throat, she did not complain of it—she and I were generally good friends—she did not like me, she used to find fault with me very often, but I never said anything to her—she went every day to her husband's workshop to work, from the time this occurred till the Tuesday—she used to write for him, copying—they have children—they were at home all the time—when I saw him having hold of her throat I pulled him away, and told him to get away—when the policeman came he went up stairs—he said if they would let him alone and send the mob away, be would come down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. John Street—about two months ago Jemima Collins came to me to pay me some money, and in conversation about the prisoner and his wife, she said it was more the wife's fault than the husband's; that she was constantly aggravating and irritating him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Pentonville, and am in the prisoner's employ<lb></lb>ment as a copyist, I went there about March last—I used to go out for their dinner—although a dinner was provided, the deceased was in the habit of sending out for stewed eels, buns, and all kinds of things, she had a very unwholesome appetite—I always found the prisoner treat her with great kindness—he has sent out for port wine for her—he generally went out to his dinner—on Thursday evening, 24th July, they had supper together in Brownlow Street, the deceased was in very good spirits that night—she was very persistent in wanting to sleep there that night—she said she would sleep in the wash-house—they were busy that night—the prisoner said if she would not go and take a bed at a public-house opposite she must go home, she could not sleep at the office—she appeared quite well, in her usual state of health—on 29th July she told me that she had been to King's College Hospital and they had told her that she had pleurisy, and that the doctor sounded her and said she ought to go home and have mustard poultices on; that nothing could be done—and that same day she went to her mother's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to John Wootton, fancy manufacturer, a Houndsditch—the prisoners came together into our shop on the 22nd August—Priestley asked to see some plated chains; I showed them to him, and he did not like them—he then asked to gee some watches; I showed him some, and he asked the price—I said, "Three guineas"—he offered me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I would not take it—Garland was standing by his side—he put the watches back on the counter, and then asked to see the chains again; I showed them to him, and he chose one that he had seen before; the price was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked to see the watches again, and took one to the door to look at it—it was in this case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—his back was towards me—he came away from the door and offered 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said, "No"—there was a gold hunting watch in the case—he bought one of the chains, and Garland paid me—Priestley put the case back on the counter again shut up, and then left—Garland stopped behind and asked me for half a pint of beer, and I gave him a penny, and he left too—after they had left I opened the case and found a metal watch in the place of the gold one—the value of the metal watch is 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 1, Clement's-lane, Strand; I was living with William Maxfield; I know Mrs. Holland, she did live at No. 1, Clement's-lane, in the same house as the prisoner. On Monday, 14th May, I and Maxfield were invited to go to tea with Mrs. Holland—Maxfield went up first and I afterwards—there were five of us altogether at tea, and seven afterwards—Mrs. Holland occupied the back room, second floor, and the prisoner the front—whilst we were at tea, the prisoner came and kicked up a dreadful disturbance outside the door, and kicked in the panel of the door—I did not see her—that was about 6 o'clock—that was the first thing I heard of her that evening—at the same time she called out, "Come out, you b—w—; I will have your life, Jenny Holland"—Maxfield got up and opened the door, and asked what she meant by kicking up that <hi rend="italic">row.</hi> we were not disturbing her at all, she did not say anything to that—she was blaspheming and going on—I cannot say exactly the words—I did not hear her say anything about any clothes—Maxfield had nothing in his hand at the time—when he opened the door the prisoner did not come in, but she immediately threw a yellow dish at him, and another at me afterwards—the dish she threw at Maxfield struck him on the forehead, and he fell down, and the blood gushed out from his forehead—both the dishes were broken all to pieces—Maxfield was taken to the hospital by Jane Holland—I went afterwards, and saw his head partly dressed—he did not die till the 25th May—I saw him after his death—at the time this happened I was half and half; I was not to say drunk—the prisoner was mad drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I take the name of Thomas Holland. On 14th May I was living at No. 43, Clement's-lane, in the second floor back room; the prisoner lived in the front room on the same floor—on that day, William Maxfield, Hawkes, and some other persons, were taking tea with me—whilst we were at tea the prisoner came up stairs with a policeman—she had before that said that I had taken some of her children's frocks away—I cannot say whether anything had occurred before that—I believe that was the begin<lb></lb>ning of the disturbance—in the afternoon she brought up two policemen, and said I had forced her door open and taken some of her children's frocks—Hawkes and Maxfield were in my room at the time—my door was shut and the policeman and her were outside—I heard her tell the policeman this outside—the policeman asked me for a candle, I gave him one, and he went and looked at the lock, and said she was a very wicked woman for so saying, for nothing of the kind had been done, and the children's frocks had been taken off the stairs, and she had them in her hand at the time—she then went down with the policeman, and I shut my door as the policeman told me to do—about half an hour afterwards she came up again, and violently kicked against my door, and said, "I want that b—w—, Jane Holland; I will have her out of the room"—Maxfield got up, opened the door, and told her to be quiet—he had no sooner spoken the words than</p>

               <p>she <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> a dish at him; it struck him. and knocked him down, and he bled a great deal—I saw her throw another dish, which struck Hawkes on the forehead—I picked Maxfield up, and took him to the hospital—his wound was dressed there, and he afterwards returned to my house—I saw Griffiths there—at the time Maxfield went to the door he had not a poker in his hand, nor had Griffiths—I had only one poker in my room—they did not hold pokers over their heads at the prisoner, nothing of the kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Lock, and live at No. 1, Clare-passage, Clare Market. On 14th May I was living in the same room with Mrs. Holland—my husband was not living there—I was not present on the day in question when they were having tea—I came in between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening—Maxfield came in between 10 and 11 o'clock (they had been out drinking)—whilst I was in the room I saw Griffiths and Maxfield stand <hi rend="italic">brandishing</hi> pokers over the prisoner's head—each man had a poker in his hand—the prisoner was in her own room; the door was wide open—they were aggravating each other—the expressions they used were dreadful, on the one side as well as the other—there were five of them: Maxfield, Griffiths, another man, and these two women—there was also another female and myself, but we had nothing to do with it—the other woman ran down to get a policeman—the men were <hi rend="italic">brandishing</hi> the pokers over the prisoner's head in her own room—I saw her throw the dish at Maxfield—Hawkes and Holland were in their own room, or in the passage—the prisoner was a few yards from Maxfield when she threw the dish—they stood aggravating her, with the door open, and challenging her to come out to fight, and they would have her life, <hi rend="italic">brandishing</hi> the pokers, and then she threw the dish—Maxfield got his poker out of Holland's room, and so did Griffith—I had been living with Mrs. Holland about five months—I will swear there were two pokers in her room—Maxfield staggered from the blow; he was not knocked down, he did not fall; he reeled against the bed-stead—I saw his head, it bled very much; it did not appear very much cut—Mrs. Holland took him to the hospital—next day I went with him to the hospital, and the surgeon extracted the pieces from his head, and I begged him, in the surgeon's presence, not to get drinking, for I said, "Erysipelas will take place, and that will cause your death perhaps"—he said I was an old fool for saying so—the prisoner said she was very sorry for it, she did not intend to do anything; and he said to her in the room, "I had no business to be there; it serves me well right what I have met with."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at King's College Hospital, when Maxfield came there about 10 o'clock, on Tuesday morning, 15th May—he had been there the evening before, and was seen by the house physician—I examined his head—he had two wounds on the forehead, each about three quarters of an inch in length, the upper one extending throughout its whole extent to the bone of the skull; the under one was not so deep—I removed several small portions of earthenware from the upper wound—they were contused and lacerated wounds—I thought they would probably go on favourably—I dressed them—he continued to come to the hospital until 21st May, when considerable erysipelas appeared on the face of the scalp in the neighbourhood of the wound—he was then admitted as an in-patient—I continued to attend him—he died on the morning of the 25th—I have no doubt his death was caused by the erysipelas, which resulted from the scalp wound—those wounds might have been caused by an earthen<lb></lb>ware dish thrown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> They were not in themselves dangerous wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, only in the event of erysipelas coming on—scalp wounds very often heal—intemperate habits would very much expose him to erysipelas, and might tend to bring it on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might this wound of itself have produced erysipelas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he told me that some time before the accident he had had very little food, and had been living principally on drink—I did not learn from him what his habits were afterwards—erjrsipelas might or might not result from such wounds.</p>

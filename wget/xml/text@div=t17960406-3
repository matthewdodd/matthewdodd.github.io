Jack, I am sorry it is you; I don't recollect that he made any answer; immediately upon that out ran a pig out of a sack; I took hold of the sacks, and found something heavy; I looked close by the sack, and there lay a pig hardly dead, quite warm; I went round the cart, and clapped my hand on Morris's shoulder, who was at the back of the other cart, and said, come with me, or words to that effect, and desired Bradshaw to take hold of him on the other side; we took no further notice of Crossby, till the next morning; when the constable, hearing what I had to say, took him into custody; I desired my man to take care of Morris, while I called up Mr. Denby, and the pigs were left with him; there were two live pigs in the bag, besides the slaughtered one, but one of them made his escape.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Young bring you any pigs that night? - A. Yes; one dead, and one alive, in a sack, they were my pigs; the dead one had a particular mark, it was a boar-pig, and I was going to cut him, but I thought the string was so swelled, it was not proper; the live pig I have no doubt was mine, from the size and age of it, and its mother took to it.(The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence).</p>

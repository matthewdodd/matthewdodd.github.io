               <p>Q. Had you tied it there in the morning before you went out. - A. After I came out, I had been home with some work, and six-pence I took out of the handkerchief to pay for the peppermint at the bar; these two girls came out of the tap-room, and Growket asked me to treat them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before. - A. Yes, they lived in Chick-lane; I told Growket I could not afford to treat her, she then gave me a push by the arm, while the other prisoner picked my pocket; I felt her hand in my pocket, and saw her take the handkerchief out of my pocket, I endeavoured to take it from her, but she pulled the handkerchief with great force, and tore the corner of it with the money in it, then they both crossed over the way, and ran away laughing; I followed them into Brewers' Yard, Chick-lane, I went up stairs and asked them for the money, they refused giving it me, and

             sworn. I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On sunday morning the 9th of March the prosecutrix came to my house, and informed me she had been robbed; I went with her to Brewers' Yard, Chick-lane, to the apartment of one Golding, when I went into the room the two prisoners were both undressed, and in Golding's bed; in looking about the room I saw a pocket which Philips said belonged to her, containing a shilling, a penny, and a farthing, Golding and I I with difficulty found Growket's pocket, there I found two shillings, three sixpences, and three half pence, I then took them away; in walking along, Growket burst out crying, she asked me where I was going to take her to, I told her to New Prison, she then said she did not do it, but Philips did rob the girl, and she would not be hung for Philips; the next day the prosecutrix produced the handkerchief, the knot is in the handkerchief now, it is torn away from the knot; I produce it.</p>

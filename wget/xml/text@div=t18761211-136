                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, of 294, Pentonville Road—on 17th October, at 9.30 p.m., I closed my house safely and went upstairs—I heard a noise about 10.30, and in a minute or two another noise—I went down and found the prisoner at the bottom of the stairs in the passage—I asked him what he was doing; he said that he was looking for a friend—I seized him and called "Police"—the shop counter had been moved—there were several marks on the street door, which was unfastened but put to—no one was in the shop when I closed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> There was a light in the passage, but not in the shop—I sell apples—there are nine children in the house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 446). Hale called me and gave the prisoner into my charge, who told me he was looking for a friend—I found this chisel in the waisthand of his trowsers—the door post is not strong, it is not a fixture; it is taken down in the day, and it is loose; it could be shifted back with the chisel so as to release the lock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This is a fruit shop, and anybody seeing the door open might go in. I missed my friend, and thinking he had gone in to buy some fruit I went in. I did not try to run away.</p>

I occupy all but the middle room, which is occupied by a lodger, Mrs. Blower, a laundress—I have two children, one is fourteen months old, and the other four years—there are two long muslin curtains and a blind to the kitchen window, which looks into the yard, but they are quite thin; anybody can see through them—I assist my husband by taking in dress and mantle making—last Monday week, about half past 6, or a quarter to 7 o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, the ground floor room; I had a lamp, and there was also a good fire which gave some light—I saw a person looking in at the window, as if he was reading my name as dress and mantle maker, which is on a sign board in the window, and directly afterwards I heard a gentle knock at the door; I went to the door and saw the prisoner with a bundle—he asked if Mrs. Harrisson was in; I said, "I am Mrs. Harrisson"—he said "I have brought you some work from my sister"—I asked him into the parlour to see what work it was he had—I went in and he followed me, and shut the door after him, and the parlour door also—the light was on the table close to the door; he put out the light, and said, "Now I want your money"—I said, "I have none"—he touched the outside of my dress, and my money jingled in my pocket—I bad 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, loose in my pocket—he dragged my pocket out, took all the money out, threw the coppers on the floor, and left them there—he then struck me on the nose, and the blood flew on to the bosom of his shirt; I then fell with my head against the corner of a chair, and then he dragged me across to the other side of the room, and struck me at the back of my head with a large stick of my husband's, and left me on the floor unable to speak—then he went to the other end of the room, took two pistols out of his pocket, put them on the table, and said, that if I hallooed out he would kill the baby, which was lying asleep—he cut each end of the line which was hanging in the room, tied my hands together with it, and then dragged me to the other side of the room, <hi rend="italic">jammed</hi> me in between two chairs and left me—the eldest child then began to scream—he prisoner went upstairs, came down again, and the children were then both screaming; he went out of doors, and I saw him look over the short blind as he went by the window—I was then on the floor, unable to make any alarm—my eldest child ran over to the tap and gave an alarm, upon which two men came to me, and afterwards the police, and a medical gentle<lb></lb>man—in the course of that evening I gave a description to the police of the person who had attacked me; and on the following evening I went, t the request of the police, to a penny theatre, about 300 yards from our house—I went into the pit alone, and saw the prisoner standing by the orchestra with a short pipe in his mouth, and the same handkerchief and trowsers as he had on before; it was a white handkerchief with large blue or green spots; I believe blue—I felt quite certain that he was the man, and I feel quite positive now; I went out directly and spoke to the police, and they went in and took him into custody—I had seen him before, on the Wednesday before this happened, that is three weeks to-day; I was coming from the Metropolitan Hospital with my children, and saw the prisoner near the Exchange with some handkerchiefs, which were not new, and one of which he asked me to buy for a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but in consequence of what a woman who was with me said to me, I did not buy it—I did not stand still, I was going on and the prisoner fol<lb></lb>lowed me—I had an opportunity of observing his features; he was five or ten minutes in my sight on that occasion, and he was ten minutes or a quar<lb></lb>ter of an hour in my parlour on that night.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say he was in your company from half-past 6 till half past 8 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the saloon—I am quite sure he was there all that time—he never left, except merely when he went into the public house, and he returned before me—that was about 5 minutes to 7 o'clock, as near as possible—we did not stay there two minutes, and then returned to the theatre, and there he staid till the first performance was over, which was half past 8 o'clock—I had seen him the day before, Sunday—I went to the fight with him, but they did not fight; the other man did not come to his time, and forfeited his money—the prisoner was dressed on Monday night in a pea jacket, and a light scarf, with a darkish spot in it, and cord trowsers, very tight; his usual dress, in fact—this is the scarf—I have no doubt whatever of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember this Monday, the 11th—I was with Mr. Mallett all the afternoon, from half past 3 till 6 o'clock in the evening, and then I met him again at 25 minutes to 7; he was then in the saloon—I went under the stage to see some of the people engaged at the place—the dressing room is under the stage—I returned about 5 minutes past 7 o'clock, and he was then going on the stage, I believe, to hold the people while they were having the laughing gas—I left him by the orchestra then, and went out of the place—I returned again in about an hour, and he was there then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you were with him from half past 3 to 6 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we were in the saloon in the afternoon—there were some people there having their likenesses taken—he was not in the saloon from half past 3 till 6 o'clock—we came out of there, and he asked me to take a walk with him down Whitechapel—that was a little after half past 5 o'clock—it was 25 minutes to 7 when I saw him again in the saloon—I went out and returned in an hour, and he was standing by the orchestra; he always stands there all the evening—he had on a pea jacket and this scarf—I was with him when he bought this scarf, on Sunday morning; he gave 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I saw him on the Tuesday evening—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> outside the door in the road, with two <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>, fighting, and he was there then—I did not see him in the theatre when he was taken into custody on the Tuesday evening, I saw him just before—I did not notice whether he had this handkerchief on then—I did not notice his dress that evening—he had on this handker<lb></lb>chief when I saw him outside the door at 6 o'clock on the Tuesday evening, and the same jacket, and he had it on on the Monday evening—he spoke to me about it—I was going to buy one myself like it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How does he get his living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have always been told that he worked in the docks; I could not swear to it—he gets so much a night at this saloon; I cannot say how much—I generally open the doors soon after 6 o'clock, sometimes half-past 6, to allow the people to go in—the per<lb></lb>formance begins about 7 o'clock, sometimes before—we have no regular time, it is according to what people there are in—the place holds 300 or 400 people when it is full—sometimes it is full and sometimes slack—I am engaged next door, at Mr. Pollard's—I at times go in there, almost every night for the last six weeks—there is singing and dancing there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow; I keep this theatre for my nephew, and take the money there. I know the prisoner from employing him, I think, about three months—he gets two nights a week 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night, and the other nights 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has to keep peace and quietness, and to keep the saloon select—I remember this Monday night—I got to the theatre at 25 minutes after 5 o'clock that evening, and when I got there, to the best of my recollection, he was sitting on a seat in the shop—we have to pass through a shop to go to the theatre—I saw him after that repeatedly through the evening, as it was his custom to go in and out of an evening, and he always speaks, and asks me if all is right—he did just the same that evening as all other evenings—I considered him a very quiet, harmless young man—he had very little to say, and always did his duty—he bore a good character,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180035"></xptr>
               <p>as far as I knew—he was recommended by a party, who said he was a very quiet young man—it was necessary for us to have a person, and we engaged him—he appeared a very quiet, inoffensive man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many nights a week is the theatre open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six nights—he was employed six nights a week—I believe he did fight prize fights, but he never fought in our place—it was his duty to keep quietness at the theatre—if he chose to go out for half an hour during the evening, there was nobody to prevent him—I know the Bull Inn-yard; it is not a very great way from the theatre; I cannot say the distance.</p>

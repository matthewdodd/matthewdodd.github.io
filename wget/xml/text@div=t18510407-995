                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich. On 28th March I delivered a carpet-bag to Thomas Beavis to take to our laundress, containing six yards of stuff, five shirts, two pairs of stockings, an apron, a chemise, and other articles—I had put them into the bag, and saw Beavis put them into his cart—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the shirts—it has my initials on it—the bag was then covered with carpet, but now has only the lining left (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I received a bag from Mr. Marson to take to the laundress in London—I put it in my cart, and went on to Woolwich—as I was returning over Blackheath I missed the bag—it had been at the bottom of my cart, and could not have fallen out—I left the cart several times, once as long as half an hour.</p>

On 28th March, about twenty minutes past nine at night, I saw the prisoner coming out of the Ship and Billett, Woolwich-road, with a bundle under his arm—I stopped him and asked what he had in the bundle—he said he had a dirty shirt, towel, and a pair of stockings, which he had taken off the same day—I took him into the toll-house—the bundle was this lining of a carpet-bag—I saw a piece of merino at the top of the bag—I told him he must go to the station, and on the way he told me he had picked up the bundle coming down Shooter's-hill—at the station I saw the bag contained five shirts, seven collars, two pairs of stockings, a chemise, a pair of drawers, a silk</p>

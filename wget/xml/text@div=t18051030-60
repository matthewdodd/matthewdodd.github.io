             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where do you live? - A. At Great Barkham; I am in the straw-plat way; I come to town twice a week; I saw the prisoner at the Artichoke in Fleet-market; I cannot tell the day; I saw him once before; I sold him the goods in the month of August.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the note. (The note produced by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. The name of Simmons on it is your name on it? - A. Yes, I cannot write, my daughter put that name on it.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a charge against the prisoner for forging a bill of exchange. A bill of exchange consists of a note drawn upon a person on a certain date, signed by somebody before it is accepted. Instead of that, this bill is accepted before it was signed, therefore it was no bill at all; therefore, when you were there, they told you they would give you a bill, and with an acceptance, they having put the acceptance, and there is no name signed to it. It cannot be called a bill of exchange, because it requires something else to a bill of exchange, which is the handwriting of a drawer. I cannot take that as an act of forgery, because it is not a forgery of a bill of exchange; when the name is not written upon it it is no bill of exchange, it is but a bit of blank paper. Prisoner, I advise you to take to other courses.</p>

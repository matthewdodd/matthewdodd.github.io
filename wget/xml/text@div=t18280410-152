            . I am shopwoman to Mr. Foot, and left the shop in Cheapside, rather before nine o'clock in the evening of the 28th of March, leaving Twinch there; I have seen some umbrellas since - here is one very remarkable, which I know well; about one hundred were missing.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Foot, and was the last person in the shop, on the 28th of February, I left some of the stock in the window, and some in the shop - I went again, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and found the door ajar; I missed a great number of umbrellas - the top lock had been broken open, and the other opened by a false key. Full one hundred umbrellas were gone; here is one I can particularly swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Your master is an extensive dealer? A. Yes; I do not know how many agents he has - the one I swear to, has a bone hook, of a description we never had before; it is a black and white bone; we never had one so small as this before - it stood in a corner of the shop the night before; I am certain we never sold it; I had showed it to a customer about seven o'clock that evening.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you worked for him? A. Four or five months; I cover them after the hooks are put on - the books depend on the size of the umbrella; the size of this is not remarkable.</p>

            . I live in Cable-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner came to my house with these umbrellas on Monday, the 10th of March, with another person who knew me; that person said, "I have brought a person here who has one hundred umbrellas to sell, and has brought one as a sample" - the prisoner had this one in a black bag; I think he said they were 7s. or 8s. each; I told him to leave it till next morning, and I would let him know - he came alone in the morning, and I said the price would not do; he said the lot cost 30l., and I might have them for 35l; I said I would have them - he took me to a house on the other side of Finsbury-square to look at them; before we came to the house he said, "We will go into this public-house and have something to drink" - we went, and had some rum and water; while there he said, "I will go to the house, which is just by, and see if they are all ready;" he went out, stopped some time, and I asked the landlord,(who I had seen him speak to,) where he was gone - I went to Mr. Gray's by his direction, and found the door open; I went in, and saw him and Gray in the parlour - a number of umbrellas were there - I looked at them; the prisoner said, "Are you satisfied" - I said, Yes; he said he would get the remainder - he went and brought down some more, and said, "Here is but seventy, but I will settle that at your house;" I said I had left some rum and water at the public house - we went there, and then to the house again; the officer was then waiting there - I thought I was going to see them at his own house; he did not say he had them to sell for another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever been in this Court before? A. I was tried in the other Court twelve years ago, but acquitted before the trial was half through - it was for fetching some silver spoons out of pawn; I have been very cautious ever since; I was tried at Hick's Hall for a misdemeanor - I have lived where I do for fifteen years; the officer knew me - my house has been searched perhaps twenty times; I gave information of this to the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the misdemeanor? A. It was about some articles which I bought; I was admitted to bail - no other charges were ever made against me; I was never charged with stealing a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your house searched about? A. If malicious people will lay informations against me I cannot help it.</p>

            . On Thursday, the 28th of February, the prisoner, who lodges with me, came to me at three o'clock in the afternoon; I saw him there till eleven, and he then went to bed - it was the day the New Brunswick Theatre fell down - he came in and told me of it; I saw him about seven o'clock in the morning - he slept on the ground floor - I sleep up stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 17, Carter-street, Brick-lane, Bethnal-green; the prisoner keeps the house, I lodge there, and have done so about two months - we both work at the same shop, and have our meals together; we supped about ten o'clock - his wife and my wife supped with us; I cannot tell what we had - I did not go out to look at the Theatre till the Saturday; we all breakfasted together next morning, and had our meals together - we dined between twelve and one; we drank nothing but porter at supper; we are both weavers, and work for Ellerby, Wilson and Co.</p>
               <p>- DUNCAN. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 28th of February the prisoner came home about three o'clock - he had been to see the Theatre which had fallen down; he was at home all day till about eleven o'clock, when he went to bed; I generally fasten the door- there is no key to it; I saw him again between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - either I or my husband opened the door to let a girl in who nurses my child; I saw the prisoner all the next day - we sleep on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you have for supper? A. I think bread and cheese; I do not recollect any gin being fetched - the prisoner went to bed first; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100086"></xptr>down in the supper room before my husband - I am his daughter.</p>

I took a flat of butter off; the flats contained fourteen lumps, each lump two pounds, twenty-eight pounds. I placed this flat down on the pavement, with several others ready to deliver to the respective owners; about five minutes after I had so placed it, I missed this one flat or basket, and while I was looking for it, thinking it might be in a wrong place, the officer came by with the identical flat that I had lost I am positive the flat that the officer had is the same that I took from the waggon, and placed there five or six minutes previous to his bringing the man and the flat of butter back. This was about seven in the morning, quite light.</p>

            . I am an officer, about a quarter past seven in the morning, I was standing in Newgate Street, opposite of Warwick Lane; I observed the prisoner running along with this flat of butter before him; I suspected him from the manner of his carrying it; it is not an usual manner of carrying butter; I immediately crossed the road, he turned down Warwick Lane; I followed him, he kept on a good jog trot; he went behind carts, he went into a door-way; he took a great coat from under his arm and begun to cover up the flat; I then went up to him and asked him whose it was, he said his, he was going to take it home; I asked him who he had it from; he said a person in the street; I took him back into Newgate Street; we passed several waggons, we came to a waggon where Rogers was unloading; I said Rogers have you lost a flat of butter, he said yes, he was that moment looking after it; as soon as he saw it, he said it was the identical flat of butter that he had lost; I took the prisoner to the compter. This is the flat that I had taken out of the waggon and, I missed it.</p>

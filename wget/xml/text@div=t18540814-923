                  </hi>. I am vestry clerk of the parish of St. Bride's, in the City of London—I know the defendant; he is a housekeeper in that parish—I have known him living there twenty years or more—I have a copy of the appointment of this gentleman to serve the office of overseer—this is a copy of the appointment by Sir James Duke (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"I, Sir James Duke, being one of the Aldermen of the City of London, do hereby nominate and appoint John Brown, Thomas Glanville, and George Frederick Cruch<lb></lb>ley, to be overseers of the parish of St. Bride's")—our parish is in the ward of Farringdon, of which Sir James Duke is Alderman—there is a book kept of the name of every man as he enters the parish—it has come in the order of rotation, to the turn of this gentleman, to serve that office—he has never served that office—after this appointment was made, the other two overseers and myself waited on Mr. Cruchley—I took with me the banker's book, belonging to this parish, and the check book, and the notice of the parliamentary election, which it was necessary for the overseer to sign—Mr. Cruchley said he could not attend to the duties, that he had a great deal to do, and that public business excited him—the other two gentlemen said that if he would take the office on himself with them, they would take all the laborious duties of it, and that he hardly need to come out of his counting house, if he would merely take the office on himself for the sake of public example—he absolutely refused to take it—he said he could not do it, and he did not do it, and the notice was published with only two overseers' names—I had made the report of this to the vestry in April; the appointment was at Easter—the notice was a public printed notice—the vestry directed this course to be adopted; they determined that the defendant should be compelled to do it—after this bill was preferred, I came to some understanding with him—Mr. Cruchley came to my office at half past 10 o'clock one morning—I was engaged with two gentlemen; I left them, and went and spoke to him—he said he wished to settle—I told him I was engaged, and to come at 11 o'clock—he came at 11 o'clock, and we came to an arrangement—he was to pay the usual fine to the parish of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the costs, 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he left my office at half past 11 o'clock, and came again at 1 o'clock, and laid on the table four small parcels in paper—he said, "You will find 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—I opened three of them,</p>

               <p>they were each 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the fourth was only 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he made it up in silver—he said, "Give me a receipt," and I did—he did not draw for the balance; he said he did not like to be drawn on for a small amount; he gave me an I O U, and said he would pay next week—immediately he left me, I came to consult Mr. Bodkin, and he advised that it wag proper for the defendant to come here and plead guilty.</p>

You are requested to attend on Monday morning; the 10th, to take the office." The other two came, and they went with me to Mr. Cruchley's, and said, "Will you take on yourself the office?"—he said, "What will be the consequence if I do not?"—I said, "You will be liable to a fine"—I repeatedly gave him notice of my intention to indict him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give him any formal notice of your intention to indict him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I did not summon him to attend before a Magistrate to answer the charge for refusing to serve the office—I did not go to the London Sessions, because I inquired at the office of the Clerk of the Peace, and was told it was customary to come here—I went to inquire, and was told it was the same thing whether it was here or at the London Sessions.</p>

My own impression undoubtedly at present is, that the statement is receivable; because I cannot hip thinking that the meaning of the Act of Parliament is, that the Magistrate shall, after the examination of all the wit<lb></lb>nesses for the prosecution, and having it read over in due course to the prisoner, then call on him to make such statement as he may be advised, giving him, as I should say, the two cautions which are contained in the</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th section. If a Magistrate acts so, then he gets rid of all the difficulty which may arise out of any previous threat or promise by any other person, however much authorised that person may be to make such a threat or promise. If a prosecutor has promised a man that if he would confess, he should be let off scot-free, still, if a Magistrate, when the prisoner is brought before him, and after the exami<lb></lb>nation</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">of the witnesses against him has been taken, tells him that he is not bound to make any statement, hut that what he says will he taken down, and received in evidence against him, and that he has nothing to hope from any promise of favour, and nothing to fear from any threat held out to him before, to induce him to make the confession; after the Magistrate has done all that, he has removed the effect of any previous promise or threat, and the man is then to be taken in point of law to be a free man, not bound to say more than he pleases; but whatever he does say, notwithstanding any previous threat or promise, may be received against him. That was not the case formerly, because where a promise or threat was previously made by a person authorised to make it, then the statement before the Magistrate was not received, but it is now. And further, after caution given and statement made, it is receivable, and receivable without any further proof than the mere transmission of it by the Magis<lb></lb>trate, without any proof being given that it was said by the prisoner, but only that the Magistrate says it was said by the prisoner the Act of Parlia<lb></lb>ment then says it shall be receivable in evidence, and have its effect. But I think it meant no more; and it left full liberty to parties to prove in a lawful way, as they might have proved before, any statement or confession made by the prisoner at any time; before the Magistrate, or at any other time—here they propose to prove it in a regular way, by a gentleman who heard what he said at the time, and took it down in writing, and who tells us that no promise or threat was made. I am therefore of opinion, under these circumstances, that the statement is receivable."</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CRESSWELL</hi>: "<hi rend="italic">I concur in thinking it receivable. At the same time I can see it is open to doubt, which I think ought to be considered by the Judges. In the first place, a man making a statement under this Act of Parlia<lb></lb>ment, has the security provided by the Act, that it is to be recorded by the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate, and that that record will be the only evidence, and that nothing will be proved that is not in that record. It is obvious if this statement is to be received, although it was written down by the clerk, the Court would not be bound to re<lb></lb>ceive that writing, if it is to be proved by ordinary statement; it does not pre<lb></lb>clude</hi> B <hi rend="italic">from proving by parol, because</hi> A <hi rend="italic">took a note of it, unless that note was taken officially, and made the proper evidence of it. Therefore, a prisoner may be exposed to have a different version given by some bystander of what he said, instead of that recorded by the Magistrate, which would preclude all evidence of anything beyond that. The matter seems to me not without some difficulty attending it, but I think it is admissible."</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Carrier-street, St. Giles's. The deceased, Catherine Shehan, was my daughter, and was twenty-seven years old—she lived in the same room with myself, two other daughters, a son, and the prisoner—we all slept in the same room—on Saturday night, between one and two o'clock, we were all in bed except Catherine—she came into the room where we were all in bed—she had taken enough—she said, "Mother, is any one out?"—I said, "No"—she said, "Is there no fire or candle light?"—I said, "Un<lb></lb>dress and get into bed, never mind"—she got angry, and began to talk—her brother said, "If you don't leave off talking and get into bed. I will put on my clothes and go out," which he did—she still kept on talking—the pri<lb></lb>soner awoke up with the noise, and said, "Why don't you go to bed, and let us sleep?"—she spoke very roughly to him, and called him very ugly names—she went on with a deal of rough talk, and gave him a deal of <hi rend="italic">sauce</hi>—he got out of bed, and they had a struggle on the floor—I got up, took her round the waist, and sat her down on the foot of the bed—I put my knee over her to pacify and keep her from talking—I had some difficulty to keep her down—she was violent and struggled, and while I had her down on my knee on the bed, the prisoner came and hit me on the knee with a stick—I sat on the bed, and she with me, and he hit her on the head once—her head</p>

               <p>bled, but not a great deal—one of my daughters told him to throw away the stick, which he did, and went down stairs—my daughter complained of pains in her head that day—she stayed at home all Sunday and Monday—she did not get tipsy on Monday—no drink was brought to my house except a drop of beer, which I brought myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness. I was in bed on this Sunday morning between one and two o'clock—Catherine came in and awoke me by <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> at my mother—my brother got out of bed, and told her to go to sleep, and then he went away—the prisoner afterwards awoke up, and said, "Go to bed, and let us sleep"—she persisted in making a disturbance—she said it was not often she disturbed him, and he could go out the same as her brother did—she was still <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> him—what she said I do not know, but I saw him on the floor, and he struck her with his fist—she afterwards called him some very bad names—I did not see him strike her with the stick—I saw it in his hand—my sister desired him to put it down, and he did so and went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the deceased—I was awoke out of my sleep on this Sunday morning when Catherine came home—after my brother had gone out I heard the prisoner say, "Go into bed, and let us sleep"—I then fell asleep, and heard no more till I heard Catherine on the bed, saying, "O dear, O dear, what shall I do?"—I jumped out of bed, and saw the prisoner on the floor with the stick in his hand—I told him to put it down, and not hit her with it—he put it down, and walked out—after he was gone I saw her head bleeding—I did not hear her complain of her head that night—she did on Sunday and Monday—I was out on Tuesday—I saw her on Wednesday morning as I was going out with my basket—she was still kept in her bed—I was not present when she died, I saw her dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, attached to the infirmary of the workhouse of this parish—I first saw the deceased on the Monday, between one and two, in her own room—she was perfectly sober—she was in a state of great prostration—I understood that she had received some blows on the Sun<lb></lb>day morning, and that she had vomited large quantities of blood—I found considerable contusion round the left eye—the symptoms were principally those of stomach disease, and I treated her for hæmatemesis—I found a wound on the head which had been dressed—she never mentioned any head symptoms to me—she always directed my attention to the region about the stomach—her expression was that her heart was burst, which is a very com<lb></lb>mon expression among that class of people—I saw hex on Tuesday—the symptoms were rather improved, but still the same—on the Wednesday I found her in a state of complete collapse, in fact evidently dying—she died within an hour after my seeing her—on the Friday following I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found undoubted acute inflammation of the stomach—the head presented very slight appearances of congestion, nothing more than I should expect to find in almost all cases where no blow had been given—in my judgment the cause of death was acute inflammation of the stomach, occurring on a state of chronic inflammation—there was a large patch of co<lb></lb>agulated blood on the stomach, from which part, no doubt, the blood which she vomited had come—in my judgment the blow on the head had nothing to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100054"></xptr>
               <p>do with the cause of death—she would have died had she received no blow, the blow might have aggravated the symptoms to a slight degree, and I have no doubt it did, but in my opinion she would decidedly have died had she received no blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were all the symptoms you saw before you made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, consistent with the existence of this acute inflammation of the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perfectly—the vomiting of blood I think referred to the old disease of the stomach, which was of long standing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think she would have died as soon from the inflmma<lb></lb>tion of the stomach, if no blow had been given? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have recently had a case in which death occurred thirty hours after the attack of acute inflamma<lb></lb>tion, and so it is quite possible—it is impossible for me to give a decided opinion—I do not think the blow contributed at all to the death, I attached no importance to it during life.</p>

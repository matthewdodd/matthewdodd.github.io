            . I am headborough of Shadwell. On the 10th of February I met the prisoner in the Commercial-road, and said I wanted her. She said</p>
               <p>"Don't take me into custody now, Mr. Atkinson." She said she would tell me where she lived, but going down the road, she declined telling me. We walked to the watch-house together, and I took from her person a bonnet and gown which she had on, also a black silk skirt, flannel petticoat, a pocket, and a handkerchief. She said the shift she had on was her mistresses, and gave me a book, which she said was her own, and seven duplicates. I asked her about a brooch and black satin spencer; she said voluntarily that she had pawned them at a shop at the other end of the town, and left the duplicate on the counter; she did not know where the shop was.</p>

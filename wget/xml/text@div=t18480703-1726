                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. I am servant to Mr. William Wheatley, of 23, South-terrace, Thurlow-square, Brompton—the prisoner was in his service eight days, and left between seven and eight o'clock on 21st June—she left one of her boxes behind, and Mr. Wheatley said she must come for it afterwards—she came for it about eight that evening, and asked leave to go down-stairs for a certain purpose—you have to pass the kitchen to go to the closet—it is indoors—you need not go into the kitchen to go to it—she went down-stairs, and I waited for her up-stairs in the passage—I and a little boy six years old were the only persons in the house, besides an invalid lady up<lb></lb>stairs, who was locked in—the prisoner was gone a very long time, and I called to her three times—she made no answer—I went down, and saw her come out of the kitchen—I am sure it was not out of the other place—I did not go into the kitchen myself at that time—we both came up-stairs together—I opened the door to let her out, and while I was standing at the door, before she went out, I smelt a great burning—I asked her if she had seen anything on fire when she was down-stairs—I am sure I used the word <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> anything—she said no, she had not—she was looking down at the kitchen window two or three times, we could see it from where we were—I looked and saw a great smoke come from the window—I asked her whether she would mind coming</p>

               <p>down stairs again with me, and she told me I might go down and look and see whether it was on fire, for she had not any business in the house when her box was out—I told her, that master would be very much obliged to her if she would come down and put it out, if it was on fire—she would not, and I went down by myself into the kitchen—I went to a cupboard, the door of which I found shut, and found rags inside burning on the top—it was smouldering—there was a little flame—I am sure I saw flame—it was beginning to light again, but a pipe which runs through the cupboard was melted, and the water run out and put it out—I was rather frightened, I ran up stairs and asked the prisoner again to come down—she told me to go down and open all the doors and windows, and then the smoke would go out—I went down, but I did not do that—I opened the cupboard-door, and when I found it was begin<lb></lb>ning to blaze up again I shut it again—the prisoner came down in about ten minutes—I had not done anything in the mean time to put it out—I could not do anything—when she came down I threw some water over it, and when it was very near out, she took up a jug and threw some over it herself—I told her if I opened the windows and doors it would blaze up, and the house would be burnt down before my master came home—she said she could no: help it, she was in a hurry, as she had to go out that evening—I asked her if she met my master to tell him that the house had been on fire, and she said she would—we usually kept black-lead brushes and leathers to polish candlesticks in the cupboard—there were some rags, but no wood was there before the fire—I am sure of that—it was kept in a different cupboard—there was wood mixed with the rags when it was on fire—that was the first time I had seen wood there—rags were kept in the cupboard, but in a different part—I had not seen any of them before on that day—the wood was kept in another cupboard—no paper was kept there,-but there was some burning—the inside of the door, the side, and underneath the shelves of the cupboard, were all burnt black—I had to throw a great deal of water on it—it was put out at last—my master came in a little time after the prisoner had gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any part of the cupboard on fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was no flame from any part of the cupboard itself—the rags were where the flame was—the cupboard-door was black, and all in cracks with the burn<lb></lb>ing—it appeared as if it had been in a flame—it was charred—the paint was blistered—when I told the prisoner the place was on fire, she said it was only nonsense—she did not say anything before I noticed the flame—she remained there ten minutes—she did not go till it was over.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at this house—it is in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington—the prisoner came into my service on 12th June—for some reason I parted with her—she went on 21st—she wanted a month's wages besides the time she had been in my house—I refused to pay her, on account of her conduct and the bad language she used while in the house—she had been rather violent—she said she would not go without her month's wages—that was on the Tuesday—on the Wednesday evening after I paid her I went out—I gave her leave to leave one of her boxes in the passage, and to come back for it—I left my little boy and Caroline Steele in the house—the rest of my family were out—as I came home I met the prisoner at the corner of Thurlow-square, and said, "You have been for your box yourself?"—she said, "Yes, Sir"—that was all she said—I went home, and found Steele very frightened, and fainting away in the passage—I went into the</p>

               <p>kitchen, and the water was running out of the pipe that supplies the cistern in the fireplace—the water in the kitchen was over my feet, I was wet up to my ankles—the pipe was very hot, and there were some rags which had been burning under it—they were smouldering like tinder—I did not see any flame—the kitchen was full of smoke—I put it entirely out—the cupboard was very much chirred, and the paint quite black—it had been in flames and the tire had come round out of the cupboard—sonic of the outside of the cupboard was burnt—the water had stopped it—I had looked in the cup<lb></lb>board before I went out, I saw no rairs of that kind there—I cannot say there were no rags there—nothing of a Combustible nature was kept in the cupboard—lociter matches are kept in a tin box, on the mantel-piece.</p>

               <persName id="t18090412-9-person98">A. Mary Havendon</persName>
            ; I went to her, the prisoner was in the bar with her; my housekeeper told me that she had taken out a five pound note and two two-pound notes, and twelve shillings and sixpence, which was nine pounds twelve shillings and sixpence, and seven shillings and sixpence she took for the wine, in change of a ten pound note for three pints of wine; at that minute a man that frequented the house with eggs came, my housekeeper went to him and bought two shillingsworth of eggs, and when she returned she missed two two-pound notes from off the bar; she said there was no one present in the bar but herself and the prisoner; she requested that I would send for an officer. I put the question to the prisoner, she denied taking them; I sent for an officer, the officer came; the housekeeper and the prisoner were in the bar, I shewed him into the bar; he came out and told me he had found the two two-pounds upon her. I know nothing of the notes, I leave that to my housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This woman did not live with you at the time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The poor girl did live with you - A. Yes; she was obliged to go away, being pregnant.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something about Brown's tavern - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a house that was indicted - A. By the informers it was, and I took my trial by the informers.</p>
               <p>Q. You have denominated it a tavern - A. It was so called a long while before I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor girl has lived with you - A. That I have informed you.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some application has been made to her to come back, has there not - A. That I do not know, I leave that to my housekeeper, I never heard of any solicitation.</p>
               <p>Q. You reside in the house, do you - A. I do.</p>

            . Q. Are you housekeeper to Mr. Griffiths at Brown's tavern - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at any time the prisoner at the bar coming into your house - A. Yes, she came the 29th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the bar besides you and the girl - A. Not a soul. I received a ten pound note previous to her coming in, to take for three pints of wine out of it; I took from the till a five pound note, two two-pound notes, and the rest in small change to make up the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they bank notes - A. Yes; I put them on the desk over the till; I received the ten pound note of a captain of a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. No person was in the bar waiting for the change was there - A. No. After I had taken the bank notes out of the desk, the prisoner came into the bar, she came from towards the kitchen; I did not know that she was in the house. Nearly at the same time that she came into the bar, a man that I am in the habit of purchasing eggs and butter came in and asked me if I wanted any thing, he came to a table that stood under the bar window; I stepped out of the bar one step, I bought two shillingsworth of eggs, I returned into the bar and took up the money, which I had placed before on the desk; I counted over the notes, I missed two two-pound notes; one of the two pound notes had writing with red ink, and the word Soho in black ink; the other was an old dirty note and torn. I said I had missed some money; I opened the till, I could not find any such money; I turned round to the prisoner and said I had lost two two-pound notes from off the desk; she seemed rather agitated when I mentioned it, she said there has no person been in the bar but you and I, and either you or I must have the money, rather impertinently, so I convinced her that I had got no such money. I rang the bar bell, and told the waiter to call his master; Mr. Griffiths came, he sent for an officer; I gave the officer, when he came, the description of the money that I had lost; the officer said to her, if you have the money say so; she positively denied it; before the officer came I saw her shuffling her hands in her bosom. The officer has the notes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. I understood you to say you had left the notes on the desk - A. Yes; they were both taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120008"></xptr>together.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your waiter's name - 
               <persName id="t18090412-9-person100">A. William Richards</persName>
            ; he does not live there now.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the house sometimes passed in the name of the waiter who has lived in it - A. Not to my knowledge; the name of Brown is kept on the door. It always passed in the name of Brown.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 27th of March, I was sent for to go to Brown's tavern; I went there. I found the prisoner along with the housekeeper in the bar; the last witness informed me that she had lost two two-pound notes; she said there was nobody in the bar but their two selves; she said she certainly must have it; the prisoner denied having the notes; Mr. Griffiths came and insisted upon her being searched; the housekeeper said the notes are wrote in red ink, and in black ink was wrote Soho upon the same note; she said she thought she had them in her bosom, by her putting her hand up to her bosom; I told her I must search her, and desired her to unpin her clothes, which she did immediately; she unpinned her clothes by her breast, I saw the ends of the notes under her clothes; I took the notes out of her bosom; I shewed them to the housekeeper; on my examining the notes I found they were just as she described them; these are the notes I took from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Havendon. These are the two two-pound notes, one has red ink upon it, and the word Soho; I can swear to the two-pound notes, because I had no other two-pound notes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, and called no witnesses to her character.</p>

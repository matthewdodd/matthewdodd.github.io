On 2d Dec., about 1 o'clock in the night, I was on duty in Southampton Row, and saw some dirt on a rail adjoining a shutter box, which is against a wall about ten feet high—having suspicions that some person had got over there, I got assistance and got over the wall, and, after searching some time, found the prisoner concealed under some steps, at No. 55, Southampton Row, in the back premises, outside the house—Itook him to the station and charged him; he gave no name and address, but said that he was a printer—I searched the premises next morning and found marks of a crowbar on Mr. Searle's back window, which had been raised.</p>

I heard Barber call, assisted in searching, and found the prisoner under the steps of No. 55, Southampton Row—Barber took him, and I found this crowbar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by the side of where he was lying—I searched and found Mr. Searle's back closet window, of No. 2, Bloomsbury Place, open—there were marks on the sash, as if it had been forced open—I put the crowbar to them and they fitted exactly—thatis about fifteen or twenty yards from where the prisoner was found—Ifound a ladder placed down the back area of No. 2, and a window of No. 4, was forced open.</p>

I was disturbed by a noise outside—I listened, and in a few moments heard something come down heavy—I got up, and found it was a ladder which was in the area—it had been put under the garden wall on the same day—I saw the prisoner close to the pantry window, where I had been sleeping—I rose the window up two or three inches and called, "Halloo! who are you?" and he went up the ladder—he was not a</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Gray Searle, artist and surveyor, of No. 4, Bloomsbury Place. On 2d Jan., between 10 and 11 o'clock, I closed the water closet window and bolted the lobby door—next morning I found that the window had been opened, and it had never been open before, being stuck by paint—the marks in it correspond with this instrument—that would make an opening big enough for a man to get in—a towel in the water closet, which had been hanging up, I found in the wash-hand basin, and the soap dish and soap were put into it—the door leading into the lobby, which I had bolted, had been opened—there were marks of gravel on the seat, and marks of three fingers on the window inside.</p>

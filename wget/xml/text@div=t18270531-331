I put my hand to protect it, and in a short time I felt a hand at my pocket. I put my hand down and missed my handkerchief. I turned round and saw the prisoner putting his hat on his head, in which I saw a handkerchief. I said "You have my handkerchief;" he said "I have not." I said "I know you have, and I insist upon seeing it, if not, I will call the Marshalman." I put my hand to his hat, and he showed me a silk hand - kerchief, and said "Is this yours." I said No - mine is a cotton one." I called the Marshalman, and the case was heard - this is the handkerchief - it was in his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. On what business had you gone there? A. To make an affidavit; the prisoner was behind me; I felt a hand at my pocket, but I cannot tell what hand it was; there was a crowd of people, some before and some behind me; I turned round, and the prisoner was putting his hat upon his head; no person could have stooped behind me; there was not room - it was not a pressure behind me, it was a fumbling; it might have been done by a person raising his hand up from the ground, but the prisoner was upright when I saw him; he might have stopped and raised a hand from the ground, but I should think he could not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he deny having it? A. Yes; and he told the Lord Mayor that I said the silk handkerchief was mine - I said I did not; the cotton one was mine - he told the Lord Mayor he picked it up, but he could not, there was not room.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. But how do you known he could not have stooped? A. Because the people were so pressed together; he had a silk handkerchief of his own and mine in the bottom of his hat; his handkerchief covered mine; I took mine out of his hat; it has never happened to me to feel any thing under my feet, and to mistake another handkerchief for my own; he, I understand, had been a person in a respectable situation in life, but has left his family.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found this handkerchief on the floor, and took it up; the prosecutor turned round and took hold of my handkerchief, and said, "This is mine" - I said, "It is not" - he then took hold of the one I had found, and said, "This is mine" - he then gave me in charge.</p>

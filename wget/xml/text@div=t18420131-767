                  </hi>. I live with my father, Joseph Fisher, in John's-row, St. Luke's. The prisoner came to me to hire a truck—he said, "How much an hour is your truck?" that he wanted it to fetch three boxes from Fresh-wharf to the City-road—I called my wife, and agreed to let him have one—I opened the gate to draw it out, and he asked me the way to Fins<lb></lb>bury-square—he went away with it—he did not bring it back—I found it at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I hired it a little after nine o'clock, and was going home with it about half-past three, when I met a person who brought me here. <hi rend="italic">Wit<lb></lb>ness.</hi> He hired it about nine o'clock in the morning, and said he should want it about three hours.</p>

Between three and four o'clock on Tuesday, the 18th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, the prisoner brought a truck to my stable—I met him coming to the stable, and found the truck there—I was sent for to come and look at it—I had bought a truck of him before—I said, "Well, master, you have another truck for sale?"—he said, "Yes, I want 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—I said, "I suppose you are aware of the difficulty I had with the truck I bought before of you," which has been owned, that I had given it up, and forfeited all the money, I should take him to the person who had got the truck—he said he had no objection to go with me, but wished to go over to the Borough to his friends, but I took him to the station.</p>

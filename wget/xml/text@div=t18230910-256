I got into the midst of it, and was endeavouring to make my way out. My pocket-book was in my left inside coat pocket, and my purse containing two sovereigns and five shillings in my left side breeches pocket. My coat was buttoned, and my breeches pocket also. They were safe when I entered the crowd. There was a general rush among the crowd; and immediately as I got out of the crowd, I found both my pockets had been robbed. I gave information at the different offices, and found the prisoner in custody on the Saturday following, at Marlborough-street, and my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100099"></xptr>pocket-book produced, containing letters and memorandums directed to me.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. Giles's. On the night of this fire, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was on duty in George-street with Riley, and the prisoner crossed the street, coming down Stacey-street, in a direction from the fire. I stopped him, and asked what he had under his coat. He said he had nothing there. I put my hand to his side, and found this pocket-book full of papers. He said it was his own, and contained a few letters from his friends. I asked what they were about. He said he did not choose to tell. I found nothing else upon him. The direction on the letters led me to the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I let the prisoner a furnished room on the 30th of October, at 7s. 6d. per week; the articles mentioned in the indictment were let with the lodging. She paid me the rent regularly. I went into the room to borrow something of her; I missed the furniture off the bed, and the other things. The prisoner was out. I sent for an officer. When she returned I asked her what she had done with the property; she said she should return them again. I saw the officer find most of the duplicates on her, and the others were found in her room.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. To deny this charge would only be aggravating the offence; I had no criminal intention in taking the property; I had been pressed for a small debt. I pledged the property, meaning to take it out when I had more money, which I very soon expected. The money was offered to the prosecutor to take the things out of pledge, but he would not accept it. The magistrate wanted them to refrain from prosecuting me, and take the money. I earnestly implore the court to have mercy upon me; I hope I shall never transgress again.</p>

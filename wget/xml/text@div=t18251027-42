I seized Hammond by the collar, and accused him of having the handkerchief - they both spoke together, and denied it. I accused him a second time, and saw the handkerchief fall on the ground; while I stooped to pick it up, Collins ran away, but he was stopped about fifteen yards from me, without my losing sight of him. As we were going to the watch-house, Hammond said, he hoped I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270018"></xptr>not do any thing to him, for he had friends in distressed circumstances.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBARTS. Q. When did they deny it? A. When I first took them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COLLINS. Q. Did not two gentlemen come to you and say, "This is not the man I am sure?" A. Yes; they pointed out Hammond, and said it was not Collins.</p>

            . I am a messenger. I was in the City-road, and saw the two prisoners coming towards me, arm in arm. - Mr. Bath was on before me, and the prisoners turned round and went after him - they observed his coat pockets, and I thought they meant to rob him. Mr. Bath stopped at a saddler's shop, and when I got on about thirty yards he passed me again; I then crossed the road, but kept my eye on them. I saw Mr. Bath turn round and take Hammond, and call to some person to take Collins. I followed and took him - I saw the handkerchief on the ground.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HAMMOND'S Defence. I was coming down the City-road, and followed this gentleman - he put his hand to his pocket, and I suppose missed his handkerchief - he turned round and accused me of having it. I had not seen it - Collins was walking by my side pretty sharp - he was pursued and taken, we had not been together.</p>
               <p>COLLINS' Defence. I was going to my aunt's. I was walking sharply, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - two gentlemen said, they were sure I had nothing to do with it.</p>

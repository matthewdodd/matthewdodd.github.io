Did you speak to him during the meeting or after? After. Where was it you spoke to him? Outside the Victoria-gardens. What time was it? It was about a quarter past 12. Was anyone with him? No. What was he doing? Walking in the road. Tell us what passed? He said, Mr. Fayerman I want to speak to you, and he took me down. What did you say? I said ‘Oh, very well, I am quite ready to speak to you.' What did he do? He took me down the road commonly called the Alma-road, just opposite the Victoria-gardens, and he said, 'Mr. Fayerman, are you going to support me and Sir Henry Stracey?' I said I had not made up my mind; he said, 'I suppose you want a little money,' I said it would be very acceptable; he said, 'Well, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is as much as I can afford, if you will vote for me and Sir Henry Stracey.' What did you say? I said, 'I will take it, and I will vote, and I will support you.' He said, 'If you will, after the election is over I will get you a situation on this new railway, if you will suppport me and my colleague.' Did he give you anything? He gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note. Is that it (<hi rend="italic">Handing a note to the witness</hi>)? It is, and there is my signature upon it. When did you write that on it? As soon as I got home. Just read the indorsement? 'Given by Sir Edmond Lacon his</p>

You received this on the 18th of April, 1859, and promised to vote for Sir Emdond Lacon, did you? Yes. After that you said you had not made up your mind? Yes. You say that note was given to you on the 18th, and you promised to support Sir Edmond Lacon, and you told Mr. Reynolds that you had not made up your mind ten days afterwards? Yes, because I had not really made up my mind then. But you had taken this money then, and then you told Mr. Reynolds you had not made up your mind? Yes; because I did not know which way to go, as I always do when I am in doubt. Did you mention this to anybody, this gift of the note to anybody? No, not a word. You have got a wife, have you not? Yes, but she left me, and turned out a regular bad one."</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>, Did you first want this changed to Norfolk. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and then there was a fresh application to postpone it on account of the illness of a witness—I know Charles Botwright by name only—I know John Cooper—I saw him sometimes during the election—I have spoken to him when I wanted anything in his shop—I have not spoken to him in reference to the election—I don't remember canvassing him—I did not speak to him in reference to the election—I had no particular reason for abstaining—I know James Spiller; he is a friend of mine—I saw him in his own house—I canvassed him—he did not promise me his vote—I don't think he voted—I really can't tell what answer he made when I canvassed him—my impression was that he had not made up his mind—I can't say what he said—I only saw him that once during the election—he was not canvassing for me—Payne was examined before the Committee—saw Savage on the canvass; I have not had frequent communication with him—he was canvassing round—I know William Lee, he was not a canvasser of mine—he voted for me—I canvassed him—I had no communication with him during the election—I know Isaac Shelton; he was a voter; I did not</p>

               <p>canvass him—he voted without—I had no communication with him—I never spoke to Fayerman at all during any part of the time, during the election or during the canvass.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the Committee, after the evidence of Fayerman, you were yourself examined and I suppose cross-examined as to your statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes I was, and it was after that that the resolution with reference to the perjury of this man was found—my opinion was that this man was only a tool in the hands of others—that was and that is my belief—I did not intend to prosecute him unless that letter had appeared—I made my speech at the public dinner on 12th April—from that time until I had commenced proceedings against this man for perjury no step had been taken against me in an action—the two actions are brought each by an attorney—I only know from their publishing their own names that those parties were on the Committee—I was not aware of those persons having been bribed; I gave no authority for it—Mr. Reynolds is my agent—I have represented Yarmouth before in Parliament—this was the first time Sir Henry Stracey had stood—I am generally in the habit of smoking a cigar in the evening—whether I recollect the cigar on that evening, I recollect the meeting at the Victoria-garden—that was the only one—Mr. Marsh has been two or three times Mayor of Yarmouth—he was not so at the time of the election—he was chairman at my meeting—Mr. Preston is my attorney—Mr. Corry is my solicitor; I left the matter in his hands—the production of this note, which was produced at the Committee, or the apprehension of any evidence he might give on the trial have had no influence on my mind in reference to this trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fly driver at Great Yarmouth—I was fly driver at the Royal Victoria Hotel in April, 1859—I remember the election at Yarmouth quite well—I remember driving Sir Edmond Lacon and Sir Henry Stracey to the Victoria-gardens on the evening of 18th of April—I left the Victoria Hotel from ten to twenty minutes after 8 o'clock; that is a short quarter of a mile from the gardens—on reaching the Victoria-gardens' gate the two members left the fly and walked into the gardens—I left the fly soon after and went in myself; I went straight to the pavilion; I saw the two members and heard them—after they had finished the meeting it wanted ten minutes or a quarter to 11; the meeting was then over—I then went first towards the fly and they followed me—on their coming up I opened the fly and let them in—I then shut the door, mounted the box, and drove towards the Victoria Hotel—on reaching there I saw them enter the house; that was about five or ten minutes to 11—I then took my horse in the yard; that was the end of my driving that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long after 18th April were you first asked about this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 28th April this year—I was asked about the time I took them and brought them back—Captain Marsh asked me on the 28th; I am sure of that—it was 28th April to the best of my knowledge; I re<lb></lb>collect it quite well—I went to Captain Marsh's house and he asked me—Mr. Balls, the landlord of the Victoria, asked me to go to Captain Marsh's, and I went—Mr. Balls was in his own house—he told me to go to Captain Marsh; he went with me; he did not tell me what I was going for—I saw Captain Marsh in his house; in one of the rooms down stairs, and then he asked me what time I had taken Sir Edmond Lacon home on the 18th—I saw Captain Marsh at Westminster police-court—I mean to say that this happened on 28th April this year—I was first asked what time I had driven home Sir Edmond Lacon in April, 1859, and then I recollected the</p>

               <p>twenty minutes to 11, the five or ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, and all the time had been driving about Yarmouth—I don't recollect what time I drive every body—Sir Edmond Lacon is the only one I can recollect; that it was from twenty minutes to 11 to a quarter—I drove him to other meetings before 18th April—there were several meetings—I can't be certain when I drove him before—I did not drive him on the 17th that I know of—I can't say that I drove him on the 16th—I don't know that I drove him on the 13th or 16th or 19th—I came up here on Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

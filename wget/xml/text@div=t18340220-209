               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the room very much crowded? A. It was - the prisoner was close to me - I saw his arm - I did not see his hand - I saw him take his hand from the prosecutor's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his hand from his pocket? A. He took it from his side - he is one of the swell mob, and has been so for years - I have had threats held out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell my Lord in the first instance that you saw him take his hand from his side, and now you have sworn it was from the pocket? A. From towards his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the three is truth? was it from his side, from his pocket, or from towards his pocket? A. It is all the same thing, he drew his arm from his pocket - I am a paper hanger - I went to the sale on purpose to buy- the prisoner pressed against me - there was no one between me and him - there were twenty-five or thirty people in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure that the person who pressed against you was the prisoner? A. Yes; his right arm pressed against me, and he pressed against the prosecutor, and when he was taking something from him I felt his elbow rub against my side, and I saw him pass the contents of his hand to a person; he appeared to have something in his hand, but I did not see any thing in his hand - I saw the motion of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he appeared to pass the contents of his hand to his neighbour? A. I saw him draw his arm up from the prosecutor's right side, and pass it over to another person, but there was something in his hand, or the other would not have left immediately.</p>

            . I am a builder, and live at No. 1, Meredith-street, Clerkenwell - I have known the prisoner five years - he lodged with me a year and a half ago - he certainly is not one of the swell mob to my knowledge - on the day of the sale I met him in Piccadilly, and went with him to the sale room - I went to buy some articles, but I found the lots I wanted had been sold - I think the prisoner and I stayed in the room about twenty minutes - I came out with him - he certainly did not hand me a purse or anything else - he has been a respectable man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you swear he did not hand any one else anything? A. That I cannot tell, the room was very crowded.(

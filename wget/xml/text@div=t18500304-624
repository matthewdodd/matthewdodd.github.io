                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at 30, King-street, Drury-lane; in the same house with the prisoner and the de<lb></lb>ceased, Mary Ann M'Donald. On Monday, 4th Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my room, which is only separated from the prisoner's by a thin wooden partition, I heard a wrangling between him and the deceased—they had been in and out all day, drinking and quarrelling, in consequence of the deceased having absented herself from her home—they returned about seven; and from the noise they made stumbling up the stairs, I presumed them to have been intoxicated, and I gave them a light, to enable them to unfasten their door—I heard them in conversation after they went in, but not apparently in anger—I did not pay much attention until I heard the deceased exclaim, "Now <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, it is my turn"—that was about ten minutes after they had been in their apartment—there was then a struggle, but no talking, then a momentary silence; and then I heard the deceased say, "I think, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, you have done enough; I bleed very much; give me my shawl, and let me go to the hospital"—I then heard footsteps leaving the room—I did not see the deceased again until the Friday following, the 8th; she was then very ill in bed—the prisoner was present—he appeared kind and atten<lb></lb>tive to her, and her manner was quite composed—she made no complaint whatever—she said very little—she was too ill to speak—she had been to the hospital and returned—I advised the prisoner to have medical aid at once; he had no means of getting it himself, but as soon as he could get medical aid from the parish he did, which was the following morning, and she was promptly attended to by Mr. Bennett, at the parish infirmary.</p>

I met the prisoner and the deceased, about seven o'clock—I knew them before by sight—she was then intoxicated, and very excited—I afterwards saw her again by herself—she was then bleeding very freely from a wound in the head (I did not observe that the first time I saw her)—she spoke to me as she passed—I believe she went to the hospital—I left her, and went down the street to see if I could find the prisoner, but I did not—I saw him between nine and ten next morning—I said, "I have heard that you have killed your wife?"—he said, "No, she is not hurt very badly; I will tell you how it</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at King's College Hospital, in Por<lb></lb>tugal-street. I remember the deceased coming there—she gave her name as Mary Ann M'Donald—she had a wound over the left temple, from which she was bleeding very freely, and had lost a quantity of blood—it was about three-quarters of an inch long, and to the bone—it was a few inches above the left ear—it might have been inflicted by such an instrument as this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should say it was not such a wound as would be made by a fall against a chair—if she had the poker in her hand, and fell upon it, she might possibly have given it herself—she fainted once or, twice while I was dressing the wound—she was very anxious to go home that night, but she remained in the hospital till the next day—I considered she was not in a fit state to go home—I should say she was sober when she came to the hospital—she had been bleeding considerably—the whole of her things were saturated with blood—I did not see anything of the prisoner at the hospital—the deceased was brought there by two lads, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and her sister-in-law came for her next day—the wound was not in itself dangerous unless erysipelas supervened—erysipelas generally follows from scalp wounds—it depends very much on the state of the body and the extent of the wound, but all wounds on the head have a tendency to produce erysipelas—I did not see anything of her after she left the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of the parish of St. Giles. On Saturday, 9th Feb., I saw the deceased in the Infirmary of the workhouse, where she was removed after having been visited by the assistant-surgeon, who found her labouring under erysipelas of the head, and without any means of being properly attended to—I found her suffering from erysipelas of the head and face—on removing some plaister, which covered a spot about three inches above the left temple, I found an irregular-shaped wound, about three inches in circumference—the wound had sloughed, and the character of it had no doubt very much altered since its infliction—I should not think that at first it was a wound of any importance in itself, but erysipelas so frequently super<lb></lb>venes from injuries of that description that medical men attach more importance to scalp wounds than any other class of wounds, and an importance quite disproportionate to the extent of the wound at first—she remained in the Infirmary until 22nd Feb., when she died—the proximate cause of death was erysipelas, producing congestion of the brain, and effusion on the brain of about four ounces of serous fluid—that would be induced by some previous injury—the wound on the head was very likely to produce erysi<lb></lb>pelas, but I cannot distinctly state that it did produce it—I believe erysipelas occurs from atmospheric causes, and that it will not follow from any wound unless those atmospheric causes are prevailing, and the constitution of the patient is in a condition to absorb that poison, whatever it may be—in my experience I never found one solitary case of erysipelas; whenever it does occur it occurs in several cases, and I believe atmospheric causes influence it—the state of the blood and the body cause it, undoubtedly—a patient in a bad state of blood would be more disposed to absorb the poison—I believe that erysipelas is consequent upon atmospheric causes—I do not know what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040090"></xptr>
               <p>those causes are—I do not mean exposure to the atmosphere, but the pecu<lb></lb>liar state of the atmosphere—it has been recently very prevalent in nearly all our hospitals, independent of external injury—I do not think it altogether depends on the state of the blood—a wound on the head, more than any other, would predispose a person to erysipelas.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Smart's-buildings, and am beadle of the parish of St. Giles. I recollect the deceased, Mary Ann M'Donald, being in the Infirmary of the workhouse—she died on Friday, 22nd Feb.—in con<lb></lb>sequence of her death I made inquiry at her late residence, on the Saturday afternoon—I saw Mrs. Dounes, and was asking her a few questions, when the prisoner and a woman came into Dounes' room—his room was locked—I asked the woman if she knew how it happened, and the prisoner made answer, and said, "It was done by the poker"—he then went into his own room; I followed him—he took this poker out of the fire-place, and held it up to show me the way in which the woman held it in her hand, saving that he was going to take it from her, and in doing so, he accidentally hit her on the head—I took possession of the poker, and have produced it to-day—an Inquest was held on the body—the prisoner expressed a wish to know when the Inquest was, that he might attend it—he was taken into custody that same evening, so that he could not attend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read, as follows</hi>: "We were both sitting by the fire-place together, and she was <hi rend="italic">jangling</hi> with me about my having another woman on the previous Sunday-evening, and if I dared to go to bed in that room she would be my butcher before morning; I said I certainly should; she said she would see whether I should or no; she took that poker from out of the fire-place, and got off the seat, and walked across the room, and she had it upraised as I was sitting down, and said, "It is my turn now;" and I got up and got hold of it underneath her hand, as she so held it, and gave it a snatch, and we fell on the floor, and she still had the poker in her hand; and whether the poker hit her head, or whether she struck her head against the chair, I cannot say; I laid down on the floor, she sat up, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Bob</hi>, I think you have done it now? Look here, my head bleeds!" she then said, "Where is my shawl? Let me go somewhere and get it dressed; I gave her her shawl, and she went down-stairs; I laid down on the bed and went to sleep, not thinking she was hurt; I awoke about three o'clock, and not finding her in bed, I got up and struck a light; I saw some drops of blood about; I went down-stairs about seven o'clock, and then heard she was at the hospital, and that she was to be removed from the hospital, as it was full; she was brought home, and remained till the Saturday, when she was taken to the workhouse, where she remained till she died.</p>

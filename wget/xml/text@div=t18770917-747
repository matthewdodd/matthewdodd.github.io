On the night of 15th August, I was on my beat at the Horns Stairs, and saw the prisoner, at several intervals from 11 till 4 o'clock in the morning—at 4 o'clock I did not find him at the stairs—I went to examine the Horns tavern and found the window about 3 or 4 inches up with the light of my bull's eye I saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing on the parlour floor against a table with his arms folded towards the wall—I recognised him as the man I had seen on the stairs—a lamplighter came past and 1 borrowed his stick and told him to stand at the window while I rapped at the door—when Mr. Williams came down I went into the house—I saw the prisoner come round to the back door while I was at the front door—he went over the fence down on to the water, I took a boat directly and went over the water to Limebouse, but could not see anything of the prisoner there, the other boat was about halfway across before I started—I did not see what became of the prisoner; I rowed back again—before I started in pursuit I saw the waterman Butcher there, I had not seen be risoner before 11 o'clock that night, I did not know him or his name.</p>

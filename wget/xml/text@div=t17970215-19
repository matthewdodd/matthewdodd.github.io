               <p>Q. Had you left it fastened? - A. I cannot say whether it was locked; I missed a pair of sheets I had just taken off the bed before I went out, a calico printed morning-gown, and a calimanco petticoat; the next day I searched the pawnbrokers, I suppose about a dozen, and I found all my property at a Mr. Friere's, a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. No; I had never seen him, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>NESON BEAR sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. I am a Jew, I buy clothes; I went in the street about my business, and the prisoner met me; he offered to sell me a duplicate he had of some clothes in pawn on Thursday last; he did not tell me where he had pawned them, I never saw him before; I asked him how much he wanted for it, he said, three shillings; I gave him an answer I would give him three shillings, but he should go along with me, and let me see them, because I cannot read this language, I am a stranger to this country; he went with me (I cannot tell the street), to Mr. Friere's, a pawnbroker; I went in and gave the duplicate to the man to let me see the clothes, but he did not, he said he should let me see them by and by; at the same time he sent for an officer, and gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give the prisoner in charge as well as you? - A. He charged the officer with both of us.</p>

             CAFFLE sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Friere, pawnbroker, in Little Pulteney-street, Golden-square: On the 6th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and offered a pair of linen sheets, a calico bed-gown, a calimanco petticoat, and two gowns, which are not mentioned in this indictment, to pledge, and asked one guinea and an half for them; I lent him a guinea upon them.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he ever been at your house before? - A. Not that I know of, I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions about the goods? - A. He told me they were his property, that he had his goods seized, and wanted to make up this money to save his goods that were seized; the next day Mrs. Carrison came with some patterns of things which he had pledged the over-night; she saw them, and said they were her property; on Thursday night following the last witness brought the duplicate of the things, and asked to see them; the prisoner waited at the outside of the door; I, in the mean while, sent to Marlborough-street, and got an officer and took them both up.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Marlborough street, On Thursday, the 9th of this month, I was sent for to Mr. Friere's; I took Bear into custody; he said, it was not him, that it was a man that waited at the outside of the door that gave him the duplicate; I went out and fetched the prisoner into the shop; I searched him, and found these pick lock-keys, (produces them); he told me, while I was searching him, that he was a smith by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find all those keys? - A. Yes; they are what are called skeletons.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Monday week last, in the evening, going towards Little Pulteney-street, (I keep a house in Spur-street, Leicester-square) I met a man who had formerly worked with me, about fourteen years ago; he asked me to go and pledge some things for him, he had sent his wise to Birmingham, and he was going for her; I told him if they were his property I would pledge them; I went to Mr. Friere's, and pledged them for a guinea in his name,

            ; I brought him out the guinea, and gave him the duplicate; he asked me if I would have any thing to drink, I said I don't care; as he was going away he gave it me again; he said, you may make the best use of them you can, if I don't take them out in two days; coming along Marlborough-street, I met this Jew; I said to myself, If this Jew will have them he shall; the pawnbroker has said, that I never pledged any thing there; I can produce in Court duplicates that me and my wife have had, of things we have pledged.</p>

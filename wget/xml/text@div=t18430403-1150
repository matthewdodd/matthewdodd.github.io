                  </hi>. I am apprentice to John Ayres, a linen-draper, in Whitechapel-road. On the 16th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, as I was taking down the shutters, and carrying them through to the back part of the shop, I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I immediately went to the door, and, about fifty yards off, saw a man chasing a lad—at that moment four pieces of print were thrown into my arms, by a young man re<lb></lb>siding next door—I took, them back to the shop, and found they were part of a pile which stood about three yards inside the door—I had seen them there about two minutes before—these now produced are them, and are the property of Mr. Ayres.</p>

On the 16th of March, at half-past seven o'clock, I was in Whitechapel-road, and when within two doors of Mr. Ayres's, I saw the lad taking down the shutters, and the prisoner just before me—the moment the boy's back was turned, the prisoner <hi rend="italic">whipped</hi> in—he was not in a moment—he brought out these prints—I was going to lay hold of him, and he dropped them at my feet, and ran—I pursued, calling "Stop thief"—a gen<lb></lb>tleman caught him, and gave him up to me—I took him back to the shop, and he asked Mr. Ayres to forgive him.</p>

I was present when they took two barrels of ale from the storehouse; they told me a publican would take a barrel or two, when they came home at night; Blake told me he had delivered two barrels to Salmon, and was to call another time for the money. Salmon, kept the White Horse, in Brick-lane. Blake told me two or three times that Salmon had not paid him for it - I never was paid for it. After I was taken up I mentioned this to Messrs. Wyatt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. The ale was in the course of regular delivery at this time. I was taken up for robbing my masters.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did they know what was the regular load - A. They did.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SALMON. I am a publican, and keep the White Horse, in Brick-lane. I knew the prisoner, Blake, he delivered two barrels of ale to me in the middle of May - I had not ordered them - I thought Mr. Wyatt had sent them. He said his master ordered him to bring them. I might have seen Collins before. Mr. Wyatt has sent amber to me several times without my ordering it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you have not often seen the other prisoner at the bar - A. I do not know him. (Go close to him.) - I am certain that I know nothing of him - I have no recollection of him - I have no knowledge of his having been at my house. I knew there was some other person with Blake. Blake applied to me for payment within three weeks or a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. About how long ago did he apply to you for payment - A. I cannot exactly say. He said, he came for the money for the beer, as the storehouse clerk wanted his share. I did not see him again till three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me all that passed at that time - A. He did not tell me any sum. He said, "Let me have some money." I said, "What money? - I never pay you, I only pay the collecting clerk." He never said what sum he wanted - He met me in the street at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in your hearing, mention to your wife, or any other person, what sum of money he wanted - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In about six weeks after he applied to you again - A. I met him in the street, he asked me for some drink, and said, "I hope you will pay me the money. I said,"I will pay you no money."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he never mentioned any sum of money to you - A. No; I usually paid Mr. Blew every month.</p>
               <p>Q. Six weeks had elapsed between the delivery and his applying to you for payment. Had the collecting clerk applied to you during that time for money - A. He had. My wife always paid. I never got a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your wife been subpoened here - A. She is very ill - She is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not say she was ill - A. My boy is ill; she is not ill. My boy is not expected to live. She did not go before the Grand Jury. The beer was afterwards taken away by Mr. Blew. Blake said, the storehouse clerk wanted him to get the money, as he was to have part of it. I told no person of it-that was three weeks after it was put down in the cellar. When beer comes in, either me or my wife signs the book; I never signed for it.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Walter, of No. 42, south<lb></lb>ampton-buildings, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn; I reside in the house, which is mine, but Mr. Walter has an office there. The prisoner was in my service as a sort of clerk and servant to me—I paid him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he writes very indifferently—I know his writing—I have seen him write for the last nine years—on the 22nd of Dec. I had occasion to go to a table<lb></lb>drawer in my room on the first floor front, and missed 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I kept there—it was a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns—36, 050 was the number of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this produced is it—(looking at it)—here is written on the back "James Webb, 17, Geo.—, —berwell"—part of the writing is struck out—I have no doubt it is the prisoner's writing.</p>

I believe there was a summons in the cause of "Brown v. Applegate"—I was unwell, and did not get up till one o'clock that day—I dare say I instructed the prisoner the night before to attend to the summons for me—I am informed he did so—I am not quite certain whether I gave him the order—I have received 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. re<lb></lb>respecting the cause—I saw him about half-past twelve or just before one o'clock on the 22nd of Dec.—I was getting up at the time—Mr. Walter had business at the Court of Bankruptcy that day—I did not see the prisoner and Mr. Walter into a cab to go to the Bankruptcy court, but I complained of the Prisoner being late, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take a cab to go to the Bankruptcy Court—he ran up stairs, as I understand, to my room, got the papers, and went down to go off—I did not see him get into the cab—the bankruptcy case was Brown and another—he returned from the Bankruptcy court and came up stairs by himself—I saw Mr. Walter in the course of the afternoon—I am satisfied that the prisoner went to the Bankruptcy Court and attended on Mr. Walter—I think he returned to my chambers about half-past one—when he came back I immediately said to him, "I have been robbed, you have been my confidential servant nine years, I depend upon you"—the charge was,</p>

"—I expected he would have called on me in the morning before he attended the summons—I suppose the summons was returnable at ten or eleven o'clock—he went out with Mr. Walter to the Bankruptcy Court, and I believe he came back with him—the money might Have gone on the Friday, Saturday, or Monday previous—I was going to Add 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.., to it, and missed the rest.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been clerk to Mr. parrell? <hi rend="italic">A</hi> About three years—I am not copying clerk—I manage the business—I am common law clerk—before that I was clerk to Mr. Wells, for about the same time—I left him because he retired from business—Mr. Parrell occasionally attends to business himself—he is laid up now, and can<lb></lb>not—he is paralysed, and has been so about six weeks—before that he attended to business sometimes, and sometimes I did—I think there were twenty-five summonses that day at the judges' chambers—we were the last—I got there at a quarter past eleven—the other side took out the summons—it was a peremptory summons, and I was rather in jeopardy, being behind time—I was doing nothing in the interval between a quarter past eleven and twenty minutes past twelve—I was not talking to the prisoner all the time—I had no other summonses to attend that day—sometimes the Judge gets through the summonses very quickly—I did not know the prisoner before, except on the previous summons—I cannot say what time I got to Red Lion-square—I do not know what other business I had—I think I got back within an hour of leaving the chambers—I left the chambers about twenty minutes after twelve, and got home about twenty minutes after one—I think I can be sure of that—there were eighteen or twenty people waiting at the Judges' chambers on the twenty-five summonses—they do not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> always wait, they make appointments to come back again—I do not think the Judge left directly after disposing of our summons—I did not go before the Magistrate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184701040065"></xptr>
               <p>on this matter—I saw in the newspaper that the prisoner was before the Magistrate—he did not call me as a witness there—I have never been a wit<lb></lb>ness ness before, nor in the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have no doubt the prisoner was there all the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—if he had left I should have left too—I was watching him—he brought me there by the proceedings, and he got the costs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POCOCK.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a remand at the Police-court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a second remand was required; that was not asked for on the part of the prisoner, but by myself <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did u ask the prisoner for his address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the station-house—he refused to give it—I could not find out from Mr. Walter or Mr. Wood's—I have been there since.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">H.T. JAMES</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the back of one the summonses is written "Mr. Parrell, 25," is it that your writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was on the summons when it was served—25 is the number of parrell's house, it has nothing to do with the number on the list.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> Samuel was examined at the first examination, and more fully on the second—there was no examination on the day he iden<lb></lb>tified the prisoner—it was not communicated to him on that day that Samuel had identified him, but Samuel was examined in his presence on 1st Jan., and again on 5th.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner say to you, "Do not you remem<lb></lb>ber I was at the Judges' chambers that morning?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did say no—I said I was not aware of it, as I was in bed.</p>

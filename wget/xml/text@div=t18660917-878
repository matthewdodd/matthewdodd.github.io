                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at 224, Westminster Road—on the 5th of September, about a quarter-past one o'clock in the day, the prisoners came to my shop together—Welch asked for a pair of common boots—while I was finding them I saw Welch shuffling and arranging her dress—I went on fitting her, and at last I found a pair; she said she would wear them—I put the right boot on her foot, and while putting the left on I saw one of these pair of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) projecting from under her shawl—I threw her shawl back, and said, "What the deuce are you doing of? You are robbing me," and further up her arm she had another pair—Smith sat directly opposite, within a yard and a half of her—Welch was very much confused—I sent for a constable and gave her in charge—the value of the boots was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Smith said she was a respectable woman—the boots were hanging on a rail just behind Welch—Smith could not have reached them.</p>

Q.</hi> Were the boots thrown over her arm when you found them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not notice that Welch's boots were in a bad state—one of my little boys was sitting by Smith—I gave them both into custody—I distinctly told the constable to take both.</p>

               <p>are you doing with these?"—she said, "I merely picked them up off the ground, to give them to the proprietor"—I turned round and said, "Did Smith come in with her?"—the prosecutor said, "Yes, you had better take them both away"—I asked Smith if she knew anything about the other—she said she knew her to be a respectable woman—I said, "You had better come down to the station with me," and she came down.</p>

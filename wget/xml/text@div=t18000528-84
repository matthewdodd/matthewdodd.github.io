             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street: On Tuesday, the 27th of May, I apprehended the prisoner; I overtook her in the way to London; she had a bundle; I took her to Mrs. Creed's house, and searched her; upon her neck I found this muslin handkerchief, marked I; she resisted a good deal; she would not let me search her pockets; I found this linen-handkerchief in her pocket; she had this petticoat upon her; this muslin gown was tied up in a bundle; this muslin handkerchief was tied round the bundle, marked M B; there were other things in the bundle belonging to herself; I found a duplicate of a gown pawned in the Borough; I asked her what that duplicate was, she said it was a duplicate of a gown she had stole from Mrs. Creed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he or you made her any promise? - A. No; I told him not, and I was present the whole time; she said she hoped he would not hurt her, it was the first time, and she would tell me where all the property was.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pressman. The same afternoon that she was apprehended I went with her to her lodgings, and the first thing that I claimed was this handkerchief, marked M B; she denied it, and said her sister had given her it; this muslin gown, when it was lost, was in a petticoat; but I cannot say positively as to any of the things, that they were in our house, only the ladies said they were; I have had things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280085"></xptr>with these marks a great many times, for these ten years; the prisoner owned to this handkerchief, marked M B; and to the muslin spotted gown, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master and mistress both promised that I should not be prosecuted if I would own to the things.</p>
               <p>Creed. I did not promise any such thing.</p>

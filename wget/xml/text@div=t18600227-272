                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Bedford-square, Commercial-road—On the 6th of February, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I was coming down Fenchurch-street; there was a crowd collected—I was passing through it, and I stood still for a minute—the prisoner came and stood by the side of me, and when I went to turn away he had got my watch-guard in his hand—it was twisted round his fingers—it was a guard that went round my neck—it was still round my neck—it was a gimp guard—the prisoner was wearing an Inverness cape; as soon as I looked at him, he turned away from me and dropped the guard out of his hand, and it went down in front of my trousers; I immediately caught hold of it, and found my watch was gone—the guard had been through the bow of the watch—as soon as I found the watch was gone the prisoner turned away and went about two yards from me; I went and caught hold of him, and told him he had taken my watch—I am sure he is the man; I did not lose sight of him—he said "Me take your watch"—I said "Yes, you have taken my watch"—he said he did not—I said, "You did"—I kept him and called to one policeman, and he did not hear me—the prisoner said, "Come back to the crowd, and perhaps we may find the watch on the ground, and some of the thieves there"—I told him to stop where he was, there would be another policeman up directly, I would not let him go—I held him till the officer came and asked what was the matter—I told him the prisoner had stolen my watch—the prisoner made no reply—I had seen my watch about 10 minutes before—I had looked up at the clock at the establishment where I worked and looked at my watch, and I walked straight to the crowd—it could not have taken me more than 10 minutes.</p>

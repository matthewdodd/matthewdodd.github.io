                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William Grimstone, of Broad-street, Bloomsbury, tobacconist and snuff manufacturer—the prisoner was his clerk and traveller—he had a weekly salary, and a per<lb></lb>centage on what he sold—there are some tills in the shop, and money had been missed from them—on the 20th of October some money was marked, a crown-piece and eight shillings put into one till, and four half-crowns and five shillings into the other—the prisoner came in between five and six o'clock—he then had the opportunity of taking money out of the tills—he occasionally served in the shop while I have been getting my tea in the evening, but at no other time—he was in the shop while I had my tea that evening, but no one came that wanted any change—the policeman was sent for that evening</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250117"></xptr>
               <p>—the prisoner was examined in presence of Mr. Grimstone, and then taken to the station—I was shown this shilling the next morning—I swear to it as one that Mr. Grimstone had marked in my presence, and I missed it out of the till.</p>

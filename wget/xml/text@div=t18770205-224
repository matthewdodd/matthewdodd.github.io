                  </hi>. I am surveyor of Inland Revenue—on the night of 11th January or the morning of the 12th, about 12.30, I was at the bottom of Great Windmill Street; the prisoner passed me and made a remark about the time—I pulled out my watch, and told him the time, and as I was putting it back he kicked me just above the left ancle, snatched my watch, and ran away—the kick knocked me down, and I fell and injured my head and my elbow-as soon as I could get up, I ran, and some other people were running after him—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—I was lame for three or four days-this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was standing at the bottom of the street two or three minutes, hesitating which way I should go home—I had been with a friend who I had not seen for ten years—I was not particularly the worse for liquor, it is a difficult thing to say when a man is in liquor—I believe I went into a cigar shop; I don't remember that I spoke to the prisoner in that shop—I don't think I asked him if he knew a man named Robinson, a betting man, nor do I know Robinson-my home is in Yorkshire—I don't remember telling the prisoner that I lived in Yorkshire—I made one or two casual remarks to one or two people there—I did not take my watch out and swing it about by the chain and say "You <hi rend="italic">cockneys</hi> don't have such presents as this, this is what we get from our Yorkshire friends"—I ran after him, but was too lame to get up to him—the injury was not a sprain, I had the mark of a kick for a week after; I did not sprain my ancle, it was a bruise—I mentioned being lame when I charged him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not remember ever having seen the prisoner, before he came up to me in the street—I did not twist my watch round and I did not throw it down an area in Rupert Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High Street, Canterbury—on the morning of 22nd January I was in Windmill Street, and saw the prosecutor talking to a friend—I saw him again an hour afterwards, at 12.30, getting up from the ground—he called "Stop thief!" and I saw the prisoner running away about 20 yards from me—I ran after him—he ran up Windmill Street and took a turning on the right—I. followed him, and saw him throw something into an area, apparently, he then turned another corner to the left, I still following—he then turned back and appeared to be walking calmly towards me—a constable came up and I gave him custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the station—the prosecutor charged the pri<lb></lb>soner with stealing his watch, and I believe he added "Robbery "with violence," but I won't be certain—I walked with the prosecutor to the station; I should say that he was sober, but he was very excited and very lame.</p>

I was on duty in Great Windmill Street, heard cries of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running—I followed him and caught him in Rupert Street, and Deering gave him in custody-while he was running I heard something go against an area window—I afterwards went to the area, turned my light on, and saw this watch there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor was very lame—he charged the prisoner at the station with stealing his watch and kicking him—I did not examine his leg, but there was a mark on his wrist-lam sure he mentioned the kick at the station and said that he thought his ancle was sprained by the kick he had had.</p>

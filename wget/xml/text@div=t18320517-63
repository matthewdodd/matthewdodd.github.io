The prisoner came into our service on the 25th of February, and left on the 17th of April; she left her box, which was searched by Bradshaw in my presence on Good Friday, and five cambric handkerchiefs were found in it, which are mine - I think the box was locked; it was brought into the parlour by the other <rs id="t18320517-63-deflabel366" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18320517-63-defend697 t18320517-63-deflabel366"></join> - I had frequently inquired of the prisoner for handkerchiefs which I had lost, and she always said she did not know where they were; one or two of them were washed and clean.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know of her box having been searched before that? A. Yes, and none of my articles were found then; she was not going away - she had given me warning before, but afterwards expressed a wish to stay; we had a dispute about her not rising early enough in the morning; she said if I was not satisfied with her I had better get another person - she had left the key of her box with the other servant; I do not know her motive for leaving it; I made no use of the key - I did not have it in my possession at all; the box had been searched, and some other things found before that - the officer then took the key from the prisoner and searched the box, but not very minutely - on the second search a handkerchief was found in a pair of stockings, and the other handkerchiefs rolled up in different things; the prisoner had only a week's wages due to her when she absconded - I had no opportunity of paying her; the other servant is my cook - she is not here: the officer searched her box the first time as long as I directed him; my husband is not here - I suppose he is at his office; he is an artist and a publisher of architectural designs; he knows of this prosecution - I do not know whether he knows I am here as a witness; I saw him this morning, but did not breakfast with him; I do not know what might have occurred between the prisoner and the cook.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the box was searched twice? A. Yes; on the 17th I discovered I had been robbed, and on the 18th her box was searched; I found some things in it, but not these articles - she then sent for her box, and it was about to be delivered up by the cook, but a lady, who was with me, suggested that it should be searched again, and in the interim the prisoner had gone and the key was left with the cook; on the second search these handkerchiefs were found - I had had no quarrel with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BRADSHAW. I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner at Battle-bridge - she came to the door, and I said, "Do you know what I take you for?" she said, "I know nothing about the silk, the other things I found among the rubbish;" I went to Mrs. King's, and the handkerchiefs were found rolled up in articles of dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was the prisoner present? A. No, she was at the station - the cook was present; I did not go to search for property in the box, but, as the prisoner, was in custody to see what belonged to her, and take charge of it - I was not there at the first search.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never put them into my box.</p>

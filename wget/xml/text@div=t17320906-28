One of them held a Pistol to my Head, and said, If you speak a word, you're a dead Man. Deliver your Money, Doctor! I answer'd and said, Gentlemen, I am in your Power, do with me as you please. Then 3 of them rifled me of a Guinea, and 3 Half-Guineas. I had my Snuff-box in my Hand, and thinking to save it, I flung it into the Ditch. They observed it, and asked me what it was that I had flung into the Ditch? I told them, Nothing; but they would not take my Word, for one of them stopping down, found the Snuff-box. They felt about my Waistcoat Pocket, and asked me what I had got there? And I said, Only some Drugs for poor People; and so they went away. It was so dark I can't be sure that the Prisoners are any of those that robbed me,</p>
               <p>W. Booth. I and the 4 Prisoners were at Buck's Gin-shop in St. Giles's all Day, and at Night we concluded to go a robbing. We went up Tottenham-Court Road, and near the Halfway-house, betwixt Hampstead, and Kentish-Town, we met this Parson (the Prosecutor.) Patrick had one Pistol, and I another. Patrick went up to the Parson, and bid him stand; and then searching one of his Pockets, took out 3 s. and some Halfpence, and two Farthings ; and Meeds searching the other, found 3 Half Guineas. I saw the Parson throw something down, and asking him what it was that he threw away, he said, he threw away nothing. Yes, but you have, says I; and stooping down, I found it was a Silver Snuff box. I took it up and gave it to Vaughan, and he afterwards gave it to his Creature, who is now in Newgate, and she sold it for 6 s. and brought us the Money. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060017"></xptr> an old-fashion'd Box, all wroughted at Top. While the others were examining the Parson's Pockets, Vaughan and White stood threatning to shoot him thro' the Head if he did not stand still; but I'll say that for the Gentleman, he was very easy. Smith. Not so easy as you think for.</p>
               <p>White. Was I there?</p>
               <p>Booth. Yes.</p>
               <p>Patrick. Who held the Pistol to the Parson?</p>
               <p>Booth. You did.</p>
               <p>Patrick. Of what Size were they that robb'd you?</p>
               <p>Smith. They were all Boys of a small Size.</p>
               <p>White. I had known Booth but a Fortnight, by playing at Skettles with him, and happening to meet with him and some others, as he was going Home, I bore him Company, and by the Way we met this Gentleman the Parson; but as soon as I perceiv'd they intended to rob him, I ran away. I have several People to my Reputation.</p>

The prisoner served part of his time to me, but left about twelve months ago - I lost this paper out of the side warehouse, which he had access to just as he pleased, as his father and him had both been in my employ, and the front door is constantly open; he was not in my employ - on the 25th of November, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I missed three bundles of paper, consisting of 2,200 sheets, and forming a novel called"Much to Blame;" I afterwards found part of it at Mills', Gray's Inn-lane, who gave me information; I left it in the hands of a serjeant of the Police.</p>
               <p>MORRIS NICHOLAS. I am a serjeant of the Police. I found part of the property at Mills', and apprehended the prisoner; when I went into his room his wife began to cry - before I said a word to him he began to cry, and was hardly able to answer my questions for some time; I told him I took him for stealing a quantity of paper from White- he made no answer; I called Scarborough up - he identified him as having sold the paper; I found more paper at Carter's.</p>

On the 11th of February, about ten o'clock, Blackford came and bought a rasher of bacon, which came to 4d. - I was close by the parlour door; he put a shilling on the counter - the prisoner gave him two penny-pieces, and at the same time put his hand in the till, took out some silver, and put into Blackford's hand - Blackford went off with it, without stopping to see if it was right; my son stopped him, and we found two shillings, two sixpences, and two pence in his hand; I took it from him, and both were taken into custody - I am sure I saw the prisoner deliver that money into his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. Where were you standing? A. Inside the parlour door; there is a glass partition - there are six or seven gas-lights in the shop; Blackford had lived with a cheesemonger in the neighbourhood - he only put a shilling on the counter, and the prisoner rang it; I was watching, having had information that Blackford had received money twice before - he and the prisoner both live near Spitalfields.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I saw Blackford come in the afternoon, and buy a piece of cheese, which came to 1s. 6d. - he put down half a crown; I thought the change given was wrong, as I heard silver sound in his hand - he came again about ten o'clock, and bought some bacon; I watched, and he had the right change that time - he came again in a quarter of an hour; I was then in the parlour, and told my father my suspicion - he had a rasher of bacon; I saw him put down a shilling - the prisoner put down some copper: his hand was then in the till for some time - I saw him take something out, and put into Blackford's hand; I went out, caught hold of Blackford's hand, and my father opened it; there were two shillings, two sixpences, and two pence - he said he had given the prisoner half a crown; but at the watch-house he said he had two shillings in his hand when he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him come in the third time? A. No; I am sure it was a shilling he gave the prisoner, and he could not have other money in his hand, for I saw it open - I am certain the money came out of my father's till.</p>

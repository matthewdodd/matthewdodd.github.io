On the 16th of November about eight o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the accompting house, there is a window between the accompting house and the shop; on my looking through the window I saw the prisoner, he was laying flat on the counter in the shop with his face close to the till; I had but a transient sight of him, but he appeared to be busily employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the position of his hands - A. No; I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the shop open or shut - A. I am not sure whether it was fastened or put to; I went into the shop and saw it was not fastened, only put to; I fastened the shop door inside, to prevent the prisoner going out, I called my niece and sent up for my brother, before my brother came down the prisoner went up to the corner of the shop where the witness will prove that three one pound notes were afterwards found; I went up to the till and looked in, there were in it ten or eleven shillings, and some halfpence; in the afternoon I put two one pound bank notes in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you saw the prisoner there - A. It might be two or three hours before; and some small gold, some seven shilling pieces, I cannot say how many; I believe more than one seven shilling piece, and I put one half guinea in, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken this money in the course of business - A. Yes; in the afternoon; I had taken the money of different customers; no other person had served behind the counter during the afternoon; when I first ran in the shop and got between him and the shop door; I asked the prisoner what business he had there; he replied by asking what he had done, he said he had nothing about him, and then I instantly fastened the shop door. When my brother came down he laid hold of the prisoner and sent me to fetch Mr. Midlam, our next door neighbour; Mr. Midlam went in, he, my brother, and myself took the prisoner into a back parlour; when there my brother took a few shillings out of the prisoner's waistcoat pocket; Mr. Midlam told the prisoner to pull off his shoes, which he refused to do, I stooped down and endeavoured to pull one of his shoes off, I could not; Mr. Midlam laid hold of his leg and forced one of his shoes off, and in that shoe there were two seven shilling pieces. My brother then told me to fetch a constable; the prisoner then said, for God's sake do not; my brother insisted upon knowing where the prisoner had put the rest of the money, and the prisoner repeatedly begged of him to forgive him. I went for the constable, and when the constable came he searched the prisoner in the parlour, he found nothing more on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any notes found - A. No; when the notes were found the prisoner said he did not know any thing of the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady swore, at Marlborough-street that she knew nothing about the seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Witness. I told the justice that I could not be so certain that they were in the till at the time. Upon the prisoner was found two seven shilling pieces, he said they were his own; that made some impression on my mind, and it induced me to doubt whether I had not given them away in change for the identical notes which I had put into the till, but not the half guinea; I put a half guinea in the till, there was no half guinea found on the prisoner.</p>

            : Q. You are brother to the last witness - A. Yes. About three o'clock I had occasion to look in the counter till, I saw there a one pound note. In the course of the afternoon I went up stairs and left my sister to serve in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q Did you observe what gold there was - A. No; I only recollect the pound note being indisposed; I went up stairs, I remained there till about eight o'clock in the evening, when I was called down; and when I came in the shop I saw the prisoner standing in the shop near the door; my sister informed me that she had detained the prisoner for stealing the money out of the till; I sent for Mr. Midlam when he came we took the prisoner into the back parlour, he was searched, Mr. Midlam took off one of his shoes, and there two seven shilling pieces in it; I then asked the prisoner what he had done with the rest of the money, at first he denied any knowledge of of it, but upon repeating the question, and ordering the constable to be sent for, he said, will you let me go if I tell you; to that I made no reply, but again insisted upon knowing where the rest of the money was; he then said, if you will let me go I will shew you where it is; I then said, I suppose you have given it to some of your accomplices at the door, or words to that effect, the prisoner answered, no, it is in the shop. I then went with Mr. Midlam into the shop, taking the prisoner to shew us. When we got half way along the shop the prisoner turned round to me and rather stopped me, and said, you have children of your own, pray forgive me, and I will never do so again; immediately after this I saw Mr. Midlam go into the corner of the shop, there he stooped down; it was the right corner as we came from the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Salmon. You have heard your brother describe this place to which Mr. Midlam went up, was that the corner where you saw the prisoner go when you came in the shop - A. Yes, that was the very corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either your brother or Mr. Midlam point out the corner where they found the note - A.Yes; they both pointed out the corner, and I am sure that is the place to which the prisoner went up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Salmon. You say he turned a little to the right - A. Yes; Mr. Midlam stooped down then and took up a note from off the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. It was laying unconcealed then, was it - A. Yes. He then turned his hand to a tea chest that stood on the same spot, in the corner, or near the corner, and between the tea chest and the wall; he took up two other notes wrapped up together; I did not examine them; they appeared to be bank notes as he had them in his hand.</p>
               <p>MR. MIDLAM. Q. You have been in court while Mr. Salmon has been examined - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His account is correct - A. Yes. I kept the notes myself and the two seven shilling pieces till the constable came, and then I gave them to him. They were three one pound notes; I do not recollect the numbers.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop in order to buy some sugar for an aged mother, for whom I am her chief support, no person being in the shop I leaned against the counter to rest myself until they came; when the prosecutrix rushed from the parlour, bolted the door, and accused me of robbing the till. I was taken into the back room and searched, nothing was found on me but money that was my own.</p>

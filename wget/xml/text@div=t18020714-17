I answered, what cheer? upon that, he immediately lifted up his fist, and gave me a violent blow, which cut me in the ear, at the same time he had my watch-chain in his hand; I immediately gave him a blow, and tripped up his heels; one of the others then struck me, and I sung out murder, robbery, watch, as loud as I could; the watchman then came up, I had treated him with a glass of gin but a minute before; I told the watchman this man had attempted to rob me, they had broke my watchchain, and when the watch - man came up, the prisoner threw down the chain by his feet, and they all ran away; the watchman picked up the chain; I never lost fight of the prisoner; two other watchmen came up, I told them if they would guard me, I would guard the man; I did not like to let go my hold.</p>

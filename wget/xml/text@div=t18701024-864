I live at 45, Rectory Grove, Woolwich—I was with Munns—I was sober—I called on him on business, and we went arm in arm towards High Street—I had seen him take some small change from his till—I was on the outside, and these two women separated us by pushing through—they said nothing—Munns remonstrated with them, and then he said, "Banks, I am being robbed"—I saw Coyle's hand in his right<lb></lb>hand trowsers pocket, and heard the chink of money on the ground—I went to take hold of her, and Lewis came up and used some words—I went to take hold of him, he thrust me back and picked up some of the money—Munns went for assistance—I had noticed previously that he had an umbrella, but I did not see it then—the women went towards the Arsenal Gate—this was not a dark place, it was under a lamp—I waited till Munns came back, and two or three minutes after, Lewis came up, he went three doors further down, and went in—he was there some time—Inspector Harvey came up and spoke to me, and when Lewis came out I gave him into Harvey's charge—it was a private house—Harvey told him the charge—he closed with him and resisted, and would have escaped, if Harvey had not stuck to him—early next morning, I was in bed, I received information, went to the station, and saw Coyle—I had no doubt of her being the party, from her dress and general appearance—on the following Wednesday week, I saw Brown and Coyle brought into the station yard with four or five others, and I identified Brown without any difficulty—I have seen this umbrella before, it is Mr. Dubbins'.</p>

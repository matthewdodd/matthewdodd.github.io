            . I keep a livery stable at the Star near Charing Cross, I never knew the prisoner, before the third of November; he came to put the mare up at my stable, and said, I might sell her. I am sure that is the man, I bought the mare of him for two guineas and an half, that is as much as she was worth. I would not have given another guinea for her; he told me his father gave him the mare; the mare was claimed about three weeks after by the prosecutor.</p>

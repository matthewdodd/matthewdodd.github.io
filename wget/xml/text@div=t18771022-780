I am a sailor on board the San Paulis, which the prisoner also belonged to—one evening, I cannot say the date, I went to a public-house, and the prisoner came in afterwards—he quar<lb></lb>relled—I told him to be quiet, and we left to go to my vessel—when we got near the water-side the prisoner began to quarrel with another man—I said "Be quiet," and then he struck me—I fell to the ground and received several blows on the head and arms—I felt I was cut—I was carried on board ship, and afterwards to the hospital.</p>

I am house surgeon at the Poplar Hospital—the prose<lb></lb>cutor was admitted on the 18th September—he had been bleeding very much; his clothes were saturated with blood—he had an incised wound on the left side of his head, on the back of his neck, and on his right forearm—the wound in the neck extended down to the spinal column, about 1 1/2 inches long—I should not like to say whether it penetrated—he had partial paralysis of the left side—he was in danger—the wounds could have been inflicted by a knife—he has not quite recovered from the paralysis—I think he will.</p>

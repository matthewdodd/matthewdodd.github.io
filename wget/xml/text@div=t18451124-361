                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Henry Smith, the master of Rasberry. I was employed as a labourer on the 21st of Nov. at three houses which were under repair—the scaffolding was taken down, and Wiles was the carter to take it away to Mr. Fordham—I was called away by the bricklayer—I returned, and Jones, the carpenter, asked me to atsist him in taking these things out of the cart—they are my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present on that day—the cart was there to take away the scaffolding—I saw Rasberry helping to load, and in taking the scaffolding he took some old boards under the scaffolding, and carried them to the cart—I think Wiles was the man who was in the cart, but I cannot swear to him—when Rasberry had given the scaffolding and boards to the man in the cart, Rasberry took a small door from a mortar heap, and carried that to the cart—he then went back, and fetched another small door—the same man was in the cart all the time—I went to Jones, who had been longer in the employ than me—I told him what was going on, and he went up to the cart—these are the two doors, and these are the pieces of wood—I do not believe they had any business to take this wood—I understood they were to take the scaffolding.</p>

In consequence of information, I went up to the cart, and saw Wiles—I asked what he had got in the cart—he said, "Scaffolding"—I looked in, and saw a two-panneled door—I said, "This is pretty scaffolding"—he said, "It is only just to make a child a bed, and you had better let it go"—I said, "I cannot"—I turned it over, and saw two smalldoors—I then saw three pieces of wood and two small pieces—he said, "You had better let it go, it is only fit for firing"—I said, "I cannot"—they were all Mr. Smith's property—I asked Putt to help me take the things back to the building—I told the foreman when he came, and he said I was quite right.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's brother. On that morning, about eleven or twelve o'clock, Wiles came to me, and said they bad been taking some wood out of the cart—I said I hoped he had not done so—he said he really had—I went round to Rasberry, and accused him of putting the stuff in the cart—he declared he had not, it was quite a falsehood—they had not the least business with either of these boards—they are valuable to a certain amount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Beale, and live in Lower Whitecross-street. The prisoner was six weeks in my service, and left me under the pretence of having a bad knee, which compelled her to go to the hospital, and she went there on Wednesday—I missed two ear-rings on the Friday morning—I have since seen them at the hospital—she took one pair all but the drops, and a pair of tops.</p>

The prisoner was admitted there on the Thursday—her mistress came on the Friday—I hap<lb></lb>pened to be coming out of the ward, when her master and mistress came up to the lobby—I went to the prisoner—she willingly produced her bundle, and a pair of ear-rings was found in it—I handed them over to Mrs. Beale—these are them.</p>

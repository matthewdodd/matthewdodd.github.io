                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, and live at No. 42, Wych-street, Strand. The prisoner was in my service for three or four months, and lodged in the house—he left on Sunday, the 7th of Sept.—I missed, among other things, a handkerchief from the parlour or shop, and a pair of Albert slippers—he himself told me of the loss of the slippers—on the 9th of Sept., I went with the officer to Dorset-place, Fleet-street, and found the prisoner there—the officer told him he was charged with stealing some things of me—he said he knew nothing about them, as respected taking them, he knew they had been taken—in coming along he said he was very glad I had taken it in hand, because it would make those who were innocent free from any charge, and those that were guilty would be found out—he came to me in the name of Baker, but also went by the name of Cummins, which is his father-in-law's name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Harris. During the time the prisoner was in Mr. Harris's employ, I worked under him—I was bound to him for four months by an agreement—on the 21st of July I was sitting at my work in Mr. Harris's top room, and heard the prisoner come up stairs—he stopped on the landing for about two minutes—I looked round, the door was half open, and I saw him with a handkerchief, with a red border, holding it up and looking at it—when he came in I said, "Ton have got Mr. Harris's handkerchief"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have," feeling on his breast—he said, "You may search me if you like;" and I let it pass—I saw him fold up a pair of white trowsers behind the door—I asked where he was going—he said to Battersea, and if I liked I might go with him—I said, "What will Mr. Harris say?"—he said, "Never mind what Mr. Harris will say; you are my boy"—I went with him—we went up Drury-lane, and he went into Mr. Sayer's, the pawnbroker—I waited outside—I saw him with a pair of white trow-sers, and saw the pawnbroker give him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a ticket—after that I went to Battersea with him—the trowsers were not claimed by Mr. Harris.</p>

The prisoner offered this silver table-spoon to sell, broke as it now is, (produced and deposed to by the letters E S on it;) the prisoner said, where he was servant in a house, the spoon fell down and broke; I seeing it could not be doubled and broke in that manner by a fall, I stopped it; I asked him where he brought it from; he said he came from the Queen's Arms at Hertford; he said a young man paid half a guinea for the spoon, and he found it afterwards tied up in a paper coming from Hertford; the next morning I secured him, and took him before Sir

               <p>I was along with a party, and was billetted at the prosecutor's house; I was going to work on a Wednesday morning about five o'clock; as I opened the gate coming out, I found this spoon wrapped up in a paper, I put it in my pocket; I was about a mile from the town where I worked; I did not understand the letters on it, I put it in my pocket; I came up from Hertford to London to see my wife; I offered to sell it to this gentleman for 5 s. an ounce; he said he would not give me that; I said, then you shall not have it; said he, I'll give you 3 s. for it; I would not take it; then he said he would give me 3 s. 6 d. I would not not let him have it; then he stopped it. I belong to the 36th regiment that now lies in Jamaica.</p>

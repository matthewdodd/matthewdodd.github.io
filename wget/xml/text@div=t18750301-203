                  </hi>. I live at North Street, Stepney—about 9.30 on 31st January I was with Emma English in Baker's Row, Whitechapel—we met the prisoner—I knew him well—he asked me to go and have some drink with him, and I and English and the prisoner went to a beer-house together—we had some drink—the prisoner seemed as if he had had a lotto drink—he seemed the worse for liquor when he met us—we came out, and he asked me where I was going to—I said I was going to Emma English's sister's—he said "You shan't go"—I said "Why?"and he made a job in my arm with a knife—I saw the point of the knife—I did not see the handle—I felt the knife go in my arm—it just cut it—it did not hurt me much—I told him he had more control over me than my own father, and with that he made a blow at me with his fist, but did not strike me—I ran across the road and he followed—I stopped, and asked him to have a glass of ale—he did not make any' answer, and as we were going along towards the public-house he stuck the knife in my hip—he was behind me—I did not see the knife—I felt it go in—I said to a young man "Would you be so kind as to pull the knife out?"and he tried to pull it out and could not—the prisoner said "I can put it in, and I can pull it out and stick it into her again," and when he pulled it out I fell senseless in the young <hi rend="italic">chap's</hi> arms—I was taken to the hospital, and was there a fortnight—I feel the place now, because it keeps on gathering.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner six years altogether—I kept company with him for eighteen months before he went to America—he always professed himself to be very fond of me—he was considerably the worse for drink—I asked him to have a glass of ale to try and get him away, and I thought it would cool his temper, as he was in such a passion—he was always jealous of me—I don't believe he meant seriously to hurt me.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to tell Mr. Emery of it afterwards? - A. His wife was fretting about it, and I told her not to make herself so unhappy, for it was I that took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. YOu know I was an old friend of your's at Clerkenwell? - A. Yes; I was at Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was your friend, and you were kind enough to rob him for his kindness to you? - A. I took the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know, that by swearing against this poor man you save yourself from going to Botany Bay? - A. No, I don't know that.</p>

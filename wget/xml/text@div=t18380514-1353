                  </hi>. I live at West Drayton, in Middlesex, and am a cord-wainer, but do not follow the business. On the 4th of November I lived at Uxbridge—I was in the George inn-yard going home through the fields, between ten and eleven o'clock at night-as I proceeded along the footpath, three or four men came up, and knocked me down in the fields, not a quarter of a mile from Uxbridge—I received a blow on my nose, which caused it to bleed—I was knocked down, and my eyes blindfolded-a man held his</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler and farmer. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of Sunday, the 5th of November, I saw the prisoner Hutchinson, with another young man, in my public-house at Watford—they came there about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—that is about eleven miles from Uxbridge—they went into the tap-room-a person named Thomas Green applied to me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I lent him—I went into the tap-room about five minutes afterwards, and saw the prisoner, and another young man sitting in company with him, close to one another—the prisoner was sitting close to Green—I did not see any thing pass between them—the prisoner and his companion had some beef-steaks, and then went away a little before ten o'clock-in consequence of suspicion I entertained, I sent for two constables, bat they came too late to stop them, or I should have had them detained on suspicion of a murder at Hertford.</p>

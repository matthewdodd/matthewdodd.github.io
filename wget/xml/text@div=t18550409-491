                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of Hammersmith. On 19th March I bought a number of sheep—I saw them that afternoon in a field at Brook Green, Hammersmith—there were four marks on them: a "T" on the face, extending from the forehead down to the nose; a red dot of paint between the ears; a slight red paint mark, older done, on the back, towards the hip; and an "H" on the back—there were thirty-one of them, including the leader sheep, which I had had twelve months, or a little more; it was tame, and when sheep came home from market, it used to run in first and they followed instantly—it was about half the size of the other sheep—on that Monday I saw the leader driven into the field, they were all there together—there was a private mark on the leader—I had bought it for a gentleman a few months back—we castrated it ourselves; and not being a usual per<lb></lb>formance with us, it took longer to heal; we had to dress the parts affected, and they had just got well—I live about a quarter of a mile from the field—on Thursday morning, about half past 9, my lad gave me information, and I went and found only eleven sheep left—I did not know Paulin, but I know now where his butcher's shop is—I went there on Saturday, from something that I heard, and saw three carcass of sheep resembling mine, and some joints of mutton of the same quality—I have killed some of the same sheep—a pair of hind quarters of the leader were hung close behind, hidden—I have them in court (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are the strings of the parts, which we cut across with a pair of tweezers, and I can undertake to say that this is part of the carcase of the leader—on the same day I went to Mr. Wighton's shop, and saw four carcases of sheep, throe in front, and one hanging in the row; and I said to myself, that is one of my sheep—I had no notion of finding any of my sheep there—on the following Tuesday I went to Mr. Corderoy's, in Long-lane, Bermondsey, and saw this sheep's skin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is a red dot on this skin between the ears; it was on four out of the nineteen—this "T" is my own mark; that was on the whole twenty—this skin has been limed and washed, which has effaced the marks very much—here is the red paint on the hip—I did not look at the other skins; there were seven; but I was told that if I found any of mine, it</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 40, York-street, Manchester-square. In consequence of a message left at my mistress's house on the Fast-day, I went to Paulin's house next morning at 7 o'clock, and saw a heap of skins lying on the pavement before his door—in pursuance of directions I had received, I put them into my cart, and took them to Mr. Williams, of Newgate-market, and left them there in the name of Paulin; that was in consequence of what my mistress told me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellmonger, of Bermondsey. I bought some skins of Mr. Strong; I think it was last Saturday three weeks—on the Tuesday following, Mr. Fowkes came to my premises, and picked out a skin—I cannot say whether that was one of the skins which I had bought of Mr. Strong, because I had bought of two other salesmen, and they were all mixed together, but Mr. Strong's were among them—I afterwards examined some skins, and found two others marked just like this—they had been limed and washed then.</p>

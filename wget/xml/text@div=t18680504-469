                  </hi>. I live at Mount Place, Upper Clapton, and am a widow—on Thursday, 23rd April, I left my dining-room about midnight shut up safely, when I went to bed—I was awoke in the night by a noise, but not sufficiently alarmed to get up—I think it must have been just on the head of daylight—I was called at 7 o'clock by my servant—I went into the dining-room—the sideboard was broke open, the drawers emptied, and a number of articles taken, to the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since identified some of them—this clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was taken from the mantelpiece, and this microscope.</p>

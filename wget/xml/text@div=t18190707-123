On Saturday, the 21st of November, I placed eighteen hand-glasses over the cauliflowers; on Sunday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I missed two glasses, and two plumtrees, which were growing in the garden.

            . My husband is a carpenter. On Sunday morning, the 22d of November, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner brought two glasses and two trees to sell - he said one was a plumtree, but he did not know what the other was. I agreed to give him 5 s. for them, and put them into my garden; he was to call next day for the money. He came on Monday, about five o'clock, Dowding came at the same time. I pointed the prisoner out to him, who ran away. He said his name was Pearce. He never returned for the money.</p>

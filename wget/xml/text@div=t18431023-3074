I am the father of William Haynes, who is committed for the murder of his wife—the Jury sat on her body—the prisoner came to my house, and wished to see the body, because, he said, he was one of the Jury—I let him do so—he then asked me for some vinegar to wash his hands, and asked when I intended to bury it—I said the next day—he said, "Where?"—I said, "At Haggerston church"—he said, "I am the parish clerk"—I said, "Perhaps you will be so kind as to take the warrant for interment, and see to the grave"—he said he would, and said, "There are dues fot the interment"—I said, "Very well, what are they?"—he said, "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," which I gave him for the dues—when I began to reflect in the evening, I thought I had been deceived, and waited on the person who I found to be the parish clerk the next morning—I should not have given the prisoner that 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. if he had not told me he was the clerk—if I had not believed it I should not have given it him—I did not per<lb></lb>ceive that he was drunk.</p>

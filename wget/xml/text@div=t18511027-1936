I live at Alfred-place, St. John's-wood—I first knew the prisoner at Amsterdam, and afterwards, in April, met her at Brus<lb></lb>sels—I came from Brussels with her, as my servant, to this country fourteen days before the Exhibition opened—I took her because I could not then speak a word of English—we first went to Mr. Cline's Hotel, in Finsbury-square, and remained there eight days—the prisoner then told me it was very expensive to live so long at an hotel, and I directed her to get lodgings—she went out, returned, and told me she had taken lodgings—I sent her with my boxes—the boxes were all locked—I bad in a desk a bill for 100 francs, two bills for twenty-five guilders, and ten notes for ten guilders each—a guilder is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the desk went with the boxes—I went in about two hours to the lodgings, which were at Mr. Brandt's, a cigar-shop, in Fleet-street—they consisted of a bed-room and sitting-room—I slept there that night with the prisoner—she awoke me in the morning, and brought me my watch, and I saw it was 5 o'clock, and she gave me some tea, as I was very ill—my keys were in my pocket when I went to bed—the prisoner asked me for them, and I said, "Take them"—she left the room, and then brought them back directly—they were the keys of my luggage, which had been placed in a little pantry—I went to sleep, and awoke about 11 or 12, went to the dining-room, asked after the prisoner, and found she was gone—I could not find the key of the pantry, and at last Mr. Brandt burst the door open, and I found my things all over the floor, and all the boxes unlocked——I missed the money I have mentioned from the desk, a box and a towel—these produced are the box and towel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have towels which match this one—I also missed a shift, petticoat, and paletot—I afterwards saw the prisoner, I do not know when it was—I asked her to give me my money back, she said she had nothing for me, and I said, "I go to the police-station"—she said, "Very well, you may go; I will fetch for you a policeman"—I went to get a policeman, and in the meantime she was gone.</p>

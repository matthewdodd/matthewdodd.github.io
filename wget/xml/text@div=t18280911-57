            , about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon; I received the cheque from him - this is it (looking at it;) it is drawn for 35l., and signed W. and G. Borradaile: on looking at it I suspected it to be not genuine - I asked Higgins what he would take for it; he hesitated very much, and gave me noanswer: in consequence of a conversation with him I sent a porter into the street, and he brought the prisoner Burgess in - I knew him immediately, and said, "You belong to Messrs. Borradaile's;" he said, "I do not:" he had been very frequently at our house before, from them - I said, "You have been very frequently in the habit of coming to our house to receive money - I have paid you money frequently myself;" he said he never was in the habit of coming to the house at all - those were his words; not that he had never been there: I am certain he has very frequently been there - I had very often paid him money at the counter: nothing further passed between him and me - an officer was sent for; he and Higgins were both taken into custody. I very often pay Messrs. Burradaile's cheques, and I should say this cheque is not their handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Your firm consists of three persons - does it not often happen that the senior partner allows his name to remain, when he has no interest in the business? A. It may be so, Sir William Curtis is a partner - the cheque has not been in my possession ever since; I know it by my initials on the back, which I put on at the time, after I had questioned him - I did not keep it a minute after it was presented; I gave it to the solicitor; I did not put my initials on it when I first parted with it - I do not recollect whether I did it the same day or not, as it was near the close of business; I do not think I did put them on the same day - I knew the cheque when it was put into my hands, from the filling up and the writing; I suspected it when it was first produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Higgins' manner increase that suspicion, or otherwise? A. It increased it - he hesitated very much in his answer how he would have it; I did not send him to fetch the prisoner - he was detained; the prisoner said he did not belong to Messrs. Borradaile's; I have since heard that he had been discharged that morning - his answer was so far correct; he said he had not been in the habit of coming to the house; I did not ask his name - I knew his person well; the porter was present at this conversation.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was about half-past four o'clock when Higgins brought it? A. It was; I sent for a constable, but not immediately; I had some little conversation with Higgins previous to my sending out to Burgess - a little more conversation passed than I have mentioned; I kept the cheque in my hands till the boys were taken up - it then got into the hands of the solicitor; I gave it into the hands of our head clerk, Mr. Stevens - he did not return it to me; I had not then marked it - I cannot positively say whether I marked it that night or on Monday morning, (this was on Saturday).</p>
               <p>Q. After you put it into Mr. Stevens' hands, did you see it again? A. I think on Monday morning, but am not certain; I have not the least doubt of having put my initials on the same cheque - this is the same cheque; the prisoner said he was not in the habit of coming to our house at all, and said he did not come from Borradaile's- I did not ask him if he had ever belonged to Borradaile's; I said, "You belong to Borradaile's."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect when you first saw the solicitor? A. I think on the Saturday afternoon, but I had no conversation with him; I was busy, and do not remember.</p>

            , JUN. My father is a waterman, and lives at No. 18, Gedling-street, Dockhead. I have known the prisoner about three months - he came to me on Saturday, in July, at Bankside - he asked me if I was going over the water, and then he asked if I would give him a cast over; I did so, after asking my father's leave; when we got over my father stepped out on the stairs, and then told me to moor the boat - the prisoner and I went over Three Cranes-wharf, and when we got up into Queen-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110049"></xptr>street, he asked me to go a little way with him, he should not be above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I said if we should not be longer I would go; when he got up two or three lanes, he asked me if I would go in there with a piece of paper - he pointed to the house, where I went in, and gave me a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he ask you to do? A. He asked me to go in there with a piece of paper, and say, "Short," for he was going somewhere with a letter; I was to take the paper in there, and put it on the counter and say"Short."</p>
               <p>Q. If you got anything, what were you to do? A. To bring it to him; he said he would be outside by the time I came out - he gave me the paper; I took it into the house; the clerk asked me what I would have - I said"Short:" after some conversation the prisoner was fetched in - I told the clerk, Burgess was outside: I put the same paper down to the clerk, as the prisoner gave me; I laid it on the counter.</p>
               <p>MR. BRACKET. The term, "Short," means the smallest number of notes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear who proposed to the other to go? A. No - I stepped out on the stairs; they crossed some other boats to the wharf; I did not hear them say a word - they shoved the boat from the steps to make the rope fast.</p>

            . I am solicitor to the Committee of London Bankers; this prosecution is carried on at their instance. On the 12th of July I was fetched to the banking-house of Messrs. Curtis - the prisoner and Higgins were there; at the time of my going into the counting-house a conversation was going on between Burgess, Higgins and a gentleman there, who, I think, was Mr. Stevens; the conversation ceased as I entered, and it was stated to me that there was a forged cheque brought in by the two boys, and I was requested to do what was needful; the cheque was produced to me - it was between four and five o'clock; the cheque was lying on the desk before them; I questioned Higgins, who, I understood, had brought it in, and he stated, in the presence of the prisoner, the facts he has now given in evidence; finding Burgess had given it to him, I told him the serious consequences of the offence, and cantioned him against stating anything to me that might affect himself, and told him to state nothing but the truth; I then asked him from whom he had the cheque - he said from Norris, who was the foreman of Messrs. Borradaile's; that he had received it from him that morning, and was to take him the money for it in the afternoon; I then asked if he was quite certain that Norris was the person from whom he had received the cheque (taking the cheque in my hands) - he said he was; I took it into my possession, and kept it till Monday morning, when I went to the Mansion-house, and I think it was then Bracket put his initials on it; it had not been out of my possession before then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This prosecution is by the Association of Bankers? A. Yes; I was sent for as their solicitor; Mr. Stevens was in the room when the conversation took place - he might, or might not, hear the cantion I gave the prisoner; there are one or two desks in the office; Mr. Stevens was at the end of the office and busily engaged - it was cancelling time, but it is possible he might have heard it; when I entered the room he was about as far as I am from you, and said to me, "These are the lads who brought the cheque, will you attend to them" - he then left that desk, and went to his own desk: I told the prisoner what he said would be given in evidence, and more particularly, if he told an untruth it would be more prejudicial to him; I always make it a rule to caution a person before I ask a question - I told him it would be more detrimental to him if he told an untruth, and then he said Mr. Norris was the person who gave it to him; I told him it would be a serious thing if it was not so - he replied that Norris was the person; I think Mr. Bracket put his initials to the cheque at the banking-house previous to my going to the Mansion-house about eleven o'clock in the morning - it had been in my possession till that time; it lay on the desk on my entering the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Mr. Stevens retired from that desk to his own - whose desk was he standing at at the time? A. I cannot say - it was one of three or four desks which stand in a room; Bracket was not there; Rhodes entered the room at the time the conversation was going on.</p>

I believe the question was asked him by somebody, I think by Mr. Gates; and an officer was despatched for Norris - Mr. Gates left the place, desiring me to take care of the prisoners; during his absence I was speaking of the enormity of the offence - I did not say anything to induce him to make a statement - I asked how he could be guilty of such a thing, if the charge was true against him, which I hoped he would prove not; he said he had the cheque several days in his possession - I said, "Then how is it that they would suffer a cheque to lay in your possession, and not call for the proceeds before" he said he had had cheques lay in his pocket for days before, and it happened so in the hurry of business sometimes; nothing further passed - I searched him on Mr. Gates' return, which was in about half an hour, and found on him three cheques, with the names signed to them, but the sums blank - these are them(looking at them) they were in his left-hand jacket pocket, with other papers; I produced the cheques, and Mr. Gates, I believe, put some questions to him - he said he had them from a boy named May, who (he said) was in Messrs. Borradaile's employ, in the counting-house; May was sent for - Norris afterwards came to the Mansion-house, and, I believe, the first words Norris said, was, "You know, Burgess, you were discharged from Messrs. Borradaile's," for some reason; I believe Mr. Gates asked Norris, in the prisoner's presence, if he had given him the cheque; Norris denied it, and said he had not given it to him; and denied that it was the signature of the firm - the prisoner was then dumb - he made no answer; he heard what Norris said: May was afterwards sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that the whole of this took place before you went before the Magistrate? - A. Yes; he did not go before the Magistrate that day: Mr. Gates first came to the Mansion-house about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Gates, on seeing him at the Mansion-house, desire to know from whom he had the cheque? A. Yes - he did not say he had already heard from whom he had it; I do not think anybody was present when I talked with the prisoner; I believe he is sixteen or seventeen years old; I knew the charge affected his life.</p>
               <p>Q. And after "enlarging on the enormity of the offence," you questioned him? A. I put this simple question to him - I did not tell him his answers would be given in evidence against him, it not being my original charge.</p>

            . On the 12th of July I was foreman to Messrs. William and George Borradaile, and am so still. The prisoner was in their employ, and left on the morning of the 12th of July; I am acquainted with Messrs. Borradaile's hand-writing - (looking at the cheque) this is not in the hand-writing of any of the firm, nor any part of it; no other persons are authorized to draw cheques in their names; I did not give this cheque to the prisoner on that day, or at any time; I have been in Messrs. Borradaile's employ ever since I left school, about thirty-five years; before the present gentleman came into the house. I know nothing whatever about the cheque; I know very little of the prisoner's hand-writing: I was sent for to the Mansion-house on the 12th of July, about six o'clock in the evening - I saw the prisoner and Higgins there.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner was in the service of your employers, had he ever been sent to the banker's? - A. He was repeatedly sent to Messrs. Curtis', not less than twenty times; I was asked, in the prisoner's presence, whether I had given him that cheque, and said certainly not; part of the prisoner's employment was to clean the counting-house out; the cheque-book sometimes was kept in the pigeon-holes, where memorandums are placed, and when he was cleaning the counting-house he might have access to the cheque-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the prosecutors' service? A. Since 1793; I superintend the manufactory - I am confident I never saw that cheque; there are several firms named Borradaile in London, but not Borradaile only; I never knew our firm sign blank cheques - two other clerks and a lad named May had access to the cheque-book, as well as the prisoner; the warehousemen have no business in the counting-house, but they might have access to it. I have sent the prisoner to Messrs. Curtis' many times; I believe he came into the employ in October, 1826; he has been with us nearly two years.</p>

            . I am in Messrs. Borradaile's employ, and have been so since November, 1827. I never gave the prisoner these three cheques; I know nothing of these three; the day before he left the service I saw him take two cheques out of the cheque-book, which laid on Mr. George Borradaile's desk; they were blank cheques - I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said Nothing - that they were of no use: nothing more passed - he took the two cheques, doubled them up very small, and put them into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you did not give him these three - did you give him any others of the same kind? A. No; I said I knew nothing of these three; but I saw him take the two I have spoken of, and double them up very small; I only know of those two; I never had anything of the sort in my possession; I saw him take them from the cheque-book; I knew the cheque-book by the appearance of it - there was not "Cheque-book" written on it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were blank - did you look at them? A. No; the cheque-book is never filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you occasionally look into it, I suppose? A. I have occasionally cheques to go to the banker's, and I have fetched cheque-books from the banker's; I fetched that one more than a month before this happened; I had not looked into the book after I fetched it - I thought it wrong for him to take them; I did not go and tell of it: he said he was going to do nothing with them; I said nothing about it till he was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110051"></xptr>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was that next day? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM BORRADAILE. I am in partnership with George Borradaile - we are furriers; our manufactory is in Bridge-row, Southwark. (Looking at the cheque) this is not my hand-writing, nor my brother's - nobody is anthorized to draw cheques in our name; we never draw blank cheques, nor leave them in our cheque-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these three cheques - are either, or all of them, signed in your or your brother's hand-writing? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have no other partners? A. None - I am certain we never authorized any person to sign cheques for our firm - my brother is not in town.</p>
               <p>The cheque was here put in, and read [see indictment,] also the three blank ones found on the prisoner; they were on Sir William Curtis and Co., and each signed William and George Borradaile, apparently in the same hand-writing as the one uttered.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CURTIS, ESQ. My father. Sir William Curtis, Mr. Robarts, and myself, compose the firm of our banking-house.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to HENRY HIGGINS, JUN. Q. Where did you meet Burgess that morning? A. At Bankside, about two o'clock - it was not by appointment, but accidental; we waited a few minutes till my father came from dinner, and then crossed the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go, directly after you landed at the wharf, to Lombard-street? A. Yes; he stopped to buy one pennyworth of apples - I am not quite sure that it was two o'clock when I met him; we mostly dine about two - I do not know at what time we got to the banking-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped no where but to buy one pennyworth of apples? A. Yes, we stopped a good bit at a public-house - he asked me to go in; I had no suspicion of anything wrong - I swear that.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You said it was about two o'clock when you landed the prisoner from the boat, and said you would go with him if it would not take more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you stay at the public-house? A. We stopped a good while - he said he was only going in for a minute or two.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he tell you he was going to take you to the banking-house to give you a paper to receive money? A. No, not till he got close to the place - he said he was only going to the public-house for a few minutes - we had some porter, and he kept me a good while - he said my father would not get a fare yet; I told him I must not stop above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>MR. BORRADAILE. We understood and believed the prisoner to hear a good character.</p>

             re-examined. I found the prisoner at the corner of Abchurch-lane, about six or seven yards from our door - our house is at the corner of the lane; he was on the same side of the lane as the house is, and on the pitching, not on the pavement - our door is in Lombard-street, in the centre of the house; he was a yard and a half or two yards down the lane - I dare say he could see anybody go in and out of our house - he was just round the corner; as soon as I went out of the house I saw him, and brought him in - he could not see into our windows, they are very high.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You say he stood some distance down the lane? A. He could see anybody coming down our steps from the banking-house door - he stood at the corner of the street, watching to his left; as soon as I went out at the door I saw him, and took him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you got out at the door did you see him? A. In less than a second, as soon as I was off the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon could he see anybody coming down the steps? A. He could see through the rails, which project out two feet or better.</p>
               <p>MR. STEVENS. I am engaged in Messrs. Curtis' house; Beckett gave me a cheque; I referred to Mr. Robarts, and sent immediately to Mr. Gates; I put the cheque into Mr. Gates' hands - before Mr. Gates came in, I think I put it into Mr. Robart's hands, and he returned it to me; it was not out of my sight while in his hands - I put no mark on it; I believe this cheque to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it in your possession before it got into the possession of Mr. Gates? A. I should think not a quarter of an hour - it had been in the room where I was all the time.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Mr. Robarts was not in the same room as you? A. No: I think I put the cheque into his hands - I did not leave it with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it to Mr. Gates, or lay it on the desk? A. I think I gave it into Mr. Gates' hand.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY HIGGINS, JUN. Q. Had you ever been to a banker's before? A. No: the prisoner gave me the cheque at the banking-house door; I did not read it - it was doubled together; he told me to put it on the counter - I did not know what "Short" meant.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 44, Weymouth-street, and am a baker. On the evening of the 22nd of January I was at the Constitution public-house, and saw the deceased Felix Charles, with a man named Harwood—they came into the tap-room, and were served with a pot of beer—soon after<lb></lb>wards the prisoner, who is the landlord, came into the tap-room, and asked Harwood to sit down, as he was standing before the fire—he said he was very cold, and said, "I shall sit down presently, but is not this a tap-room?"—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140227"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner said, "If you do not sit down, you shall go out"—Harwoodsaid, "No, you won't"—Bonner said, "I shall" and took him by the collar, and took him out of the tap-room—they had a scuffle—they went out together—the deceased got up, and followed them out—that was all he did—all three came into the tap-room, after being out three or four minutes, and were quite, friendly, both the deceased, the prisoner, and Harwood—when they came back, the deceased said to Bonner, "Why do you be so passionate, Mr. Bonner?"—that was about a minute or two after they came in—he said, "Why don't you be of a mild temper, like me?"—he said, "Let us be comfortable, Mr. Bonner; we don't come here to make a piece of work, we came to be comfortable, and have a pot of porter; let us shake hands toge<lb></lb>ther," and they shook hands—the pot of beer had come in before the de<lb></lb>ceased sat down—after they had sat down three or four minutes the de<lb></lb>ceased said, "Bonner, if you had served me as you served that man, you should have gone down"—the deceased had a pot of beer in his hand, and the prisoner snatched it from his hand, and said, "Would you, by G—?" and threw the rest of the beer in his face—the deceased rose up, and pushed him away from him, and Bonner struck him with the pot on the head—the deceased <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away, and the prisoner directly struck him on the head with the pot—the push the deceased gave was not violent—he had his at off when he got the blow with the pot—the prisoner's wife came in, and got between them—the deceased was forcing to get at him, and the prisoner kept repeatedly hitting him with the pot, three or four times—I am sure he hit him four times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before they shook hands, did not the prisoner say, "I am rather passionate, but let it all drop?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear that—I am sure of that—I did not hear the words, "Let it all drop"—I never heard him say so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May that expression have taken place, and you forget it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is a good while ago—he may have said so—after the prisoner struck the deceased, he fell from the last blow—the deceased sent for the doctor—I had not drank anything myself that night—the man that came in with the deceased (Harwood) went for the doctor—nobody sent for him but the deceased—he came and cut the deceased's hair off—he came in it; or six minutes after the blow was struck—he lives next door—the de<lb></lb>ceased said to him, "Now, do what is necessary, and you shall be paid for it; you have no occasion to be afraid, you will be paid for what you do;" and the doctor said, "You go home and get a poultice, and come to me in the morning"—I cannot say how long he staid in the public-house, for I left myself about nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Page and Sherlock get between the prisoner and the deceased, to separate them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were never in the room—the deceased never said he would smash their heads—he never saw them—the prisoner by Striking the deceased, struck the prisoner's wife with the pot—she had no blow from the deceased—I never heard that about three quarters of an how after this happened, the deceased went to the house with a club, and swore he would have the b—life of Mr. Bonner, and made every body give him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—I did not hear any witness depose to that effect before the Coroner—I was not in the room all the while—I do not belong to the society—I did not draw the brief for the prosecution—I gave my statement of the evidence to the attorney—I cannot tell who the attorney is—I stated before the Coroner that the deceased said to the doctor, "Do what is ne<lb></lb>cessary, and you shall be paid"—it was taken down in writing, and read over to me afterwards, before I signed the depositions—my deposition was read over to me, and that was in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the pot-boy. I was in the Constitution on the 23rd of January—I saw the deceased, and Mr. Bonner, and Harwood—I was there when they came in—I took the beer to them—after that, Mr. Bonner came out of the parlour into the tap-room, and said to the deceased and Harwood, "What a noise you are making!"—the deceased said, "We are not," and Bonner said to Harwood, "If you do not sit down and be quiet, I shall turn you out"—he was standing up by the lire-place—Har<lb></lb>wood answered him, "Oh no, you won't"—Bonner said, "Yes, I will," and took him by the collar, and turned him out—they then came in again, and Mr. Bonner followed them, and the deceased said to Mr. Bonner, "What a curious tempered man you are! come, shake hands, and be friendly"—Bonner said, "If you will sit down and be quiet, I will"—the deceased sat down with a pot of beer in his hand, and before he drank, he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140231"></xptr>
               <p>said to Bonner, "You put me out of your house once; if you had put me cut as you did my friend, I should have put you down"—Bonner said, "Would you, by G—d?"—he said, "Yes, I would"—Bonner caught the pot that was in his hands, and turned the beer over him, with his left hand he took the deceased by the collar, and struck him a blow on the top of his head—I do not recollect whether his hat was on or off—the deceased rose up, pushed his arm out, and struck Bonner in the eye; then Bonner struck him three or four times afterwards—the blow over the eye was a pretty violent one—I saw Bonner the next morning, and he had a black eye—he had no black eye before he received that blow from the deceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often did the prisoner strike him after he struck his eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four times—then Mrs. Bonner came into the room, got between them, stopped them, and got a black eye herself—I cannot say who gave her that—the deceased did not strike Bonner in the eye before Bonner struck him with the quart pot—I do not recollect saying before the Coroner that the deceased struck Bonner before he hit him with the quart pot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You named to the Coroner about being in the back part of the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they asked me if I saw the deceased strike Bonner in the eye, and I said I did not see the blow given, but he put his arm out—I am not quite sure who struck first.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I usually attend Mr. Bonner's family—I live next door to them—I was sent for to the deceased—he seemed quite in possession of himself—his head was bleeding—I took the hair off, clearly to see the state of the wound—the scalp was divided, not so deep as the bone—blood was flowing in considerable quantities from the wound, and it appeared to be bruised as well as divided—there were no marks of more than one blow—as there was but one wound, I think it must have been only one blow—I directed him to get his head poulticed—it did not strike me as at all dangerous at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an assistant to Mr. Key, a surgeon, at Guy's Hospital, at the time the accident happened. I remember the deceased coming there about the middle of the day on the 23rd, as an inmate—he remained there till his death—on the top and forepart of his head was a slight contused wound, about an inch and a half long and not very deep—I thought it of little consequence—he had, however, some suspicious symptoms which indicated that the brain had received some slight injury—no portions of the bone ever came away; a piece of the bone became dead, and was undergoing the process of excoriation—I consider the blow had produced a slight injury to the brain, which in about nine weeks pro<lb></lb>duced inflammation of the membranes, and that produced death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you trace the death to the original blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly.</p>

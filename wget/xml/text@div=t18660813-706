                  </hi>. I am clerk to Edwards and Company, of Fen<lb></lb>church Street—on the morning of the 2nd August I saw the prisoner following a gentleman very closely—I saw his hand in his pocket, and saw him take out a handkerchief and put it in his pocket—he stood still a short time and went across the road—I held up my hand to a policeman, who did not come at first, and I took the prisoner and gave him in custody without losing sight of him—there might have been a minute and a half between his taking the handkerchief and my stopping him—I saw him searched—the handkerchief was found at his feet when the constable took him—I tried to find the gentleman, but he was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you close to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no one between us—I stopped one gentleman, thinking he was the same, but he was not.</p>

                  </hi> (City Policeman 701). I was in Fenchurch Street—Birt ran across to me and pointed the prisoner out—the moment I stopped him he dropped this handkerchief at his feet—I picked it up, when he said that he had not stolen it—I only found a common ring on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you know how the handkerchief came on the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see it in the act of falling, but the moment I turned you round a respectable person who was passing said, "He has just dropped it on the ground," and it was at your feet—it was not on the ground when I stepped up to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Coming along Fenchurch Street I was close behind a gentleman, which made the witness suspect me; if he was sure I took it why did not he accost the gentleman, and not allow him to go? he after<lb></lb>wards stopped the wrong man, and therefore may not I be the wrong man?—I did not know that the handkerchief was on the ground. <hi rend="smallCaps">

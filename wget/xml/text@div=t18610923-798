On Tuesday, 2d September, I went to No. 2, Legg-court—I went into the room and saw the prisoner sitting down on a chair, and the body of the deceased lying on the bed—I said to the prisoner, "How was this done?"—he said, "She <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it herself; I know nothing about it"—I cautioned him, and told him he was not obliged to say anything unless he thought proper, and whatever he did say might be used as evidence against him—he then said, "I was sitting down having my dinner—I had a few words with my wife yesterday about getting drunk—I sent my little girl out for some oats for the rabbit—I was eating bread and butter and potatoes—when I had done, I laid my knife down on the table, she picked it up and <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it herself, and threw the knife away" I then said, "Who put her on the bed?"—he said, "I don't know—I asked whether he assisted—he said he did not—I examined his hands—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the West minster Police Court—I was on duty there when the prisoner was under examination—while the witnesses were being examined the prisoner requested that he might make a statement—I took down in writing the statement that he then made as he gave it—I have made a transcript of it, which I can check by the original—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "The prisoner having requested to be allowed to speak, and being told that he may speak if he wishes, but that he is not called upon to-do so says, 'I worked at the Duke of Buccleugb's till 12 o'clock, and I could not get from there to Peter-street till a quarter or twenty minutes past 12. My wife had my dinner for me, potatoes and bacon. She had a drop taken on the Sunday night, but I did not say anything, to her then. As she was sober and I was sober, I thought it a good time to speak to her, and I said, 'It is fitter for you to look to your children than to drink away my money. 'I had my knife to eat my dinner. It was by my side, and she caught it up and did it herself, and flung the knife away, and said, 'It is done now; we will not have any more jaw.' I tried to stop the blood. She fell on the floor, and died immediately. I goes to the door and sings out,' Will any one go for the doctor,' and that is how the people got round. I have no more to say. Who brought the doctor I don't know.")—The first examina<lb></lb>tion before the Magistrate was on Monday, 2d September, about half-past 1 or 2 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Denbigh-street, Pimilico—I am also a Doctor of Medicine—about the middle of the day, a little after 12 o'clock, on Monday, 2d September, I was called to a house in Legg-court—a young man, seventeen or eighteen years of age, came for me—I do not know his name—I recognised him here yesterday—I went into the room on the ground-floor—there were a good many persons in the room, quite a dozen, I should say—it is a very small room; I heard it stated as nine feet by ten, and t have no doubt that is correct—I did not measure it myself—I judge it to be about that—as I entered the door there was a table; the door just escaped the end of the table—I saw the body of the deceased lying on the floor when I entered the room; indeed I had some difficulty in passing into the room—the feet of the deceased were against the door, so that I had to push a little on one side to enter the room—the body was lying across the room—the table was between the lady and the window—her feet were towards the door, and her head towards the fireplace—her feet were at the corner of the table—the door opened inwards—the hinges of the door were towards the bedstead—as the door opened it would go against her feet—the fire-place was facing the door—her head was within, probably, eighteen inches of the fire-place; perhaps it might be two feet—her body nearly covered the whole floor—the prisoner was among the other persons there when I went in—I could not speak to where he was—before I removed the body from the floor I observed a wound on the left side, of</p>

               <p>the neck—it was half way between the perpendicular portion of the neck and the apex of the shoulder on the left side (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position on his own person</hi>)—it was nearer the shoulder than the base of the neck, just over the collar bone—I subsequently made a doable post mortem examination—finding she was dead, I asked assistance to raise the body on to the bed—I called on the prisoner to assist me; he was one man present among others—I did not know that there was any connexion between them at that time—I said, "Just assist me with her on to the bed,' and he objected—he said, "No, I won't"—O'Connor and a woman came forward and assisted me—the first examination I made was a superficial or external examination—I found the wound measured exactly three-quarters of an inch—the direction of it was from the apex of the shoulder, towards the neck—it was a logitudinal wound, not a transverse one, along the line of the collar bone—the weapon must have been in a longitudinal position when it inflicted the wound, not held transversely—it did not penetrate the shoulder; it penetrated the cavity of the chest—the wound descended almost perpendicularly down<lb></lb>wards—the probe yielded a measurement of an inch and a quarter in depth, but upon my second examination, when I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination from within, I found that the wound had penetrated the cavity of the chest; upon my first examination I was unable to state that—I cannot say to what depth the weapon had penetrated the chest, because upon penetrating the cavity it might have gone the whole length—I should say the whole depth of the solid structures from without inwards would not measure more than an inch and a half, scarcely that—when you had passed through that inch and a half you would get to the cavity of the chest—it had to pass through the integuments, the cellular tissue, and the pleura, which is in<lb></lb>cluded in the cavity at that point—the knife had divided the subclavian artery which crosses that particular spot—it is immediately underneath the integuments at the particular point where it was divided—I have seen the knife produced—I should say that knife would cause the wound I saw—it was placed in my hand for the purpose of ascertaining that fact, and I found that it corresponded exactly with the external and internal appearances—all I can say is that such a knife would have done it, and this knife corresponded with the wound—it might be done with a knife of that shape and size—I did not see the knife the day I went to the house—I saw it afterwards at the police-court; I think on the succeeding day, I am not quite sure—it is a sharp knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it require any force to inflict the wound you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it would require a very sharp blow—the wound was three-quarters of an inch longitudinally—the knife is scarcely as much as that—I have no doubt that in withdrawing the weapon from the wound it must have been with drawn in the same direction—when I had seen the nature of the wound I spoke to the prisoner—I believe I first asked if the deceased was his wife—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "How did it happen; have you been quarrel<lb></lb>ing?"—he said, "No; I had come in to my dinner, and had taken my knife and placed it beside my plate, when she took it up and stabbed her<lb></lb>self"—I understood him to say he had taken his "penknife," but no doubt it was his "pocket-knife"—the wound was not a transverse one—it was in the direction of the apex of the shoulder—there was nothing to indicate whether the edge of the wound was towards the shoulder end of the apex or towards the throat—when the prisoner told me about her having inflicted the wound herself with the knife, I said, "Where is the knife?"—he said, "After she had done it, she threw it away somewhere about the room."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at the wound as you subsequently ascertained it to be upon our <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, its position and direction, was it a wound which in your opinion the deceased could have inflicted upon herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, certainly, she might do so—in order to inflict it herself the blow must have been perpendicular; in this manner (<hi rend="italic">describing it to the Jury</hi>)—on my second <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, examination I found that it had a slight bending back<lb></lb>wards, that is to say the lips of the wound externally and internally did not correspond exactly—it was not precisely vertical—it had an oblique direction, the point going towards the back—I mean the wound within the chest did not exactly correspond with that on the surface.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe when you went in, the room was packed with people? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was quite full—before I could do anything I had to insist upon many persons leaving—when I asked the prisoner to assist me in lifting the deceased his words may have been, "I can't"—my impression is that it was "I won't," but it did not convey to me any idea of refusal any more than a repugnance—there is among persons in the lower class a repugnance to touch a dead body—I believe others did the same thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say she certainly might have inflicted this wound upon herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have seen very many suicidal wounds, and wounds that have not been so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whatever is possible, in your judgment was it probably a suicidal wound or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I looked upon it at my first impression.----</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Answer the question distinctly, if you can; in your judgment was it probably a suicidal wound or not, judging from the wound only, or cannot you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I scarcely apprehend the force of your lordship's inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> One side contend that it was a wound inflicted by the deceased herself which I call a suicidal wound; the other side contend that it was inflicted by the prisoner; whether it were the one or the other is a matter of fact, bat it is also to some extent, as it seems to me, a matter of science; you are a scientific man, and I ask you from your observation of the wound, was it in your judgment probably, without speaking certainly, a self-inflicted wound or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly it is probable.</p>

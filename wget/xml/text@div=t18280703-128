The prisoner keeps a horse and cart, and lives just by the side of our gate-way, next door but one; I did not miss any of the corn, but our gate has been found open at certain times - I have a sack and some corn which was found in the stable where the prisoner's horse stood; the sack belongs to Mr. Hearn, of the King's Arms coach-office - the corn is William Clark's property; he keeps horses in our yard; I do not know that he had corn in that sack - he had some shot in a bin; the prisoner was in his stable feeding a horse when I went in - I took a sample of it, and went to the door to look at them; I then said to the prisoner, "Joe, these are Mr. Clark's oats" - they are a mixture of black and white; it is a mixture which is made by some corn-factors, but by none in our town - they appear to me to be the same as those of Mr. Clark's, and just the same age.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is it unusual to mix white and black oats? A. No; other coach-proprietors may do it.</p>

            . I went to this stable between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 20th of June, and saw John Hill go into the stable of the Crane inn, and bring out a sack about half full; he shut the door, and unlocked the yard gate, which I had locked up - I went into the privy and saw him come to the dung-hill, and give it to the prisoner over the pales; I went and told Mr. Perfect what I had seen, and we went to the prisoner's stable, where we found the corn - Hill went away directly, there was no other corn in the stable but this, which I believe belongs to Mr. Clark - it appeared to be about the same quantity as I saw in the sack; there was not more in the prisoner's stable than one man could carry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark? A. Middling; I could see the prisoner's yard from the privy - it was only a board fence which parted us.</p>

             re-examined. I called Hill, and said to him, "This is a pretty game;" but I did not know whether I should take him - I let them both go; the prisoner slept at home I believe, but went off the next day; when I went to his stable, he did not attempt to conceal anything - I sent for a light, and the corn was standing before the horse; it corresponds with what remained of Mr. Clark's - I inquired the next day, and the people in the town all said, they had no mixed corn; I do not know whether it is usual to feed horses with mixed corn - I have known the prisoner two or three years, and never knew anything amiss of him.</p>

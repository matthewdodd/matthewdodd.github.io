                  </hi>. I am a clothier of Albion-street, Woolwich—I engaged the prisoner two years ago, as a tailor, and he worked for me some time—he left, and applied to me again about seven months ago for employment—I said, "You can travel for me on commission"—I afterwards took a second shop and put him in to manage it, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with furnished rooms, fire, and gas—he received no commission there—about 27th February, some pawn-tickets were brought to me—I think these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner had no authority to pledge any of my property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not mean to say that the Insurance office said that you were robbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You see there was only 407<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods found in my shop injured by water, but not destroyed—I ought to have claimed for 955<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, but I made it for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for damage done to the goods—I was only allowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the goods back which were not damaged by water—the prisoner made out this claim for me—he can read first-rate—he can read printing—I have only one hand and cannot work hard, and he took the goods and furnished the information to a man who wrote it—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced by four pawnbrokers' assistants</hi>) are my property—I know the make of them—I buy them in warehouse—they are all new—there is no particular mark—I only know them by the make, but have no doubt of them—the prisoner sued me in the county court for his wages, but he lost the case—the Judge c<lb></lb>onsidered that he swore falsely.</p>

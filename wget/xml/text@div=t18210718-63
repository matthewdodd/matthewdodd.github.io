            . I am a Lieutenant-General in his Majesty's service. The prisoner was eight years and a half in my service; he left me in March, 1814. I have a married sister named Simpson, the prisoner married her servant, while he was in my service. On being married, his wife and him both came into my service, and went down to Plymouth; and about eight months after, they both left my service together; this was in 1814. From that year, to the present time, I have been mostly in England, except last year, when I was abroad; the prisoner's wife returned into my sister's service about two years and a half ago, as near as I can say - I came to London on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180035"></xptr>the 31st of May, and went to my sister's, and on the 3d of June the prisoner came to the house about four o'clock in the afternoon, and had some conversation with me on the subject of his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. After that conversation, did he go away - A. I opened the door, he was ringing at the door very violent, and told him to go away, but he continued to ring the bell. He was in a state of intoxication; I ordered 
               <persName id="t18210718-63-person621">Hamilton</persName>
             the servant to send for a constable, which he did, and he was taken away, I went out of town to the races, and on the 14th of June, I was at my sister's, and about half past ten o'clock in the morning, I was told the prisoner was there - I went into the hall, and saw him, I went up to him, Hamilton, my sister's servant, stood behind, he looked very wild in the face, but was perfectly sober - I said</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me," he said,</p>
               <p>"You have seduced my wife, and I have proof of it"; I said,</p>
               <p>"On my word and honour, it is false, and if you have proof, produce it." I then told him to go away, and was retiring from him, with my face towards him, and when about three paces distance, I saw him with a long butcher's knife in his left hand, in consequence of which, I stood where I was, and put myself in a posture of defence, with my face directly towards him (I am left-handed and so is he); he then rushed at me with the knife with great violence, rose his hand, and thrust the knife into my right breast, about three inches and a half - it rather stunned me, I did not fall; I recovered again before he made a second thrust; he made several more thrusts at me, which I parried with my hands, and got both hands cut; I was cut in one hand, and stabbed in the other - after that, Hamilton came behind, and pinioned him; we then all three closed and fell together - Sir

             and another servant came, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Describe the injury you received - A. I was stabbed in my right breast (here the General shewed his wound), cut on my right hand, and stabbed in the left; the stab in my breast stunned me a little, but I did not suffer from any of my wounds - I laid down on the bed that afternoon, from the loss of blood, but was not at all unwell from it - I lost twenty or thirty ounces of blood. The whole thing did not last more than a minute and a half - after it was over, he said he was sorry for it; I first saw the knife when he was going to attack me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He served you in India several years - A. He served eight years and a half altogether. I never saw him from the day he left my service, which was in 1814, till the 3d of June. I gave him a written character in 1816, but did not see him then; I was at Plymouth. He married in 1813, his wife and sister both live with my sister - I reside with my sister now; I cannot speak to the state of his mind for the last six years; he parted with his wife two years and a half ago - I do not know the cause. I heard he called on the 3d of June, I saw him on the 3d, 13th, and 14th; his language was very clear and sensible, on the third he was beastly drunk - when this happened, he was sober, he made no attempt to go away, and expressed great sorrow for what he had done. I used no coarse language to him. I might, or might not, have reproached him as a drunken fellow. I understand he has been out of employ some time.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was his contrition expressed after he was secured or before - A. After, and when he saw me bleeding. I have the knife - (producing it).</p>

            . I was at my aunt's, Mrs. Simpson's; heard a noise; came out, and found the prosecutor was on the ground, in the hall, struggling with the prisoner, and Hamilton behind, endeavouring to draw Patmore off - they were almost flat on the ground, and the prisoner was pushing forward towards my uncle on the ground. He was on his body. I could not see whether he had any thing in his hands - he was pushing them forwards, making an attack, striking. I took hold of his right arm, and, with the assistance of Hamilton and another servant, pulled him up. My uncle picked the knife off the floor.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Simpson. On the 14th of June, the prisoner came to my master's house. I opened the door; he came in, and asked if the General was at home. I said he was. He said he wished to see him. I went into the parlour, and told the General 
               <persName id="t18210718-63-person625">Patmore</persName>
             wished to see him. He desired me to tell him to go about his business, he would not see him. I told the prisoner the General would not see him. He said he wanted an answer, Yes or No. I said, the General's answer was, No, he would not see him. The parlour door was not shut too; our voices could be heard. The General came into the hall; the prisoner immediately accused him of seducing his wife. The General said he knew nothing whatever of his wife. The prisoner said he did. The General said he did not, and that he accused him of a thing he knew nothing at all about, and without any proof. The prisoner said he had plenty of proof. The General desired him to fetch his proof, and immediately on that he rushed at him, and struck him on the right side with his left hand; it was a thrust, or punch. I did not see what he had. I seized him by both arms behind - he repeated the thrust several times, perhaps more than three; and, after a short struggle, we all three fell together. Sir

             came out of the parlour, and assisted in getting the prisoner from the General. I did not hear him say any thing after I got him by the arms. When he sat in the hall, after it was over, and the servants were holding him, he said,</p>
               <p>"It has come to something at last." When the General got up, he said</p>
               <p>"He has stabbed me in three places." He was taken into the front hall, and then said</p>
               <p>"It has come to something at last." I did not hear him say he was sorry for it. I fetched a surgeon. The prisoner was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His wife lived with the General's sister - A. Yes; and his sister too.

            . It was not true, but she had desired me not to let him know where she was. He said he should go to Ham after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his sister come up and say,</p>

               <p>"You need not go, it is all a fudge" - A. Not that I know. I believe the sister has a child. I do not know how how old it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, on more than one occasion, that he had heard reports about his wife, and was determined to see her - A. He has said so, and seen her afterwards. He saw her the day after the Sunday that he enquired for her - she was big with child before she left my mistresses house, and was absent a fortnight or three weeks He never asked if the General had ordered me to prevent his seeing her. I never saw his sister's child - I have seen his wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who supplied his wife's place while she was absent - A. A woman was hired, and when his wife returned she remained in the service. He never said to me that he wished to see her, to know who put her in that condition.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time your mistress occupied the General's cottage, where was the General - A. I think he was abroad. Patmore's wife went to the lying-in hospital about last December. I think the General left England in June or July. The sister laid-in four or five months ago, to the best of my knowledge; it may be less. I never denied his wife, or said a word about her by the General's order. He never spoke to me about either of the women. Sometimes Patmore's wife herself, and sometimes her sister, told me to deny her, and sometimes my mistress told me not to admit him into the house, as his wife desired not to see him. She never went to Ham till after this affair. I mean after the stabbing. The Sunday morning that the prisoner came was in the same month that she went to the lying-in hospital.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he saw his wife were they ever together - A. Sometimes in the kitchen, and sometimes in the hall - he staid with her about an hour, and sometimes more - they were sometimes alone. He has come occasionally for more than twelve months, and sometimes twice a-week. He frequently saw her after she was pregnant, and must have known she was so. I never heard him accuse her of behaving amiss.</p>

               <persName id="t18210718-63-person630">Eden</persName>
             in his bed-room. He said he had not examined his wound. There was a great deal of blood on the stairs and on his clothes - it appeared to have flowed down to his breeches; he was agitated. A very considerable swelling had taken place round the wound on the right breast - it appeared to have taken an oblique direction towards the breast-bone. I passed my little finger in, and conceive the wound to be between two and three inches deep - It apppeared that a knife had struck on the ribs, and glanced towards the breast-bone. From the direction it took, it appeared to have been inflicted by the left hand. Had it been struck with the right hand it would most probably have been fatal, as it might have struck the heart - had not the rib obstructed, it would have wounded the lungs, which would have been fatal. The wound on his right hand passed across three fingers, and laid bare the joint of the little finger. The other wound was a stab on the opposite wrist, very near the principal artery of the hand, but it was not opened. Generally speaking, the wounds in the hand would not be dangerous - it depended on the state of body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The wounds on the hand were probably occasioned by the General endeavouring to get the knife from him - A. They might. I was called in about eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner sitting on a bench in the hall, and two persons with him. I examined his head, having understood he had a severe would in the head. I spoke to him - he declined answering my questions.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you form a calculation of the effusion of blood - A. About two pints had been lost. I compared the knife with the wound - it was capable of inflicting it, and the point appeared to be turned as if by striking on the rib.</p>
               <p>GENERAL EDEN re-examined. Q. Have you directly or indirectly had any share in his wife being denied, or in being the cause of it - A. I had not. I was out of England at the time. I never saw his sister till I arrived in England this time. I was absent eleven months the last time. I was never in my sister's house since Patmore's wife lived with her this last time, till I came to England in May last; and while she lived there before I was not there twenty times, and never slept there, and dare say his wife did not see me six times all the while, and that was when she opened the door to me. I never had any intercourse with his wife or sister whatever.</p>

            . My sister is the prisoner's wife. They have been married eight years in August. He came several times to see her, and has seen her. I remember her going to the hospital last year, in the winter. She was cook. I once denied her to him - it was on a week-day. She was then in the house. It was after she was delivered. He was never denied to her before she was put to bed.</p>

            . I have lived with the prisoner a good deal, and slept with him. The latter part of the time he was a good deal disturbed in his mind, and appeared agitated at times. I have known him a year and a half - he was in my father's service, who is a salesman in Leadenhall-market. He left in March. He was capable of doing his business, and knew right from wrong.</p>

I marked them myself; I am not certain whether it was a cross, or down the nose. After searching the hedges and ditches, we found the skin and a head under a hedge; in the ditch of the same field, in consequence of the rain we bad had two or three days previous, I was enabled to trace footsteps from the field the sheep were in, across the farm, on the road which leads from Bull's-cross to Cotton-gate, and down by the side of the road, then across three or four other fields, to the back of some cottages, in one of which the prisoner lives. I cut up one of the footsteps, so as to preserve it; I have the sod here. I compared it with the rest - they were all like it. I also compared it with the prisoner's shoe, before the magistrate; I have his shoe here - I think it exactly fits it. I did not attempt to trace the footsteps farther than his house. I traced them to his house. I missed the sheep on Sunday. Jessopp and Shearing were with me. The prisoner was not at home, his wife was there - I knew her before. We found half a sheep in a closet under the stairs, covered with fire wood; it was cut up in joints; the entrails and feet were left in the skin; the joints of meat were compared with the feet, before the magistrate (Mr. Harvey), on the Monday - they exactly corresponded. The prisoner was taken up directly. We found him in an adjoining cottage, standing talking to his neighbour.</p>

            . I am a constable; I went to search the house, with a warrant, on Sunday, with Mr. Bottomley. I know it to be the prisoner's house. I found half a sheep in the cupboard under the stairs, it was in separate joints. All was wrapped up in a piece of cloth and fire wood put on them. It was not warm, but it had been killed a very short time - the blood was scarcely drained from it. I compared the joints with the skin; the head and feet were left in the skin - the joints answered to the feet. I have the joints here, and produce them. I believe them to belong to the same animal. Some of the bones were split, they were not jointed well. I am convinced it was the same animal. I produce his shoe.</p>

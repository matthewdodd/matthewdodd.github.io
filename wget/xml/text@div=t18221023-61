On the 11th of October, about nine o'clock at night, I was standing in my shop, and heard a pair of shoes snatched from my window, and the string which secured them crack - I looked and missed them off the shew board; they were there a minute before. I ran to the top of the passage, and saw the prisoner running up Porter-street - I called Stop thief! he was stopped in Princes-court. I only lost sight of him for half a minute, while he turned up the court. I cannot swear to him, as I did not see his face until he was stopped. My window was open, and the shoes lay on the board.</p>

About a quarter past nine o'clock at night, I heard the cry, and saw the prisoner running up the court, very fast - shortly after some people turned the corner after him - he was alone. I stopped him; he had passed Webb's door. The prosecutor came up, and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

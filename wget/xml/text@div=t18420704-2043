                  </hi>. I live in Pall-mall East—Robinson was my servant for about two months. On the morning of the 26th of June she came and took the key of my drawing-room off the bed-room table—I afterwards went to my bed-room window, and saw Howe walking up and down, opposite my house, on the other side of the way—she appeared to be watching my house—I continued at the window till I saw her come over, and come in at the street-door—I went down, and saw the drawing-room door open—I immediately wont into the kitchen, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soners—Howe was a stranger—I asked what she was doing in my house—Robinson said she had come to see her—I said it was very strange to come at that time in the morning—it was about a quarter past seven o'clock—she had a basket with a bottle of port-wine, two bundles of wood, and a cut of brown holland, in it—I saw the top of the bottle stick<lb></lb>ing out of the basket, and seeing the wax, I knew it corresponded with the seals of my wine—I matched the cut of brown holland, and it corre<lb></lb>sponds with a piece I had then in the drawing-room—I gave her into custody.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's, and received charge of these things—Robinson said, in Howe's hearing, she had taken the wine and brown holland, that it was the first thing she had ever done, and, if her master would forgive her, she would take her box, and go.</p>

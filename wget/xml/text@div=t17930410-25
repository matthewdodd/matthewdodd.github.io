               <p>Q. What happened before the watch was in your hand? - I was shoved four or five yards before the watch was taken from me; then they had me tight in their arms; I pulled the watch out of my pocket myself, in order to secure it on their attacking me, and I had it in my right hand, and the watch was taken out of my hand by main force, and my wrist bent almost double; my hand was sprained for three weeks, I could not use it; I saved part of the chain, and the seal and the key.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't happen to know whose hand took it? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time it was taken had he hold of you? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen that watch again? - No. I gave about hand-bills and advertised, but I never saw any thing of it. I held Stanton by the collar, the rest went off, and I detained him till the watch came up; he was examined, nothing was found, the watchman examined him directly; the watchman is here; I told the watchman I had lost my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe what sort of a watch it was? - I did not; it was a metal watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now, Mr. Bellchamber, it is well a man should continue in the same story, you have been saying that you had got the watch in your hand, and one of them pulled it out of your pocket; how came you to say before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100031"></xptr>the magistrate that it was taken out of your pocket? - I believe I did not swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. I will read the information to you,</p>
               <p>"you met four or five young men who ran violently against you several times, one of which took the watch out of your pocket." - It was taken wrong the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention a word before the magistrate of this man's laying hold of your arms, while the others robbed you? - I might not say it then, but I know he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined before the magistrate the next morning; then the next morning you must at least have as good a recollection of the matter as you can have now? - I was not asked above four or five questions.</p>
               <p>Q. I think the most material question in the description of a robbery, is how it was committed; there you did not mention a word of his having held you while the other robbed you? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The magistrate asked you how it happened, how came you not to mention that this man enclosed you in his arms while the other robbed you? Because that is a very material circumstance, however you did not mention it there? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now another question; was not this man taken up for an assault on the watchman, and not for your robbery? - No, because I had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you whether the man was not taken to the watch-house on the charge of assaulting the watchman, and not for a robbery on o? - I charged the watchman with him as soon as he came up; I don't know was taken for assaulting the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. But when a man's life is in danger we wish people to be positive; was your charge made before you made it at the watch-house? - I gave charge directly the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you gave charge before you got to the watch-house? - He was taken away immediately as soon as the watchman came up; I said take charge of this man for he has robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you mention a tittle of your being robbed by this man before you got to the watch-house? - Certainly I did, I certainly gave charge of him as one of the people that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was he searched? - In the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. They did not search him on the spot? - They took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that you told the watchman you lost your watch before you got to the watch-house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Will you stand by that that you gave charge of that man, as one of the persons that robbed you before you got to the watch-house? - I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put it in such a way as you shall understand; on your oath did you at all charge this man, as being one of the persons concerned in the robbery before you got to the watch-house? - Yes, I did charge him before I got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you got to the watch-house you had the chain about your finger? - I had it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you mention the circumstance of having lost your watch till the watchman asked the question, from the circumstance of seeing the chain in your hand? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you was perfectly sober at that time? - No, I was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking? - Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. We want to know what time; from five o'clock in the afternoon till one in the morning? - No, not so much as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100032"></xptr>that; it was from about half past nine, and I had been drinking till between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. All that time you had been drinking? - Part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you was so drunk, as not to be able to know what you was about? - I certainly was in liquor a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how far you was got in drunkenness, upon your oath had not you drank till you was perfectly insensible - I was not so bad as that, I own I was very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you answer the watchmens questions that they put to you, had you the power of utterance at that time? - I don't know about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know whether you was able to articulate a word to the watchman? - Yes, I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you was able so to express yourself, as to have your words understood? - I should think I was not so intoxicated as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you was at all sensible of what passed? - I recollect being stopped by them; I recollect going to the watch-house, and seeing the man searched.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give a different account before the magistrate than today, do you think you had got over your drunkenness the next morning? - I was not perfectly sober then, I did not go to bed till between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And the magistrate did not sit till twelve o'clock, and yet you was not perfectly sober then; your situation in life is only that of a waiter? - That is my situation.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of this watch? - I valued it at 4 l. it cost me seven guineas and a half.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Mews the brewer; I don't exactly recollect the night, but I think it was about five or six weeks ago, I had been spending my evening in Maiden lane, Covent Garden, and coming home, I went through the Piazza's, and I saw five or six men surrounding the prosecutor, and I stood for some minutes, I believe ten, and I see them hoist him backward and forward, and several of them struck him; after standing this time I remonstrated with two or three watchmen who stood round, for suffering the man so to be insulted, without interfering. The watchmen then made an appearance and interference, which gave me an opportunity of going in amongst them, I went in, and immediately laid hold of the man, who had been confining the prosecutor by the arms during the whole time of the bustle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner that man? - I think he was; on my taking hold of him, I directly told the watchman to take him to the watch-house, and I would bring the prosecutor; they did with some little difficulty; I got the prosecutor to follow after; I accompanied the prosetor to the watch-house, where he gave charge of him; I did not attend any further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give charge before he came to the watch-house? - No, sir, I gave him into the custody of the watchmen, I did not attend to it any further, I then left him, I might stay there as much as a quarter of an hour after; when I got into the crowd, I observed the prosecutor had got a watch chain in his hand, he said, they had wrenched the watch from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you hear the watchman at the watch-house ask the prosecutor what was become of his watch? - I don't recollect that question.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prosecutor at that time any share of recollection so as to recollect what was past? - He was in a state of intoxication, all the account he gave was that he came out of a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to give any account of the transaction at the watch-house? - No, he only said, he was ill used by the people, that is all that I recollect of the circumstance; he appeared very much in liquor; but the whole of the business seemed to have brought him something to his recollection.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; about half after one, on the 1st of March, there was some people got about Bellchamber here, and the watchmen threw their rattles, and I came up to their assistance, and Mr. Bellchamber had hold of the prisoner, and the prisoner had hold of him by the breast, I asked the prisoner what business he had with him? and he said, what was that to me, he wanted to take care of him, so I told him to go about his business; with that, he made a strike at me at my breast, and I took him out of Mr. Bellchamber's hands, then with that Mr. Wilkins came up, and he said watchman take him away, and take him along to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. While you was in the street did the prosecutor give you any charge of the prisoner? - Yes, he told me to take care of him, for he was one of the people that robbed him of his watch; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined before Mr. Justice Addington at Bow-street? - No, I was not. On this, I was for myself, because I gave charge of him for striking me.</p>

Please your Worship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I had been spending my evening with a few friends, and was going my way home, through the Piazza, Covent Garden, I saw a crowd about the prosecutor, and seeing him a decent man, I thought I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100035"></xptr>take his part; the watchman came up and took me, this watchman said immediately, I saw a man run out of the crowd, and very likely he was the man that robbed him: But however this prosecutor, by the persuasion of other people, thought proper to charge me. I never before this was in the walls of any prison, my name was never known to be amongst suspected persons, and I hope you will find me as innocent as I am conscious I am myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

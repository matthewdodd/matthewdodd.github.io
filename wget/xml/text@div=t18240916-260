I keep my money in a box in the work-shop - it is generally locked. On the 30th of August, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I went to the box - it was then locked, and I believe I left it locked. I missed a 5 l. note from it before half-past eight; it was safe at eleven. The box might have been left open in the course of the day - the prisoner assisted in looking for it, but we could not find it - he went home at night. I saw the note afterwards in the possession of Mrs. King, and knew it.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Nagg's Head public-house, St. Johns-street, very near to Beckwith's - the prisoner frequently came there. On Monday, the 30th of August, about one or two o'clock, he brought a 5 l. note for change, which I gave him - my husband endorsed the note in my presence - I know his writing. I gave it to the officer (looking at it) this is it - it has his writing on it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday evening, the 1st of September, I apprehended the prisoner coming through Smithfield, riding on an ass. I took him to the watch-house, and asked who the ass belonged to; he said to a man in Turnstile - he afterwards said, voluntarily, that it was his own - that he bought it for 30 s. I found 13 s. on him, and asked him where the rest of the 5 l. was; he said he had bought a saddle and bridle for 16 s. 6 d.; also six trusses of hay, and had paid a month's rent for a stable for the ass - that he had changed the note at King's, and bought the ass with the money - I have the note.</p>

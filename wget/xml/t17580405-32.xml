I found he had got some wire to neal in the furnace, I gave it him; he ask'd me for a candle, I said, I had never a one; he said he would go down into the foundery shop, he went; I went to go there, and there was

            : I ask'd him if Bray had any wire a nealing in the furnace, he said no. Soon after, I saw a light in the surff-cellar, a place where we put old brass: soon after came the prisoner out and shut the door after him, and set down the candle; his apron was full of something. I set Mills to watch him: soon after Mills came and said he was gone away; I sent Mills after him, who brought him back with about fifteen pounds weight of brass, call'd yellow metal about him; some in his pockets, and some in his apron, which he emptied before us in the shop, and said he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Alderman Alexander in the foundery. I came to work about six o'clock, and Bray was in the shop with a candle, he came up and put the candle down, and went out of the shop. Mr. Milward ordered me to follow him, I did, and ask'd him what he had got in his apron? He said, he had got some tin; I said where are you a going with it, he answer'd I am coming back soon. I put my hand into his apron, and found it to be yellow brass. I made him come back along with me into the foundery, and got a thing and emptied it into from out of his apron and pockets. We took him before a justice, he told him he could not deny it, when charg'd with stealing it, and said he was very sorry for it. (It was Mr. Alexander's property.)</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this to be Mr. Alexander's property?</p>
               <p>Mills. He had nothing in his apron when he went down into the surff cellar, and there is nothing else there but such brass, the property of Mr. Alderman Alexander.</p>

               <p>It was none of the Alderman's property; my wife bought it and I brought it with me to the shop, in order to sell it as other people do, and I went out to get a penny worth of purl for myself, and said I'd be back presently. No, said Mills, you shall come back along with me, with all my hear said I; and he took it away out of my apron. They took me the next morning before the justice, and ask'd me what I had to say for myself. I said, I was sorry they should bring me to that place, I never was before I justice in my life before. I have work'd in the shop almost ten years, please to ask these two witnesses my character.</p>

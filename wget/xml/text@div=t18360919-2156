                  </hi>. I am a pig-dealer, and live at Bradingham, in Nor<lb></lb>folk, which 101 miles from London. I turned my horse out on the 16th of September, between six and seven o'clock, into a field near my house, which I rent; and when I went in the morning it was gone—the prisoner has lived in our parish several years, and knew my horse—he has seen me with it—it is a pony, about 13 hands high—I was sent for to town, and came last Monday, and found my horse in the posses<lb></lb>sion of a witness and the officer.</p>

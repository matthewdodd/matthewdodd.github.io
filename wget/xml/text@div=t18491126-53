                  </hi>. I am housekeeper and lady's-maid, in the service of Mr. Robert Towers, of 22, Chester-square. Ann Clark was in his employ<lb></lb>ment, and used to come there in the morning, work there in the day, and go away at night. About three weeks before I was before the Magistrate, I</p>

               <p>missed some lace and muslin which I had. given her to work with—she denied having taken anything—I sent for her mother (the prisoner Caroline), and she said the girl was quite honest—I afterwards went with the prisoner to the mother's house in Orford-street, and, in a table-drawer there, found two forks, one knife, one spoon, and some towels, which belonged to Mr. Towers, but which I had not missed, and found some articles which I had missed in the mother's box—I never saw the mother there—I had never been there before—the box was in her room—she used to work for Mrs. Towers in her own house—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); they are Mr. Towers's property.</p>

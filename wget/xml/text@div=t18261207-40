On the 2d of December about half-past two o'clock, I went up stairs to answer the dining-room bell, and as I came down to the foot of the stairs, I observed some one in the knife-house, which is part of the dwelling-house, and joins it; his back was towards me. I went into the knife-house, and found it was the prisoner - he had these two patent brass lamps in a basket, which was on the ground, before him; there were a few lemons in the basket; he turned round with two lemons in his hand, and asked if I wanted any lemons; I had put the lamps on a shelf in the knife-house before - he could reach them down; I asked what he was going to do with the lamps - he said, "Nothing at all;" I collared him, and called Edgar, the porter, to fetch the beadle. The lamps belonged to Mr. Penny; I am certain they are worth full 3l. - I do not know what they cost; they are large lamps, with two burners each; I think them worth between 3l. and 4l. I am certain they are worth more than 40s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is there a back-door to the house? A. Yes - there is a side-door, which we call the back-door; he must have entered at that door. One lamp alone is worth 40s. I did not value them at Hatton-garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-manufacturer, in Nelson-street, Finsbury. The prisoner was my foreman two years—in Feb. last I left town, and left the prisoner in charge of my business—I returned to town on Good Friday, went to my business on the following Monday, and the prisoner was not there—he has never returned since—I examined my stock, and missed six pairs of silver watch-cases, twelve gold watch-cases, five gold dials, four gold Geneva watches, and one silver watch—I had seen them safe in Feb., before I left town—I went to Mr. Wood's shop, and there saw the eighteen watch-cases, and the four gold watches—I next saw the prisoner last Saturday afternoon, in one of the Courts at Westminster, in custody.</p>

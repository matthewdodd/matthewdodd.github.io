               <p>Q. Was it in the foot-path in the road, or across the fields? - A. Across the fields; a good distance from any road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a field through which there was a foot-path, or not? - A. There was a foot-path.</p>
               <p>Q. A common footpath for Kingsland? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it? - A. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner met me, and asked me for my money.</p>

               <p>Q. He had not taken it out before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open? - A. I did not see the blade.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a knife? - A. Yes; I saw the handle of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a large or a small one? - A. It was a smallish handle; I put my hand in my pocket to feel for my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put your hand in your pocket then for your money, when you had not done it before? - A. I suppose I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you take out? - A. A half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it him? - A. No; I threw it down upon the ground, he stooped to pick it up, and I made off for Kingsland; I thought he was coming after me, I looked round, and saw him running away; I turned back, and cried stop thief, murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing more said by him before you left him? - A. Yes; he asked me for more, when I threw the money down; I said I had no more; he asked me for a seven-shilling-piece; I said, I have got no seven-shilling-piece, you villain; that was all that passed till I called stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a seven-shilling-piece? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this transaction take up? - A. Not much more than a couple of minutes, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whether the prisoner is the person or not? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you run after him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body stop him? - A. No, I did not; he got over the hedge, and the people pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was he taken? - A. I believe, about five minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him about five minutes afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon your money by which you could know it? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were a great deal alarmed, I take it for granted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you threw your money upon the ground, are you able to say whether he had taken out his knife? - A. I am positive he had taken a knife out of his pocket before I put my hand in my pocket.</p>

Yes; I heard a loud cry of stop thief, murder; I saw the prisoner and the lady, she was running after him, and he was running away from her; I came up to the lady, and asked her if that was the man that had robbed her; she said, yes, it was a man in a smock srock, and sore eyes; I then ran towards the prisoner, there were people nearer then I was; I cut across another field, and met him just as he was taken, he had got over the bank; I returned to meet the lady, and asked her what she was robbed of; she told me four shillings; I saw something in his pocket, and took it from him; it was an oyster-knife and a sheath.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not a clasped knife? - A. No; the knife was in his right-hand breeches-pocket, and the sheath in his left; he put his hand to his left-hand pocket, and gave me the sheath, and said, you may as well take that with you.</p>

             sworn. - I was in my own house, about a furlong from this field, and heard a cry of stop thief; I immediately ran out of the house, and saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any woman? - A. No, I did not; Mr. Elliot and I pursued him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him, did you observe him do any thing? - A. In the scussle we tumbled both together; he had got one of his hands shut, we were going to lay hold of his hand, when he drew his hand back, and threw some money against the pales; I immediately picked up a sixpence, a young man got over the pales and gave me a half-crown over, I saw him pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that to the pales? - A. It might be a yard off.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing happen in the taking of him? - A. He had not an opportunity; I collared him, and Atwell pushed out of his own house immediately and assisted me; I saw his hand closed, I said to Atwell, he has got something in his hand; I endeavoured to open his hand, and he threw himself upon the ground in the struggle; Atwell then left me and picked up some money, while I held the prisoner upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else picked up? - A. No, I did not; I heard of a half-crown being picked up, but I did not see it; I did not see the knife taken from him, but I saw the sheath; he said, you may as well take this with it; that was while I held him by the collar.</p>

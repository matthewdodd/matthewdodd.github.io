               <p>Q. You say the prisoner boarded with you - did he come back wards and forwards as usual - A. No; I did not see him till the 2nd of December, then I met Wogan about seven o'clock in the evening in Chiswell street; I told him he was the man I wanted; he said what did I want him for; I told him I wanted the property that he had robbed me of, and the money he owed me; he told me it I would let him have his liberty he would pay me the money he owned me, he had got none of my property but the umbrella; I asked him why he did not come to his meals as usual; he said because he was afraid I would put him in prison; I told him if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110014"></xptr>was not guilty of robbing me, why not come and help to find the thief that did rob me; he told me that he had left the umbrella with the woman that he had slept with the night before; he told me the place: I went there and found it. I have never seen any of the other things. My husband and I took him to Worship street office.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home on the evening of the 4th of November, was your room door locked - A. Yes, and the key left with the landlady below; when they came home they asked for the key, it was given them.</p>

            . I lived servant with Mrs. Pink when she kept the Nag's head public house, Whitecross street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Wogan - A. Yes, I have seen him often at that house, before Mrs. Pink removed from the public house. On the 5th of November he came into the tap room with an umbrella in his hand, and asked me for a needle to repair it; I gave him a needle, he could not make use of the needle, he asked me to repair it for him; I did; he said it belonged to the captain's daughter, he should get anger if he did not repair it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else that he had - A. Only a watch that he had in his pocket; I did not particularly observe the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that umbrella that you mended - A. I do; here is the place that I mended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When it was rainy I was in the habit of borrowing the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pink. That is the umbrella that was in my possession; I never allowed him to make use of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Sindall ever come back to you again - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The night before this affair happened Mr. and Mrs. Pink, Sindall and me, went to the play; I had the umbrella the night before; I was going home, I left them close to Smithfield; Mrs. Pink said, I shall not be at home tomorrow, I am going to my sister's child christening, there is some cold shoulder of mutton in the cupboard. The next morning I went to the Nag's Head with the umbrella about one o'clock in the afternoon; I went to Mrs. Pink's, I went up stairs and knocked at the door, no answer was given to me; I went and asked the landlady it any body was at home, she said she did not know, there had been a great many people up and down; I borrowed five pence of the landlady, I told her I should go to the Bell. When I was at the Bell Sindall came in, he said he heard me knocking, he told me had the landlord of the Three Pigeons in the room, and a woman of the name of Lawson; he and I went to Mrs. Pink's room, and when I was going I said I would lock the door and take the key down to the landlady; he said no; I went down stairs, and saw no more of Sindall till the Saturday morning; going down Whitecross street I met Sindall with Mrs. Pink's great coat on his back; he said he was going home; I have never seen him since, I went to the house on the Monday; neither Mrs. Pink nor the landlady was at home; I met the landlady, she told me of this, and told me Mrs. Pink would prosecute me. I being innocent, was afraid of being put in prison; when I went with Mrs. Pink to the office there was no officer to prevent me from going away. If I had a mind to resist I might.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Had you been to the play the night before - A. Yes; they went to the play with us; Sindall and the prisoner had the use of the umbrella; I took it from them when we parted in Smithfield.</p>

            . I live in Gloucester court, Whitecross street; I have known the prisoner eight years, or rather better. Mrs. Pink came to me and informed me of the robbery on the day following; she told me that the other young man had robbed her, she did not suspect that the prisoner was the person; she asked me if I had seen him; I told her I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say upon your oath that she said she did not suspect him - A. Yes, she said so several times.</p>
               <p>Q. But she wanted to know where he was - A. Yes. I told her I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the prisoner the last time - A. On the Saturday morning, as I saw Mrs. Pink in the evening; I saw him about ten days afterwards; I went to Mrs. Pink's house, she was not at home; I left word with the landlady I had seen him; Mrs. Pink told me that she had been down to the father and mother of the young man, that his father said he had a watch in his pocket and a bundle; he had one of Mr. Pink's shirts on, and one of the pair of stockings in the bundle was marked in full length with his name, and that a gentleman at his father's asked him what the watch cost; he said two pounds, and that he had another watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of that umbrella - A. That umbrella was left with my landlady in the room below and a letter for Mrs. Pink; I delivered it into Mrs. Pink's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Pink, in fact had you been down after the other man Sandell - A. Yes, at his father's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you traced a number of things into his possession - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you had good reason to suspect that the other man Sandell was in possession of a number of things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told that young woman so - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never found the things, you only heard it from the father of Sandell - A. I only heard it from him.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 13th of February, the prisoner came in, and desired to see some handkerchiefs; she looked at some, and borrowed a pair of spectacles to look at them; she offered me two-and-twenty pence, and I shewed her some others, and she went out of the shop: I missed one piece, and I pursued and saw her three doors from the shop; I told her to come back, and she should have one. I perceived she had something below her left arm behind her cloak, and as she was going into the shop, she dropped ten handkerchiefs; two witnesses saw her drop them, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take them at all? - I did not suspect her in the least.</p>
               <p>What did she say for herself? - She said she was very innocent; what did we mean by accusing her with taking handkerchiefs, she knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Have you since enquired who she is? - No.</p>

               <p>Was it possible it should catch about any part of her clothes and attach, and then drop as she went out? - It is not possible, without my perceiving it.</p>

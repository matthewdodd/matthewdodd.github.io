               <p>The Council for the King opened the Indictment, informing the Gentlemen of the Jury, that this Indictment was brought against the Defendants, to prevent a growing  <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> the Nation groans under, and that   diminishing the Currant Coin of the Kingdom   they hoped to prove that the Defendants had agreed with several Persons, to sell them broad Money.</p>
               <p>Then the Witnesses  for the King were called, the first of which was   Matthews, who being sworn, deposed, That he being a Receiver of the Publick Money of the Kingdom at the Town of Tosecter in Northamptonshire, one Mr. Gore, a Shopkeeper of that Town came to him and told him, That he had a Friend at London, (a Merchant) whom he did not Name, that would gave him 5 l. per Cent. for every hundred Pound of broad Money he should procure, but desired that the Mill'd Money might be left out. Upon this, Mr. Matthews writ a Letter to the Lords of the Treasury, and acquainted their Lordships with the same, who ordered him that he should go on and deal with the said Gore, on purpose to find out the design; he at first let them have 100 l. then 200 l. and so on.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Gore was sworn, who deposed, That there was 1100 l. put into a Coach at the Bell-Inn in Friday-street, which he had received of Mr. Matthews and in this Coach Mr. Gore went by Mr. Howard's appointment to the Nags Head Tavern in Cheapside and there another Person met him, who he saw only by the glance of the Candle, so could not tell who it was, and the Coach being dogged by a Person on purpose, several Bags were seen to be deliver'd at the House of Mr. M - ; but it was not proved that Mr. M - was any wise privy to the matter, and Howard being absconded, so that the Evidence did not come up to prove any thing against either of the two Persons thus indicted</p>
               <p>And Mr. M - brought a great number of Credible Persons (both Merchants and Traders) of the City of London, who declared, That he was a fair and honest Dealer; and particularly, that a certain Person once brought an Ingot of Silver to him to sell, which he might have had for half the value, but refused it, and stop'd the Person who offered it, sent the Owner word of the same. Others said, That he never was known to pay bad Money in his Dealing, but as good as other Men did. So after a long Trial they were both <rs id="t16950403-33-verdict131" type="verdictDescription">

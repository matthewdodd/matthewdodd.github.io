               <p>MR. ARTHUR WIGGAN. I live on Dowgate-hill. On the 5th of October, between twelve and one o'clock, I was looking in at a print shop, in <placeName id="t18221023-51-crimeloc279">Sweeting's-alley</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18221023-51-crimeloc279" type="placeName" value="Sweeting's-alley"></interp>

I had seen the prisoners standing close to me at the shop - they were about three yards from me when the gentleman gave me the information - I laid hold of Franks and charged him with it - he denied it - I left him, as there were people to take care of him, and laid hold of Brown - he denied it; my handkerchief was picked up immediately after, close to the spot - the person who found it was about two yards from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was in a public part of the street - A. It is a very crowded place; several people were looking at the shop.</p>
               <p>MR. B. W. PIKE. I am a dry salter, and live in Miles's-lane. I was in Sweeting's-alley, and saw the prisoners acting in such a manner as to draw my attention, and in about a quarter of an hour I saw them immediately behind Mr. Wiggan, who was looking at the prints - one stood against each pocket. Brown had both his hands engaged, twisting a piece of paper round his thumb - Franks had his hands before him, close to Mr. Wiggan's pocket. Immediately on their quitting Mr. Wiggan, I went and asked him to feel in his pocket, and he missed his handkerchief. The prisoners were accosted about three yards from the spot, and at the end of the alley Franks ran away; I pursued him to the end of Bartholomew-lane - I had lost sight of him for a moment - I ran back, and at the end of Sweeting's-alley I saw him walking; I immediately touched him and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man," and in a moment an officer came up and took him. The handkerchief was picked up five or six yards from the shop - it was utterly impossible for any persons to have done it but the prisoners. I placed myself behind the corner of the windows, and had a perfect view of their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FRANKS. Q. Did you see me run, when in Sweeting's Alley - A. Yes; within three or four yards of the end of the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear positively who took the handkerchief - A. No, because they covered each other's operations. I did not see it taken or dropped. Three or four persons were round the shop, I will not swear there was not six, there was not seven; they were respectable persons. Brown did not take it.</p>
               <p>

            . I am street-keeper. I was on duty at the North Gate; heard a cry of stop him - turned towards Sweeting's Alley, and saw Brown running; he was stopped in Threadneedle-street, before I could get up to him. Franks was brought to me, and one Samuel delivered me the handkerchief. The prisoners were much agitated, and begged hard to be let go. Brown was stopped between the corner of Bartholomew-lane, and the Cock, tavern.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. WIGGAN. Q. Did you not say you seized 
               <persName id="t18221023-51-person568">Brown</persName>
             a short distance from the window - A. Yes, the witness is mistaken, it was Franks that run, not Brown. I took Franks, but left him, and took Brown; then went again after Franks; he might have run, while I was away.</p>

            . I am sure Brown was running, when I turned round.</p>
               <p>MR. PIKE. I saw Franks running, but did not see Brown run; I had my eye on him for five minutes. I did not see him get from the persons round him, for I was engaged running after Franks; he might have run during that time.</p>
               <p>BROWN'S Defence. I walked away about six yards from the shop. Mr. Pike came up and said,</p>
               <p>"You are one of them." I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" Mr. Wiggan said I had got the handkerchief; he laid hold of me, and I was taken down to Bartholomew-lane - and about the middle of the lane, Bradey came up. I never run, for I was not let go.</p>

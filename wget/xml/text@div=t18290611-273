            ; he had no complaint for months before the 10th of May, that I know of; we were always together, and I should have known if he had - his last severe illness was last Christmas twelve months; he at times said his inside was a little out of order: for a week before the 10th of May he stated himself to be better in strength and spirits than he had been for months - I lived next door to him: he came to me on the 10th of May, about five minutes before he went out, and asked the way to Golden-square - I told him; I went out for about three hours, and when I returned he was at home, lying on the sofa, so unwell; he could not rise without assistance - this was between one and two o'clock: I persuaded him to get up and come down to dinner, in order to rally him, but he hardly took any thing; he appeared in great pain, and great agitation - towards five o'clock he got so extremely ill that I persuaded him to go to bed, and helped him up stairs - he got gradually worse; I got Dr. Lloyd about eight o'clock that evening; he died on the Saturday morning following - from the time he took to his bed he was certain he should not live, and arranged his affairs; he said he should never recover - he said nothing more than that, as to the certainty of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had Mr. Lloyd been attending your brother for any length of time? A. Not for two months; he then paid Mr. Lloyd two or three visits; he had a depression of spirits in consequence of the death of his wife - there was nothing the matter with him at this time; his inside had been out of order - that was set right by a little medicine: I believe Mr. Lloyd wrote for him - his wife died of a complication of diseases- I have heard she had some stoppage in her inside, what it was I cannot say, and there was a tumor also. I attended the Coroner's Inquest; Mr. Van Butchell was not there - the verdict was returned without his being there: no proposal was made to delay it till he could he sent for; an attorney came from Mr. Van Butchell, and requested to see my brother's body, on Friday, when it was too late - he came about three hours before the funeral: the friends were all assembled, and the body fastened down; Mr. Van Butchell was taken into custody on the day of the Inquest(Wednesday); we refused to grant a view of the body, as it was fastened down, and not in a fit state to be opened - I saw Mr. Lloyd after the Inquest; I know of no application being made for a surgeon to see the body till the Friday I mention; if any body had come to see it on behalf of Mr. Van Butchell in proper time, he should have seen it; I did not say if I had the Coroner's authority they might see it - a paper was brought with a request from the Coroner, the day after the funeral.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether your brother had walked from Golden-square? A. He walked to the first coach-stand, and rode the rest of the way.</p>

            . I live in Frederick's -place, Old Jewry, and am a surgeon. I called on the deceased about the 8th or 10th of May, and found him in a state of great depression of mind and body, apparently suffering great uneasiness; he complained of great uneasiness in the abdomen, and greater pain in the lower part, towards the left side - he said, "I am aware I have received such an injury in my bowels as I shall not recover;" my opinion from an examination of him, and from his report of an operation he had undergone, was that his bowels were seriously injured: I stated that I considered his life in a very uncertain state, but that at that moment it was impossible for me to say what injury he had sustained: independent of the injury he had received, there were not those symptoms to lead me to suppose he must necessarily die; I had several conversations with him - I endeavoured to encourage him, but his expression always was, he believed he should not recover. On the evening of his decease I examined his body, and found the whole of the abdomen very much extended, and on cutting it I found it arose from gas; the contents of the abdomen altogether exhibited appearances of inflammation: the general appearance of the covering of the viscera was that of recent inflammation - the parts were gathered together by a sort of lymph and serum, mixed with flakes of lymph in the cavity of the abdomen: the appearances of inflammation were greater in the lower part of the abdomen, and on endeavouring to examine the upper part of the rectum, I found such inflammation had gone on to that part, that another portion of the intestine was adhering to it - I was anxious to examine that part particularly, and as some injury might be occasioned by removing the parts at once from the body, I examined them in their natural situation; for that purpose it was necessary to separate a portion of the intestines, which was adhering to it - I did so, and at once perceived the rectum had been perforated, so that its cavity, and that of the abdomen were injured - I proceeded to remove the injured part from the body, and the portion of the intestines that adherred to it; I was then enabled to examine them more particularly, and was then confirmed in my opinion, that it was occasioned by violence, and not by disease; I have subsequently examined them again and again, and am the more fully confirmed in my opinion; any uneven instrument being introduced would have produced this injury, whether sharp or blunt - I have here a straight clyster-pipe, six inches long, by which a similar accident was occasioned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q.Who occasioned that accident? A. A nurse in the hospital - the patient died: on pressing the lower part of the deceased's abdomen he complained of pain - I found the peritonoeum considerably inflamed; his feeling a tenderness there, was not a decisive criterion of a peritonoeal inflammation - I was con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110115"></xptr>vinced he was not suffering from peritonoeal inflammation to any extent when I first saw him - it came on afterwards; he was bled two successive days - I generally prescribe only, but I did bleed him on the Tuesday; he had a dozen leeches on the Sunday - they usually take about half an ounce each, but the quantity is uncertain; leeches were again applied on Monday, and I think twice that day - I bled him in the arm on Tuesday, till he was faint, which is the only good rule to bleed by in such cases; I should think I took sixteen ounces or eighteen ounces, but will not undertake to say positively - I bled him again next day in the arm; on examination after death, I found the upper part of the rectum adhering to some of the smaller guts - I had used a cutting instrument to open the body; I took the part out, partly with my hand, and partly with a cutting instrument; I found the adhesion before that - I separated the smaller intestines from the large, with my hand - the rectum, in my opinion, varies in different individuals from seven to eight inches - in my opinion, decidedly not ten inches; it is a continuation of the large gut.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the distance from the anus to the part where the adhesion was, seven or eight inches? A. Not in a straight line, it would be little more than four inches to the upper part of the rectum; the gut lays round in a curved situation - if the rectum was taken out of the cavity, in which it lays, it is much longer, but a straight instrument, could only go in a straight direction; I did not take away any part of the gut in separating them; where the inflammation is of recent duration, it could not be done - I separated them gently with my hand; I doubt the possibility of doing it, if the inflammation had been of long standing; it was almost impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. If you wanted to examine the rectum, and parts adjacent, would not the right course have been, to have taken them out, and infuse water into them, to see where the injury was? A. I never adopted that course - if I could not discover it, it would be necessary to use other means, but here it was quite obvious, generally speaking - from two inches and a half to three inches of the intestine is in contact with the bladder: when distended the bladder is much higher up, it depends on the size of the bladder - when it is distended, it extends quite above the rectum; the injury was about four inches from the anus, in a straight line - if an instrument had gone in a backward direction, it would have gone against the back-bone or bladder, but in a front direction it would not; a cellular membrane fills up the space between the bladder and rectum - in my judgment it would not be safe to pass a straight gauge, six inches long, if made of uneven materials; it is not within my knowledge that any regular surgeons introduce such an instrument as an uneven gauge - there are flexible metallic gauges; I never saw an uneven one, six inches long, introduced - I have seen a pliable one used; I have for years paid particular attention to the disease of the rectum.</p>
               <p>Q. I should like to know how many patients you may have had under your care in those cases? A. I have been in large practice for many years, and cannot tell you within one or two hundred; I include strictures and those sort of complaints - I cannot tell how many cases of stricture of the rectum I have had; I never saw Mr.

             before to-day - I attended the inquest, but left when I had given my evidence; I did not suggest to the Coroner the propriety of sending for the person who performed the operation - I had nothing to do with it; Mr. Salmon called, and told me he was going to examine the body - I replied,</p>
               <p>"I have the parts here that are injured, and you can see them," and it was no use his going to see the body, as I had the parts; I had taken them out on the evening of the day he died - it was by day-light, between seven and eight o'clock, I think; we were a good while about it, and as the part, in its natural situation, lay in a cavity, I had a candle to put into that cavity, that I might better examine them - in my opinion the rectum is not ordinarily ten inches long, decidedly not; parts of the body vary according to the height of an individual, but in the average number of cases it is not ten - it possibly may be so in some individuals; the cavity of the rectum is usually strong and thick compared to the smaller intestines.</p>
               <p>Q.From the anus for the first four inches is it not natuturally straight? A. I should say not; the principal curve is that of the lower part of the back bone - the intestines in their natural state may be dilated very much, but when inflamed they cannot.</p>

               <p>Q.Suppose the patient was on his knees, and his head down to the floor, would not the rectum be straighter than if in another position? A. I should think it possible, the lower part might be, but the other part would be still more curved; I have put a patient in that position merely to examine the state of the prostrate glands, and to examine if their was a stricture in the rectum, but not commonly - the cerum in the cavity would arise from inflammation, which would cause the smaller part of the gut to adhere; inflammation of some standing, at times, produces ulceration - I do not think I had seen the deceased for more than three months before; he then consulted me for the piles, which is a disease in the lower part of the rectum - operations fail at times, when performed by the most regular surgeons: I remember the case of Mary Kent, at the hospital - I removed her breast when she was in a state of pregnancy; she died soon afterwards - it was a tumor I removed.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have had more experience since that, do you consider you acted right? A. I still consider it doubtful, for I have heard it discussed in medical societies, and heard different opinions; many think it was wrong, but allow me to say she died of a disease she had had several times before, and whether it arose from the operation it is impossible to say - she did not die from the operation clearly; I found the deceased's liver slightly diseased. I am a member of the College of Surgeons; Mr. Smith, who assisted me in the examination, is not so.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing the rectum had been perforated, would not the consequence have been very acute pain, and an inability to walk or stir? A. With such an operation as this I should say not immediately - it would cause great pain and faintness, but I consider the pain would not be longer than the faintness; he would be able to walk, for I saw a person who walked from Islington in a worse situation, with part of his bowels hanging out - that was not with a hole in the rectum.</p>
               <p>Q. If the cellular membrane had been perforated as well as the rectum, would not blood flow? A. I think very little; I am unable to say whether any would have ap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110116"></xptr>peared externally, if the operation be performed by a blunt instrument - if the bladder was perforated it is uncertain whether there would have been blood: I think it more probable that there would not - if blood had flown, I think it most probably would have gone to the intestines; it depends entirely on where the vessel was wounded - there was evidence of active inflammation having gone on about the parts; I did not use any injection when there was a difficulty in getting the bowels to act - I said the proper thing to be done was a clyster, but as I believed the bowels were perforated, if an injection was thrown up, it would destroy the patient at once.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have the injured parts here? A. I have; I attribute the death to the inflammation arising from the injury of the rectum. The case of Mrs. Kent occurred within the last twelve months - will you, as an observation made will tend to insinuate I did not treat the patient right, permit me to say the reason bleeding was not had recourse to at first, was his being in such a state of great bodily and mental depression, that it would have caused instant death.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You adopted the best means in your judgment? A. I did.</p>

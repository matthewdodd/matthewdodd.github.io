             sworn. - I was married to the deceased on Oct. 16, 1787, and she went from me on the King's birth-day last to cohabit with the prisoner; on last Tuesday morning, between three and four o'clock, she came to my watch-box (I am a watchman,) she asked me if I had seen the prisoner; she said she would go home, signifying to the prisoner's house, and I saw no more of her that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her afterwards? - A. On the same day she was with me in <placeName id="t18050529-38-crimeloc208">Little Chesterfield-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was he sober, or how? - A. He was not sober, nor much advanced in liquor; he said he would serve me the same, or any body that seemed to take her part.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour was this? - A. I believe it was past twelve; then the deceased came out of the tap-room with me, and said she was very hungry, she said she would get something to eat; then we went from the Globe to the Nottingham Arms; I believe it was near three o'clock when we went away from there; we had some eggs and two pints of beer there, and at the Globe we had a pint of ale between three of us; we went home from the Nottingham Arms about three o'clock; I saw what temper the prisoner was in; I advised her to stay with me till his passion was over; I persuaded her to lay down, I being a watchman, and having been up all night.</p>
               <p>Q. She was perfectly sober, was not she? - A. Yes, she was sober; we went to-bed at near four o'clock in the afternoon; I went to sleep directly, I was tired, I had had no rest from the Saturday till the Tuesday; about half past six, or near seven o'clock, I awoke by a violent shriek, and when I looked up I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to-bed did you fasten your door? - A. I locked it, and by the request of the deceased I put the key on the table, in case the prisoner came, that he should not come in; when I awoke by the shriek, I observed the prisoner standing by my bed-side, on the side my wife laid; I observed the prisoner standing in this attitude (in a boxing posture) over the deceased; I immediately jumped up, and seized him; we had a great scuffle, and we fell down two or three times together in the fire-place, and once across the foot of the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife in bed at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of you fall, so as to fall upon her? - A. We both fell down on the floor together; I saw the complexion of the deceased change, and her lips turn black; the moment I got up I called for the people to come in, and to get medical assistance (the door being open,) and for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you called where was the prisoner? - A. Seated in a chair, he never attempted to escape; in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, the surgeon came; he ordered a pail of boiling water, and what he thought necessary; the prisoner asked the surgeon if she was dead, and he said, yes; I bathed her feet with hot water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the surgeon inquire whether any body had struck the deceased? - A. I do not recollect, I was in such trouble then; after this the peace-officer came, and secured us both.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time do you recollect whether any blow was given to the deceased? - A. Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased, after you awoke, explain to you, or in the hearing of the prisoner, what was the occasion of her shriek? - A. She neither so much as sighed or breathed after I awoke.</p>
               <p>- MOTT sworn. - I am a surgeon: On Tuesday, the 28th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was called by two women, who are witnesses in Court, to go to the deceased, understanding from them the deceased had received some injury. When I came into the room, I saw the deceased lying on the outside of the bed; on examining the body, I found little or no signs of life; I bled the deceased in the neck; I attempted to bleed her in the arm and on the temple, but without success; I directed her legs to be bathed in warm water, but without effect, the deceased being too far gone to be recovered by the means that I made use of; I then inquired what had been done, by the people standing at the door, or how the deceased came by her death. The prisoner was sitting in the chair near the window; I asked the husband, in the hearing of the prisoner, whether the woman had been struck; the husband said he had done it, pointing to the prisoner, who was sitting in the chair; I then asked the prisoner whether he had struck her; he said, O yes, I have done it, striking his forehead with his hand; I asked him where he had struck her; he said, Oh! I know nothing about it, waving his hands; I then said, you must secure this man, and send for a constable; he said, Oh, certainly I will be secured, and several expressions of the same effect; I then left the house, he made no attempt to escape. In about three quarters of an hour I was sent for again by one of the officers of Bow-street, they imagined she was alive; I examined her, but found no symptoms of life. On Wednesday, by the direction of Mr. Lee, the Magistrate, I opened the body, although I found no marks of violence on the exterior of the body, but on opening the cavity of the chest I found abundant marks of bruises or concussion; there was extraversated blood in the minute vessels of the parts in the cavity of the chest; I found no other marks of violence within the body but that, and from that I suspected there had been some injury done to some more vital part; I then proceeded to examine the head; I opened the head, and found a great deal of blood again, extraversated over the surface of the brain, which I do imagine to be the immediate cause of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290027"></xptr>her death - I do believe that the blood found on the surface of the brain was owing to the violence done to her chest - I do believe a blow may be so given as to cause death, although no external marks should appear: the parts being covered by blankets and a sheet, the injury might have been sufficient to destroy the woman's life, without these appearances on the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blow appear to have been given? - A. On the right side of her breast; I found no outward marks, I found evident marks of injury within; the blow given on the side, occasioned a violent spasm of the heart, or more important organs of life, that would be sufficient to force the blood so upon the vessels of the brain, as to produce the appearances that were seen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are of opinion that the blow on the breast caused that extraversated blood on the brain, and that blow was the cause of her death? - A Certainly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it is not possible that a person awoke from her sleep by the breaking in of the door, and finding a man standing by the bed-side, might not that surprize occasion the appearances in the head as you found in that head? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if they might, what should you have said was the cause of her death? - A. I then should have said that the appearances on the brain was the cause of her death from sudden fright, or sudden surprize; I should have considered these symptoms sufficient to produce death, but then I cannot account for the symptoms which appear on the side; stating it in the light in which your Lordship has stated it, I should have considered those symptoms sufficient, had I not found those which I had seen in the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you say, the symptoms in her head were the immediate cause of her death? - A. They were the immediate cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard of a case of two persons fighting, and one dying in the fight, yet it appearing most probable, and to a degree of certainty, that that death was not occasioned by a blow, but through an apoplectic fit? - A. I have heard of such a case; I do not believe the deceased to be subject to that disease, she being of a thin habit of body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do no persons of a thin habit of body die of an apoplexy? - A. We are taught to believe that a person of a full habit of body is more apt, and persons of a thin habit of body seldom if ever die of an apoplexy, except they labour under some disease, as in most inveterate cases of scurvy they may die of an apoplexy, but not in a healthy state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Whether or no she might not have so laid on the bed, that trending upon her, or falling upon her, might not have the same effect as a blow? - A. Certainly.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You live in the same house with the husband of the deceased? - A. Yes; I had just come home from work, I had sent my little girl down for a light; the prisoner at the bar put his head into my room, and asked me which was Smith's room; I pointed to Smith's room-door, upon which the prisoner knocked very loud at it; I did not hear any answer returned; he cried out, Smith, Smith, get up and come out, if not, I will come in, I will break the door open; he pushed the door open with both his hands; the first thing that I heard was a very heavy fall, that shook all the things in my room; I looked into Smith's room, and Smith and he were fighting; he was under the prisoner. I called my landlady; she asked the prisoner what had brought him there, he had broke all her crockery; I never saw the woman till I saw her dead; the prisoner said if she was dying, he would die with her; he went to the bed, and kissed her; he was not sober when he went into the room, but he was sober when he knew the woman was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Your room is just opposite to their's? - A. There is nothing between the two rooms but the wainscoting.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you could hear any noise in that room? - A. I could indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. And the first noise you heard was like something falling down? - A. It was; I heard the crockery break, then I went and saw them fighting.</p>
               <p>- DUDLEY sworn. - Q. You are the owner of this house, in which the deceased's husband lived in? - A. Yes, when I went up I saw the two men scuffling, the table was overturned, and the crockery was all broken; they were both from the bed when I saw them; I saw a woman lying on the bed; Smith said it was his wife; he went to the bed side, and said, he has killed her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The moment I went into the door I enquired of the woman that lived on the same floor, whether they were at home or not; the little girl came by with a candle a-light at the present time; I took the candle and perceived them lying together on the bed, through the hole of the door; I knocked and called for them to open the door, and they neither of them spoke; immediately I pushed the door open; the deceased saw me coming into the room, and she made a bit of an alarm to her husband; he jumped up immediately on the bed, and immediately struck at me; as soon as he got off the bed we got into a skirmish, and in our scuffling we both fell athwart the woman; we had several ups and downs in the room; no further I have to say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general machinist, in partnership with Gabriel Riddle. The prisoner was in my employ—he was engaged in August last as town-traveller—it was his duty to solicit the trade gene<lb></lb>rally, in the glass line, for orders—he had h is regular set of patterns—he was to go out from day to day for that purpose—his appointed hours were from nine to seven o'clock—it was his business to be at home at seven o'clock in the evening, to enter the orders of the day in a book ex<lb></lb>pressely kept for those orders—we have a regular collector of cash—it was no part of the prisoner's business to receive money—he had orders not to take it—he has paid money to me, or Mr. Page—the excuse he gave was, that some person had said, "I wish you to take this money."</p>

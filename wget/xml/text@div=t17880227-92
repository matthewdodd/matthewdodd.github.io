               <p>Are you so well acquainted with the smell of aqua fortis, as to tell it from any strong acid? - I will not pretend to say upon my oath I am judge sufficient to say that; the little boy was sitting on the ground without his shoes and stockings, crying; the old man continued at work all the time making shoes, without a shirt; he had a waistcoat on; each of the lads pulled off an apron; the old man did not turn his head, nor say any thing, till we said, we must take him to the magistrate; then he seemed very much affected indeed.</p>
               <p>Court. These are the pieces; one of which was in the hand of Thomas, and the others on the board, that you are sure of? - Yes, I kept them separate; those I took from the fire, were uncoloured shillings and sixpences, and those on the board were all uncoloured sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Smell that, (giving the witness a phial) do you think that is aqua fortis? - I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with the smell of copperas? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>You know perhaps that shoemakers use copperas to colour their heels of their shoes? - They may.</p>
               <p>Did you find any copperas in the room, except that was copperas in the bottle? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Does this board differ from a poor shoe-maker's cutting-board? - They may certainly cut their leather upon it.</p>
               <p>And they may sharpen their knives upon this part that appears rubbed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You see the pieces that are not coloured; what would produce upon these pieces the colour of those that are? - A number of things, the principal thing is aqua fortis; after the piece is dipped in aqua fortis, it is thrown into water; each piece takes something of the strength of the aqua fortis from it, and it is afterwards rubbed in sand.</p>

               <p>You burst the door instantly, so that they had no time to have emptied any thing out of the phials? - No, it was impossible.</p>

I was on duty on 2nd July, in St. Pancras-road, at a place called Cook's-row—I had heard complaints made about persons obstructing the footpath there, and had received directions from my superiors about keeping it clear—about 7 o'clock that evening, I saw the prisoner and another sitting on the footpath there—I said to the prisoner, "Get up <hi rend="italic">Tush</hi>, and go away"—that was the nickname I knew him by—the other person got up, and went away—the prisoner said, "I shall not get up for you, you black b—r"—I had told him several times before to get up—I had told him so that afternoon—I told him he must get up, and he said, "I shan't get up for twelve such b—rs as you"—he then got up, and put him<lb></lb>self in a lighting attitude—a traveller who was in Mr. Blunt's, a grocer's shop, came out, and said to him, "What are you doing? the policeman is only doing</p>

On the evening of 2nd July, I was crossing the road opposite the Brewers' Arms—the prisoner was sitting down—he got up off the pavement, and crossed the road after the policeman—when they got towards the Brewers' Arms, the prisoner made use of foul expressions—he went into the gate, took a pint pot off the table, and turned it upside down—he held it a few minutes, and said to the policeman, "You black b—r, I will knock your brains out, and then you shan't lock me up," and in a minute he came out, and struck the policeman a blow on the side of his head—his hat fell, and in the act of picking the hat up, as he rose again, he gave him another tremendous blow on the head—I saw four blows struck on the policeman's bead, and the fourth blow struck him on the back-part of the head—I lent him my pocket-hand<lb></lb>kerchief to tie round his head—I went for a policeman.</p>

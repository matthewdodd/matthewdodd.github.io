             was in my service; he was about eleven years old. On the 24th of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I employed him to draw a truck with a small bed on it, from the Kent-road to Chelsea; I accompanied him - he was standing resting in the carriage road with his truck; I was on the pavement near him, and saw a cart coming at a very quick pace - before I had time to warn him, the cart struck against the truck; it had been a rainy night, but was clear then - I saw the cart about four yards from me; the driver must have seen him if he had used proper caution, I certainly think - I saw the cart strike the truck; the boy called out twice before it struck, but the cart did not slacken its pace till it struck the truck - the shaft must have struck it and knocked the boy down, and the wheel went over his body; the blow overset the truck, and threw the contents out - the boy screamed violently, and I went to him; the cart was stopped - there were three men in it; the driver got out, and gave himself up as soon as it was stopped - he was not sober, but quite in liquor; he was driving very quickly - the boy was taken to an apothecary's, and then to Westminster-hospital; he was very near the curb-stone when it happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he sitting on the truck? A. No, he was standing within the handle in his proper place - I saw the shaft of the cart strike the truck; I think the wheel struck the handle and broke it - there was some kind of metal in the cart, more than 3 cwt. it was said; a crowd got round the cart, and stopped it - I cannot say whether the man pulled the horse up himself; I rather think he did stop- I called several times to know who was the driver, and he gave himself up - I am sure he did not himself take the boy in his arms.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he trotting or what? A. It was a kind of very quick trot; it was a dark night, but there was sufficient light from the shops to show the truck - the gas was not lighted.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner assist in carrying him to the doctor's? A. No; he came in a few minutes after he was carried in, and appeared to wish to speak to the boy - I do not think he appeared very anxious about it; it was rather a dark night, but not very- there were too many people for me to see whether the cart stopped itself, or was stopped; he gave himself up when the driver was asked for; I was too much frightened to notice the other two men - the man, who took the boy up, is not here; I was crossing when it happened, and was nearer to the cart than the truck - I was at the side of the cart, but I saw the truck long before I ran; I saw a piece of the flap of the truck fly off into the road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what pace was he going? A. Very quick; there was light enough for a person, who was ordinary cautious, to see the truck.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I was standing at my master's door, in Arabella-row, seven or eight doors from where this accident happened, looking towards the spot, and saw the horse going at a tidyish trot, of about six miles an hour - I do not think it was going too fast; the boy was resting about three feet from the curb- I heard him, or the lady, halloo out, and ran up before it happened; I saw the lad knocked down - I think it was the horse came against the truck, and broke the handle; it overturned and broke - all the things were thrown out; I saw the off-wheel go over the boy's loins - I could scarcely see the truck at the distance I was first at; three lamps, a little further off, were not lighted - there were no shops that gave any light of any consequence; if the driver had been ordinary cautious he might have avoided the truck if it was not for the hill, but it is a steepish hill, going down - the road is pretty broad; there were no other carriages - the lad was on the left side, and the driver coming on the same side, which was the near side; he appeared to me a little intoxicated - I should not know him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the truck three feet from the curb? A. When I got there the lad seemed to be trying to save the truck, and it must have been three feet from the curb - that part is shockingly lighted; the gas was not lit at all - it was a darkish night, and had been a wet evening; I know it is impossible to draw up in a moment, for I have a troublesome horse to deal with- it is a very awkward place to pull up at immediately; I saw the man throw the reins on the horse's head and get out - he followed the lad to the doctor's; he did not assist to carry him there - the cart would go quicker with a heavy load, at the brow of a hill, than in any other part; he had just got to the foot of the hill where he would have the least power over his horse - the cart was on its wrong side; I think two carriages might pass on the road; but the cart-horse turned out when it happened, and the truck was sent more into the middle of the road - there was room for another carriage to pass when it happened.</p>

            . I was in the cart with the prisoner when this happened; it was loaded with about 3 cwt. of cast-iron; another of my shopmates was in the cart, and a little boy belonging to the prisoner - the road is six or seven yards wide, as near as I can judge - there is room for two carriages to pass easily - I did not see the truck till the cart struck it; it was very dark; there was no lamps lighted at all - there were candles in the shop windows - the cart stopped directly it happened, as the boy screamed; I never heard any hallooing out till he was knocked down - the prisoner did not appear to me unable to take care of the cart - he had been drinking, and I dare say was not sober; I think he was in liquor, but able to conduct himself - he was on the right-hand side of the road, going towards Pimlico; the truck was on his right-hand side; that is, on the off-side - I saw nothing to prevent his going on the near side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are in the service of Mr. Cubit, the builder? A. Yes; the prisoner came to out place from Mr. Gabriel's, and one of my shopmates said he would give me a lift home in the cart - I was sitting on the same seat as him, on the near side; he was in the middle - I heard nobody cry out for us to get out of the way - he stopped, and got out directly the boy screamed; he was going at a smart trot, not a gallop - he was driving a lightish cart.</p>

The deceased was brought there, and another medical gentleman saw him; I did not see him till early next morning - he was very drowsy, and unwilling to answer questions; he complained of a pain across his stomach - he died next evening; I opened him - his liver was ruptured, and no doubt he bled to death; I have no doubt the injury caused his death.</p>

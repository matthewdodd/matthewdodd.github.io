               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have the clerks books of this description? A. Yes; there are six clerks in the office - the hours for business with the public conclude at three o'clock - Mr. Robarts was a trustee in 1830, and, I believe, from the commencement of the Institution, in 1816; the prisoner had not left us quite a year when he was apprehended - I believe he was taken in the residence he occupied when in our office; he had no part of the clerk's duty to perform - all monies paid in there should be received by me; the clerks refer depositors to me, to make payments - I am responsible for the money received; the accounts are kept by the actuary - the prisoner was to arrange the depositors according to their turn; I pay the cash to the treasurer - nobody but myself is authorised to receive money; I am not aware of any express stipulation that no clerk is to receive money, but that is the course of business - I am not aware that about the time the prisoner left, it had been proposed to put him in livery.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was the prisoner's duty to present the depositors at the clerk's desk? A. Yes - the clerk enters the figures in the book, and after the money is paid to me, it is written in words, at length, by another clerk, and a manager signs his initials in the margin - that has not been done in this book.</p>

             - we keep a house for Mrs. Keemer, at Streatham, and by advice of her steward, on a Tuesday in September, 1830, I went to the London Provident Institution, to deposit a 5l. note and three severeigns; it was my husband's property - I got to the office, in Bloomfield-street, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock; Mr. Lock wood, the steward, had come with me - we saw the prisoner in the outer office; Lockwood told him he had brought me there to put a little money into the savings' bank - the prisoner asked if I was married; I said Yes; he asked if that was my husband - I said No; he then said I could not put it in without my husband, and he would give me some papers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160028"></xptr>to take home - that my husband was to fill them up and sign them, and when that was done Lockwood and I went back, in about a fortnight, with the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you done with the money the first time? A. The prisoner said the first time, that I could leave my money with him, and it would be all correct - I left him the 5l. note and sovereigns; we returned in a fortnight, and gave the prisoner the papers - he looked at them, and said there was something wrong in one of them concerning my husband's business; he gave them to Lockwood to take home again, and gave him his address, that he might send them up, and not have the trouble of coming again - Lockwood is now dead; I got the paper altered - Lockwood wrapped them in paper, and sent them up; a fortnight or three weeks after that, I went to the office for my book, as the prisoner had promised to send us one - (Lockwood and us were uneasy about it, and Lockwood paid my fare up to see about it;) when I went in, the prisoner said, "Good morning, Mrs. Hubbard, I was just going to send your book up;" he had got it in a brown paper parcel, directed to my husband, at the Horse and Groom, Streatham - he said he supposed I was uneasy about it; I said, "Not particularly, I suppose it is all right now;" he said, "Yes, it is all correct;" I was then satisfied - this is the book he gave me; he came to see me on the last Sunday in last March - I brought out my book, and he said something about 3 1/2 percent. for what I had deposited, and if I had any more to deposit at any time, he would take it as a friend, and see it deposited for me - about three weeks before last Christmas, I went up to the office again, with a little money we had saved, and found Clay had left; I presented my book, and was told that was not the day to make deposits - I wanted them to make it for me; they refused - we left, and six weeks ago next Monday, I came up with five sovereigns, and found we had no money there; inquiry was made about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went at noon-day to make your deposit? A. Yes - I saw nobody but Clay; I was in the outer office - he appeared like a gentleman then, but, I believe, was called the porter; it was a kind of place I was never at before - I went on a Tuesday, the first and second time; the 8l. has never been put down to my account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent of any criminal intention - I merely took it in my duty, as I thought it was to promote the interest of the concern, but my memory being very bad, (I have been materially injured, several times severely, and consider) I must have overlooked the thing, which certainly an upright man should not have done - it is not likely I should have committed myself in this way, when there was no occasion for it; it must have arisen in some degree from being fully occupied in another extensive concern, which I hold at the present moment.</p>

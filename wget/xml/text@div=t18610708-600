                  </hi>. I am a stoker, living at Albert-square, Shadwell—on Friday morning, 7th June, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was walking along St. George's-street, Shad well, with a female named Mary Ann Franklin,</p>

               <p>when the prisoner came up to me, took hold of me by the collar of the jacket, and used some very bad language, and said I was the G----d fellow he wanted to get hold of—I asked him what he meant, and he struck me in the face—I scuffled with him, got away from him, and went on the other side of the way, when he followed and shot me—I saw him fire a pistol—the shot struck me on the right shoulder—I have not suffered a great deal from the wound—it was a very slight wound—it was seen by a surgeon—I had never seen the prisoner before in my life—I gave no provocation—he was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Albert-street, Shad well—on 7th June, I was walking with the last witness—I saw the prisoner come up to him, and catch hold of him by the coat—he said, "You are the d-d fellow I want"—Morrell asked him what he meant, and he said, "That is what I mean," and scuffled with him—I thought he was going to stab him—Morrell got away, and went across the road—the prisoner followed him over the road, took a pistol out of his breast pocket and shot at him—the prosecutor was sober—I never saw the prisoner before in my life.</p>

On 7th June, I was on duty in High-street, Shadwell, and heard a disturbance—I made up to the parties to separate them, when I saw the prisoner draw the pistol from his breast and deliberately fire at the prosecutor—he then ran away, and I followed him into some fields—I asked him for the pistol, and he said he had not got it—it was found afterwards close to the place where I apprehended him—he was present when it was brought to me—this is the pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is a five barrel revolver—the barrels were all loaded at the time with powder and shot, except the one that was discharged—that appeared to have been recently discharged—the prisoner did not appear to be intoxicated—there was no appearance at all of his having been drinking.</p>

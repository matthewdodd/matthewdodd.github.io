               <p>DANIEL HEALY. I am a Police-constable. On the 10th of June, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I fell in with the prisoner in Hornsey-road - he had a bag and a basket; I asked how many fowls he had - he said ten; I met my brother officer - he asked him if he had any more fowls; he said No, but he took two more out of his pockets - the prisoner was about one mile and a half from the prosecutor's when I met him.</p>

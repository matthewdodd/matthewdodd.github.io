                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Fountain, a wire-worker, of 11, Pear-tree-street, St. Luke's—on Wednesday afternoon 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> June the pri<lb></lb>soner came to hire a room—she took the top front room unfurnished—she moved into it that night with her family; it consisted of six children—a chair and a table was brought into the room; that was all—I did not see anything of her that night—I heard the baby cry in the middle of the night—the people in the house made complaints next morning, and I went into the prisoner's room—she was not there—the baby was being nursed by the eldest girl, about eleven years old—there was part of a loaf and a mug of water on the ground; that was the only food—the loaf was part of a quartern from "the house"—the baby had nothing but a dirty rag placed in its mouth—I did not examine whether there was anything in the rag—I did not take it out of its mouth—I tried it with a little sop, but its mouth was so sore it would not take it—it cried all day long, and nobody came near it till night—I saw the prisoner on the Thursday night and a gentleman—she came home about 9 o'clock and went up to the room—I called her down, and asked what she meant by bringing such children into my place, and giving me such a false reference as she had—she said she could not help it, she was obliged to give a false reference to get them into a house, but she would endeavour to get them out of the house as soon as possible—I asked her whether she thought it was right to leave them—she said she could not help it; she was in trouble—I said it would not take her all night to leave them to see about her troubles, day-time was the proper time to see about such things—I said, "Have you got anything more to leave them than dry bread?"—she said they wanted for nothing—she had not the infant with her when this took place; she left it up stairs—after this she went out, with the man who she represented as her husband—she did not return that night that I am aware of—the child was crying continually all that night—on the Friday morning, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner came in and went to her room—she afterwards came down to me in the passage—she said she was going to take the child to the doctor's, and when she came back she said she was going after a room to take her children into—she had the infant in her arms—I said it was dreadful to hear the child cry in the night, nobody could get any rest for it—she said she was very sorry, but she could not help it—she brought it back about 10 o'clock that morning, and left it with the same little girl, and she then went out all day—she returned between 9 and 10 at night, I believe—I did not go into her room on the Friday while she was away—I did while she was there—there was no other food there than dry bread and water—the children were removed on the Saturday morning between 10 and 11—as far as I can tell she remained with them on the Friday night—I went up at 12 o'clock—she was in the room on Friday night, but I don't believe she remained all night—I could not say, because I went to bed.</p>

I am brother-in-law of last witness—I live in the same house, and sleep near the front door—I did not see the prisoner and her children come to the lodging—I heard her go out on Wednesday night about 10, I believe; at least the man went out about 10, and she followed after—she did not return before Thursday morning—she stayed out all night—she went out again on the Thursday morning, and never came home till about 9 or 10 on Thursday night, and then the man came in with her—the man went out first on Thursday night, between 10 and 11, and she fol<lb></lb>lowed him in about three-quarters of an hour—she did not come in again before 7 o'clock on Friday morning—I believe she went to take the child to the hospital in the morning—I saw her go out with the child, and my younger brother watched her to the hospital—that was the only time the child went out with her—she brought it back again about 10 o'clock—she was absent about three hours—she went out again the same morning, and did not return till about 10 at night—I went into the room while she was absent—I saw some dry bread, and a little milk jug with some water in it, which the eldest boy used to come down into the yard to fetch—that boy was about twelve or thirteen years of age—there was nothing but a piece of dirty rag for the baby—I do not know whether the prisoner went out on the Friday night—I did not hear her go out <hi rend="italic">;</hi> I was asleep—I heard the child cry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Luke's workhouse—I attended the deceased child, Rebecca Blake, on 25th June in the re<lb></lb>ceiving ward of the workhouse—she was a thin wasted child—she had thrush in the mouth, a large belly, and small limbs—I saw food given to it; milk and water—I attended it up to its death, which was, I think, on 12th July—it did not improve in health at all—I made a post mortem examination—the general appearance of the internal organs was that of great pallor—that was the most remarkable point—the lungs were pale, the heart and the brain flabby and pulpy—that indicates defective nutrition—the child died of mesenteric disease in an advancing state—it died from general feebleness and</p>

               <p>diarrhoea—it had great difficulty in retaining any food—the feebleness and diarrhoea appeared to have arisen from want of being fed upon such food as it could digest, from want of proper food.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mesenteric disease proceeds very often from a scrofulous temperament, does it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very often—where there is that scrofulous tendency the disease develops itself earlier than at other times—a child may be born with it—mesenteric disease of itself prevents proper nourishment being taken into the system—it is a question of degree—it develops itself whether there be nourishment from the mother's milk or not—among the lower orders it is a complaint that a great number of children die of, even though they have nutriment from the mother—distress and misery on the part of the mother would injure that nutriment—it would hardly dry up the milk; it would impoverish it, and probably lead to that; but I must distinctly state that the mesenteric disease was not in that ad<lb></lb>vanced state that it would destroy this child—I know the child could not have received nutriment from its food—it had the thrush—that causes a little difficulty in a child taking the nipple at first, but it sucks readily enough after it has once got hold of it—if it is hungry it will suck—it would not be capable of knowing whether the milk was good or not.</p>

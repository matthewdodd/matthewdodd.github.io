            . Q. I believe you are a silk broker - A. Yes. I reside at 5, Bates's-buildings, Hoxton. I have an accompting-house, 22, Cateaton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 1st of April, purchase a bale of the Company's raw Bengal silk, for Messrs. Phillips and Co. at Leek, in Staffordshire - A. I did. The weight of the silk was one hundred and forty-eight pounds. I paid for it two hundred and thirty-eight pounds and eight-pence. I ordered my man to take it to the White Bear, in Basinghall-street. Messrs. Pickfords sent to me several days afterwards. I then found it was lost. I went to Messrs. Pickfords. My correspondents told me that the bale had not arrived. It was to go to Messrs. Phillips and Company, Leek, in Staffordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mackray's lodging in Maiden-lane, Wood-street - A. I did. I was there shewn a parcel of silk in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the sort of silk that you had packed up to go by Pickford's waggon - A. Exactly similar to what I had bought for Phillips and Company, marked C. L. signifying the city of London; and under that is a dot, 1207, there is M, then a stroke under that 12, and under it the letter E, in capital. I believe that is the East India Company's mark. All silks that come from Bengal must be sold by the Company's candle. I could not swear that the silk produced to day was a part of that silk.</p>
               <p>- PORTER. I went with the last witness. I cleared two bales of silk from the India-house, and afterwards I took them to the White Bear, Basinghall-street. The bales were directed to Phillips and Co. Leek, Staffordshire. This is the receipt. (The receipt read.)</p>
               <p>- GROSVENOR. I am book-keeper and porter at the White Bear, Basinghall-street. I signed that book for an acknowledgment of the receipt of these bales.</p>

            . In the beginning of April last I resided in Maiden-lane. I acted as silk broker. I purchased a parcel of silk of Mr. Hammersley. He brought me a sample of it. I did not understand the nature of the silk. I took one or two heads before I would buy it to several persons in the trade. They informed me they thought it would not suit the trade. I afterwards shewed a sample of the silk to Mr. Tatlock.</p>

            . I am a silk-weaver. On the 5th of April I lived in Maiden-lane. On the 18th of April last the prisoner brought me a sample of silk. He told me he was very much distressed for money. He wished me, if it suited me, to purchase it, or to lend him twenty pounds. I went that evening to the prisoner's house with twenty pounds, and agreed to take forty pounds worth of silk. I went on Monday, and took twenty pounds worth of silk from his house in Montague-street, Spitalfields, and on the next day I took twenty pounds worth more. I gave him twenty shillings a pound; forty pounds for the whole. I afterwards sold the silk to Mackray for fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you a bill of parcels given you by the prisoner - A. I took the first away without. Finding it would not answer the purpose, I asked him for a bill of parcels, as I should have to sell it. He said, as you have got to sell in you ought to get something by it. The bill of parcels is made out at thirty-two shillings a pound, but twenty shillings was the price.</p>

            . I am a silk-broker. I met Mr. Mackray, I think, on the Saturday this took place. He shewed me a skein of silk. He said, he could not afford to sell it for less than thirty-two shillings, which I thought cheap. I immediately took it to Daintry and Rye, the first in our line, and they only offered me thirty shillings for it. I took the skein away, and going up Trump-street I saw the advertisement of this felony. I was persuaded it was the same silk, but no man can swear to silk. I went and shewed it to Mr. Beardmore. I told him I had got some silk that would suit him exceeding well, but I had some doubt how it was come by; I must look into that first. I went to Mackray in Maiden-lane, and desired to know how he came by it, as I had some suspicion of it being stolen. He told me he bought it of Hammersley. In the evening I saw Hammersley. He told me he bought it of the prisoner; he either gave twenty-four or twenty-eight shillings, I cannot say which; one or the other, upon my oath. I then told him, the prisoner must be seen. I sent for Mr. Nalder. Mr. Nalder, and a constable, Mackray, and myself, went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160067"></xptr> to the prisoner's house. I went up stairs, and he came to me I went up stairs. There are looms in his manufactory. He is a narrow weaver. The prisoner seemed much agitated in seeing me. I took that agitation to arise from this, because I appeared against him before. I then said, I am afraid you are again in a bad thing. He said he was not. I said, I have seen some silk at Hammersley's, which he says he bought of you Does he, said he, and what price did he say he gave for it. I said, either four or eight-and-twenty, I did not know which. His answer was, he only gave twenty. I told him, I had the City marshall with me. He said, you know I have been true to my word once, and I will be so now. I hope you will not take me up. I said, be honest, and I will not. I then advised him to let the whole of it fail upon the right shoulder. I did not see him from that day until I saw him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you who he bought it of - A. No, he did not. He said, he had a bill of parcels, and there he stopped</p>

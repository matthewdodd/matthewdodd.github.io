            . I live in St. George's parish. I was coming from Spring Gardens, Vaux Hall, where I am a <rs id="t17570713-45-viclabel223" type="occupation">waiter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17570713-45-victim448 t17570713-45-viclabel223"></join>, to go home, between three and five in the morning, on the 2d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man?</p>
               <p>Everit. I am. Coming thro' the gateway in Westminster into <placeName id="t17570713-45-crimeloc224">Old Tothill street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17570713-45-crimeloc224" type="placeName" value="Old Tothill street"></interp>

I met two or three watchmen, and gave them a pint of beer. I pull'd my purse out in order to pay for it, and the prisoner and two soldiers were sitting in a box in the same room; after that I went and sat down at the lower end of a table next to her. I had a pot or two of beer, they drank with me, and I pull'd out my purse again to pay for the beer; the prisoner had a great mind to take my purse then, but the landlord bid her keep her hands to herself; she put her hand towards it as it lay upon the table. I took my money up, the prisoner followed me out, and the landlord call'd after me, and said, knock that hussey on the head, for she'll rob you. I went on my way home, she came up to me, and I ask'd her what she wanted; she said my dear only to see you safe home. I desired her to go back again, but could not get rid of her. Then I cross'd the Broad-way to Dormant's hill, when she gave me a shove on the side and push'd me into a dirty way. I got my hand to my pocket, and said, hussey if you take any thing from me, expect what will follow; she said she never did such a thing to any man in her life, then put her hand under my armpit, and pull'd me close to her. I shoved her from me, and put my hand in my pocket, and my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Everit. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear you had it when you went out of the house?</p>
               <p>Everit. I can very safely swear I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Everit. I was very able to walk without any support; I knew every word that was spoke to me, and what I said to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to her when you missed your money?</p>
               <p>Everit. I said you have rob'd me. She made use of a very bad word, concerning her eyes, and said she never touch'd a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Everit. This was about five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any people about?</p>
               <p>Everit. Yes, people were going to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call any body to your assistance?</p>
               <p>Everit. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so ?</p>
               <p>Everit. Because my wife being big with-child I was afraid of giving her uneasiness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Everit. No; I never saw her in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with your money or purse again?</p>
               <p>Everit. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Everit. She promised to go back with me to the man's house where we came from. When I was for going she insisted upon going through the street that I lived in, but I did not chuse that.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Everit. Because people were up and would see us.</p>

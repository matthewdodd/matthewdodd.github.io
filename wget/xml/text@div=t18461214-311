                  </hi> I am a mariner, and live in King's-row, Horsleydown—I know the defendant—he works at Billingsgate. This happened between the 15th or 16th of Sept., about a quarter to twelve o'clock at night—me and my wife had had a quarrel during the day—Mrs. Pickard, who lives oppo<lb></lb>site, abused me—Susan Cole, Henry Pearman, and Ann Stephens, all lived in the house at the time—I was assaulted and abused by Susan Cole—Ann Stephens called me a b the prisoner was not there at all then—I went to bed about nine o'clock, awoke about twelve o'clock, and found my wife was not in bed—hearing people talking in doors I got up, and found Pearman, Pickard, and Cole, and my wife, at their door opposite—I opened my window, and saw the whole four—the prisoner was not there then—I said to my wife, "Why do not you come in doors?"—I came down to the door and stood there, persuading my wife to come in—the prisoner then came over, squaring up to me, and wanting to fight—I told him I had had no quarrel with him, nor he with me, why should he want to fight—he kept on squaring up—I said, "I do not want to quarrel, why not go away?" Pearman stood opposite and said, "It is me you want," and struck me with his life-preserver; which is a thing loaded with lead—I was gored in blood—Mr. Guthrie called a policeman, who showed his lantern—the pri<lb></lb>soner and Pearman flew in doors—the prisoner never touched me, only kept me in conversation for the others to fly up to me, to do it—he was taking my attention—as soon as the others got close to me, the prisoner stepped away to let Pearman come to me and strike me unawares with the weapon—I got three blows on my head—the bone of my arm was broken, but I sup<lb></lb>pose the blows on my arm must have been done afterwards—I have three cuts on the scalp of my head—I raised my arm—I suppose that was how I got the injury to my arm—there are several marks on my arm besides where it was broken.</p>

I took him before the Magistrate for aiding and assisting Pearman—the Magistrate did not say he considered there was no evidence against him, and he would bind him over to keep the peace for six months, as he squared at me—I did not ask the Magistrate if I could indict him—the Magistrate did not say, "What for? I have punished him"—he did not bind me over to appear here—I came to the Court and had him indicted—I have been drinking to-day—I had a pint of coffee at eight o'clock this morning—I did not know what you were enquiring about before—I have had a glass of rum, and 1 think about a pint of beer, and some bread and cheese—I was not going to beat my wife on this night—I told her to go out to avoid a knock—I had had beer to drink, and I dare say a little drop of spirits—I cannot tell how much, I do not keep a log-book to tell how much—I was sober enough to row about among the steamers.</p>

                  </hi> I am a deputy corn-meter, and live in King's-row, nearly opposite to Ellis's, and next door to the prisoner's. I went to bed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184612140090"></xptr>
               <p>this night about eleven o'clock, and heard two females talking near my win<lb></lb>dow—it might be twelve or one o'clock—I got up, and saw the prisoner come down in his shirt, with the two females standing at their own door, aggra<lb></lb>vating Ellis—the bad language which came from them exasperated Ellis—they called him the worst of names they could—Stephens first came out in his trowsers, and I suppose his shoes, and wanted Ellis out to fight—Ellis said, "Go in, my good man, I have had no words with you; mind your own business"—he stood some minutes squaring before Ellis, who did not think proper to fight, till there was an opportunity for the man behind, named Pearman I believe—he went a little on one side to make room for the others running over the way—Pearman immediately ran over and struck Ellis—I will undertake to say the prisoner went out of the way to give Pearman a passage, and Pearman struck Ellis a tremendous blow with some instrument, I could not see what, being dark—I never heard such a tremendous blow in my life, and I have heard horses knocked down—I saw blood on the pave<lb></lb>ment, called for the police, and told them to take all four in charge—the policeman got hold of Ellis, and said, "I have got charge enough here"—while he was holding Ellis up, supporting him, I desired the policeman to take charge of them—Mrs. Pickard said, any b—entering her house she would split their b—skull—the policeman took Ellis away to the hospital—I was leaning out of my window, in my shirt—as I felt very much cramped, I did not go out, but next morning I traced the blood 200 yards towards the hospital, and the next morning I traced it 300 yards, where they lad led him away—I saw blood coming from him, but could not tell how—I suppose it was from his head.</p>

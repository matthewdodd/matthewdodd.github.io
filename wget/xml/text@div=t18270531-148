I was in Bond-street, and saw the prisoner and another walking before me; I saw Mr. Kinnear put a green purse into his coat pocket - I saw the prisoner put his hand into the pocket twice, but he did not take the purse; he put his hand in a third time, pulled out the purse, and dropped it - the other took it up, and ran away; I told Mr. Kinnear, and he was taken. I am certain he is the boy.</p>

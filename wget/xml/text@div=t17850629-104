               <p>Sorry for what? - For what they had done, Knock had dressed herself up in my wife's cloaths, and went up to Whitechapel, and there she got herself into trouble, and she sent Mrs. Wilkie to pawn the gown, she said she only dressed herself in them to go out; we lost the things mentioned in the indictment; at the Rotation office they owned taking the other things, there was no promise of favour made them, they owned it voluntarily ; they said, they had been carrying out things for a fortnight before, the very same time I went to church to marry my wife, they carried things out, and pawned them some of the things were found at Mr. Rolfe's the pawnbroker's.</p>

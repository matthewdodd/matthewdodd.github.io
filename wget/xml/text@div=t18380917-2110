               <p>past two o'clock on the 3rd of September, I was in Bartholomew Fair, near Richardson's show—there was a rush, and the prisoner came and snatched my pin from my breast—I collared him, but my hand was knocked away by some of his associates—he got from me—the pin was stropped—he was followed and taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Marylebone-lane, and am a coachmaker. I was at the fair—I saw the prisoner and several more pushing about, and this prisoner took the pin from the prosecutor's bosom—I am sure of that—it dropped down the gentleman's bosom, and then the prisoner ran away—I ran after him, and he was given into custody.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you not said that you had a doubt about him, but you believed him to be dressed in the same way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, never—I hive not said that I could not swear to him—I never said that I lost sight of him, to the best of my recollection—I did lose sight of him of course—I was looking at the coaches—I went to see the fair proclaimed, and to look at the Sheriffs' carriages—I gave charge of another man—he was not very respectable—I did not say that the prisoner was" dressed like the man—that I lost tight of him, and could not positively swear to him, nor any thing like it—I work for myself in the Acre, in St. Martin's-lane, in a yard—I did work for Messrs. Nurse and Warren, in Crawford-street—I left them on the 19th of last October—Mr. Pever was the last person I worked for.</p>

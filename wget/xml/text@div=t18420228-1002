                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliffe. In the morning of Friday week, Mead came to me, and said be was dis<lb></lb>charging a barge of sand at the wharf—(this barge was lying at a wharf nearly adjoining my house)—he said one of the people had got locked up, and was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., would I lend him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a sail, to prevent the man being sent away in the van—I said I would do it for him—he left, and in about fire minutes he returned with Watts and this sail—I was about giving him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Lend me another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., we shall want a pot of beer when we get the man"—I lent him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and this is the sail he left.</p>

I remember the barge lying at Ashley's wharf that day—there was no cargo with her—I helped to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her oat to anchor to save her from getting injury—I had heard previous to that of the sail going out of her, and I was blamed for taking charge of her—I was afterwards sitting in a public-house, smoking my pipe—a man came, and gave me information that so and so was taken out of the barge—I went, and saw Mead in a marine-store shop with the rope—I did not see where he took it from—I had seen such rope on board the barge, and lent a hand to put part of it down into the hold—this is the rope—a man in the marine-store shop said to me, "Have you anything to do with it?"—I said, "It is stolen property, don't you buy it"—Mead went out, and Watts came in—he said, "I am master of that barge, the rope is mine"—I said, "You nor nobody shall have it till I get an officer," because I took charge of the barge.</p>

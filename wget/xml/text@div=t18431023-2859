                  </hi>. I am the son of Stephen Bird—he has one partner, and lives at Kennington—the prisoner was their carter—on the 26th of Sept, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and another of our carters stranding with their carts opposite the Hand and Flower—the other carter pulled his hones a short distance, and the prisoner pulled his further—I saw him empty his hose-bag of chaff and beans into a small trough where he stood—he hung his nose-bag on his cart, and drove towards London, without the horses eating any of it—I went over, looked at the trough, and found it half full of chaff, corn, and beans, which I believe to be my father's—I have no doubt of it—I ran home, and told my brother—I came back in ten minutes—the trough was then removed—I went to the landlord—I found some corn in a bin in the stable, which was the same I had seen shot out of the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the prosecutor, and it is my duty to serve out the mixture. I supplied the prisoner with his the evening before—I accompanied Mr. Bird to the Hand and Flower stable, and compared the mixture with ours, and believe it to be part of what I served out the night before—there were two sorts of beans, one a very large kind, which we never gave out before.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you swear it is the same? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—I will not swear to it—I do not say there never were such beans before—I never saw any such before given whole to horses—there was about three parts of a peck in the bin—corn may not be so fresh at the bottom of a bag as the top—we discharged the other carter.<hi rend="smallCaps">

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">affirmed.</hi>) I am a member of the Society of Friends. On the 18th of August, about nine o'clock at night, I was in the Green Park—I had dined at the Garrick Club-house, in King-street, Covent-garden—I drank after dinner three or four glasses of claret—I had a very severe head-ache—I dined at half-past five or from that to six o'clock—I left the club-house with a friend, at about a quarter to eight o'clock, in<lb></lb>tending to visit the English Opera-house—I found, on getting there, that the order I anticipated taking my friend in with, was for myself only, and therefore declined going; and I went to my friend's rooms, 51, Lincoln's-inn-fields—his name is John Spedding Frowde—he is a solicitor—I went to his chambers with him—I staid there about three quarters of an hour, more or less—he left his chambers with me, and I went with him to Greek-street, Soho, to some billiard-rooms where he wished to play—I did not go into the billiard-rooms, but he did; and I went down the street leading to Cranbourne-street and Leicester-square and Piccadilly into the Green Park—I was not intoxicated in the slightest degree at any period that evening—I was perfectly sober—when I got into the part, I walked round the top of the basin, on the western side—I turned to my left when I got to the top, and walked straight across the open part of the park, in a diagonal line, till I got to the Duke of Sutherland's—I had got some way, when I turned out of the path for the purpose of making water and while I was in the act of doing so, some one came behind me, and said, "Good night"—I replied, "Good night;" and, looking over my shoulder, saw it was a person in a light dress—he immediately seized me by the skirts of my coat, throwing him<lb></lb>self rather upon me, saying, "This is just what I wanted, you are the sort of men that get soldiers bad names"—the horror of my situation I at once felt—I was entirely in his power, that he had the opportunity of bringing any charge against me he chose; and the horror of my situation was such, I cannot exactly bring to my recollection what happened from that time—I was so agitated I cannot remember very well what happened; but to the best if my belief, I struggles, when he said, "You had better be quier," and something about "expose"—he then pulled me on further down towards the bottom of the park, towards the palisades which separate the Green Park from St. James's more towards the palace—he then said, "What will you give me to let you go?"—I replied "I will give you all, or any thing, or every thing (I forget which term I used) that I have"—h demanded my purse—he asked me for my purse, (I forget the very words he used,) and I gave it him instantly—It contained a sovereign, a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210016"></xptr>
               <p>half-sovereign, and some silver—I am sure of that; and a seal, and key of a desk—he took the purse, and demanded my watch—I gave it him immediately—I should know that watch again—he then said, "Are you content," or "are you satisfied?" in a loudish voice—Idid not make any reply—he went away, and so did I as fast as I could go—I think he went to the right—he struck down, I think, towards St. James's Park—my sight is not very good I did not take such an observation of bis person as to be able to swear to him—I immediately went out at the gate, by the Duke of Sutherland's, that took me to St. James-streer—I them paused to think what I should do—I afterwards went to the Garrick Club—I was calmer and cooler then than I had been—I felt exceedingly nervous—I took some refreshment—I took some porter, I belive—Idid not take anything thatcould affect my sobriety—after leaving the Garrick, I went home, and went to bed—I was then slceping at my friend, Frowde's chambers, No.43, Lincoln's-nin-fields—Mr. Frowde did not see me when I returned—n the Monday following (this was on Tusday)I mentioned what had occurred to Mr. Richards, a friend of mine, who is a law student of Lincoln's-inn—he was going to get on the coach at the time, at the Elephant and Casstle, to accompany me to my father's house at Carshalton—It is Carshalton House where my father resides—he is a gentleman of property—something had occurred that rendered it necessary I should mention it to Mr. Richards—there was a police-offcer there—he put some questions to me concerning a watch, and in consequence of that I mentioned to my friend what had occurred.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As you were going to get on the coach, a police-officer put a question regarding a watch, and then you told Mr. Richard's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you at that time in your company a younger brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had—I did not permit to hear the disclosure I made to Mr. Richards—I attended at the police-office next morning—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there—my watch was produced, and I recognised it at Bow-street office—Mr. Richards attended with me—the charge was then gone into, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you always been a member of the Society of Frinds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always—I am a merchant, that is to say, I am at present with my brother-in-law in his counting-house, not actually in partnership with him—I am not in business on my own account—I have been there now, or before I left, eight months—I am twenty-seven years of age, and am single—my support arises partly from a sum placed by my father in my brother's business, and partly from my exertions there—my brother pays me a salary—I am tolerably well acquainted with town—I generally reside at Carshalton—I siept that night at Mr. Frowde's chambers—I had slept there one night before—on the previus night—I had dined with Mr. Frowde alone, at the Garrick—we left the Garrick together—we had an arrangement that we should both go to the English Opera-house—I had a free admission for myself, but none for a friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You wished to go to the theatre that we night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so, and so did my friend—It occurred to me that we might both go by paying for one—we did not wish to pay—It was for my friend to choose whether he would pay or not—I waived my privilege—I couuld not offer Mr. Frowde the order, as it was not tracsferable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the arrangement first made for Mr. Frowde to go to the billiard-rooms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We left the Garrick to go the English Opera—them went to his chambers—when I left him at the billiard-rooms, I told him I was going to take a walk—I did not tell him where, because I did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210017"></xptr>
               <p>not know myself—I made an appointment to meet him in an hour and a half a time—I had not taken that walk before since I have in town—I have walked over the same ground before—I do not think I walked there so late in the evening—I never knew it was a dangerous place to walk in at night by myself—I had a very bad head-ache, and thought the air across the park would he more beneficial than the road—I had had the head-ache, more or less, the whole day—I complained of it in the course of the day to Mr. Frowde, and I believe I told him of it when I told him I was going to take a walk—I mentioned it to him before we proposed to go to the English Opera.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you proposed to go to the Opera instead of the park? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; my head-ache became worse afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> when did it become worse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> when I had walked out after din<lb></lb>ner—my friend and I had had some conversation of a nature that was not likey to make it better—It became worse in walking to the theatre, or rather it felt worse when I was walking than when I was sitting quietly—I had pledged myself to go with my friend to the theatre, and did not think my head-ache was to prevent it—It was dark when I went into the park—It does not occur to me that I met any person in the park, but I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether you met one person or twenty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am very certain I did not meet twenty—I cannot tell whether I met any person—It was not a matter which occupied my attention—I was suffering from bodily pain, and wished to get rid of it, that was my reason for walking there—I do not remember whether I met any body—I went five or ten paces out of the regular path for the purpose I have stated—I mean steps—there are not railings on each side the path—I was on the grass when I made water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to stats distinctly, you met no person up to that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not—the person I came in contact with spoke to me before I was touched at all—I was grasped by the tails of my coat—he threw himself ratber forwards upon me, holding the tail of my coat at the same time—I affirm that I did not speak to him first—I said nothing whatever about girls—nothing more passed between us than what I have detailed—I did not any, "This is a fine place for girls"—I mean solemnly to affirm that—I did not make any such remark while I was with him—after I was adderssed, I looked round immediately—he said, "Good night, and I saw a person in a light dress—It was a soldier's dress, from the make of it, was late in the evening—I cannot say it was a light flannel jacket—I was not near encough to see—my impression at the time was, that the person addressing me was a soldier—I did not say to him, "What time have you to be in barracks?" nor any thing of the kind—or, "What time must you be home?"—he did not say to me that he must be home, or in the barracks at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it was so dark as you have stated and you were in such confu<lb></lb>sion as not to recollect what took place, how can you swear it was the dress of a soldier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I saw a person in a light dress, and a dress fitting in that way generally belongs to a soldier—the second sentence he uttered was, "You are the kingd of parties that give soldiers bad names"—I had finished what I was about at that time—I believe I had restored my dress to its usual place, for I found my dress restored subsequiently, and imagine I did it by instinct almost 6, I may say—I looked at my dress immediatly. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean immediately after you parted from the person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210018"></xptr>
               <p>at least my dress was then right—I did not mention this to my person till I mentioned it to Mr. Richards, after I had seen the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any thing said between you and that person as to an appoint<lb></lb>ment at a future night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; but for the communication with the officer, I should very probably never have mentioned it at all—I cannot sat how far the person and I went togeether, my state of agitation was so great—I had had the watch about six months—I had bought it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any arrangement made for you to meet the person again, and to give a certain sum of money on your watch being restored to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I did not get other watch between the time of my giv<lb></lb>ing it up and the officer coming to me—I was without a watch all that time—my brothers were not at home, except my younger brother, and he did not inquire where it was—Mr. Frowde did not inquire—I was not in the habit of wearing a watch so that it might be seen—at times I did, and at times I did not—I struggled when this happened—I did not call out—I did not meet any one after I left the person, till I got into St. James's Park—It might be fifty or seventy yards to the gate at the corner, then I had to go into St. James's Park—I met one person, I believe, before I got to the sentinel of the palace—I believe it was a man—It was a man—I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it not occur to you, that as you had been so ttacked by a per<lb></lb>son you believed to be a soldier, uit would be the best thing for you to tell the first soldier you met on duty what had occured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not occur to me—the person turned to the right, I believe, but I did not pay any great attention—I went away myself as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near were you to the railings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say fifty yards from them, as well as I am able to speak of distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell me whether, when you parted, the soldier went away on the regular path, or diverted from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went over the grass—I went from the pathway on to the grass before he attacked me—I did not give him up all the money I had—I gave him up the purse—It did not contain all the money I had—I had some money in my trowsewrs pocket—that was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him I would give him all I had about me—I would gladly do so—I gave him what he demanded—I would have given him all had he demanded it—I did not say to him, Pray take all I have, and let me go;" nor any thing to that effect—I gave him what he de<lb></lb>manded, and he appeared satisfied—I have never been married—I never stated to any one that I was married—I never allowed any female to pass as my wife.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, the 20th of August, the prisoner came to my shop and produced it on the subject of ear-rings—when he proiduced the gold watch, he asked me what it was woth—It had a small seal attached to it, and I think a steel ring—I said, "It must have cost at least 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. new"—he then said it was too good for him to have knocking about—he said it was given him by a lady's maid—when I told him what it was worth, he said, "You would not think that was a present to a lady's maid, would youi?"—I said, "No I should not"—he said it was too good for him to have knocking about; that he had it in his possession for three weeks, and had not shown it to any of his comrades; and that he wished to dispose of it, because it was too good, and he would take anotherin exchange, if I would buy it, and make it worth my while—he did not say any thing about his discharge, to my recollection—I then replied to him that I did not think it had been given to a lady's maid—he then said, what he had stated was correct, and that he was always to be found, giving me his name and address, "Robert Swan, Scotch Fusileer Guards, First Bat<lb></lb>talion—I then asked him long he had it in his possession—he said, "Three weeks," and asked if I knew of a person who it waws likely to suit—I said I thought I had a customer it might suit, and if he would leave it I would show it to him—he hesitated, and asked me how long I should be—I said if he would allow it me two hours, and he agreed to it—I had a motive for asking him that—he went away, leaving it, and in the mean time 1 endeavoured to trace out the coat of arms on the back—I gave information at Bow-street—he returned in about two hours and a quater, and asked what I had done about the watch—I said, "Now I wish to know how you became possessed of this watch?"—Fletcher, the officer, was close at hand at the time—I think he was in my parlour—he afterwards came into the shop—he was in the shop when I said I should like to know how he came by it—the prisoner said it had been given to him by a young woman he was keeping company with—I said I could not give it up to him, unless I was satisfied he had become honestly possessed of it—he then began to say he was not going to be swindled out of it in that kind of way—a young woman was with him when he came the second time—then the officer interfered—he said the young woman had nothing to do with it—I gave the watch to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to Bow-street Office. I went to Mr. Baker's house on Thursday, the 20th of August, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening—I had some information from him what I was wanted for—I went into the shop—there was nobody there but Mr. Baker—I about half an hour the prisoner came in with a female—he had got his uniform coat on, with side-arms—the prisoner inquired of Mr. Baker whether he had seen the gentleman respecting his watch—Mr. Baker re<lb></lb>plied, "I want to know how you came into possession of the watch"—he stated that he received it of a female that he was keeping company with, and he wished to dispose of it, for the purpose of purchasing his discharge—Mr. Baker inquired of him the price he wanted for it—he did not state any price—the prisoner appeared very anxious to get the watch or money,</p>

I forget the answer I made—we proceeded a little further, and as I thought, turned his back to make water—I was going on, he said "Stop a bit, I am going through the Park, I will accompany you"—When he turned round again his per<lb></lb>son was exposed in a disgraceful manner, and he asked me what I thought of that, and I, as he says, took him into custody, and told him at the same time it was such men as them that got soldiers into bad names—he begged that I would not take him, and at the same time pulled out this watch—I took the watch, and thought at the same time as a testimony against him—we went a little further towards the bottom of the Park—he fell down upon his knees, and begged for his family's sake that I would let him go—I pitied him—after long entreating from him, I told him I would let him go on a promise that he would never insult a soldier in a like manner again—he pulled out his purse, and called me a good fellow—but it was agreed he was to meet me the next day at the bottom of the Park, and I was then to return him his watch, and he would make me a present—he asked me not to bring any one with me—I told him I would not—at twelve o'clock next day I had made up my mind to give him into custody, and had a person with me who was on duty there, but I did not communicate to him what I wanted him for—that is all I have to say—the money that I had from him was, to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection, one pound ten shillings—he told me that I was to dispose of the watch as I thought proper, If he was not there the next day.—<hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT SWAN</hi>.

For my general good character, I beg to appeal to the officers of the Regiment I have served upwards of ten years. My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, in conclusion, I beg to state my innocence of the crime I am charged with: and, finally, to request your impartial and humane consideration of the facts; and, in throwing myself on your protection, I humbly rely on your favourable verdict, and leave my case entirely in your hands, with the full assurance that you will give me the benefit of any circumstances in my favour."</p>

            . I am a patrole. I was visiting my station, and found the watchman of the beat was not about; Harrison was with me; we were resting against a shutter stand; I saw the prosecutor against the lamp post; I saw the prisoner Smith slip the bundle from under his arm; Pullen was with her; she showed it to him - they then walked down Oxford-street together; we followed, and took Pullen with the property in his possession - and Harrison secured Smith; the prosecutor remained asleep; I said,</p>
               <p>"What are you doing with that property?" the woman said, his name is William, and he gave it to me to take care of; I said,</p>
               <p>"We will go back to William, and hear what he says;" I went and awoke him - he said it was his: Smith said,</p>
               <p>"William, do not you know me?" but he would not be persuaded that his name was William.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did he say in the watch-house that he should not give charge of them - A. He said something of the kind; I said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you bring them here;" I did not hear him say he could not say that he had not given it to her - he looked very stupid, and has been no in this Court; I was fifteen or twenty yards from them, where there was a gas light.</p>
               <p>- HARRISON. I took Smith; I saw her take the property from the prosecutor; they had got about fifty yards when I took her; she said she knew him - that his name was William, and he gave the things to her; he said he never saw her in his life.</p>

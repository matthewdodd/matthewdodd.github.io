                  </hi>. On the 27th of Jan. I acted as clerk to the Magistrate at Clerkenwell Police-court—after the evidence had been given against the prisoners, Tiediman said, "I gave the flags to Wheeler, I had nothing for them; I had a right to give them away."—Wheeler had been in custody on the 25th, and he then said, in reference to the stone, "I bought it of one of the masons at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot; I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Monday night, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Tuesday evening; Keefe saw me pay the money"—on the 29th Wheeler said, "I went to Tiediman, and asked if he had any old bits of paving for sale; he said yes; I asked what he wanted a foot; he said 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot; on Tuesday I had the remainder; I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and we had a pint of beer."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>are what was said on that occasion—after hearing the whole evidence, if the Magistrate thinks there is a case to send to this Court, he asks what they have to say, and then what they say is always returned to this Court—there are statements made, which are not returned—no communication is made to the Court on the occasion I have stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it in your knowledge that a prisoner is entitled to a copy of the deposition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but not of his examination, I believe—if the prisoner had come and asked for a copy of any depositions that I have, he would have had them—my practice is, when I furnish a copy of the depositions, (though I believe I am not required to do it) to give the attorney a copy of the ex<lb></lb>amination also, unless I had directions not to do it.</p>

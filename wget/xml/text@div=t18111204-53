            . I am a constable, I was standing at my door, the prisoner was leaning against the railing, I asked him what he wanted there, he said he was in great distress, he said he came from Hereford, or was going there, I cannot say which; it was about seven o'clock in the evening, I thought him to be a suspicious character, I was determined to follow him, I saw him go into Mr. Draper's house, I beckoned to a person that I supposed to be the landlady, and by the time I spoke he came out with the box coat on his arm, I asked him whose coat it was, he said it was his own, the sheets were wrapped up in the coat, they were quite warm then. I took him to the watchouse, I found half a twopenny loaf in his pocket, and four pennyworth of halfpence, in his waistcoat pocket I found three shillings and six-pence in silver. When he got to Marlborough Street office, he was known by the name of Johnson.</p>

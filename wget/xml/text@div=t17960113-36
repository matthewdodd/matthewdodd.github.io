             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pewterer; I know of the making of these pots, and the selling of them; I made these four pots, and sold them to Mrs. Keymer, a month or two months ago; they were brought to my shop for sale by the prisoner, he deals in pots, he goes about hawking of pots upon strings, and sells them at public-houses; he buys of me sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Keymer's name upon them? - A. Yes, and the Plough; they were brought to me the 4th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you buy old pots? - A. Yes; a great many thousands.</p>
               <p>I am sorry to hear it; for we hear so much of pots being stolen, and hear nothing of what becomes of them afterwards. - A. I changed with him for a dozen of new pint pots that he wanted; I have known him about five or six months only, to have any dealings with him; he came for a dozen of pint pots that he had bespoke of me, he offered me these four among other pots; I believe there might be about fourteen pounds; there was a dish or two that was owned before the Justice, among the pots, that all weighed the weight of my pots, and four of five ounces over.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no money to pay you then? - A. Yes; the workmanship, which is a certain price, fixed in trade, we weigh in and we weigh out, and charge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130067"></xptr>4s. for the workmanship of a dozen pint pots; after he had weighed the metal, he was going away, and I took up one of those pots of Mrs. Keymer, and, says I, halloa, where did you get these from? Why, says he, they are old pots that I have collected; I wish you would not take any notice of it; they were good pots, but bruised a good deal; he said he had bought them of a customer; he would take care in future not to bring me any more of that kind, if I would look over it this time; I told him I would not for 100l. pass it over; I was a very intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Keymer; he went his way about his business, and I let Mrs. Keymar know on the Sunday what I have let you know, gentlemen, that I had got some of her pots, and to consult with her; I knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a pewterer by trade, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a pewterer? - A. I believe, no more than your Worship is, there are many sham pewterers in the trade; Mrs. Keymer came to town, we took him before a Magistrate, and he was examined; there were some dishes found in his possession, and other pots he had to mend.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Several persons attended about other pots? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not other publicans attend, and say he had bought pots of them fairly? - A. Yes; there were three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they all said they had? - A. They all claimed their own pots that he had had to mend.</p>
               <p>Q. Now about these pots of Mrs. Keymer; he came to you at what time of the day? - A. I think it was in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in open day-light? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. On Holywellmount.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mrs. Keymer live? - A. She keeps the Plough, at Homerton.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - A. Three or four miles from Homerton.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from Homerton? - A. As much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he had them of a customer? - A. Yes; from Mr. Stevenson, who keeps the Woolpack, near Mrs. Keymer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Stevenson here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These pots had the mark of the Plough, and Mrs. Keymer's name upon it? - A. Three of them had, one of them was disfigured.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not taken into custdoy, though this examination had taken place; you said you should take no notice of it, and he went home that day? - A. As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not taken up by warrant and found at his own house? - A. Yes; on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were the pots he had to mend for the publicans part of the pots he sold you? - A. No; part of the pots were found at his house.</p>

               <p>Q. You never saw them, perhaps? - A. I never saw them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say you have dealt with this man as a pewterer two years? - A. Yes, and better.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband dealt with him at times? - A. No, Sir, nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever deal with him for pots about this time; how long before this had you dealt with him for pots? - A. I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Dealing so much with him then, you don't know exactly? - A. I have bought a great many of him, and lost a great many, and that he knows, or else I should have had no occasion to buy so many.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect buying some-pots in a washhouse behind your house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I keep the Woolpack, at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is it to the Plough? - A. Not above three hundred yards, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Keymer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; I have known him these three years, if not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any dealings with him? - A. Yes; we have bought a great many pots of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold him any? - A. No; my mistress has changed some pots with him, but I never did; when there were any pots that were cracked, or run, he used to take them with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see this man before he was taken up; how long before? - A. The day before; I was with Mrs. Keymer on Sunday, she sent for me, and I went to her, Mr. Philips was there; she asked me what was best to be done? and I told her she should take up the man; but when I came back, my wife was very angry; she said, she would lay under no such a scandal; I should go to London, and take him up: I did not know Where he lived, for he never put his place of abode to his bills and receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write them? - A. I believe so, am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us look at them? - A. I believe they are not his writing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stevenson. They were always brought ready wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Stevenson.) What passed when you saw him on the Monday; how came you to go there? - A. Mrs. Keymer had told me and Mr. Phillips, that this man said, he had them from the Woolpack; and my wife was very angry, and said, we should lay under no such scandal; I came to London, and met with him in the Curtain-road; I said, what is this you have been saying to Mr. Phillips, concerning some pots; where did you get them? Why, says he, I cannot say,; I had some from your house, some from the Mermaid, and some from the White Horse; I cannot justly say where I got them; I told him he had better go down to Mrs. Keymer; Mrs. Keymer had told me, that he said he had given Mrs. Stevenson sixpence a piece for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him, in answer? - A. I told him he had better go down with me; he said, he could not come then, but he would come at night.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Stevenson.) Did you sell him any post about that time? - A. Not to my knowledge; it might be that time that he called at our house, that he had three pint post and one quart, the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they these pots? - A. No; they had my own mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Phillips.) Did you engrave the name of Mrs. Keymer upon the pots you sold to Mrs. Keymer? - A. My son generally engraves them, or some of my people.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mrs. Stevenson.) Can you read? - A. Yes. (Reads one of the prisoner's receipts)</p>

               stealing goods to the value of 10d.
            </rs> (Aged 29.)</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury, before Mr. COMMON SERJEANT.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner; the defence you have set up is false; which now I have a right to say, by the verdict of the jury; I shall take care to enquire into the character of this woman; the attempt to throw an imputation of felony upon a witness living in credit, who could have no motive for doing it, is such an aggravation, that I shall think it my duty to take particular notice of your case.</p>

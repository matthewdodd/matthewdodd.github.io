               <p>Q. Were you quite sober? - A. I was not in liquor but what I new what I was about; I went out to the door to make water round the corner of the lane, and Chapman laid hold of me on one side, by the collar, and the baker on the other; the baker is not taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Chapman before, did you? - A. Yes; he shoved me right a-head down the lane, there were three of them; the baker knocked me down with a stick, Chapman on one side, and Horne on the other; the baker took the watch out of my pocket; I did not see Horne till the baker hit me upon the forehead, and the baker said then, d-n the b-r, kill him, then they all three ran away towards Gunnersbury; I came up on the Monday following to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the name and description of the baker, at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch since? - A. No; they never asked me for any money, I had only one shilling and three pence about me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give an account of this? - A. The Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober enough to know these people? - A. Yes; it was quite starlight, and I was quite clear that they were the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen either of these two men before that night? - A. yes; I have know Chapman, I suppose, two or three years, and I have known Horne pretty near two years, ever since he came to work at Mr. Wood's as a labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. These two prisoners are both labourers as well as yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take them up? - A. The Monday following; I took Chapman myself upon Ealing-Common; I took him by the collar and told him he must go along with me, he was at a cricket match, he turned round and said he would cut my bloody head off; one of the runners took the other at Action.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever robbed in your life before? - A. No; people gave out that I was robbed several times, that I had got a bad pocket, and the money slipped out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give evidence before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any reward for taking a highwayman? - A. Yes; I dare say there is forty pounds, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first told of that? - A. I have heard of that, I suppose, for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Chapman what you had taken him for? - A. No; the runners did at the public-house, when they searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say any thing, then you charged them with this robbery? - A. Not one thing at all, no more than what he said to me when I took him by the collar; I told him he must go with me, he said he would not, he would cut my bloody head off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen either of them that evening before? - A. Yes; I had seen them in the same public-house I was not in company with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to talk when you came out of the public house, which road you were going? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been out of the public-house before they overtook you? - A. Not two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might you have been drinking that evening? - A. I cannot tell; I suppose I might have drank about three pints in the course of the night, but I am sure that would not make me drunk; I had been hard at work all that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.This is a pretty good job you have made this time, you have no other witness? - A. I am my own witness.</p>
               <p>Q. And then expect you will be your own witness to eighty pounds you know? - A. I am very clear that they were the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to get eighty pounds? - A. No. I applied to the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you will be entitled to a share of eighty pounds? - A. If I have a right to it, I should give it to the runners.</p>
               <p>Q.This happened on Easter Eve, did not it? - A.Easter Sunday was the day following.</p>
               <p>Q.Where do you work? - A. At Gunnersbury; about half past seven o'clock, I received two guineas from my mistress.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick to that, that for five hours on settling your pay and the work, you drank no more than three pints of beer? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you drank before you came there? - A. None at all, only a pot of beer that we allow ourselves at dinner time.</p>

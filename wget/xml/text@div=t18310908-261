            . I live in Market-street, Newingtoncauseway, and am a general-dealer. I have known the prisoner some time - she keeps a marine-store shop, in Portpool-lane; I have heard that she is married. In July last (I cannot tell what day) I bought some paper of her, which I sold to Mr. Cohen; I sold it him by sample before I bought it in the bulk - Mr. Cohen had the same paper and quantity that I bought; I bought it of her on a Friday, and sold it to Cohen on a Monday, but I should state, that before I went to the prisoner's I met Mr. Cambridge, in Holborn, and he asked me if I was going to his daughter's (meaning the prisoner) - it was in consequence of what he said I went to her; I said that her father told me to call - she then said she had paper to sell, and fetched me about a quire as a sample, which she brought from up stairs; she asked 3d. per lb. for it - I offered her 21/2d.; she said she could not take that - that it was her father's property, and she sold it for him; I took the sample, and said I would let her know - I went to Mr. Cohen, showed it to him, and asked him 5d. per lb. for it; he offered me 4d. - I went back to the prisoner's, and bought one lot first; I think I then took three or four hundred weight, but I do not know exactly - she said it had been weighed before; I said I should like to see it weighed again, and a lad, who was in her shop, helped me to fetch it down stairs and weigh it - we got it from a little room on the first floor: I did not no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080120"></xptr>tice whether it was a bed-room or not - I do not exactly know what quantity I had in all; I paid her 3d. a pound for it, and sold it to Mr. Cohen for 4d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long before you went to her had you seen the father? A. Just before.</p>

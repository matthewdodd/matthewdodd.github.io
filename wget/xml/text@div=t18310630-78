On the 21st of July the female prisoner came and took my first floor, at 7s. 6d. a week - it was furnished; she promised to come the next day to tell me where to apply for a reference - next day both the prisoners came, without any bundle; they lived there till the 11th of November - they had paid me 1l. 2s. 6d. for rent, and when they went away there was about 3l. owing; I had not seen them from the night of the 10th of November - I had repeatedly asked for my rent; the woman borrowed a cloak of mine to go to Mr. Bailey's agent, in Suffolk-street, Strand; her husband had told me that he was a lieutenant in the Navy - when she came back she told me the agent was out of town, and she had to go again early in the morning, and if I would let her have the cloak she would pay me the money early in the morning; her husband was then up stairs - he was never to be seen; he never left my house from the 21st of July till the 11th of November - he always pretended to be ill; when they were gone I missed all the articles stated in the indictment - they had all been let to them except the cloak: I missed them between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - I went up and knocked at the door, and not receiving any answer I tried to look through the key-hole, but it was filled with butter; I had repeatedly been in the apartment before, but had not missed any of the articles till that day - I saw the female prisoner on the 3rd of June, and I saw my cloak the next Tuesday at Queen-square office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Were you good enough to offer to Mrs. Bailey the loan of your gown and bonnet also? A. She said she had not a gown and bonnet to go to the agent in, and I lent her mine on the day before, but on that day I declined lending her them, and only lent her my cloak; she was living with her husband all the time - her husband was never out.</p>

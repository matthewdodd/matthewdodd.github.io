I keep a coffee-house at 174, St. George's Street—on 17th March I went into a urinal in Cannon Street Road, about 3 p.m., and the prisoner, who was there, gave me a hard blow by my right ear, and then snatched my necktie with my gold pin in it—I got hold of him, we. struggled, and he threw them away—I let him go and picked them np—I kept close behind him through one street into another street—he went into a public-house—I got a policeman and gave him in custody—I never lost sight of him—it was a very hard blow—I felt it for two hours.</p>

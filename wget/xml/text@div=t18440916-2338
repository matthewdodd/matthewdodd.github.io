                  </hi>. I live in Bayne's-court, Cold Bath-square. I was driving a carriage on tlie 31st of Aug.—I missed a carriage-apron—I followed the prisoner, who had been pointed out to me by a boy, and I found the apron on the prisoner—I said to him, "Give me my property"—he said, "How long has it been your property?"—I said, "It was, about ten minutes ago"—this is the apron—it had been on the rumble, behind the carriage, and was nailed down—I was cut off and torn—here is where it has been partly cut and partly torn off—it belongs to my master, Mr. Thomas Eldridge, of Gray's Inn-road.</p>

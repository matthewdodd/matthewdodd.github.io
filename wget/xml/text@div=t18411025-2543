                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer. On the 13th of October I was in St. Martin's-lane, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I had a purse in my right-hand coat-pocket, containing seven half-crowns, three shillings, and two sixpences—I did not feel any thing at my pocket—I knew nothing of it till the policeman drew my attention to it, I then felt, and missed my purse—I saw Holmes with Sergeant Langley, when he asked me if I had lost my purse—this was about 100 yards past Northumberland-house—Sergeant Langley had hold of Holmes by the arm—he was close to me—I saw Dooley at the station the same afternoon—this is my purse, and its contents.</p>

I saw the two prisoners and another, at Charing-cross, a little after three o'clock that afternoon—they appeared to be in company together—I was in plain clothes—they followed a gentleman to Whitehall-place—he went into a house—they waited ten minutes, and then went away—I lost sight of them for some time; at last I saw them in St. Martin's-lane—they noticed the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, and followed him to Northumberland-house—I saw them all three go close to the prosecutor, Dooley's hand came from the prosecutor's pocket, and he put something into his breeches-pocket, and walked away—I told Walker to go after him—I took Holmes, and went after the pro<lb></lb>secutor, and asked if he had lost any thing—he said yes, his purse—the third one got away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Prestly, a turner, of Gloucester-road, East—on 28th November, at a little after 6 o'clock, I was in Cornhill, and there was a stoppage, caused by an omnibus crossing Gracechurch-street—I had my puree in my pocket, with a florin, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some stamps in it—there was a poet on my left side—the prisoner came up on my right side and gave me a rough push, which rose me off my feet, and in a moment he came and stood in front of me—I thought he was about to pass under the horses' heads, but he returned to my right side, and said, "You can't go yet"—I felt my portmonnaie safe before I crossed the road—the prisoner guided me across, and then I missed it—it was a dark-green one—the prisoner was still by my side—he then walked a little in advance of me and met another man, and they walked across the road—I</p>

               <p>met a policeman and pursued the prisoner, who did not leave, but kept a little in Advance of me—the policeman brought him back to me a short time—the prisoner is the man.</p>

The prosecutrix pointed out the prisoner and another man to me about half-past 6 o'clock in the evening—I caught hold of the other man, and then saw the prisoner with a green portmonnaie, which he was in the act of opening, but seeing me he ran away—I let the other man go, ran after the prisoner, and caught him in the dark part of the market, but did not find the purse on him—there were several waggons loaded with skins there, and I suppose he threw it into one of them—took him to the station and found 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

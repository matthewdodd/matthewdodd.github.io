            . Q. Where do you live. - A. At the Turk's Head, Phoenix street, St. Giles's. On the 22nd of February, about four o'clock, I met with the prisoner in Bridgwater gardens; I had business to do in Fleet street, so we went up Goswell street into Fleet market.</p>

             public house. - A. I only stopped there to drink a pint of beer with the landlord; coming out I met James Burke, I gave him something to drink; I drank part of a glass of gin with him, and I tasted part of a glass of brandy and shrub at a chandler's shop, along with some old customer's of mine; then I went down Fleet market with the prisoner into Fleet street; we stopped at the Angel, I drank a glass of gin and peppermint, and throwed the other in the saveall; I drank there only one glass, I paid for two; then I went up Fleet street, I called at Mr. Radley's the brandy merchant, to order some goods; I cannot say whether I drank any thing at Mr. Radley's or not; I tasted some shrub and water. We then went up to Wych street, we had a glass of mulled wine in the new mulled wine shop; from there I went to Mr. Kendrick's in Drury lane; we had there two shillingsworth of rum and water between five of us, then I went to the Black Dog.</p>

               <p>Q. What had you there. - A. Two small glasses of brandy and some cold water; after that I treated the prisoner with another glass at the Compasses; I had none there.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you were pretty drunk. - A. No, I was not, I was in liquor certainly; I was merry, I could walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not reckon any body drunk that can walk. - A. Yes I do; when I came out of the Compasses I was going home; the prisoner was about two paces behind me, he catched hold of this arm, I felt him put his hand into my waistcoat pocket; as soon as he felt me endeavouring to put my hand into my waistcoat pocket, he put his elbow against me, and with his other hand he shoved me down in the middle of the street, and then he ran away. When I got up I put my hand in my pocket, I found I had lost my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you missed. - A. I cannot tell exactly; I had two guineas, six or seven half guineas, about six, seven, or nine seven shilling pieces; I had felt this money at the Black Dog, I saw it there when I was paying for the liquor.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 29th of February; I found none of the property on him that the prosecutor could speak to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, my poverty prevents me from having counsel to defend me. I have every reliance upon your lordship's humanity to ask these questions of the prosecutor, which I have no doubt will state my innocence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. The house that you went to first in Drury lane was the Compasses, Kendrick's house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Kendrick when he desired you to have some more rum and water; that you had no money. - A. I do not recollect; I might say so in a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you apply to the prisoner to lend you a shilling at the George. - A. I did; he lent me a shilling for the purpose of paying for the rum and water; I did not pay it with his money, I borrowed a shilling out of a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand how you will force in that - I ask you now, upon your oath, whether upon the man applying to you for more rum and water, you did not tell them you had no more money, and whether you did not borrow a shilling of him to pay for the rum and water. - A. I believe I did.</p>

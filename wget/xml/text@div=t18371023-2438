                  </hi>. I am a dustman, and live in Moss-fields, Vauxhall-walk, Surrey. I had a donkey and colt, which I turned out into Short's fields on the 13th of October—there was nothing to prevent them straying into the road, but they never did so—on the following afternoon I went to Smithfield-market to buy a cart, and saw my donkey there being offered for sale—I stopped it and the man who had charge of it, upon which James Wells came up and said something to me, and I gave Wells into custody—the donkey was given up to me—it was worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Con naught-terrace, and am a butcher—the prisoner was in my employ. On the 6th of October I saw a blue frock concealed between the wainscot of my passage and the shop—it was yond my reach—I took a stick and touched it, and heard a dish rattle a little further round—I then got a policeman to watch my premises—I have no doubt this mutton and beef are mine, and the suet I can swear to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly fifteen years—the prisoner has been with me since April—he went to market for me three or four days a week—I did not always give him the money—I never sent him to purchase on his own credit, and never knew of his pawning his watch to get goods for ray shop, or of his pawning any thing—I generally sent some money to market—I once sent a bill enclosed to a certain party, confidentially, which was re<lb></lb>fused—I had not credit with the person—I expected to get credit, not having money—the prisoner has never supplied me with goods or property of his own when I could not get credit—my credit is not good in the market—I owe the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never been applied to for it, except from his father—his father applied to me for his wages, and I withheld them on one particular account—I told him I would send them on one occasion—I did not pay him, because I did not know how much I might be brought in debt for other things—I did not fix a day to pay him—I said I would not pay him till I knew what was owing at Newgate-market—I never said I would not pay him till after this trial was over—I did not say I would</p>

               <p>send it him on the Wednesday—I said I would send him the money-the father came for the prisoner's clothes—I sent a servant up with him and he took them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long is it ago since an accident happened to your scales? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I do not know—I always regulated them every morning but I had not regulated them one morning, and they were found rather short of balance by the Jury when they came—that was the only day that I forgot to regulate them—they are elm scales, and they will vary according to the weather—I regulate them with lead, so that they may be on a ba<lb></lb>lance—I think the Jury came to my house about eleven o'clock—I had sold something that morning—the Jury did not cut up my scales—they chopped a chain or two—I got one new scale, and got the other regulated by, a scale-maker—I was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—The Jury come once a month—they came by surprise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time the prisoner came into your service, have you ever paid him a single shilling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but Mrs. Fletcher did—she is not here—I do not know how much she paid him—she paid him according as he requested it, with the exception of one occasion—on one occasion be requested leave to go into the country—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to him—he requested to have the money, and she paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see it, but she told me so—I think she had paid him in my presence—I will not swear it—he never asked me for his wages—he might have asked my wife in my presence—I do not remember that he has asked for wages repeatedly, and could not get a farthing—I do not remember that I have asked him to take a few shillings at a time—I might have been present when he has been asked to take a few shillings at a time, and I not hear it—I might have heard it—I cannot call to recollection whether I did or not—the only amount that I know he received was that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot swear that he got that—he was to have had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he never applied to me for wages, that I swear—the first application I had was from his father—I did not refer his father to my wife, as she was not in the way—the first time his father applied I had not the money in the house—he applied twice—I had the money on the last occasion—I have no idea but that he can receive his wages at any time, if he is convicted or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were first at the police-office did you not say you could not identify any of the meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I said I believed it to be mine—I said I could identify part—I can identify this suet—this piece of steak I can identify from the piece it is cut off of—I had three persons in my house, the prisoner, and a lad under him, and a maid-servant—the prisoner had partly the management of my shop, but not almost entirely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you spend much of your time in the Quebec public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the evening, and I have been there from two to four o'clock in the afternoon—I have been there perhaps two or three days a week—I have been at the Clanricca public-house perhaps an hour or two in the week—I never was in the Horse and Groom public-house in my life to sit down—I have been in there, and taken a glass perhaps, two or three days in a week—there is no place to sit down there—I have sat down in the other houses—I will not swear that I have not sat down when I could not stand—this meat is not worth much now—I valued it at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I can swear to part of it, but part of it may not be mine—I have not the least doubt of its all having been in my shop—I think the prisoner had been to market for</p>

               <p>me on the Thursday, the Friday, and the Saturday before he was taken—I think I gave him on the Saturday, when he went to market, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he laid out, I think, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told Mrs. Fletcher he paid the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his own pocket—I do not know how often he has paid for me when I had not given him money to pay, but whatever he has paid has been returned to him by Mrs. Fletcher when he brought the notes, but latterly he has not brought notes—I did not see Mrs. Fletcher pay him the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I should say the did pay it—I should say that I have seen her pay money to him which he has advanced in Newgate-market, but really I do not recollect how often nor to what amount—it is down in the book, but I have not brought it here—I do not know what was the largest sum I ever trusted him to go to Newgate-market with; it was upwards of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say any thing to this effect, that you would not be ques<lb></lb>tioned, and if you were not asked any questions you would be lenient to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at his father's request—I did not say if I was questioned I would press as severely as possible against the prisoner—I said nothing of the kind—when he was remanded, I came back and I met his father in the Court—he said, "They have employed a solicitor"—"Very well," says I, if they employ a solicitor and cross-examine me, I must enter fully into the case"—those were the words I used—the fact was this, his father was a very respectable man I understood—I had nothing in my mind except good feeling towards him—I did not know who was robbing me—I know I have been robbed to an enormous amount.</p>

I was sent for, and waited out<lb></lb>side the prosecutor's house till half-past ten o'clock on Sunday morning, the 6th of October—I then saw the prisoner come out with a bundle—I followed, and came up to him—I said, "Yon have got some meat belong<lb></lb>ing to Mr. Fletcher"—he said, "It is all right"—I said, "I don't know, I think you had better come back to Mr. Fletcher"—he said, "Don't be too hard, it is only a bit of steak"—I took him back, and he had this meat and the kidney.</p>

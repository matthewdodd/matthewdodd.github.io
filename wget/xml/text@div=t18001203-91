             and William Haydon: I took stock on the 9th of October; there was not then any deficiency; we had a porter of the name of William Brady; he was discharged on Saturday previous to the 24th of October; there was no stock taken between the 9th and 24th; there was then deficient one chest of congou tea, and one chest of fouchong tea. On Monday, the 27th of October, I saw a chest of tea at the Mansion-house, the property of Messrs. Basire and Haydon.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that it was in your warehouse on the 9th of October? - A. No, I cannot, but there was no deficiency upon that day, (the chest produced); here is a mark of my making with a marking-brush, "13," on the 26th or 27th of March last, that signifies the 13th break.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say whether any of that break was sold by your master? - A. Not one single chest; we have made all the enquiries we could after Brady, but have not been able to find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr Alley. Q.I suppose you know what the stock is, from what the surveyor tells you? - A. I always take stock with the surveyor.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, when the surveyor came, you did not know the exact number of chests then in the warehouse? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Your master has sold a great number of chests since the month of March last? - A. Yes, but not of that break.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not by comparing the entries on time with abother, that you find there is any tea missing? - A. I could not ascertain that any tea was missing till I took the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is by comparison with the book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Then I trust your Lordship will strike this evidence out, as not being the best that the nature of the case affords.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Are you sure, without examining any books, that there was any tea missing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PARSONS sworn. - Examined by Mr Knowlys. I keep the Rummer on Old Fish-street-hill: On the Sunday before the loss of the tea was discovered, the prisoner came to my house, and desired me, if any person should call to enquire for a man of the name of Brady, who had come to my house that morning before - he had hurt his leg, and was brought to my house in a coach - to send him over to his house, No. 9, Labour-in-vain-court; in the afternoon I saw the prisoner go out in a coach; on Monday and Tuesday I met them again walking together; at that time I did not know that he was discharged from Mr. Haydon's service.</p>

            , Aug. 1, 1753, I believe the defendant at the bar is the woman that swore it. I remember her the better, she being with me 2 or 3 times about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her sign it?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I believe I saw her sign it, or acknowledge it to be her mark, and also that I swore her, which is always done previous to the caption. I have no doubt in the world but that the person who signed this information was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is a place erased, and also an interlineation in another place on it; did you observe them before it was sworn?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I can't say I remember them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. I saw the woman at the bar come to Guildhall, and heard Mr. Thomas administer the oath to her. I kept the door there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say this is the information, which she swore, without alteration ?</p>
               <p>Hill I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to live with her?</p>
               <p>S. Jacobs. I was with her to appraise some pawned goods to make a sale of them; she brought them with her from Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what reason she gave for her saying so?</p>
               <p>S. Jacobs. I know not the reason. But she said they were a combination of thieves and blackguards, and Mr. Salt at the Gatehouse was the biggest of them all, and that she would make beggars of them all; I have heard her say she did not know them to be acquainted with them. She sent for me, when she went out of her house, and said, Mrs. Jacobs you are a very honest woman, your word will go in a court, you never was brought in question; you must swear that Thorp, Ashmore and Rowland came every day to the door, and threatened to have us out life and limb when we came upon trial (this was after she could not get bail) She told me she was sadly afraid Mr. Waters does not do me justice; come along with me and let me examine him. He gave her but little encouragement in her affair, and she seemed to be afraid of him. She said also, that Stevens's character was so bad that she would not take her trial with him, for if she did she should be cast; and you must say he is gone you know not where; she said she would say so, and then I might after her; said I, can you say so before the face of a judge, when you put him out of the way for a day or two?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in her house?</p>
               <p>L. Jacobs. I was 4 months there; I never saw her since because I would not swear it. The reason of my going to her first was, my husband had pawned some things there, when she lived in the Broad-way, Westminster, and she was gone and we could not find her; at last we found her in Goswell street, and she said we were forced to come away from there because there was no peace.</p>

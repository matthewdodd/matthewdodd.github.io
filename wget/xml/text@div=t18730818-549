I live at 10, George Street, Woolwich—I am a Police pensioner—on Saturday night, 28th July, I was in Powis Street, about 9.30, looking at a man selling umbrellas—two or three people hustled by me, and I heard something <hi rend="italic">snck</hi>—I looked down and saw my watch in the prisoners hand—I <hi rend="italic">collared him</hi>, and said "Where is that watch you just now took out of my pocket?—he said "I have got no watch"—I said "I don't suppose you have passed it"—I held him and gave him in custody.</p>

I work at the Royal Arsenal-on Saturday night, 28th July, I was in Powis Street, with my wife, looking at a man selling umbrellas—I heard something snap; I saw a watch in the prisoner's hand, and a chain fall to the prosecutor's front—the prisoner ran between two men—I followed him, and saw him caught by the prosecutor.</p>

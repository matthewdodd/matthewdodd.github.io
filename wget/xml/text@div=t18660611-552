                  </hi>. I am a gentleman living on my private fortune, at 34, Gloucester-gardens, Hyde-part—I received a letter, about the 14th of May, by post—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in coneequence of the receipt of that letter, which requested me to send a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to a certain place, I placed myself in communication with the police within half an hour of the receipt of it—in consequence of what they said, I put a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in an envelope, and directed it to "A. A., 5, Connaught-terrace"—I know nothing of the prisoner—I discharged a female servant rather more than twelve months ago—there is not one iota of truth in the vile imputation contained in this letter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, X</hi> 63). I took this letter to 5, Connaught-terrace on the evening of 14 th—it is a coffee-shop—I saw the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note put into it first—in company with another officer, named Bone, I kept watch on the house, in plain clothes, that evening, so that I could see what was going on without being seen—about 11 o'clock I saw the prisoner drive up to the door of the coffee-shop—there was nobody in his cab—he got off the box, and went to the door, and knocked, and I heard him say, "Is there a letter for A. A.?"—Mrs. Greigson said, "Yes, there is one," and went into the shop—the prisoner went a few paces into the passage—Mrs. Greigeson then returned with the letter, and gave it to him as he was coming down the steps leading into the street—he broke the envelope—I then said to him, "Whose letter is that?"—he said, "It is mine"—I said, "I shall take you into custody"—the letter was quite open, and his hands were on the con<lb></lb>tents of it—his hand was on the note when I spoke to him—he then said, "It is not my letter; it is for a gentleman in my cab"—I walked with him to his cab, and there was no one there—it was quite impossible for any one to have jumped out of the cab after he drove up, without my seeing it—I</p>

               <p>had a clear view of the road while he was driving up, and until I took him into custody—nobody could have opened the cab door on the other side and have jumped out without my having seen it—this is not a low coffee-house—it is rather a respectable house—it was a very bad place at one time, but since the new people have had charge of it it is better.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate</hi>:—"On last Thursday night, the 17th of this month, about 11, I was along Cambridge and Oxford-terrace; a gentleman hailed me, and I got down to open the cab-door; the gentleman got into the cab, and told me to drive to a coffee-house in Connaught-ter<lb></lb>race; this was at the Duke of Kendall public-house; he said, "Don't open the door, but ask if there is a letter left for Captain Davidson." I asked the servant in the bar, and she said there was no letter there; the gentleman then told me to drive to 5, Connaught-terrace. I drove there; he was then inside the cab, and he said, 'I am not going to get out; I want you to knock at that door, and ask if there is a letter for A. A.' I got off my cab, and knocked. The door was opened by that female, and I said, 'I have got a gentleman in my cab, and he sent me to ask you if you have got a letter for A. A.' She said, 'Yes,' and went into the back room. I went back to the cab, and then went to the door, into the shop. I was in complete dark<lb></lb>ness where I stood; Mrs. Greigson was at the far end of the shop; she came to me and put the letter into my hand. I walked out of the shop; a man followed me out and said, 'What have you got there?' I said, 'I have got a letter.' He took it out of my hand. I said, 'I have got a gentleman in my cab, and I said, 'Look, the cab-door is open, the gentleman is gone.'</p>

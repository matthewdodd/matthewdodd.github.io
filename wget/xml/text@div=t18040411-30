I went with the seven-shilling piece to get a shilling to give the prisoner; then I told Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones followed her, I went after him, and lifted up her great coat, and saw something under her gown; we took her back, and sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. This young woman desired to have some handkerchiefs shewn her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The handkerchiefs she took was perfectly in your view? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her put them on the counter? - A. Yes, and I saw her put them quite plainly into her right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. It was done quite open? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What distance were you at the time? - A. I was on the other side of the counter; when we shew any of these articles, we always take particular notice of what is doing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. This woman was a relation of one John, that she asked for? - A. Yes; he has been at our house about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that John standing by her? - A. He was standing at the left hand side of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her what was the price of these things? - A. No; they are marked G S F, that was seven shillings and sixpence; she had not asked the price.</p>

I have known the prisoner twenty years; I married his wife's mother - I allowed him and his wife to live in my house without paying rent; he had lived there four years and three quarters - he is a gardener by trade - he brought some furniture of his own to my house, but the articles he took were not in the room he occupied; they were in one of my rooms - I missed them before he left my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Is your wife alive? A. No; the prisoner's wife looks after my house, and I let them live there for that - the prisoner is not in regular employ, he is only a jobber - I went out of town for fifteen or sixteen days - I left two pounds with the prisoner's wife to pay incidental expences - I did not pay them any wages - I don't think the prisoner was in employ when I went out of town; but I heard that he earned money while I was away, from Mr. Batson - the prisoner's wife is still looking after my house, I left her at home ill this morning - I never ordered the prisoner off my premises, but I have said to other persons that I should be glad if he would take his wife and go off.</p>

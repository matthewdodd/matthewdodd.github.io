                  </hi>. I am in the service of Henry Tucker and others, silk mercers, in Trump-street. On the 26th of April the prisoner came to the warehouse—he wanted sixty pieces of Korahs (that is East India silk hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs) for a shipping order to Hamburgh; and he wished to have them on approbation for the approval of a third party, if he chose forty or fifty pieces out of them he would return them to us to ship, and the others were to be returned to us—this is the invoice that was sent with the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This invoice says, "Bought on approbation;" that is, that the party buying had a right to reject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it quite understood that these were to be re<lb></lb>turned for shipment, supposing they were bought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not sell them outright to the prisoner, but we keep no memorandum-book in our es<lb></lb>tablishment—we keep no waste-book, therefore we send out an invoice of this sort, and put on it "On approbation"—if the prisoner had wanted to purchase for himself I should not have let him had them—I had no authority to let him have them—I was not to be brought in communication with the third party; but some of these were to be selected, then returned to me, and I was to ship them—our terms for these goods were nett cash—it was under<lb></lb>stood by me that the prisoner wished to have them for about a couple of days—part of them would have been rejected, or the whole might have been kept—in either case we should have shipped them—I should not have parted with them except on those terms—I directed them to be sent to Bucklers-bury with the invoice—I went there about four days afterwards, and found the prisoner's premises were closed—I was not able to find the prisoner.</p>

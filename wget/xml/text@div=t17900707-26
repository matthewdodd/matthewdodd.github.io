               <p>I am a labouring man. Three weeks ago, I was going to my labour between four and five, and I met the three prisoners in Mr. Welling's field, about two hundred yards farther than her house: they were going to where the goods lay, in a ditch: there was three bonnets, a boy's hat, a tea-chest, a bird cage, and a canary in it: they were coming across a field where there was no road. I went to my master's yard, and met Mr. Croker; and I followed the prisoners out of Mr. Welling's yard: I saw them all in the ditch, and come out of the ditch; and I went with Croker, and we met them in the same field where the goods were; and Croker drew his cutlass; and Wall threw away the tea-chest, and I ran after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Wall walking or talking with the rest? - He was about two yards from the other two: I saw Croker stop the other two.

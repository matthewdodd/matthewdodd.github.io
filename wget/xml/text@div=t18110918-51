            . On the 26th of July I was in Baker-street North. I saw the prisoner and another man, they come over the area rales of No. 1, Park-place, as the prisoner was coming over; I saw a silver spoon drop from his left hand pocket, and I saw him pick it up again; I called to him, I said, what have you been at there, that is not your property, he made some answer, and away he ran; I cried out stop thief; I missed him, and catched sight of him in Park-street again; I followed him until he was taken, and brought back to No. 1, Park-place; I put my hand into his left hand pocket; I said, you have not got the spoon, what have you done with it; he said he knew nothing about it. He was stopped, and taken in Lord's Cricket ground; I am sure he is the same man that came over the area rails of No. 1, Park-place, and the the spoon dropped out of his pocket; I called the servant girl up and the pie had been removed into the coal-place, and he had ate almost all the pie, and taken the spoon away.</p>

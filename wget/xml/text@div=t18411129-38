                  </hi>. On the 23rd of October the prisoner was taken into custody at the British Museum—before that two books called "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and "The Baronet" were discovered to be missing from the library—those now produced are them—they are the property of the Museum—it is usual to affix marks on the books belonging to the Museum—there is generally a mark put on the title-page—this book, "The Hunchback" bad three tide-pages, being in a collection, and in one of them was a mark, and that title-page is torn off—another stamp was also put at the end of the book, and that is also torn off—the "Baronet" has also the appearance of having had the title page torn out—I see no altera<lb></lb>tion of any thing at the end—the two books are worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in conse<lb></lb>quence of a communication made to me by some of our officers I went to Mr. Hewitt's, a bookseller in Holborn, and found "The Baronet" on a shelf there—the other volume bad been brought to me previously.</p>

On Saturday night, the 19th of April, the prisoner, Jordan, took a furnished room in our house. Smyllie passed as his wife. They slept there on Saturday and on Sunday, and on Monday I went to Greenwich, about twelve o'clock, leaving them at home; Smyllie promised to take care of the house until I returned. About half an hour before I went, the landlord called for my rent. I took out a pocket-book in her presence, and gave him three sovereigns, leaving nine. She saw me do it, and the money jinked as I put the pocketbook into a box under the bed. I locked it, put the key into my pocket, and told her I was going to Greenwich with my children, and gave her the key of the door. I returned about eight o'clock, found the door locked, and the key on the table in their room; they were both gone. I found my box broken open, and the pocket-book and money gone, with the other property stated in the indictment, I have found none of them. We apprehended them on Wednesday at the Horse-Guards; Smyllie was then dressed with a new bonnet and feathers like a lady, and when she came to live with us she had but one gown.</p>

            . I belong to the 3d regiment of Guards. On the 29th of April Hossack described Jordan to me. I saw the prisoners about half-past 10 o'clock next morning, at the King's-mews Barracks, and had them apprehended. I knew neither of them before. Smyllie was dressed in a plaid gown, a new bonnet, and shawl. Nothing was found on them.</p>
               <p>JORDAN'S Defence. I asked this woman to go with me to the fair; she said she had promised to get the lodger his tea; but after tea we went. I met a comrade, and staid with him until Wednesday morning, and on going to the Mews was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and tea-dealer, and keep a post-office at No. 86, Upper-street, Islington. On Thursday, 28th Sept., I marked three half-crowns and one shilling, between four and six o'clock in the afternoon—I put them in my till—there was no other half-crown there—the prisoner was my shopman—he had been in my service about twelve months before, as a warehouseman—about two hours after I had put the money in the till, the half-crowns were all gone—I had only been in to take my tea—there had been two or three customers in the shop—I had an engage<lb></lb>ment out, and did not return till ten at night; my shop was then shut up—I did not say anything to the prisoner till the Monday evening following, when be came in and told me he thought he should not be able to get through the work, that he must leave—I said, "Why?"—I had not made any complaint—I then said, "Wareham, you have been robbing me "—he paused, and seemed very much confused, and said, "Will you forgive me, sir?"—I said, "That depends on circumstances"—I then asked what money he had in his pocket—he said he did not know—I said, "Certainly you know what you have got; what have you got up-stairs?"—he said he did not know—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in custody—he was searched at the station, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one half-crown found on him, but not one of those I had marked—the policeman came back with me and<lb></lb>the prisoner, and searched his boxes—there was found 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in his trowsers pocket—his wages were 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but he had not been paid, as he had not been a quarter with me—among the money, I identified this half-crown—I have no doubt of its being mine—I cannot speak to any of the other money.</p>

I know this cock - it hung over a tub, and came from a neighbour's house to mine; it was fixed to the wall of my own private house - my husband rents the house; I had seen it safe on the night of the 14th of April, when we went to bed - this pipe came from my neighbour's wash-house, and branched into my yard; when I got up in the morning, it had been cut off, and a small part of the pipe from the wash-house of the next house, which was empty; the persons who got into the next house could have taken it away without coming into my yard - I have seen them in the officer's possession, and know them: the prisoner was taken in the course of that day.</p>

            . I live in George-street, Stepney, and am a labourer, in the employ of Mr. Nott, of Jamaica-street. My father was getting up on the 15th of April, and saw the two prisoners - I went down into the yard, and missed the water-pipe from our premises; we had no cock- my father sent me after the prisoner; I found them in company, about a quarter of a mile off - I ran and called Stop thief! Vigo dropped a bag from under his coat; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110127"></xptr>had known Holland before; he had lived in the empty house which they had been in; Holland put down a white wash-hand bason near the kennel; I ran and took up the bag, and gave it to my mother - there was some pipe in it, and about seven brass cocks; the prisoners got away then, but they were taken the same day; I am quite certain they were the persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner VIGO. Q. Where did you first see me? A. In Redman's-row, a quarter of a mile from the prosecutors; it was between five and six o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 15th of April, I was going off duty at twenty minutes before six o'clock, I met Levett running after two men - I told him no one had passed my beat but the two prisoners; I saw Vigo drop a blue bag - I just opened the mouth of it, and saw some cocks and leaden pipe in it; they got away then, but were taken the same day; I saw them before the Magistrate, and knew them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DICKINSON. I am an officer.

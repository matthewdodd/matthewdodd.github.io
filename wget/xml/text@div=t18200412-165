I could not see any person near me when I lost it - I called out Stop thief! I could not see the features of the person that robbed me. I lost sight of him - I pursued, but did not see him till he was stopped - it was Harrison. The other was not taken till the Saturday week following. On the 1st of April, I saw my watch again - it was dark at the time.</p>

            . I live in Dog-street, Rosemary-lane. I was in Osbourn-street, when Mr. M'Queen was robbed. I saw three persons together. I was crossing from the corner of Church-street to Booth-street, and heard a little of their conversation. I am not certain that either of the prisoners were part of the three - one of them said,</p>
               <p>"Will you stick to me?" They answered they would as close as the shirt to his back. About five minutes after I saw two of them make a rush upon Mr. M'Queen - they both came up to him. I did not see what they did at the time - they lugged away the lady from his arm, and something from him. Mr. M'Queen ran about half-way down Booth-street, and fell down, and I fell likewise. I got up immediately. I lost sight of him till he (Harrison), was in custody at the watch-house. I cannot say that he was one of them. In going to Worship-street, on the Saturday, I saw Dyson there, I said I thought he was one of the party, and he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was coming out of my residence, Pussey's-court, Booth-street, I heard the cry of Stop him! I saw three men running down the street, I went after them and called out Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Were the three persons in sight when you saw Mr. M'Queen fall - A. I lost sight of Harrison when he turned the corner. When I got to the same corner, he was the only person in the street. I came up to him in John-court, and stopped him - he was the same man I first pursued. I called out Stop thief! and he did the same. When I came up to him, he said</p>
               <p>"Why do you stop me, I am not the man, he is gone through the court - I was in pursuit of him as well as you." The watch was picked up at the corner of the same street where the prisoner turned. He did not stop, neither did I see him throw anything away. I saw Dyson on the 1st of April, at the watch-house door - I have no recollection of him.</p>
               <p>(Watch produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HARRISON'S Defence. I am innocent of the charge. I was coming out of my door and heard the cry of Stop thief! A gentleman came up and said I was the thief - he called to me to stop, and I did.</p>

I offered him the change; he said, "No, I have got holes in my pockets, I will lend you that for your wife and family." When we got to Enfield he burst the door of this house open and asked me to go in. I said, "No, I won't, I will go home; here is your ticket," and as I was going along I got knocked down and lost the ticket. I was taken to the police-station, and they took that newspaper from me and ripped it in two, and now bring it forward as evidence against me.</p>

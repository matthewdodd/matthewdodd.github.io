             I cannot find since I was taken up, she asked me what I thought of her niece, I said, I thought she was a very fine girl; she asked me, if I would have her, for she knew the situation she was in, and I said, I did not know whether I was married or not, for I was in a state of inebrity at the time; she has been down to the county of Durham to see my friends.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Peter's-street, Westminster.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, in attending to the evidence. you see that both marriages are proved, therefore he must be convicted; at the same time, I have seen enough in this case to convince me that it is not one of those cases in which severe punishment ought to be inflicted; you will therefore find him guilty, and leave the punishment to the Court.</p>

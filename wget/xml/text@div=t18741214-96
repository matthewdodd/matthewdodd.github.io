At 1.30 on the morning of the 26th November, (that is after midnight), I was on duty in Boyd Street, Whitechapel, when the prisoner and a woman came along shouting—he was the worse for liquor—I requested him to be quiet as the people who had gone to bed wanted to sleep and not to be disturbed at that hour of the morning—the prisoner then struck me on the breast and my helmet fell off in a doorway—while I was stooping to pick it up he said "Give me a poker, I will have the b——y b——r out of this; it is my house"—I picked up my helmet and he struck me over the left side of the head with a file—he had not the file when I first saw him—this was inside the house, while I was picking up my helmet—the door was open and I went into the house—I fell against a table and overturned the table—he also hit me on the right hand which afterwards swelled—Constable 162 came up and I called him into the house, and took him to the station—I have not been able to do duty since—I have been under the care of Mr. Phillips, Burgeon.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 162). I was in Boyd Street on the morning in question—I saw Stewart, the prisoner, and a woman in the street—Stewart asked the prisoner to go along quietly without making a noise and disturbing the inhabitants—I did not see his helmet fall off—he had it on when I first saw him—I saw it afterwards—the constable called to me to secure the man, and said "I am struck"—and I saw his head bleeding.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I was a few yards off—I could not see you if you did strike the constable—I did not see the constable stoop in the street to look for the helmet—I did not see when you and your wife went indoors—the door was open—I thought before, the door was closed—the constable was standing before you in the house—you were standing very close behind I should say—I was not close enough to see you strike him in the street—his helmet fell into the house—I think the house was down steps—the constable did not fall down the steps against the table—I heard the table go over with all the crockery on it, but that was after you struck him—I heard you say "Out of this, I will have you out"—I heard you say when you struck the constable" You are in my house, what are you doing"—the door was open—I don't know who opened it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of No. 2, Spital Square—I saw Stewart on the evening of the 26th November—I found a lacerated wound on the right hand side of the head, about 4 inches long, exposing the pericranium—the bone was exposed by sloughing—he is still under my care and I can not say how long he may be unable to do duty—I think such an instrument as that file would produce such a wound.</p>

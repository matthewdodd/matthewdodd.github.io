On the 18th of October I was told he was detected in stealing some, by Mr. Barley the King's officer. I went to the upper end of the yard where he was: Mr. Barley told me he had taken some tea from him. It is customary. when the men are discharged at 2 o'clock, that they should be rubbed down by one of the customhouse elders, or one of the King's officers.</p>

On the 18th of October, as Mr. Barley was discharging the people, he found some tea in the prisoner's pocket; I was present at the taking of it out: he took some out of one of his pockets; the prisoner said that was all: after that he found about three or four ounces concealed in a handkerchief in his breeches.</p>

            . In discharging the men at 2 o'clock I found a little tea in the prisoner's coat pocket: I asked what he had there; he said, nothing. Then I took him into the counting-house, and called Mr. Prosser in; and in searching the prisoner farther I found that tea (produced) in a handkerchief in his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of it?</p>
               <p>Barley. There is 3 or 4 ounces.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property is this tea?</p>
               <p>Barley. This was on St. Luke's day: there were no warehouses open then but the teas making up for the company, and the prisoner was at work in those warehouses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was moving of goods; the chests being bad some tea ran out; I being a stranger to the custom of the place I took a little of it up, fearing it should be trodden under feet, thinking they would have thrown it to the dunghill. I had been there but 2 or 3 months; I did not know the rules of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110036"></xptr> the warehouses before; I was recommended from the country.</p>
               <p>Q. to Barley. When did the prisoner come to work in the warehouses?</p>
               <p>Barley. He came the 13th of August last.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bell. I keep the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch street; I have known the prisoner upwards of 12 years; I never heard any thing against his character in my life. He kept coaches once, and used to come to my house. He was a man of substance; he was concerned in the Dover coach. He came to misfortunes, and was recommended to work in the India company's warehouses.</p>

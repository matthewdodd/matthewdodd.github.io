               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You trusted the entire management of the farm to him? A. Yes, he did not buy and sell at his discretion - he has perhaps bought corn, which he got from a person I sent hay to; he frequently sold hay without consulting me - he took it to market, and when he wanted corn for the horses, he got it from the person I sent hay to; I charged him before the Magistrate with not accounting to me for what he had sold, and I produced the receipts for these two particular sums the Magistrate dismissed him, and ordered the book to be given him to see if there were any errors; it was returned to me in about a week - it contains an account of goods sold to persons for me, and at the end is a general statement of his account; that has been made since he was before the Magistrate - I had a previous account, in which he marked some errors; here is one of 3l. which is now added - the account is headed "Cash received;" he charges himself with gross sums, without naming persons, and makes a total of 731l. 1s. 8d. - he then strikes a balance, making 9l. 5s. due to me; the two sums in question amount to between 8l. and 9l.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you prove these sums are not in the account he renders? A. These sums are taken from accounts in the book; and they are not named in those accounts - he once mentioned an error of 3l. to me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you gone through them to see if you have received the sum of 2l. 17s. or 5l. 8s.? A. He never gave me either; his duty was always to hand over the money to me, not to lay it out - it is the information I received from Mr. Wells which makes me prosecute him; neither of these sums are mentioned in his account, which embraces the time before and after October.</p>

            . I am a hay-salesman, and live at Hendon. I was in the habit of selling hay for the prosecutor, which was brought by the prisoner for that purpose: on the 2nd of September, 1830, I sold for the prosecutor, by the prisoner's directions, a load of hay for 3l.; my commission was 5s., and I gave the balance to the prisoner - on the 5th of October I sold a load for 3l.; and on the 25th of September, one for 2l. 18s.; making together 5l. 18s.; my commission was 10s., and I paid him 5l. 8s. at once; we generally settled once a week - I was before the Magistrate at Hendon; these two sums were mentioned there - the prisoner was dismissed to make up his books; he called on me three or four days after, and saw this account; the said he had not had the load of hay on the 2nd of September - he marked it, and said I ought not to put that down; I said I paid for it - he made a mark against the 28th of September and the 5th of October, and said I was not to put them down, but to make a fresh bill, for he had not got them in his account - I am quite sure I paid both these sums to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Did he not tell you there must be some mistake, for he had never, on those days, received those sums? A. Yes; I said "Here is my book, and I cannot alter it" - he insisted that his account was right.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is, in his book, "25th of September, 2l. 13s., and the 7th of October, 2l. 15s." - that makes 5l. 8s.? A. It does, but I have not seen his book; I am quite sure I paid the 5l. 8s. in one sum.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On the 2nd of September you paid him 2l. 15s.? A. I do not say I paid it on that day, but in the course of a few days; he had had a week given him to make up his books - he has written "left out," against these sums, which means I was to leave them out in the account: there were sales on the 25th of September and the 7th of October - besides these items, there were two distinct sales, which had nothing to do with this sum of 5l. 8s. - I have gone through every item of his book, and these two sums are left out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was only brought here on Saturday; I never received 5l. 8s. from him at one time in my life - I used to receive the money by instalments, and have rendered a true account, and after my book was delivered into their hands they altered it; there are four loads of hay I never received any thing for.</p>

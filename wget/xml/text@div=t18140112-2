            . Q. Were you in Mrs. Matthews's shop on the 8th of December - A. Yes, I was in the parlour; I heard the shop door open; I said to the little boy, Charles, what is that; we went into shop, and saw the shop door open; we looked up for the hind quarter of mutton, it hung at the further part of the shop; we missed the hind quarter of mutton. I went to the door; I saw the prisoner just going off the step of the door, with the hind quarter of mutton under his arm; I took it from him. I said, what a shame to rob a poor widow woman with four children. I delivered him to Oram, the patrol. I can swear to the mutton being Mrs. Matthews's property. I had seen the mutton hanging up in the shop not ten minutes before, the fellow to it was hanging up; I matched it afterwards, the other hind quarter fitted it exactly.</p>

            . You saw the mutton - A. Yes, the prisoner had his coat off, the meat was wrapped up in it, under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came up from Deptford that evening, we went to a public-house, and agreed to have a leg of mutton for supper, they gave me the money to buy it; I bought a quarter of mutton in Clare-market; after paying for the mutton in Clare-market, coming along Vine-street I saw a butcher's shop, I said, I will go and buy a sheep's head, and have it for supper with the loin; as I came to the step of the door a man came to me, he said, halloo, what do you do with this quarter of mutton; I said I bought it in Clare-market. He called out two or three times at Mrs. Matthews's shop before any body answered; he asked if they had lost any mutton; this woman came to the step of the door, she said, she would look. She looked all round the place, and said, you had better take him in custody until Mrs. Matthews came home. I paid thirteen shillings for the quarter of mutton in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Andrews. Had any body got hold of him when you went out - A. I do not know; there was a crowd collected. He then did not say he had bought it in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. to Oram. Did the prisoner say he had bought it in Clare-market - A. No. He appeared to be an ideot.</p>

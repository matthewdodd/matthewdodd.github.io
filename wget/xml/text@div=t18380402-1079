About twelve o'clock on Sunday, the 18th of March, I left it barred and locked up as usual, and the goods all safe—as I was going away, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soners Sealey and Callaghan standing with three or four others, about two</p>

About one o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 18th of March, I was at my window, and saw three men go into the passaged of the prosecutor's street door—Callaghan was one of them—be appeareds to me to have something under his arm like a bag, going in—directly after<lb></lb>wards he came and stood at the door, and looked—the other two went inside—a few minutes afterwards they all three came out, Callaghen first, with something in a bag, and crossed the way.</p>

On Sunday, the 18th of March, I was walking by the prosecutor's shop, and saw three persons come out of the passage at the side of the shop—Sealey was one of them—I knew his before—I cannot say who the others were—he had something in his pocket, but what it was I could not see—I did not see either of them with a bag—I saw them come out of the passage, and shut the door after them—having suspicion, I went and pushed it open, and found the door leading to the parlour waa open—I beckoned to my fellow-servant—he came down, and I gave information to the police.</p>

I know Sealey perfectly well—on the Sunday morning, after St. Patrick's day, having taken a little too much, I did not feel disposed to go out with my coach, and asked the waterman if he knew any one who would take care of it—he said, "There is young Sealey"—he had driven for me several times—I went to the court where he lived about twelve o'clock—I am sure it was about that time—it was just before church broke up—I saw him—he was in bed—I am certain it was not a quarter past twelve o'clock then—he said he would get up very soon, and tome, but I did not wait, and got another person—I saw nothing more of him that day—I know the witness Kennedy—whenever he and Sealey used to meet on the rank they always fell out—Sealey generally got the fares away from the other, which of course irritated him; and I heard him say, "The first apportunity I have, I will be revenged on you, so that you shall not drive a cab for some time to come."

                  </hi>. I am accountant to the General Steam Navi<lb></lb>gation Company, which is incorporated by Act of Parliament—the prisoner was a clerk at the head office, 78, Lombard-street—his duties were to issue tickets to passengers, to receive the money for them, and to enter them in a book, and pay over the amount to the cashier at the end of each day—there are counterfoils to the tickets—a Paris ticket, fore-cabin and third class, is 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the usual practice is to write the name of the passengers on the coun<lb></lb>terfoil, and place the date on the ticket—a passenger gives up the ticket, and they are returned, that is after a certain time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the deposit book—I find no entry here, on 10th October, of a ticket, price 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or of tickets 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 11th October or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 13th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But you have the counterfoils for all these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but none of those tickets are entered in this book—they are properly entered on the counterfoil, but there is no amount specified on the tickets—we know them by their colour—there is sufficient on this counterfoil for me to verify the ticket—we could have checked the prisoner by a comparison of the ticket with the counterfoil—what we complain is that it is not entered in the day-book, nor the money paid in—if the prisoner was away, another person would take money—the prisoner has been in the service nearly five years—he has been promoted—his duties have been very heavy for five or six mouths during the summer—I understand that he has had to pay telegrams, but that would be between him and the cashier—Mr. Roots has mentioned that to me—I have not seen him here—I have not seen him since last Thursday—he was then at the police-court and asked me there—I spoke to the prisoner about it on the same day as I heard of it—he remained in the office ten or twelve days after that—I told him to make up his accounts, but he did not, and I had them made up—we made up the de<lb></lb>ficiency by going through the books—that was not with the prisoner's assistance—he merely came backwards and forwards every day to tell me of the attempts that were made to make up his deficiencies—I advised him to try to get the money to pay up his deficiencies—I had no power to pro<lb></lb>mise him—I did it out of a kindly feeling to him—I did not understand that, if he made it up the money, nothing would be done to him—Mr. Roots did not see him during those days to my knowledge—Mr. Roots marked the counterfoils of the prisoner's tickets himself—this marked "0" is one of those that are owing—I cannot say who put it there—it was discovered from there not being entered in this book—Mr. Roots is an active man in the Directorship—the prisoner told me the amount was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he was astonished when I told him it was 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not a paper made up by him in which he shows an account of money due—he showed one to me, and I showed him that certain additions must be made to it—I cannot say what that amounted to—it was a large amount—it contained the Paris tickets—the prisoner told me he had lent money to some of the clerks in the establishment, and produced some I. O. U.'s—up to the last moment I believed he would be able to raise the money—he made many efforts to raise it, and reported to me daily whether he was successful or otherwise—that went on for eight or nine days—I told the secretary from time to time what was taking place—I saw a paper something like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know whether this is it—by the last moment I mean two or three days</p>

               <p>before he was taken—he has frequently complained of the extent of his duties—he has not only to issue tickets, but to advise people what to do, and interpret for them also, to speak almost all languages.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the Steam Navigation Com<lb></lb>pany, Lombard-street—the prisoner was in the ledger office—after receiving the cash for the tickets it was his duty to pay it over to me in the afternoon—I have looked through the tickets from 9,406 to 9,443 inclusive, and he has not paid me any sums received for those tickets or accounted for them—he did not pay me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 10th, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 11th, or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 13th for these particular tickets—he left the office on 13th November—he had come regularly for the last week or fortnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear of this from the secretary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he is not here, or Mr. Roots—I had no conversation with Mr. Roots about it—I did not advise the prisoner to get the money; he was going to get it and I said I hoped he would do so—I do not remember whether he said that he did not know how the errors had occurred; very likely he did—he said that he had been very much overworked, especially during that season when the errors occurred—he had to pay advance notes, and he might have to pay telegrams for the other clerk in the office if he was asked, also for the removal of manure from cattle ships, and of ashes from steam vessels, also returned passage-money and several other disbursements—other people might come and ask him for money when he was very much pressed—I can<lb></lb>not say whether he has had to advance money to the people in the office—I do not know that he had advanced money to the secretary.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came his diary to be in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he left it in the office; it is a public diary which he had to keep, he produced it day by day to me and I put my initials to it—I cannot say whether there are advances to the secretary in this very diary, but I should think not; but if the secretary was going out, and had got no change in his pocket, he would send down to me to give him some money, and if I was out, the clerk might give him a couple of pounds to get his dinner—there would be no cheque for that because he would pay that, to me as money—in order to pay any claim on the Company a cheque would be given—we have to get together three directors in order to sign a cheque—the prisoner does not find the money until the Directors can be got to sign a cheque—I have not seen the I. O. U.'s or taken means to verify them; I have nothing to do with them—I understood that the prisoner was going to pay the amount, but I should not have seen it on my own authority—I did not communicate with the secretary or Mr. Roots—I do not know who issued the order to take the prisoner in custody—I have no officer here who can tell you.</p>

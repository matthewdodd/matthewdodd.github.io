               <p>Court to Holmes. Why did not you say so? - I did leave it with her, and she gave it me again, at least her daughter did.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the two Vandenburgs go out of court.</p>
               <p>Court to Holmes. You went for this handkerchief, and you took the duplicate that Maynard gave to you? - I did.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - I gave it to Mrs. Vandenburg.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the handkerchief? - Mrs. Vandenburg; then I went back to Bow-street, leaving the duplicate with her.</p>
               <p>How did the duplicate come into your hands again, and when? - I found I had done wrong in taking the handkerchief out, and went myself back immediately with one of the officers from Bow-street, I got the duplicate back from Miss Vandenburg.</p>
               <p>Where does Vandenburg live? - In King street, Westminster; when I came back I saw Mrs. Vandenburg and her daughter, and got the duplicate from Miss Vandenburg; she came to Bow-street with me.</p>
               <p>Was the old woman present when the daughter gave you the duplicate? - She was, and one Mr. Townsend that went along with me.</p>
               <p>Was the daughter there when you went first, and got the handkerchief? - No, I believe she was not.</p>
               <p>How do you know it to be the same? - I took very particular notice of it, and I know it is the same by a particular crease it had in the corner of it.</p>
               <p>What was the duplicate for? - It was for a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What date was the duplicate? - The 27th of April.</p>
               <p>(The duplicate handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Have you had it ever since? - I have not; Mr. Maynard, to whom I gave it and received it from; he has kept the duplicate and I the handkerchief, I received it in court from Mr. Maynard.</p>
               <p>Court to Maynard. Did you get the duplicate back from this man? - After the examination of this man, the magistrate ordered me to keep it.</p>
               <p>Did you get it from him at the magistrate's? - Yes, I have had it ever since, till I come into court now.</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Vandenburg called in.)</p>
               <p>When that man came and got the handkerchief from you, what did he do with the duplicate? - He gave it me, and I gave him the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - I believe I put it into the drawer with the rest of the tickets, but am not sure.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it afterwards? - Afterwards that man came back for it, and my daughter gave it him.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - Yes, I think I was.</p>
               <p>How did your daughter find it among the others? - It was easy enough, they was only just put together.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was the same? - Oh! Sir, very easy, there was none like them, nor none of the name.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - They cannot be alike, they are of different dates, and of different things.</p>
               <p>But till you read them, how can you know one from another? - Sometimes I write one, sometimes my daughter writes one, sometimes the man writes one; I can find any particular duplicate, if there was ever so many, they are always matched together, there was one to match it by; the man gave me the duplicate, and I had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030126"></xptr>duplicate and the handkerchief; she found it by the hand-writing, and the things, it was her own hand-writing; I cannot say I examined whose hand-writing it was before I put it in the drawer; I believe my daughter was by when I put it in the drawer; but I am not sure, nor I am not sure whether I put it in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Then where was it when the man came back for it? - My daughter had it and gave it to him; I cannot really say whether she had it, or took it out of the drawer from among the tickets.</p>
               <p>How do you know that the duplicate your daughter gave back to Holmes, was the same he gave to you? - Yes, I am sure of it; I knew it by the hand-writing, when he fetched out the ticket he brought it to me, and it answered to the ticket of the handkerchief; then I knew it was our own ticket, I knew it was honestly come by; I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Unless you took particular notice of this before you put it into the drawer, how do you know you took the same out? - Yes, I knew it very well, that I took the right one out; I knew it by the name, and what it was, there was never another ticket of that name in the drawer; there is no other handkerchief for six-pence, I dare say.</p>
               <p>What was the name? - Brumpton.</p>
               <p>Was there any other of the name? - No, Sir.</p>

            , to me; I took in this handkerchief on the 27th of April of one Davis, I believe it is Elizabeth Davis, I gave her that ticket, (the other duplicate handed to the Court) they are both my hand writing.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of 21 on one of them? - The number of the book in which it is entered; that we only put on the duplicate we keep.</p>
               <p>Court to Maynard. When you gave Holmes the ticket to go and fetch the handkerchief, did you take any particular notice of the ticket? - I did not mark it, I did not send him for the handkerchief, only to go and see whether it was marked with the letter; I took very particular notice of it to the date and to the writing, so as to know it again; I could not make out whether it was Mary or Mrs. Broomfield; I can say that the duplicate that was brought back, was the same; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There is nothing particular on that duplicate? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030127"></xptr>Therefore you swear positively to that ticket though there is nothing particular upon it? - No, I do not swear positively.</p>

             gave it to me.</p>
               <p>When? - On the 27th of April, to pledge; I gave him the duplicate and the six-pence back again.</p>
               <p>Should you know the ticket again? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Where did William Bromfield get that handkerchief? - He told me it was Humphries's handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did not you see where he took it from? - He took it out of Humphries's coat-pocket; he told me to pawn it for as much as I could have for it, that he might take Humphries the money on guard.</p>
               <p>Humphries lodges in the same house with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw him take it out of his coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. What does he lodge in the same house with Humphries? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - Up in Bromfield's room.</p>
               <p>Then you went from that room to the other? - No, I was not in the other.</p>
               <p>How do you know where he took it from? - Humphries's old coat was on the bed in Bromfield's room, and he took it out of the old coat pocket; I know it was Humphries's coat, because I saw him have it on that morning before he went on guard; I saw him have it on oftentimes.</p>
               <p>Did you never see the other man have it on? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know who put the handkerchief there? - I do not know, but Humphries had it in his hand the day before; I lived with Bromfield almost a week; I do not know how it came into the pocket, only I saw Humphries have the handkerchief in his hand the day before, no other things where in the room where I lived; Humphries took the coat into Bromfield's room, I saw him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever hear Bromfield and Humphries talk about this handkerchief? - No.</p>

               <p>PRISONER HUMPHRIES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I should be very sorry to leave any of my clothes in charge of a woman of her character; I went out the 18th, and came home the 25th; I had taken my room, I took a different room, and took my clothes knapsack, and every thing into a different room; I never had any thing in her charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bromfield called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Humphries called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. On behalf of Ankle, there was no evidence against him; I do not know why he came here, for there are no less than two surgeons of eminence to prove that he was in the military hospital at the time.</p>

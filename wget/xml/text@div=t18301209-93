On Tuesday, the 2nd of November I was at the Horse Guards, and saw the prisoner with two more, standing behind the prosecutor - I watched him, having suspicion; the prosecutor went with the mob - the prisoner turned on his left and the other two on the right; I went and asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing; he said."Yes, a blue handkerchief" - I turned round and saw the prisoner in Kennerly's custody - I found this blue handkerchief in his trousers pocket, which the prosecutor claimed.</p>

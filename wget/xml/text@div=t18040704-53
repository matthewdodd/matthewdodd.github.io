               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - A. About twenty minutes or half an hour; I sent her out for a pot of porter, when she returned, she brought another woman with her; I pulled off my coat and waistcoat, and laid it on a chair on the side of the bed in her absence; I was laid down on the bed, and this other woman laid down at the side of me.</p>

No; the prisoner walked to and fro in the room, for about five minutes, and then she absconded with the coat and waistcoat; I got up, and found the waistcoat and coat were gone; she went out of the room without my perceiving she had took the coat and waistcoat; I got off the bed, and went and searched for her and could not find her, nor the coat and waistcoat, for an hour afterwards; after I had been searching, I went and continued in the room, and in about an hour I heard the prisoner going up the other pair of stairs higher; I asked her for my coat and waistcoat, and she ran down stairs; I continued in the room, it was near dusk, I was thinking to go home; I met the Headborough, Mr. Lilly-white, and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find your coat and waistcoat? - A. Yes, in Whitecross-street; she confessed when she came before the Magistrate.</p>

I am a dealer in hardwood at Abbey Street, Bethnal Green—I have known Rose twelve months, and have seen him several times—he has introduced customers to me—he is a commission agent—on 10th April the two prisoners came together—I had never seen Muggeridge before—Rose said "This gentleman wants to select some mahogany to fit up an office in Lin<lb></lb>coln's Inn"—he said he had been a lawyer's clerk, and his name was Johnstons—they selected about sixteen pieces, which came to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Rose made out the bill, I signed the receipt and I gave it to Muggeridge—he then produced this cheque for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked Rose if it was all right, and he said "I have not introduced you a bad customer before"—Muggeridge wrote on the back of it "H.

               <p>about any forgery"—I said, that although the warrant was made out as a principal, he would be charged with being concerned with Muggeridge or Johnstone—he said "Yes, I know a man of that name, I took him to be a respectable man, but I found him to be a rogue, for he has robbed me of a quantity of furniture."</p>

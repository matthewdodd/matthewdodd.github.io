She said, they were in Skinner-street, at one Wells's, a Pawnbroker; she went there with me, and asked for them herself; the pawnbroker told her to bring her mother. I desired the pawnbroker to let me have them, but she would not. I said, I'd pay for them, still she would not, but said, if they were such things she would deliver them at the Old Bailey. I charg'd the constable with the girl, and went to the pawnbroker again; she would not let me have the plates; then I got a warrant to search her house; we search'd a good deal, but could not find them, at last, by persuading her, she sent her girl into the cellar, who brought them up (thirteen plates produced in court, and depos'd to) the girl confessed before the constable and two or three gentlemen, that she stole them from my kitchen. I found the linnen apron at another pawnbroker's, one Hughs's, at the upper end of Long-Alley; the prisoner went with me; the plates were pawn'd for 4 d. a plate.</p>

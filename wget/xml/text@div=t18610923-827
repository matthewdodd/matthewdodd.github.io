                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Frederick Besley, the proprietor of Nicholson's Wharf, and Beale's Wharf—a large quantity of tea is bonded at Beale's Wharf—a great portion of it is disposed of by public auction at Mincing-lane—before those auctions take place, samples are allowed to be taken, on the production of an authority, in the shape of a card, signed by Mr. William Thompson, who is secretary to the Broker's Association—any person coming with a proper card would proceed to sample—it was the foreman's duty to take out the samples and show them—Storer was the sale foreman in our employ, and Bartlett was employed occasionally an assistant sale-foreman—both of them had been in our employ some years—they were perfectly well aware of the rules and regulations as to samples—if persons came there with a proper card, they would not be allowed to take away tea, without giving returns, in even quality and quantity—it was the duty of the party who served the individual to receive those returns—book was kept of the persons who came to sample—they signed the book—they sign their own names, and the name of the firm for whom they sample, and also the number of the card, and authority, and the size of the measure which they are entitled to take—it was more particularly Storer's duty to see that the book was signed by the persons requiring samples—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was a show of tea at Beale's Wharf on Satur<lb></lb>day, 14th September, preparatory to public auction—I find a number of names entered in the book—it is filled up in the usual way, with the excep<lb></lb>tion that the signature of the foreman who attends to individuals is not here—I do not find any person named Harris here—I know Storer's and Bartlett's writing—I find no entry in their writing here on that day—I know Storer had charge of the book on that day.</p>

               <p>aware of the regulations with regard to the card—I was present on Satur<lb></lb>day 14th, when Bartlett and Storer were brought into the counting-house by Lloyd, the police-constable at Nicholson's Wharf—I did not ask then any questions—I heard Bartlett say something in answer to a question that was asked him—I did not hear the question—something was said about returns—Bartlett said they were going to be sent subsequently, and Storer <hi rend="italic">endorsed</hi> that observation—I hare never heard of samples being taken without returns being made at the time.</p>

POLAND</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">for Bartlett and Storer</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this card, an authority to a man to give samples? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: I understand that Harris had a card some years ago—the card is a general authority for persons to come to all sales, to take samples, and to inspect the teas—if a person is well known, and has been in the habit of using a card, and has left it at home by accident, the man would not be justified in allowing that person to look it samples without coming to me—I was never at Messrs. Goddard &amp; Co's; my brother, Frederick Besley, is there now—he is in the habit of taking samples of tea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose he came without his card; left it behind by accident, would not the man allow him to come in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard of such an instance and I have been in charge of that department about five years—I should not know of it, or have any means of hearing of it unless some one told me—the men have no authority to have any option in the matter—I think Bartlett has been eleven years in our service, and Storer about fire—they were both there before I had the management at all—there have been other men besides them there, but not of late—if two or three people came in together, both men might or might not attend to one party—both their writing is in the book frequently—it is their duty to see that the person taking the samples make the proper entry, and sign their names and the quantity of things taken, and the person showing, signs in this column—there are a number of separate entries of Bartlett and Storer—this book is inspected by us—it is not examined from day to day—I have never known an instance of samples being taken by persons well known to ourselves and our servants without their actually depositing other samples in their place—I have known an instance where we have sent our clerk up for a card when it was left behind—I do not know of any case where a person has been to different sales and come to our premises late in the day with his stock of returns exhausted, and has obtained samples from our premises and then sent returns on the next day—I think there have been cases where samples have been drawn and left in our custody—even if my brother had not brought his card, strictly the duty of the man would be, not to part with the samples; whether they have done so or not, I cannot say—it is a large room where these shows take place—I believe Bartlett can write and read writing easily—I cannot say it for a fact—I should not have put him into that position if I had not known it—it is the practice of our firm that person employed should be searched when they go in in the morning and when they leave the premises—there is a gate-keeper whose duty it is to search them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 111). I have been engaged in watching Beale's Wharf since 12th July—On 13th July I saw Bartlett go into Langbourn Chambers, come out, and meet Harris about half-way across the road—they then returned into the office—Bartlett at that time was carrying a blue bag, pretty well full—I afterwards saw him come out again—he had nothing with him then—Harris came to the end and saw him away—Langbourn Chambers is full of offices—there is a long passage to the house—the name of "James-Harris" is up there—I have been into the place—he occupies a small room on the second floor—there is no warehouse whatever—I next saw Bartlett on the 15th (<hi rend="italic">Referring to some memoranda</hi>)—he first came and fetched Harris from the shop in Lime street, and they both went into the Chambers together—I noticed nothing particular on that day—they remained then about ten minutes and then Bartlett went away by himself—on the 16th I saw Bartlett go to Harris's, fetch him from the shop, and they both went into Langbourn Chambers, and I noticed that Bartlett was buttoning up his clothes, putting himself together; his waistcoat was undone—on 17th June I saw him go in—he had a black bag in his hand, pretty well full, and in coming out he was folding it up, it was empty—on 20th July I again saw him go into Harris's office with his pockets full of something, and in coming cut he had a large blue bag three parts full—I watched him from Beale's wharf—he went into the Swan public house in Ring William-street first, and, then went into Langbourn Chambers, that was the first time I had teen him come from the wharf; he went almost every day for the last two months, generally carrying something in with him, sometimes in his pockets, and sometimes in a bag—I saw Harris on almost every occasion, Bartlett would go into the Chambers first, Harris would not be there, and then Bartlett would go over to the shop in lime-street, fetch Harris from there, and they would both go to the Chambers together—I had never seen anything what<lb></lb>ever pass between them up to the Saturday that I took them into custody—on 3d August I was going myself to sample, and on getting to the door I met Harrris coming out; he had a large blue bag full of something; it was the</p>

               <p>same sort of bag that I have described as carried by Bartlett—I want and took samples and gave returns—I noticed the book, and saw that Harris's had not signed it—both the other prisoners were there—the book that has been produced was lying in its ordinary place—it was about midday, between 12 and 1—on that same evening I saw Bartlett go into Harris's office—I had previously seen Bartlett and Storer coming away from the warehouse together; when they got about three parts over the bridge, Bartlett would stap on ahead—sometimes Storer would take the other side of the way—I never saw them bring anything away from Beale's wharf—I have seen Bartlett bring<lb></lb>ing things away from the Swan, and from another public-house, and I have seen him before he has gone in—he has not taken anything in with him that I have seen—on 14th September I watched the entrance to Beale's wharf, and about I o'clock in the morning I saw Harris go in; I followed him ad went to the tea floor of the warehouse, he was then sitting at a table sampling, I took a seat at a table between the chest that was being sampled and Harris, Bartlett was at the chest and be took a tray of tea to Harris and called out, "Storer, here is a gentleman waiting when you art ready to come," referring to me, Storer then came to me and brought me a sample and then went away for a minute, I hallooed after hum "What is this folio and Bartlett hallooed to Storer, "This is the folio," and then Bartlett brought me my samples and Storer took two to Harris, Bartlett then took Harris another tray full of tea, and after Harris had packed the pareels up I saw him put them in his bag and go out of the tea floor—I got hold of my samplings as quick as I could, signed the book, and as I was going out Bartlett hallooed after me, "Have you signed the book?" I ran and caught Harris up in Tooley-street—he was then being followed by another constable, I signed the name of "Bow" in the book—I told Harris I was a police-officer, And I wanted to know the contents of that bug, he said "Tea," I said "Where did you get it," he said <hi rend="italic">"Nichol"</hi> going Nicholson, and he stopped and said, "Beale's wharf;" I said, "What description of tea is it?" he said, "Really I cannot say;" I said, "What quantity have you got or what quantity have you taken from Beale's wharf?" he said, "Can you re<lb></lb>member every one that you simple, if you can you are a clever follow I can-not;" with that I said, "You must come back with me to Beale's wharf;" going along I said, "Of course you have got your returns for what you have had;" he said, "I gave my returns when I had drawn my samples"—upon arriving at the wharf I took possession of the book and sent for Lloyd and Mr. Besley—upon their arrival they gave Harris into my searched—I searched him—I did Hot find any sample card upon him—I found in the bag, eight parcels of t en, which I identify as those he was packing up (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are five each parcel—I also found a canvass bag containing 7 lbs. of tea, and 15 1/2 lbs. loose in the large bag—this is the style of bag I bad seen Bartlett with—I subsequently searched Harris's chambers, I found no sampling card there or any bill-head of his business or anything of that kind—there was about 2 cwt of tea I should think—I was in a position to see what Harris did—I am quite sure Harris did not give any returns or show any card.</p>

Harris was facing me as I walked down—there were perhaps three or four samples before him—there are tables in the room whore the persons sit to examine the samples—I went to another table—I could touch Harris's table from where I was—Storer came and attended to me; it was Bartlett who called after me, "Have you signed the book?"—Bartlett and stored leave who called after me, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—that is the time their day's work ends—Beale's wharf is on the Surrey side of the river—Bartlett and Storer live on the Middlesex side—the nearest way would he over the bridge—they sometimes walked together fur a little way and there Bartlett would go on in front—I have been watching about two months; not from the secret place all the time—I could always see them leave—about the first seven days, I watched Harris's premises in Fenchurch-street—I have seen them over and over again come out of Beale's wharf after their day's work has been over—I simply took the samples up when I was sitting at the table—they are brought up in a tray and you fold them up in paper—I folded my own samples—I noticed every time they went and brought the tray full of tea—the blue bag was by Harris at the time—the tray was brought both by Bartlett and Storer, Bartlett brought the first tray them Storer brought two; and then Bartlett took the other and brought me two in the meanwhile.</p>

I went to Beale's wharf, and saw Storer and Bartlett there—I said in their presence that some robberies had been committed in the warehouse, and asked them if they knew anything about it—Bartlett said "No"—I then asked Storer; he said no—I asked Bartlett if he knew a person named Harris—he said, "What Harris, as there are so many Harris's"—I said, "Harris that has recently gone down stairs"—he asked if I meant Harris of Fenchurch-street—I said, "I did"—he said, "I do not know him"—I then asked Storer if be knew anything of Harris, and he said 'No"—I than went for Hawkes.</p>

Beale's wharf has been a bonded warehouse about five years—Beale's wharf is on one side of the Thames and Nicholson's on the other—in 1852 my father had nothing to do with Beale's wharf—I have compared the tea produced here with samples that were at Beale's wharf; and it corresponds—I do not see that these eight packets are marked with anything to identify them with the catalogue—the usual way is to mark it so as to be able to identify the samples when they are taken home.</p>

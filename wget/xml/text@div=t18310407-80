On Sunday, the 6th of March, I was going along Ratcliff-highway, and within a few yards of my own place I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of an arch-way, talking to a female; I had known him by sight before, but not to speak to him - I saw a Policeman who came by, spoke to them, and parted them; the prisoner said something to the Policeman, but I do not know what; I said he had better take the Policeman's advice, and go home - I went down that arch-way to go home; the prisoner walked along-side of me - when I got to my door I bade him Good night! and said I lived in there; I had a pipe in my mouth - he asked me to give him a light; I put my hand into my trousers pocket, and took out a bit of paper to light at my pipe - while I was doing that, I did not feel it taken, but I saw him take his hand from my pocket with the watch in it; I had seen it safe not more than two or three minutes before - I gave an alarm, and followed the prisoner, who ran like lightning; I could not catch him - he was not taken till the Wednesday following.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. This is entirely a made up piece of business. What occasion had you to take an acquaintance of your's with the officer to point me out? Witness. I took him to find where you lodged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And previous to that he sent that man to me to know if I would make up the matter. Witness. There was a man came to my house this very morning, brought the watch, and gave it to my brother-in-law.</p>

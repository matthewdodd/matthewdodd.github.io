On Friday the 29th of June, in the evening, we found him at the Shovel in East-Smithfield, and had hold of him, but they beat us, and turned us out, and the landlord told us to go out of the house, not to breed any disturbance there; I suppose there was above forty black people in that house; then we went to Justice Staples, the officers met me the next morning, and found him in the same house, and took him; I am quite sure he is the same man that threw over the tea kettle.</p>

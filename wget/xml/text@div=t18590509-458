                  </hi>. I am a constable of the City of London—about a quarter past 9 o'clock on the evening of the 24th April I was in Jewry-street, Crutched-friars—I saw the prisoner come out of the Lamb and Flag public-house with this bag on his shoulder—I followed him—a person caught hold of me and tried to detain me, and tried to draw me into the public-house—I followed the prisoner up George-street, into the Minories, about two hundred yards—he turned round and saw me, took the bag off his shoulder and put it down by the side of a post—I immediately crossed over to him and asked him if he would be kind enough to tell me what he had in the bag—he stood smiling at me—I asked him a second time—he then said "You are joking"—I told him I was not joking, I was determined to know what he had in the bag—he said "You must have some motive in it"—I told him I had a motive, I thought it was all wrong, and if he would not tell me I would take him down to the station-house—he then said he would go to the station—I took him into custody, and took possession of the bag—I had hold of the bag, carrying it in my left hand, and the prisoner with my right—as I was taking him down John-street, he said, "I do not like to be showed up like this, if you will allow me I will carry the bag and walk with you to the station"—I told him I would allow him; I handed the bag over to him and he put it on his shoulder—just as we crossed America-square he turned round, threw the bag off his shoulder on to my legs, and said, "I do not see why I should go to the station," and ran away across America-square into the Minories—I followed, calling out "Stop thief!" and he was stopped—I gave him in charge to one of the officers, and I immediately ran back for the bag—his throwing down the bag at my legs did not hurt me, but it gave him a chance of escaping—I took the bag to the station—the prisoner there stated that he was ordered from his em<lb></lb>ployer, Mr. Major, to go and get 490 samples of indigo from Mincing-lane—he mentioned the name of the merchants, but I forget it—and he was to take them to Jones and Candler, in Coopers-row—he said in the course of</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Baker, who keeps the Lamb and Flag, Crutched-friars—it is near Cooper's-row—I have known the prisoner some time working in the neighbourhood—on the afternoon of the 24th of April, the day before we went before the Magistrate, he came to my house—it must have been either at 12 o'clock or 4, or after 4, but to the best of my belief I think it was before I had my tea—in my depositions I beg to be excused, as I met with an accident three years ago on board a ship—the prisoner brought a bag and left it in my charge—I always thought him to be a very respectable young man, and took charge of it—he called again at a little before 9 o'clock in the evening and it was brought down-stairs by my mother—I thought it had been given to him before, and said, "What, have not you had it away yet?"—he was sober—I cannot say whether I had had my dinner when the bag was brought, but it was either dinner time or tea time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Though he was sober when he brought it, did he drink before he took it away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he had a pint of porter, and half a quartern of gin and some cold water in front of the bar, and changed a sovereign, and had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change; that was when he came for it—I did not notice whether he was under the influence of liquor—I have known him between eight and nine years—he brought it quite openly, just as you might leave an overcoat, and asked me for a bit of string to tie it up, he said "Here is a bag I want you to take care of."</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">junior.</hi> I am managing clerk to Charles James Major, of Billiter-street, a commission agent—the prisoner was his porter up to 20th April, when I saw him leave at 11 in the morning, by my orders, to go to Messrs. Detmar and Fowler, of Mincing-lane, and receive 495 samples of indigo, which he was instructed by me to pack in five cases, which were to be nailed up and properly cased with <hi rend="italic">gunny</hi> bags, and shipped for South<lb></lb>ampton—I instructed him to go with the truck, not wishing to entrust one man only—next morning after he was taken I stopped the five cases, in consequence of information I received, and twenty-two samples were missing—I have looked at these samples, they are part of the samples which should have been packed in these cases—I was out when the prisoner returned to the office, but I think he returned between 4 and 5; I returned about half-past</p>

               <p>5, finished my letters, and at about a quarter-past 6 I asked the prisoner if his work was finished, and requested him to give me the list of samples packed in the chest—he gave me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). I inquired if the chests were full, he said, "No, one was not full, there was about an inch space at the top"—I asked him if they were cased, which is to prevent the indigo from passing out, and suggested that the bases should be cut down, but he said that it would not be necessary—I have seen the samples brought by the officer, if those samples had been placed in the chest they would have filled it—this list, given me by the prisoner, contains not only those in the case, but those that were missing, the seventeen missing are ticked off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the five included? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not the numbers; he has put down 495 samples, but there are only 490—he was to take five samples from my office to Jones and Candler's, to pack them with the rest; I do not know whether he has done so, but I know he did not go into the office after he left it—the numbers of all those obtained from the packers are mentioned in the paper—the five missing are the five samples that came from my office—the prisoner bore a very excellent character, I would have entrusted him with any amount of goods—he has been about seven years in the employment, and I had the highest opinion of him—I did not see him go from the office—I think I left before him, but I saw him take them from the office—he showed them to me, but I did not follow him downstairs; he said "Here are the five samples, I am going to take them to pack."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Turk's-row, Chelsea, and am a plasterer. On 21st July, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was at Mr. Surridge's stable, with the prisoner, who is an ostler—I had been helping him—we were not exactly sober—he said I knew more about thieving than horses, and I hit him—he told me to come outside, and he would give me something—I went out to fight with him—as I was going out, he said, "Take that"—he stuck some<lb></lb>thing into my eye, and ran away—I went to the hospital—I was bleeding from 11 o'clock till 7 next morning, and was there four days—I have not lost my sight—I do not wish to injure him; I think he has suffered enough.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Rose and Crown, Sloane-street, Chelsea. I came home with my horse, and went to my stables—the prisoner and M'Kee were there—the prisoner was not sober—I heard him call M'Kee a thief—he said he did not get his living by thieving like him—M'Kee said, "Don't call me a thief; call me a rogue, or anything else you like"—they struck each other—M'Kee pushed the prisoner out of the stable, and in less than half a minute the prisoner put his head in at the stable-door, and said, "Come on; I am ready for you"—M'Kee turned round, and said, "He has stabbed me; take me to a doctor"—I saw blood running from his eyes and nostrils—I thought the prisoner had struck him with his fist—he is a steady, sober, honest man—I do not believe he would have done it if he had been in his sober senses.</p>

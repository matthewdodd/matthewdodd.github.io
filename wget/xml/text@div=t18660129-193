                  </hi>. I am a French-polisher, and live with Mary Ann Harris, at 22, Bateman's-row, Shoreditch, as man and wife—I have known the prisoner six months, and have often seen him at that house—on 14th January, he came into the kitchen at half-past 12 at night, by himself—that is our living-room—I told him to go out—he would not, and I said that if he did not I would turn him out—he said, "you cannot turn me out"—I took hold of the two collars of his coat, and pulled him as far as the door—we had a scuffle, and he said, "You had better come out and have a fight"—I went out, thinking he would follow, but instead of that, he went into the first house round the corner—I followed him, and said, "Are you coming out," but he would not—I did not go in—Mary Ann Harris come out from the house that he went into, and said, "You had better go"—I went into my own house, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards the prisoner came back and said "Now I will fight you"—he began sparring at me, and while we were fighting, I found something going into my head, and felt stupefied—Mary Ann Harris said, "Do not fight any more; he is stabbing you"—that was said loud enough for him to hear—I found my head and hand bleeding—he went away, and was afterwards given in charge—I went to the hospital—the prisoner did not ask for any young woman—he looked as if he had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at this brothel with Turnpenny—I was in the room when the prisoner came on the 14th—I saw the men struggling and the prisoner went out—in about a quarter of an hour he came again, and said, "Come on, Charley; I am ready for you"—they began fighting, and all at once, I saw that the prisoner was fighting with a knife in his hand—he struck Turnpenny on the head first—he struck him several times—I laid hold of Turnpenny, and said, "Do not fight any more; he has a knife"—I threw myself on the floor, picked up the knife, and gave it to the constable—the prisoner ran away while I was talking to the constable at the door—I took Turnpenny to the hospital in a cab.</p>

I saw people round the door of the house, and heard Turnpenny say to the prisoner, "Will you go out, or I shall turn you out"—he took him by the collar—they had a struggle, but Turnpenny got him out—I said to the prisoner, "You had better go away"—he made no answer, but returned into the passage of the same house, and said, "Charley, I will bring you down"—Turnpenny said, "If you want to fight me, you had better come round the corner"—they both came out, and went round the corner—the prisoner went into the first house—Turn-penny waited outside about five minutes, and then returned with the last witness to his own house—she had nothing in her hand—about ten minutes afterwards, the prisoner and four or five men came round the corner to Turnpenny's house again, and directly afterwards I heard struggling inside—Mary Ann Harris came out with a knife, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi> Howes is using a knife"—I went into the passage, but was prevented from getting into the room by five or six of the prisoners companions, who came out with a rush, the prisoner and all—I then went in, and found Turnpenny bleeding very much from his head and wrist—I went to take the prisoner, but was prevented by his companions, who got hold of my coat, and he escaped to his own house, where I took him—I do not know what is the matter with his arm, (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's arm was in a sling</hi>)—it was all right when I took him, for he made use of it half an hour afterwards—I told him the charge was stabbing Turnpenny—he said, "All right; I will go with you"—he made a sudden jerk to get away—he had been drinking, but not a great deal</p>

I am house-surgeon of St Bartholomew's—I examined the prosecutor there on the morning of 14th January, and found two large scalp wounds, one near the occiput, four inches long, and the other two and a half inches long, also an incised wound on his left wrist—they might be inflicted with such an instrument as this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were not very deep, and I did not consider them dangerous—the knife is not very sharp, so I suppose they were inflicted with violence—his head is well, but his wrist is not.</p>

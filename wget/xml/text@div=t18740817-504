On the 4th June the prisoner was called as a witness for the defence in the case of a person named Legust who was charged with having assaulted Sarah Cronin—she was sworn, and I took notes which I produce—they are correct. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I live at 27, Martha-street—I am the wife of John Legon, a waterman—I live six doors from the complainant—at 11.45 on Monday night, 25th May, I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I went to my door and saw the complainant bleeding from the eye—she said she would lock her husband up for doing it—I saw no con<lb></lb>stable there while I was stood there.") That was the evidence on the first day after Browning had been examined—there was an adjournment until the next morning, and she was re-called and she gave this additional evidence in reply to questions by the magistrate. "I am sure it was on the Monday night, Whit Monday—I am quite sure it was complainant that I saw bleeding from a cut over the eye—I am sure she was bleeding—I saw nothing of the disturbance on Wednesday."That was read over to her by the magistrate, and no objection was made—the magistrate asked questions and she answered, and I put the question and answer together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the City of London detective force—I have been engaged in the investigation of this matter—on Monday, 27th October, I went to the house of the prisoner Griffiths, at No. 2, Brown's-buildings, Winsen-street, Birmingham-heath-we obtained admission to the house—we proceeded up stairs to the front room on the first floor—I saw Griffiths just inside the door; he was coming to open the door as I pushed it open—he had his coat off and his shirt sleeves tucked up, and his hands were covered with black ink—I found in the room a printing press, it seemed to be in use, and on the printing press there were twenty-one forged Bank of England notes, without the date or signature to them—there was a bed in the room, and on the bed there were twenty forged 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes finished, wrapped up in gutta percha, and twenty 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. forged notes—in the parcel containing the twenty tens, there was half a sheet of rupee paper, which I now produce—close to the fire place there was a small square stove, with some charcoal in it; and, on the top of that stove, there was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note plate, which they call a "mother plate," that is, the body of the note with<lb></lb>out the date or signature—on a table, in the same room, there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England plate, called "a mother plate," containing everything, except the number, date, and signature—in the same room, behind the door, we found two other copper plates, called water-mark plates; they are for patting the water-mark in the note—I also produce a date and signature plate, which I found along with the two water-mark plates; the signature is that of W. P. Gattie—after we had searched the house, I asked Griffiths if he had any more plates besides those found—he said, Yes, he had some buried in a field (Mr. Inspector Man ton and Mr. Tandy of the Birmingham police were with me), and he said if we would go with him he would show</p>

               <p>us where they were—on the road from the house to the field, he entered into a general conversation respecting the forgery of these notes—he said that he had been engaged in manufacturing forged Bank of England notes since the year 1846, and he had printed all the forged Bank of England notes that had been issued for the last seventeen years, and he had, to the best of his recollection, printed on the genuine paper stolen from the mills, the number of one hundred and eighty 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and twenty 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, for a man named Buncher, and twenty 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes for another party—after walking some distance we came to a field, and after digging in the bank for some time, with the assistance of Griffiths, we discovered a quantity of plates, which Mr. Manton has in his possession—we then went to another place pointed out by Griffiths, and there found some more plates and some notes, which will be produced by one of the other witnesses—Mr. Manton has possession of all the plates found connected with the Bank—Griffiths was examined at Birmingham, and afterwards brought in custody to London, and examined before the Lord Mayor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty-one years of age, and am a son of George Brown, who was a carpenter at Mr. Portal's mills, at Laverstoke—I was in the habit of assisting my father at the mills—I first became acquainted with the prisoner Burnett, between May and Christmas, 1861—he was then at the Three Horse Shoes, at Whitchurch—he was living there with his sister-in-law—I saw him there very often—he did not make any application to me to get anything—his wife said something about the paper at the mill, and after that he said that he knew some one that would print them and pass them—my first conversation was with Mrs. Burnett, and after that I had a conversation with Burnett, and he said he knew somebody who would print and pass them—he asked me to get some paper from the mill—I told him I should not do anything of the sort—he asked me several times to fetch it; I told him I should not do it at all—Mrs. Burnett asked me several times also—at last I took some paper from the mill—I took three sheets in the first instance; that forms six notes—I took it from the side of the size-drying machine—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a model produced</hi>) this model repre<lb></lb>sents the size-drying machine—the paper is put in at the further end, and in passed between felt blankets and rollers, two of which are heated, and it comes out dry at the other end—two girls work at that machine; one at each end; one puts the paper in and the other takes it out—the paper is between the blankets from the time it goes in till it comes out—there is a part of the machine near the lower end of it, at which a man can get his hand in between the blankets (<hi rend="italic">pointing out the position on the model</hi>)—the machine is constantly in motion—the paper is put in as it is supplied to the person who has to put it in, two or three sheets together, one on the other, laid long ways on the blankets—the girl who puts the paper in stops doing so sometimes, but the machine still goes on—there is sometimes a few spaces short—they don't fill it out regularly—if anybody stops to speak to the girl there is very often a break in the supply of paper—I was aware of that—I have pointed out to the Jury the place where a person could get their hand in between the blankets, and abstract the paper—that is on the side next to the wall, as represented on the model, between the wall and the machinery, and towards the end of the machinery where the paper comes out—I got the three sheets of paper from that place—I could not be seen by either of the girls who were at work at the machine—it was part of my duty as carpenter to be about that machine to see that it worked properly, and to alter it if it did not; to see that the blankets did not crease, and that they went regularly—it takes about twenty-five minutes from the time of the paper passing in till its coming out of the machine—the three sheets of paper that I first took were plain paper, that is, paper without any denomination of the value of the note that is to be printed—it has the water mark and every<lb></lb>thing else, but without the amount—I gave those three sheets of paper to Mrs. Burnett at Whitchurch—that was, I think, about May or June, 1861—after I had given them to her, Burnett said he knew some one that could</p>

               <p>print them and pass them, but be said he must take them to London—he asked me several times to get some more—he said I might as well get a few more, and go to London with them for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—I told him I would see if I could—I did do so—the second time I took five sheets of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note paper—I took that from the same place as I took the other—I took them to Burnett at Whitchurch—I had several conversations with Burnett about the paper—he asked me to get some more—I told him I would not, and he said if the other was <hi rend="italic">tumbled to</hi> he should very likely <hi rend="italic">split</hi> upon me—"tumbled to" I understood to mean "found out"—I then told him I would see if I could get a few more for him—I took nine or ten sheets of "fifty" next—I took those from the side of the machine, the same place as the other; I got my hand in between the blankets, and took them out—that was the third time that I took any—as I was leaving the place on that occasion I met Richard Brewer, and he asked me what I had got in my pocket—I told him I had not got anything—he said, "You have; you have got some paper"—I said I had not, it was only a piece of wrapper—he said, "It if not; it is some paper; you had better take it out, and take it back; I don't want to get you into a row, or else I would tell the governor of it"—I told him I would, if be would not tell on me—I went to put it back, and Mr. Deusatoy was in the machine-room at the time, and I had not the chance then—I took it down into the carpenter's shop, and Brewer came down to me a little while afterwards, and asked me what I was going to do with the paper, whether I had put it back—I told him I had not the chance to put it back—he asked me what I was going to do with it, and I told him—I took it for Burnett of Whitchurch—he asked me what Burnett did with it—I told him he knew some one in London who printed it and passed it—he asked me if I knew who it was—I told him I did not—he told me to put the paper back as soon as I could—I had not an opportunity of putting it back—I took it to Burnett at Whitchurch—I told Burnett what had happened with Brewer—next day I saw Brewer—he asked me whether I had put the paper back—I told him I had not the chance, and I had taken it to Burnett—he said he should not take any more if he was me, he should leave off at that—Burnett then went to London—I saw him again two or three days afterwards at Whit-church, and be gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said I was to give 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Brewer, and keep 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself—I took the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Brewer the next morning, and gave it him—I kept 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself—I told Brewer that Burnett had sent the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—he said he did not want any of Burnett's money, and he did not want to have anything to do with him—I told him he might as well have it, and he then took it—he asked me if I knew who Burnett took the paper to—I told him I did not know, but I heard him tell his wife that <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> had not got the plate done yet—Brewer asked me if it was Fred Lancaster—I told him I did not know what name it was—he told me to ask Burnett when I saw him again what the man's name was, where he took the paper to—he said he thought he knew Burnett before to-day—he asked me how much paper I had taken to Burnett, and what he got a sheet for it—I told him I did not know what he got a sheet for it, I thought he did not get anything out of it, not particular—I told him I had taken three sheets of plain, and five of tens before, and ten fifties, and that Burnett took them to London—when I next saw Burnett I inquired of him who the man was—he would not tell me—I asked him whether <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> Lancaster was the name—next morning I saw Brewer, and told him that Burnett would not tell me what the man's name was—he said, oh, that was all right, he should find out some day, he dare say—Burnett asked me to get him some more paper—I told him I would see</p>

               <p>if I could—I told Brewer that Burnett wanted some more paper, and he said I was to get as much as Burnett wanted—I afterwards got twelve sheets of plain—I took them from the side of the machine, where I got the other—I gave them to Burnett—the next morning, or a day or two afterwards, I saw Brewer—I told him that I had given Burnett some more paper—I told him what it was, twelve sheets of plain—he said that was all right—after that I told him I thought about going to London to get work—he said it was the best thing I could do—this was at the latter end of June, 1861—he said I was not to mention his name at all to Burnett about getting any of the paper—I afterwards saw Burnett—he wanted me to get some more paper—I told him I was going to London—he said I might as well get some more paper before I came away, he should not be able to get any afterwards—I saw Brewer, and told him what Burnett had said—he said I could please myself about getting some more—I did take some more—I took about forty sheets of plain—I took them to Burnett—I left the mills a day or two afterwards, and came to London with the Burnetts—we were all at Stratford—we did not live in the same house—I stayed in London about five weeks—I did not get any work in London—I lived with Burnett—he supplied me with money—after that five weeks I went back to Laverstoke—I saw Brewer there, against the mill gates—he asked me how it was that I had come back—I told him I could not get work in London—he asked what I was going to do—I told him I should stop at home, and see whether I could get work there—I came down by myself, not with Burnett—about six weeks before Christmas I was in the bar parlor of the "Prince Regent" at Whitchurch, and Brewer came in—he asked me to have a glass of brandy and water with him—I told him I would—he asked me when I was going home—I said I was going directly—he said, "We may as well go together then, I want to speak to you on the road"—this was about 10 or 11 o'clock at night—we left about a quarter of an hour afterwards—Brewer went out first, and I followed him—we walked to Laverstoke together, that is about two miles—on the way he asked me if I knew where Burnett was gone to, if I could find him—I said I knew where his brother lived, and most likely I could find him—he said he wanted me to take something to London for him—he said it was Bank paper—I told him I did not know how I should manage to go, being out of work—next day I saw Brewer against the mill gates, at 4 o'clock—he told me not to take any notice of him then, he would come up into the shop to me presently—I went to my father's shop, and Brewer came about half-an-hour afterwards—my father was in the shop at the time; Brewer said he wanted to borrow a saw, because my father was there—he saw my father, and said he wanted to borrow a saw—I lent him one—he went away with it, and came again in about half-an-hour—my father had then gone away—he told me he had borrowed the saw as an excuse, because father was there—he then asked me if I had ever had any letter from Burnett concerning the other paper—I said I had not, and I told him that I would give it up altogether, I would not have anything more to do with it—he said he wanted me to take some paper to London for him—I said I did not know how I should manage it, father would want to know where I got the money from to go with—Brewer said he did not know how he should manage it then—I told him I thought of going to Portsmouth to my brother's till Christmas—he said it was the best thing I could do, and come up again at Christmas, and make out that I had come to see my friends—he asked me if I wanted any money to go with—I told him I had enough to go with—he said I was to be sure to come up again at Christmas—after that I went to Portsmouth—I saw Brewer again two</p>

               <p>or three times before I went—I met him accidentally—he said I was to be sure to come at Christmas, I was to come back and see him, but I was not to take any notice of him when I did see him—a fortnight after Christmas I came back again to Laverstoke—I got there in the afternoon—I met Brewer as he was coming out of the mill-yard about 4 o'clock—he said I was not to take any notice of him then, but meet him at the Red House at 11 o'clock at night—the Red House is in Whitchurch, about two miles from Laverstoke—I went there about 9 or 10 that evening, and saw Brewer—he was in the parlor—I was in the tap-room—Brewer came out, and I followed him—we walked on to Laverstoke—he asked me if I was sure I could find Burnett—I told him most likely I could—he said I was to be sure and not say anything to anyone about him—he said he wanted me to take two parcels, one to Burnett, and one to a woman in black whom I should meet at the Waterloo Station—he said the parcels were paper—he did not say what they contained—he said I was to stand on the platform till the woman came up to me, and he said he would write and tell her what sort of a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> I was—he said she would have a hat on—he asked me when I thought of going—I told him the next day—he said I had better stop till the day after, so that be could write to her—he gave me two parcels, one for the woman, and one for Burnett—I waited a day in order that he might write—I opened the parcels—there was one hundred sheets of plain Bank paper in the one for the woman, and one hundred sheets of fives, and seventy-six of tens, in the one for Burnett—Brewer said I had better go by the parliamentary train, and then the woman would meet me there—I went by that train—when I arrived at the Waterloo Station I waited on the platform, and a woman in black came up to me—she asked me if I had got anything from Brewer—I gave her the parcel, and she gave me half a crown to get some<lb></lb>thing to drink—I took some pains to find out where Burnett was, and eventually I ascertained his address from his mother—I went to him and gave him his parcel—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said I was to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Brewer, the other 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to pay my own expenses—I stayed in town two days—I then went to Portsmouth—Burnett came down there to me two or three times—I stayed at Portsmouth till about a fortnight after Easter—I then went to London to Burnett's—after I had been there about a week he asked me to go down and see Brewer, to see if I could get any more paper from him—I agreed to go—he gave me money to go with; I don't exactly know now how much it was—I went and saw Brewer the same afternoon—he said I was not to take any notice of him, but to go down the lane and he would come down to me—I went down the lane, and he came to me, and asked me what I was come for—I told him that Burnett had sent me after some more paper—he said, "All right; come into my house at 11 o'clock to-morrow night—he said he wanted me to take a key to London for him, and get one made like it, for fear the other one that he had got should break—(<hi rend="italic">a key was here produced by Webb</hi>)—that is exactly like the key—he said he dare say Burnett knew who could make one like it—nothing more occurred then—I saw Brewer again next night at his house, and he gave me two parcels, one to take to Burnett, and one to give to the woman at the Waterloo Station that I had taken the other to—they contained paper—I never counted them—he told me it was Bank paper—I did not go direct to London—I went to Portsmouth first, and then from there to London—I gave one of the parcels to the woman at the Waterloo Station, the same as I did the other.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can't you give any date nearer than about six weeks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be more; I can't be certain—Webb did not come to me on the Monday—I went and saw Mr. Hamilton on the Monday—I told some of my story then; I told part of it at first—I told them that I was a thief—I told them that candidly—I told them that Brewer was a thief—I did not tell them all the statement at once—Mr. Hamilton took some of it, and Mr. Smith took tome of it—I told it all, part to one and part to the other—I told everything—I am now under the care of the police—they keep me away from all the others—I am living with Smith, the detective—I have been living with him ever since, not all the time with him exactly, I have lived with another of the detectives, Harris—they have taken me down to the premises sometimes, three or four times—I have not heard the story that Smith is going to tell about peeping through a hedge; I only heard it at the Mansion-house—I have not been taken down to the hedge; I have never had the place pointed out to me by any of the detectives—I have not been associated with anybody but Bur<lb></lb>nett, and the others I have mentioned, during this transaction—yes, with Cato; I was living with him a little while—he is a gas-fitter—I was not working for him, I lodged at his place—I have been living alone during the whole time; I swear that; since I left the Burnetts; I lived with them part of the time—except with them I have been living alone—that I swear solemnly—no woman has lived with me, never, not during the whole of the time, nor ever has—I have not associated constantly with any woman in particular—there was once a woman slept at my father's house; I did not sleep with her—I slept in the same house—she was a girl I brought from Portsmouth with me, not a prostitute, a girl I kept company with—I brought her from Portsmouth about a month before the reward came out, or five weeks, it might be—I knew her when I first went to Portsmouth, six weeks before Christmas, 1861—I did not keep up the acquaintance all the time from that period—I saw her sometimes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you on your solemn oath, whether you did not cohabit with that girl? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did; from about Christmas, and I was doing so at the time the reward was offered—I took that girl to the house where my mother and sisters were—I did not sleep with her that night—I can swear that—I did not sleep in the same room—she slept down stairs with mother, in my mother's bed—I was not living with her—my mother knew I was cohabiting with her, and my father also—she was About seventeen years old—she wore a hat, a black dress, and a black shawl—the premises close about 5 o'clock—at 4 o'clock they would just be about leaving—it is Mr. Shenton Dusatoy's duty to close the premises, all the mills, and to see that everybody has left them—neither my father nor I could get into the mills after they were closed—there were no keys at my father's; he had one key for</p>

               <p>the shop, that was all—that would not get one into the mills—no paper was left on the machine at night, they always emptied the machine every night; the robbery from that part of the machine must have been effected during the daytime—the paper is put at night into a room in the mill, this room (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the model</hi>)—that would be the duty of Mr. Marshman, who was looking after the machine, and then it was locked up—it was about May or June, 1861, that Brewer detected me coming out with some paper—I think Brewer lived at Whitchurch at that time—I am not certain—from that time I and he perfectly understood each other—I considered we were engaged together in plundering our employers—I never had any talk with him about how much he was to get by it—he asked me several times what Burnett was going to give me out of it—he did not learn how much I had got out of it—it was some time after that I was at the Prince Regent with him; that is just out of Whitchurch—it was there we had some brandy-and-water—George Voukes keeps the house—he has a wife, no servants—I am not sure whether it was Mrs. or Mr. Voukes who served us with the brandy-and-water; it was one of the two—I was well-known there—I don't know whether either of them are here to day—I have not been taken down to see them by the detectives; I have not been down there at all—the detectives asked me who served us, and I told them I knew it was one or the other of them—I don't know which of the officers it was that I said that to—I did not learn that he had been down to make inquiries—it was about six weeks before Christmas that Brewer borrowed the saw—it was not on that occasion that be gave me the key—I believe this to be the key he gave me—it was the second time I went there that he gave me the key, just after Easter, 1862.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was this key shown you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the first time I saw it—this key was shown to me about a month ago at the Mansion-house, by Mr. Webb—I know nothing about where it was found, they never said anything to me about that—they never asked me anything about the key—I stated in my evidence that I brought the key to London—I did not state it before I gave my evidence—at the time I stated it in my evidence, I had not seen this key; I did not know they had one; I am quite sure about that—I had never heard anything about a key being found in a door; I have heard of it since I was at the Mansion-house—I did not know that my father was discharged in consequence of it—I did not hear that he was discharged for it—I never heard that he was discharged the day after the key was found—I don't know how long he has been discharged—I went on one occasion with Brewer to the Red House, in Whitchurch—that was about a fortnight after Christ<lb></lb>mas—Richard Dun ford keeps that house—he has no wife—he has a mother and sister, who serve in the house—neither of them are here that I know of—I told the detectives of my having been there with Brewer; I did not learn from them whether they had been down to make inquiries—the night I slept at Brewer's house I had come from London—I got out at Basingstoke; I don't know what time I arrived there—it was the time the parliamentary train gets there; I don't know the time—I may have recollected the time—I knew the time when I was examined at the Mansion-house, but I can't think of it now—it is some time in the middle of the day that the parliamentary train gets there; about 2 o'clock, I think it is—it was about 7 or 8 when I got to Overton; I don't know</p>

               <p>exactly—I left the public-house about 10, I think, or between 9 and 10—I can't be positive whether it was not ten minutes after 10 that I left the public-house—I can't say whether it was after 10—I have not said that it was after 10, that I am aware of; I could not swear that I have not—I am not sure whether or not I told Webb or one of the detectives that it was ten minutes after 10 when I left the public-house—I am sure I never said it was ten minutes past 10—I am not sure whether I said it was after or before 10; I said it was about 10—it might be between 9 and 10; I can't be certain—it might be after 10; I can't say—the public-house is kept by Fraser—I had some beer there, and then I went to Brewer's house—that is about two miles; it is not between three and four miles—I walked there—there was no one at Brewer's house but himself and his wife—I got there about 11, I think—I left Brewer's next afternoon about 3 o'clock, not before; I dined there—there cannot be the least doubt about that—I know Freefolk-bridge; that is about three hundred yards from Brewer's house—I had not been out of Brewer's house at all before 3 o'clock, when I left—I did not meet my mother that morning; I never saw her at all when I was down that time—I was not crossing the fields with her—I do not remember at any time crossing the fields with my mother, when she was crying—I am quite cer<lb></lb>tain I did not about that period—I have never been charged with anything before of any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOVILL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you first told the detective that you did not know anything about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—at that time I was not aware whether anybody had been taken into custody—at the time, I told what I knew about it—I was quite aware of it—when I did make the statement, I was not aware whether anybody had been taken into custody—I did not know that Burnett had been taken into custody on this case; I knew he had been before—at the time I told Mr. Hamilton what I knew, I did not know whether anybody else had told the whole story—I did not know that Burnett had made any statement; he was not in custody then—I have no hope or expectation of obtaining a single penny of the reward—I never heard whether Burnett was to have anything, or when—the paper is deposited in a place called the pack-room—there is no outer door to that room—you get in against the end of the machine-house here (<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>)—there is a way in there—that door is called the machine-room door—it sometimes goes by the name of the north door—you go through that door, then through another door, and then into the pack-room—I don't know whether the key that Brewer gave me would open that north door or the pack-room door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you cohabited with this young woman; what do you understand by cohabiting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Keeping company with her—she was the daughter of the woman where I lodged—I had no marriage engagement with her; I never said anything about that—she was not the woman that I had to meet in London by Brewer's direction—it was Mrs. Burnett who first suggested to me to take the paper—before I took any, I had been spoken to by Burnett once.</p>

               <p>1861—I met him at Whitchurch, at the Plough, first, and at my sister's, the Three Horse-shoes—in April I spoke to him about getting paper from the mill; that was by Burnett's direction—I remember his bringing some paper from the mill; I saw it; it was plain paper; it was given to me, and I gave it to Burnett—after receiving that paper I and Burnett went to London for some days—we stopped at 7, Milton-crescent, Euston-square—I stopped at home, and Burnett went out—when he came back he brought some money with him; I did not see how much—after that visit to London I and Burnett went back again to Whitchurch—I saw Henry Brown there again, both at the Plough and also at my sister's, the Three Horse-shoes—I remember his bringing some paper—that was about a fortnight or three weeks after our return to Whitchurch—after that I, and Burnett, and Brown, went up to London—we stopped that time at a public-house in Drury-lane; two nights and one day—on the afternoon of the day we returned to Whitchurch; we dined in the Strand—I saw Burnett give Brown two sovereigns when he parted from him in the afternoon—we did not go back to Whitchurch till the next day—I saw Brown repeatedly after my second return to Whitchurch; I can't say how often; I saw him on several occasions—I remember Brown asking a question about a person named Lancaster; he asked Burnett if the man's name was Lancaster that he was giving the paper to—he said it was not—he said Brewer wished to know—I remember Henry Brown leaving Laverstoke—before he left besides the paper I have mentioned, he brought more; I can't say how much—I remember the day of the fire in Tooley-street—I and Burnett went up to London that day—we stopped at Stratford that time, at Burnett's brother's, the Railway Hotel—while we were there, Brown came and stayed there two or three nights—he afterwards had a lodging in the neighbourhood—we stayed in Stratford six weeks that time—we then went back again to Whitchurch—I can't remember how long we remained there then, but some time—we left somewhere in October, '61; I can't state the day of the month—I remember Brown coming to our lodging in Long's-court, where we lived after leaving Whitchurch in October, '61; that was just after Christmas, '61—I went with Brown to look after Burnett—we found him at the Victoria Theatre, and went to a public-house together, and then returned home—Brown had some of the bank paper with him at that time—Brown stayed at our house that night—Burnett went out next day; Brown stayed at our house in the meantime—when Burnett came back he had some money with him; I did not see him give any of it to Brown—I was given to understand that he took some of the paper with him when he went out; I did not see it—I remember Burnett going down to Portsmouth in the year 1862; he said he was going to see Henry Brown—I went with him once to Portsmouth; that was in March, 1862—I re<lb></lb>member after that seeing a parcel of paper that Brown brought—that was after Easter; it was in London—I did not see what was done with that paper—Burnett took some of it out; be said he had to go out the next day—I did not see any money when he returned—he went again the next day, and brought back a joint of meat—I went myself to Strutton-ground, I think, in August—I went with Burnett—he took some of the bank paper with him—he went to a butcher's shop; I know that it was Buncher's—I have gone into the shop myself on several occasions—I went to take some paper—that was when we were living in Angel-place; it was after I had been with Burnett—when I went with Burnett I merely waited for him; I went into the shop; Burnett passed through into the back parlour—I did</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City—I have been engaged since August, in respect of some of the occurrences the subject of this prose<lb></lb>cution—in consequence of information and instructions I received, I obtained permission to go to the house of Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, 13, North Kent<lb></lb>terrace, New-cross—I proceeded there on Saturday, 6th September, about 5 o'clock in the morning, accompanied by Smith and Baker, two other officers—we first went into the front-parlour and removed two bricks from the partition-wall, separating the front-parlour from the back, and hung a little picture, a print, over the hole, so as to avoid any person seeing it—we then went into the back-parlour, and remained secreted there—we were able from that spot to hear distinctly all that passed in the adjoining room—from what Mrs. Campbell said to me, I went up stain into the back-room on the first-floor, looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner Buncher come into the house, and go into the front-parlour—it was then half-past 1 in the day—he was with another man; not one of the prisoners—I first heard a knock at the street door; a Mrs. Cleft answered it; and Buncher inquired if Mrs. Campbell was in—she said, "Yes;" and Mrs. Campbell was called down stairs—Buncher said, "Good day; are you prepared to-day?"—she said, "Yes"—Buncher said, "How much?"—Mrs. Campbell said, "Fifty"—he said, "That is no good; I want the 200, as promised on Wednesday night"—(I am referring to a note which I made at the time)—she said, "I cannot spare more than that, the first time, for I have to take your word whether I get rid of them; how many have you got?"—he said, "Ten fifties"—she said, "Have you got any gold I"—he said, "Not to-day; but let me see the money first; business is business; I want the 200, as pro<lb></lb>mised the beginning of the week"—she said that she could not spare so much—Buncher said, "Let me see what you have got?"—she said, "How much have you got?"—he said, "I have plenty of tens and fives; I will go and fetch them"—he then left the house—(the other man was not in the room during this time; he was in a room by himself, and Buncher was alone with Mrs. Campbell)—Buncher was away, perhaps, ten minutes, and when he came back, the man, calling himself Campbell, was present as well as Mrs. Campbell—the other person did not come in with Buncher at first; he did afterwards—Buncher then said to Campbell, "Now, the stuff!"—Campbell said that his wife had it up stairs—Buncher became very violent at that time, and made a great deal of noise—he said, "You are playing the fool with me"—as far as I could see and hear, the Campbells did not pro<lb></lb>duce any money; I do not believe they did—Mrs. Campbell went outside, and, I believe, called the other man in, who came in, and said to Buncher, "Come along, George; do not make a fool of yourself"—Buncher said, "Now, the stuff, you little humbug; you are playing the fool with us; it is not b—likely we are going to part with the things till we get the money;</p>

               <p>you take me to be a b—fool, but you are mistaken; in fact, you were never more mistaken in your life, you little b—; once for all, you know there is 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for me; I am the b—man that has got all the bank paper; I have 30,000 now, and the b—Bank of England cannot stop it"—Campbell said, "Will you let me see the notes, and I will get the money?"—Burnett said, "It is not b—likely; we do not do business like that; but if you show me the money, I will take my oath, and kiss this book; may I be b—well paralysed, and may God strike me b—blind, if you put the money in my hands, you shall have the goods within, say, a quarter of an hour, and the things shall be here, so help me Jesus Christ"—he continued to ask for the money, and, I believe, from what I could hear, Campbell showed him a little money—he said, "That is no good; I have brought this man from the country; I have lost all this day, Saturday; if I had been at home, at my shop, I should have earned 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; pay our expenses"—he was so violent that the other man came in again, and said, "Come along, George; do not make a fool of yourself"—the Campbells did not give his any money, and the other person who was with him persuaded him to go away—Buncher said, "If you will not pay me my expenses, lend me two sovereigns;" and the man who was with Buncher said, "Come along; I will lend you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they then went away—on Monday, 27th October, I appre<lb></lb>hended Buncher outside his house, 38, Strutton-ground, Westminster, a butcher's shop—after the examination at the Mansion House, on 7th No<lb></lb>vember, he was remanded till the 14th, and when he got down stairs he said to me, "Moss, I took you to be a different man to that"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "You have stated quite as much as I said, and, I think, a little more"—I said, "No, I think it is about right"—I has certainly not stated more than I actually heard him say on that occasion, nor near so much—he said, "Do you know that little b—, that gave you the office, afterwards put us <hi rend="italic">a-fly</hi> (that means intimating something to them that it would be better for them not to go again; that is the construction I should put upon it), or you would have had us the next time, so help me God"—I said, "Nonsense"—he said, "He did, and we gave him a couple of <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> for telling us"—that means two sovereigns.</p>

I am a bricklayer's labourer at Overton—I know Henry Brown—I remember meeting him on a Sunday, in last July, between 8 and 9 in the evening, over right of Mr. Currie's house, in Southington, the beginning of Overton—he had a black shiney bag with him; there were two collars in it—I looked in it—after we got down the road some con<lb></lb>siderable distance, there was a gentleman coming along, and Brown flung the bag at him, and I picked it up—it was like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was one of this sort—I can't swear to the bag—it contained nothing but the two collars—I walked on with him towards Laverstoke—I can't say how near to Laverstoke I went with him—I should say between 300 and 400 yards; a little further then the bottom of the hill—I stopped and talked with him a little at the bottom of the hill—I then went on a little further with him, then I stopped and talked with him again, then I bade him good night, and turned back to Overton—Brown went on towards Laverstoke mill—I saw George Smith and my aunt, Mrs. Litchfield, on the road that evening.</p>

               <p>it was near about 10 o'clock, it might be two or three minutes after—when I got back to the stile where I first lost sight of Brown, I stopped to light my pipe, and at the same time I pulled out my watch to see what the time was, out of curiosity; it was then twelve minutes past 10 by me—that stile may be 130 or 140 yards from the corner where I stood when I saw them go into Brewer's house—I then went on to Overton—I saw no more of Brown that night—at the time I saw him go into Brewer's house, there was no one else that I noticed within sight.</p>

Three feet nine from the bank, but just behind where Smith stood it would be eleven feet—I did not place him at the corner—I had nothing to do with putting him there—the hedge stands on a bank; it is three feet nine high—the hedge is about one foot above the fence—this model is made on a scale of four feet to the inch—it is thirty yards from where Smith stood to Brewer's door—Webb, Soper, Currier, and Smith were present—we did not all go down together; we met there—Smith took up his position first; and I stood next to him—I did not get him to leave his spot, and get into his place; I stood at his left hand—no one was sent over here to talk in order to ascertain whether they could be heard or not; they did not try that—it was about a quarter-past 7 in the evening that it was done—it was dark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of Mr. Charles Dusatoy, one of the partners in the firm of Portal and Co.—I am foreman of the mills—I have been in the employment of Messrs. Portal for about fourteen years and three quarters—I should say this model of the mills correctly represents them, and the other appears to me to represent correctly the lane and Brewer's house—Mr. William Brewer, the brother of Richard Brewer, is the chief mould maker at the mills,—I believe William has been employed about ten years at the mills—Richard Brewer came, I believe, in 1866—it is the business of William Brewer to form the moulds for the paper on which the bank-notes are made—Richard Brewer's business was to do the wood-work; to make the frames and deckles, and occasionally to assist in the other parts, sewing on the packing wires, or any other work that might be required of him—there was a room on purpose for them, called the mould-making room—they did not work exactly in the same room; there were two rooms—Richard Brewer lived at Whitchurch when he first came to Lavenstoke—about Lady-day, 1860, he came to live at Laverstoke, in this cottage, in the lane—the mould office was originally in a cottage at the further end, called the sizing-house—it was afterwards shifted into these rooms at one end of the machine-room (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the model</hi>)—that is what afterwards became the pack-room—those rooms used to be mould-rooms at the middle, or latter end, of 1860—the mould-rooms were then on the middle floor of the block of buildings where the clock is—the entrance to the mill is nearly opposite the lane, and the road running from Overton to Whitchurch and Freefolk—there are five cottages here, three are inhabited now, by persons connected with the works—formerly they were all five in<lb></lb>habited—besides attending to the moulds, in the mould office, Richard Brewer had to inspect the moulds in use, twice a day—moulds are used to mould the paper from the pulp, and they are also used in the second vat-house—there were two vats in each—those were the two that were commonly in use in 1861 and 1862—there was another vat-house which was occa<lb></lb>sionally used—it was Richard Brewer's duty to go twice a day to the vat-house to inspect the moulds, to see if anything required repair, to put them right, and to repair the deckles, if required—except for those purposes, he had no business in any other part of the mill—I think the new mould office was occupied at the latter end of 1860—the old mould room was then made into a pack-room—that is at the further end of the machine-room—it is partitioned off—there is a stage of the paper manufacture called water-leaf—I have seen the sheet of rupee paper produced—that is in what is called the water-leaf state, before it is sized—the next stage is sizing, and there is a stage when it is sized and not glazed—there is a quantity of water-leaf paper, and a quantity of sized-paper in the mill—down to August, 1862, the water-leaf paper was kept in one of the pack-rooms—there were two rooms—the dry paper was kept in the inner one, and the wet, in the other—in 1862, the water-leaf paper was kept in the inner pack-room, whether bank or rupee paper—the dry-sized paper was kept in the same room—there was occasionally some wet paper, both water<lb></lb>leaved and sized—the sized was kept in the outer room until it was parted the next day after sizing, then it was removed—the water-leaved packs were generally kept in the first vat-house, where it was made—if an accident happened, there was sometimes more or less note paper in a sited state in pack room—there might be four weeks of one vat's work—if those were</p>

               <p>six day weeks there would be 60,000 notes in that week—a great many thousand notes were kept in this room—we ceased to use these pack rooms for keeping paper on 16th July, 1862—that was after the discovery that paper had been taken—there was a means of getting to these pack rooms from outside the mill, by the north door (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—after going through that door you would have to go through two other doors in order to get to the inner pack room—between the end of June and the 11th and 12th of July, we had some sized bank note and rupee paper in store in that room—we were constantly making Bank of England paper (<hi rend="italic">refering to the books</hi>)—in the week including 20th June we bad two vats, one on rupee paper, and one vat on Bank of England—during the week, including 7th July, we were making Bank of England plain, not fives or tens—the next week we made rupee paper, but there was no deficiency then—in the week ending 4th July, we were making Bank of England and rupee—we had three days work to make in that week, belonging to the former week, so that we made a week and a half—in the following week after 7th July, we were making Bank of England plain—we made more than a week's work of that sort of paper, so that we went into part of the next week to finish it—we made two vats of rupees, in the week ending 4th July—it generally takes about nine or ten days from the time the paper is made in the vats, until it is sized, sometimes more, sometimes less—this key produced by Webb is a master-key, which opens all of the doors, except where there are larger or different locks—it is such a key as I should look up with—it would open the north door, and both the other doors by which you would gain admission into the pack room—I heard that that key had been lost—I do not recollect it myself—I remember its being found—I cannot say the date—it was on the 6th, 7th, or 8th September, 1862, on a Monday—it was found in the door at the bottom of the stains, going up to the rag engine room—I had heard of its being lost three or four years before—William Brewer had the key of the mould office—I don't think that key would open the north door or the pack room doors—I don't think it would open any door, except that which it was intended for—Richard Brewer ought not to have had any key except the key of the mould office—after mill hours the doors were locked—the gates were not locked—they were fastened on the inside—the large gates were fastened together, and the wicket gates left open, until the carpenter went home, and then they were fastened up—it was his business to lock those gates—Richard Brewer has made application to me for my key after mill hours—I lent it to him on one occasion—I think it must have been at the latter end of 1861—that was the master-key that would open every door, except where there was a strange lock on it—he was not away above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with that key—he brought it back to me again—he asked me after that to lend it him, but I believe I did not—I have several times gone with him, and opened the doors, and 1st him into the mould office, and I have seen him out again, and locked the door, and come away—once when he was in the mould office he asked my permission to remain there after the mill hours, and I said, "Mr. Brewer, if you remain, I shall remain with you," or, "You will compel me to remain with you"—I think that was either the latter end of July or August, 1862—he said, if I would not stop with him he would inquire of Mr. Charles Dusatoy, my brother—rupee paper is never sent out in an unsized state—Bank of England paper is never sent out sized and not glazed—during the time I have been at the mill, we have always had as occasional amount of deficiency of paper—the machinery will tear some, and the men are careless—in 1862 we discovered larger deficiences than could be accounted for in that way—it is, of course, expected that every sheet put</p>

               <p>into the machine should come out—we found larger deficiencies than could be accounted for by carelessness or injury; that led to inquiry; and we ascer<lb></lb>tained what the deficiencies were—we always had deficiencies (<hi rend="italic">looking at the things found at Brewer's house</hi>)—this piece of brass is intended for a knotter to extract knots from the pulp—it has slits in the bottom of it—the width of guage of those slits is the same as our knotters used at the mills—after the pulp has been made, it is passed through a knotter, with slits in it of the same guage as these—the effect of that is, to allow the fine pulp to pass through, and to keep back the knots—it goes inside this wooden box, and works up and down—the stuff goes through, and leaves the knots behind—there are openings at the bottom which we call rabbits, to allow the pulp to pass out—here is a wooden frame with brass bars, with holes in them—that is the foundation of a paper mould—in the state it now is, it would do for any sort of paper—it would make paper the size of a bank note, with a proper deckle fitted to it—a deckle is a frame that fits on the top of the mould, to form the edges of the sheets; it is afterwards taken off—in order to form a water mark it would require to be completed—this is merely the foundation—in 1862 the mill opened at 5 o'clock or half-past 5—I always open it—there is a night watchman; he comes off duty at half-past 5, when I open the mill—the women leave off at 4—the men are generally employed a little longer, sometimes till 5 or half-past—I am the last to lock up—I dose the mill when the men have left it, generally from a little after 5 to half-past 5.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Murrell, a finisher, at the mill—I know Richard Brewer—in the spring and summer of 1862, I have seen him go through the gates—I can't say exactly the time—it might be from 6 to 8, or from 7 to 8r and at different times—I hare not noticed the time he was there—it might be a quarter of an hour—I might have seen him there as late as half-past 8, but I did not observe at all, not thinking anything about it—I hare not seen him often; I can't say how often—it might be half-a-dozen times, or a dozen; I don't know.</p>

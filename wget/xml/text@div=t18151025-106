            . In consequence of my seeing the Solicitor for the Bank, and having a communication with him, I was introduced to the prisoner, on the 7th of October; it was at the Old Bell, in Petticoat lane. The person who introduced me to the prisoner, spoke to him, in consequence of which, the prisoner asked me how many I wanted, and told me I might have half a dozen; but I could not have them before seven o'clock that evening. I according made an appointment with the prisoner, to meet him that evening at the <placeName id="t18151025-106-crimeloc622">White Dog, Widegate alley</placeName>

He came at the appointed hour, and called me out, saying, he had the goods, and wanted my money. I then gave him nine shillings, and he gave me six three shilling tokens; he bid me go to the window, and look at them. We went into the public-house, and then he gave me part of a quartern of gin. When we were parting, he bid me put my hand to his pocket, and feel, for he had ten pounds worth about him to serve his customers. I did feel, and felt a great weight. He said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250037"></xptr>might have some any time I chose, by going down Petticoat lane and seeing him. I immediately went to the Red Lion, in Bull and Mouth-street, where I had an officer in attendance, and there I marked them, in his presence, on the head side.</p>

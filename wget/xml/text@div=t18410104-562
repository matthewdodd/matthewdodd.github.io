                  </hi>. On Saturday, the 19th of December, I was gar<lb></lb>dener to Mr. George Halfhide, of Clare Lodge, Perry-hill, Sydenham. I left Perry-hill that night, about five o'clock, as near as I can guess—I had received 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., my wages, that night, and had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket besides, and also a watch—that was all I had with me—my way home leads me through Southend-lane, which is in the parish of Lewisham—I got to Southend-lane about half-past five o'clock—I met one man in Southend-lane following a dung cart—it was neither of the prisoners—I was going to my lodging at Southend—when I got about a mile up Southend-lane, I was stopped by two men—I first passed one of them, and he gave way to me on my right—it was very dark—after I passed him I turned round to look who it was—he had got something black over his face—as I was turning round to look at him, I received a severe blow on the temple from some<lb></lb>thing very heavy and blunt—I was not at that time able to distinguish the features of either of the men—it knocked me down and partly stunned me—I asked them what they wanted, and they stuffed something into my mouth—I was sensible enough to see that there were two persons—I got up as soon as they left me, I arose with them—when I asked what they wanted, they did not speak at all, but stuffed something into my mouth—I felt a great pressure on my stomach, and felt their hands at my watch—I put my hand down to save my watch, and found the ribbon was broken—the pressure on my stomach was like somebody kneeling on me, or something like that—I was not entirely sensible, and not able to make the least resistance—I do not think they remained on me more than a minute—I should think I recovered myself half an hour after, and I found I had lost a sovereign, a half-sovereign, a sixpence, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a bunch of four keys and a ring, and a bag the money was in—the money was all in a bag—my watch was also gone—I arose with them as well as I could, and ran a few steps, but fell down again—I arose again, and fell again directly, and found I could not pursue them, and then I quite lost myself, and did not know where I was for half an hour—as soon as I came to myself I found the injury I had received on the head—I did not bleed much—I lost my way through the state I was in, but at last I got into the lane—I happened to take the right turning, and went on—I came to Sydenham—I there saw a police<lb></lb>man, and told what had happened—it was about six o'clock, I was told, or a little after—when I had sufficiently recovered myself, I accompanied Mr. Kemp, a miller at Southend, to where I was robbed, to see if 1 could find any thing, and I found the stick now produced, lying down on the spot where I had been lying—the weather had been very heavy and dark for a few days before, and there was snow on the ground—I also picked up part of my ribbon and the key of my watch, and a black stock, which had come from a man's neck, a few paces further—I delivered that to the constable—I was quite unconscious who the persons were who did this—I know the prisoner Smith quite well—he had been in the service of my employer, Mr. Halfhide—he left the service about twelve months ago last August,</p>

               <p>in hay-time, 1839—it has been my habit for four years to leave work on Saturday night, and go to my lodging—Smith was quite aware that that was my practice, and he knew very well that I had a watch—he was aware that it was my habit to receive my wages on Saturday, and come home at five o'clock—I know Rosser quite well—he had not been in Mr. Halfhide's ser<lb></lb>vice, but I have known him six or seven years—if either of the prisoners had been there, and spoken while I was sensible, I believe I should have recog<lb></lb>nised their voices well—neither of them spoke during the attack, but one said, <hi rend="italic">hem</hi>—on the following day, Sunday, I went with the policeman Kirby to the spot—(I do not think I made any effort while on the ground)—I think I had a piece of paper with me when I left my master's, but I am not cer<lb></lb>tain—there was a piece of paper with lines drawn and figures, and I turned it over and saw something on it—I recollect the word "fines," or "sewers"—one side was printed—the figures were written—the "fines" and "sewers" were in print—there was nothing else that I recollect on the paper—I think I had last looked at that paper on the Sunday before the Satur<lb></lb>day of the robbery—I had got it from the brewhouse—I took it and put it into my pocket then, and have not any recollection of it afterwards—Kirby showed me a piece of paper after the robbery—it was the paper I had put into my pocket the Sunday before—this is it now produced—I at<lb></lb>tended before the Magistrates at Greenwich on the 28th of December—after the case had been partly inquired into, the prisoners were put back into the cells at the back of the Court, I was walking in the yard near those cells, and while doing so, Rosser called to me—I went up to him—Smith was not in that cell—I cannot say whether he was within hearing—Rosser said to me, "I am very sorry for what I have-done"—I said, "I could hardly believe you were the man"—I did not tell him why, but I thought he would not have committed such a thing—I asked him where my watch was—he told me it was in the Black Horse stables, in the first stable on the right-hand going up the yard—I went to that spot in company with Walker, the constable, the same evening, and in the first stable on the right-hand side I saw Walker find the watch, which I had lost that Saturday night—the one produced is it—the cook had given me half a sovereign—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was to bring her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the R division of police, sta<lb></lb>tioned at Lewisham. On Saturday, the 19th of December, about half-past six o'clock, I received information of the robbery—I went to Doust's house that evening, and got from him this stick or stake, which I produce, and this black stock—on Sunday morning I saw Smith passing opposite the station-house door—I sent a constable to call him into the station, and asked him where he was on Saturday evening—he said he came down from Southend to Rushey-green between four and five o'clock, in company with a man named Beckway, whom he left at Rushey-green, by the Black Horse public-house, and then he went down Lewisham for the purpose of seeing a man named Homeward, to whom be had sold a donkey—he went as far as the Rising Sun, and there met a man who informed him that Homeward was not at home, consequently he did not go any further, but returned home to nurse his family—I asked him who the man was that informed him that Homeward was not at home—he said he did not know—I then asked him what money he had—he said, "Only a few halfpence"—I desired him to pull them out—he pulled out 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I asked him if that was all he had—he said no, he had half-a-sovereign, which he pulled out of his pocket, wrapped up in a piece of light brown sugar-paper—I asked him where he had got the half-sovereign from—he said he had earned it, and gave change to a man for it at Bromley, in the street—(this paper which I have in my hand contains a few questions which I put down—I put them down the day after—this other paper is a similar memorandum, merely putting it down shortly—I made that directly after the other—the larger memorandum I made the day after I apprehended Smith, previous to going before the Magistrate—at the time I made it, all these matters were fresh in my mind—I put it down for that purpose—I am certain what I have stated is correctly what passed)—I asked him who that man was who he gave change to in the street—he said he did not know—he afterwards said he had pledged a coat and waistcoat on the Tuesday previous for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had given his wife on the Tuesday 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184101040105"></xptr>
               <p>from that money—he then recollected himself, and said he did not give his wife any on the Tuesday, but gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Saturday, (which was the day of the rubbery,) and with the remainder he purchased herrings, apples, nuts, and oysters—I then desired him to take off his shoes, which I produce—I went with Doust to the spot where he said he had been robbed I there found the impressions of men's shoes—the snow was then quite thick on the ground—this right shoe has only half a plate on the toe, the other has a whole plate—there are six rows of nails in the soles, and eight nails in the middle of the heel, all of which exactly corresponded with the im<lb></lb>pressions—I made a corresponding mark by the side of those that were there, and also put the shoes into some of them—in the impressions I found in the snow there was the absence of the portion of the tip on one of the shoes—those that I found exactly tallied with those that I made—the shoes are rights and lefts, and so were the impressions—I ascertained the numbers of rows of nails in the impressions quite plainly before I put the shoes into them—I feel confident that these shoes made the im<lb></lb>pressions I found—I traced the impressions across the fields into the foot-path that leads into the Southbend road, which is the turnpike-road to Bromley—I know where Smith then lived—I traced the impressions in the direction to Smith's house, and within 250 yards of it—it is full half a mile from the place where the robbery was committed, to Smith's house, the way they went across the fields—the impressions were quite plain across the fields as well, for I made corresponding marks along the road—I afterwards went to Smith's house—I there found this bill-hook in a cupboard in his bed-room—it has a rough edge, and is notched—I after<lb></lb>wards compared it with the stick that was given me by Doust, and it is my impression that it was cut by this bill-hook—I tried two marks on it. to the stick, and they exactly fitted—the stick had been partly cut, and then knocked down—when I looked at the bill-hook, it was my impression that it had cut the stick, but I had not the stick with me then—here is a chip in the stick, which corresponds with a notch in the bill-hook—I only speak as far as my impression goes—I saw nothing of the prisoner Rosser until Monday, the 28th, after he had been examined before the Magistrate a second time—he then stood committed, but was remanded for a fortnight—he was in the inspector's room, about to be removed to Magistone—he said he wished to tell of the whole affair—I said nothing to induce him to make a statement, nor did I threaten him in any way—I not only cautioned him that whatever he might say would be taken down, and made use of against him, but I told him he had better not say any thing—he was likewise cautioned by my superintendent and the Magis<lb></lb>trate's clerk not to say any thing, and told that what he said would be taken down in writing, and be used against him—he did make a state<lb></lb>ment, which I took down from his lips without asking a question, and after I had done so he put his name to it—this is the statement he made—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Abouta month ago Smith came to me when I was at work at Bromley, and said he wanted some money, and said he knew of a chance—that Doust, the gardener, in coming home on Saturday night had always 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with him, besides a watch; he knew what time he came down the lane, and wanted me to come with him—I said, per<lb></lb>haps I might, but I went another road to miss him—I saw him on the Monday following, and he asked me how it was I did not come, I said I worked too late—he then said he would meet me on the following Satur<lb></lb>day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184101040106"></xptr>
               <p>night, I said I should see him again before then. I saw him in the middle of the week, and he said, 'Will you go with me next Saturday night?' I said, 'You meet me by Southend, somewhere;' which I did not—when I saw him again, he said, 'You are not a man of your word.' I told him it was so light, I was afraid of being found out. Then I don't think I saw him for a week afterwards; when I again saw him, he said, 'It will be darker next Saturday night, will you go?' I said, I did not expect I should be in work, and I should see him about somewhere. On the Saturday it was done, he was going to London in the morning, he said, 'I shall see you when I come back;' when he came from London, he said, 'I shall be down by and by.' He came down to the Black Horse about dusk, and went in and lighted his pipe—he came out again and said, 'Come on, let us go;' and he went up the walk opposite the Black Horse, and I followed him. In going across the fields he took his hand-bill out and cut the stake off from the side of the hay-stack—we both went across into the lane, and Smith said, we had better go lower down the lane, as it would be darker there—then two men came along, and Smith' said, 'That is not him'—after they had passed, Smith said be would knock him down, and Smith gave me his apron to put in his mouth; and said he would take the watch and money he bad got—pre<lb></lb>sently the gardener came along, and he said, 'Here he comes.' Smith then went out into the road, and knocked him down with the stake—he took what he had, and gave a cough, as much as to say, Come on. He said, he had owed him a grudge for a long time; and said, 'I don't care if I have killed him.' I said, 'G—d forbid that it should be like that.' I said,' I wish I had not come now.' He gave me the watch and sovereign to hide up, which I did; and he said, 'I will see you another day,' I hid the watch in the stable the same night, and kept the sovereign in my pocket—Smith said I was to change it and give him half—the keys and the bag were thrown into the stream by Smith—then we came out at the gate into the Southend road, and I bid him good night, and Smith said be would slip home and sell his nuts, to which I made no answer, but bid him good night. If it was not for Smith, I should not have been led into it—Smith said, 'I know it is a good watch, for be has not long had it.' I changed the sovereign at Bromley on Monday morning—I did not see Smith afterwards till he was in custody. Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS ROSSBR</hi>."</p>

On Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 20th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I went by myself to the spot where the robbery is said to have been committed—I traced the footsteps of two persons from that place across the fields, into the Southend-road—the snow was on the ground very thick at that time—the marks were exactly the same over the fields, as where the robbery was done, and in the first field I observed that the man who had the largest feet, which is Rosser, had fallen down—I traced the footsteps of the two persons into the footpath leading into the Southend-road—after they got over the gate that leads into the road, Smith's footmarks went towards his own house, and Rosser's towards Rushey-green, where Rosser lives—I know the house where he lives perfectly well—I traced his footsteps within a mile of his house, and Smith's, within 250 yards of his house—I after<lb></lb>wards</p>

               <p>took off Rosser's shoes at the station—I remarked that one of the nails stood below the rest, and as I was looking at them, Rosser said, "I nailed them on Sunday morning, and put this fresh piece of leather on the heel, and by putting fresh nails in I drove some of the others out"—I afterwards compared those shoes with the footsteps, and found they cor<lb></lb>responded, and bad it not been for the nails he had put in, I am sore they would have exactly fitted—among the footmarks, there was one in a fur<lb></lb>row which was very bald at the toe—it had no nails at the toe, and there were no nails in one of the heels—here are Rosser's shoes—when I took them off his feet, some of the nails appeared to have been recently put on—they were quite new—there are no nails at the toe of one of the shoes, but a piece of leather having been put on the heel, I could not identify that—I examined Rosser's person, and observed a scar on his knee, as if it had been recently bruised from a fall—Rosser's shoes cor<lb></lb>responded with the larger footsteps.</p>

I went on Sunday morning, the 20th of December, with Doust, to the spot where he was robbed—he pointed out to me the footmarks of two persons in the lane near where the robbery was committed—behind a tree, at the top of the bank, I observed the footmarks of one of the two persons—I followed the footmarks across the field, to the gate leading from the footpath out of the field into the Southend-road—the footmarks of one then went towards Smith's-house, and the other towards Rushey-green—the gate is within two hundred and fifty yards of Smith's house—I afterwards went with Gladwin to trace the foot-marks across the fields—while in the fields", we passed a hay-stack, with wooden stakes round it—it is part of a fence to prevent cattle getting at the hay-stack—among them I found the stump of a stake, which I have here, at least the top part of it, which I cut off myself—it had been recently cut—I have compared this part with the stake produced, and it exactly cor<lb></lb>responds—I followed the footmarks of Smith from the hay-stack into the road leading to the Black Horse public-house, Rushey-green—I afterwards compared Smith's shoes with one of the sets of footmarks, and they exactly corresponded—in the course of the next day (Monday) I searched Smith's house, and found this piece of crape in a box in a room up stairs—the box was full of things, and this laid just on the top of them—it was unlocked—I heard the Inspector request Rosser to take his shoes off, and when he had taken them off, the Inspector asked me whether I thought the shoes would fit the marks in the snow—I said I believed they would fit the marks, had they not have been altered, as there were some fresh nails in, and a fresh piece put on—Rosser replied, that he had put some fresh nails in, and put the piece of leather on the heel, on Sunday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps a public-house at Bromley—I assist him. I know Rosser by sight very well—on Monday morning, the 21st of December, he came to our house, between seven and eight o'clock—he asked if I had got a fire—I said, "Yes"—he said he would have half a pint of gin and purl, or gin hot—I made it for him—he gave me a sovereign in payment—the liquor came to 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him the change, and after doing so, I said, "Stone-breaking is a very good thing, on a Monday morning to have a sovereign"—he said he bad four to take the other week, but he had been paid two, and now he had been paid all up.</p>

I was at the station with Doust, when the prisoner Rosser called to him, and said he had hid the watch in the stable at the Black Horse public-house—I went with Doust afterwards, and found the watch in the stable, where Rosser had stated—in bringing Rosser to Newgate afterwards, he said he was sorry he had not mentioned one thing to the Magistrate—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "The change of the sovereign I robbed Mr. Doust of, is in the privy facing my house, hid in a handkerchief"—I went there since his committal, and found 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a handkerchief hid in the boards.</p>

            ? - A. Yes, of the 78th regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time would he have been entitled to the payment of any money from the hospital? - A. On the 25th of June; they are paid a half-yearly advance to the 25th of December, but his regiment would not have been paid till the 21st of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your Office upon any occasion? - A. Yes, perfectly; but before that, a woman, saying she was Mrs. Heasty, had come for a blank receipt; it is a custom to grant blank receipts when a man is incapable of coming himself: On the 16th of July, I received a letter, signed by Mr. Morgan, saying that this man had been dead a month; I therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140069"></xptr>provided an officer in case the woman should come to receive the money on the 21st of July, but she did not come, the prisoner at the bar came; I said to him, I don't think this is Heasty's writing; he said, yes, it is; I said, how do you know; he said, I saw him write it; I asked him how long since, and he said about a week or ten days; I then had him taken into custody. The receipt was filled up by one of my clerks before it was given to the woman; he is not here, but I can swear to his hand-writing; no person but myself or my clerks can get possession of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the receipt that was brought to you by the prisoner? - (Shewing it to him.) - A. Yes; I put my initials upon it; the name has evidently been penciled, and written over afterwards; this is not like his hand-writing; I never saw him write, but I have seen his writing; when a man is able to come himself the receipt is in a receipt book.</p>

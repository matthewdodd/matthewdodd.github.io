               <p>I never took any thing out of the house but what Mrs. Hamilton sent me with; her husband was going to send her to the work-house for being continually drunk; I pledged them in my name, because she said, if Mr. Hamilton knew of it, he would murder her, that is true, as I stand before God; the things I sold, were things of my husband's; I never sold any thing of Mrs. Hamilton's in my life; I am innocent of what they charge me with; she said, she had twenty-four or twenty-five shillings of a milk-score that her husband knew nothing of, and she sent me with the porridge-pot to make up the money; as to the sheets, they were taken off the bed and lay on the dresser to be washed, when they took me.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Hamilton. Is any part of this story true? - Not a single syllable.</p>
               <p>Did you ever desire her to pledge any thing for you? - Never.</p>
               <p>To the prisoner. Did you set up this defence before the Justice? - I did; she acknowledged before the Justice that I pawned two gowns for her.</p>
               <p>To Elliot. Was you at the Justice's when the prisoner was examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any thing of this pass? - No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter in the service of the Marquis of Breadalbane; he lives at No. 21, Park-lane. On the 21st of May I went out at the front area gate, about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock in the morning—I left the door that leads to the kitchen so that any person coming down the area could get into the house—I returned in a few mi<lb></lb>nutes, and entered by that door—after I had shut the door I saw a man come out of the steward's room—he said he came after some kitchen stuff—I went into the steward's room, looked for the spoons in the usual place, and they were missing—I went up the steps, and saw the man who had spoken to me in company with the prisoner about twenty yards from me—they walked together a few paces—I saw the man in the act of handing something to the prisoner, but I cannot say what—I called out, and they immediately separated—the man crossed the lane, and the prisoner ran down Park-lane towards Mount-street—I followed the prisoner into Park-street—there was a wagon in the street—he went round the further side of</p>

               <p>the wagon from me, and I saw him lay down these spoons by the wheel of the wagon—he was stopped by Holloway—a stranger picked up the spoons, and gave them to me—I delivered them to Holloway—I got two other spoons in my way home—these belong to the Marquis, and are worth about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square—the prisoner and the other man separated imme<lb></lb>diately on my calling out, and ran in different directions—the other man was about twenty-five years old, and dressed like those men who come for kitchen stuff to gentlemen's houses—the handing from the other man to the prisoner was before I called out.</p>

Q.</hi> What is the name of the Marquis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> John Campbell—he has no other Christian name that I am aware of—I did not see the prisoner before I went down the area—there is an area before the house—I went down the steps, and shut the kitchen door, and then I saw the other party, who ran away—I missed the spoons, and came up and looked along the street—the prisoner and the other man were going down Park-lane towards Piccadilly—these spoons are old family plate, and have been in the family a great many years.</p>

On the 21st of May, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Mount-street—I heard an alarm of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running, and the servant following him—the prisoner ran towards me, and I stopped him—M'Farlane delivered to me sixteen silver spoons, and I got two more afterwards—the prisoner said he did not steal them, he had them put into his hand by a person he knew nothing about; that the party said, "Take these," and ran away. <hi rend="smallCaps">

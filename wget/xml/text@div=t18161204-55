There was a crowd round the door; he broke the windows with his elbows. I saw him do it; and he was stopped directly with the biscuits in his hand. Mr. Winder stopped him, the biscuits were picked up; there was no name on them.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL WINDER. I am a watch-maker. I was coming down Holborn, and saw a mob coming down towards the procecutor's house, with the prisoner at the head of them. He came up to Mr. Cornish's, and said, here is a baker's-shop, come along; he immediately folded his arms together and broke two pains of glass with his elbows; he took out a quantity of biscuits from the window; I laid hold of him; he said, I am grabbed, rescue me; the mob came round, and I, with my son's assistance. took him into the shop.</p>

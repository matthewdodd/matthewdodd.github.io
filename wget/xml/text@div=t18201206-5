Bell, Brothers, and Co., merchants, residing in Aldersgate-street. On the 14th of October, I was returning from Charing-cross, about half-past eleven o'clock in the forenoon; as I past Mr. Coutts's the banker, a man pushed me towards the road, and I immediately came between two young fellows; they put their arms within mine, as if they had been walking with me. I shook them, off with difficulty, and was going on when Reeves, who had hold of my right arm, stepped before me, put his fingers upon my fob, and pulled out my watch, he went past me. I turned sharp round and caught him by his collar, he then got away, ran about a yard and a half, and I caught him without losing sight of him. He had the watch, seals, and ribbon gathered up in his hand. While I was trying to get them from him, Johnson came up and struck me in the face, which knocked me against Mr. Coutts's railings, and the rest of the gang (consisting of eight, all of whom appeared under twenty) surrounded me and kept kicking my legs. On recovering the blow I found I still held him, but the watch was gone, just then Slinn came up and collared him; we got him into a shop, and charged him with it; he denied it. The witness Johnson came and said there was a man in at Coutts' I went there, and saw the prisoner Johnson; I immediately said he was the person who struck me; he denied it; I said if he had the watch, and if he gave it up, I would not prosecute him? he said he had not. I felt in his pocket, but found nothing. The witness Johnson found it concealed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060006"></xptr>in the waistband of his breeches - it was mine. He was secured, and both taken to Bow-street. I cannot tell who pushed me. While they held me they unbuttoned three of my waistcoat buttons - my seals and all were concealed in my fob. Reeves took my right arm, and another (not Johnson) my left.</p>

I took him into Coutts's, and found Tucker next door and brought him in; he immediately said he was the man who struck him; he denied it. Tucker offered not to prosecute, if he would give it up, but he denied having it. I searched him, and found the watch in his waistband, at the top of his apron which was tucked up. Tucker told us the maker's name and the number, before he saw it.</p>

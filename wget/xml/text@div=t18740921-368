                  </hi>. I am the widow of Mr. Pittendreigh, who was a solicitor's clerk—he died a year ago last May—the prisoner is my sister—she married Mr. Studholme—they separated in July, 1873—she left him twice, the last time was in July—at that time he had a large house in Myddleton Square—he gave that up—at Christmas time I took a house at 26, Cadogan Terrace—I have lived for many years on the same estate—Mr. Studholme came into the house at the same time I did, and he is lodging there still—he does not pay me so much a week now, because he is a ruined man—he will pay me ultimately, I hope—he agreed to pay me so much a week—two nights after I went into the house the prisoner came there with a mob of about 300 persons, and told them that I was living with her husband, and that I was the cause of his leaving her and she threatened that she would not stop till she had put me in the workhouse and that I and my daughter, aged 16, got our living by immorality—shortly after that I received a number of letters from her, sometimes two a day for. months—this the one of 31st December—it is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed "Mrs. Pittrendreigh, living with J. Studholme, the Tichborns forger</hi>, 26, <hi rend="italic">Cadogan Place, South Hackney, near French Hospital." It commenced</hi> "<hi rend="italic">You vile wretch" and accused the witness of perjury, forgery, and adultery.</hi>) This is a letter of 7th January, received by my landlady—none of the letters are signed or dated—this is the prisoner's writing—there is not the slightest truth in the statement there made—it is a most atrocious falsehood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is not true that I am living in adultery with John Studholme; there is not the slightest foundation for such a charge—a son of Studholme's was living at Myddleton Square; I was then managing his</p>

               <p>affairs for him when his wife left him—the boy did not come into his father's room one morning and find me in bed with his father, and mistake me for his mother and say how glad he was to see his mother back again; this is the first I have heard of it—Studholme did not swear and send him from the house—I was not receiving relief from the Hackney Union before the separation of the prisoner and Studholme; I was, at the death of my husband; he had been ill for four years, and I had six children, and I had no one gaining a shilling for me, and our doctor, seeing us suffering in silent poverty, sent the parochial authorities—when I went to Myddleton Square, I took my children—we went there on 7th August, and he let the house and left it on New Year's Day this year—I was there the whole time, and managed the house very well for him—I removed from there to Cadogan Terrace, where I now am with Mr. Studholme; we are all living in one house, my son, aged twenty, my daughter, seventeen, down to my little girl, three years old—Mr. Studholme was a clerk to Messrs. Routledge—he left and was ill for two months and I nursed him, and he has not been to a situation since—I did not throw dirty water over the prisoner, nor did her husband in my presence, or rotten eggs—I never saw him use any violence to her—I applied to a Magistrate at Worship Street for a summons, on these libels; I also summoned her when she came and broke my window, but I withdrew that summons and wrote to my father to keep her quiet, as I did not wish to punish her—I have been summoned there myself once by her friend, Mrs. Pearce; that was after I had applied for these summonses, and they knew I should prosecute—I have not been a defendant at Worship Street on any other occasion—the Magistrate did not refuse to grant me a summons for these letters, he granted it; he did not go into the inquiry—he was to appoint a day to hear it and send to let me know—I did not hear, and I went to the Court, and the Chief Clerk advised me to proceed by indictment, as that would be quicker and cheaper, and I took his advice, and they returned me the money I had paid for the summons—I was not the only person who went before the Grand Jury; there was the lady who she wrote the second letter to—Mr. Stud<lb></lb>holme was not with me when I was preferring the indictment—he did not know that I was going to do it; he begged me not to it—I did not subpoena him to prove his wife's handwriting—I subpœnaed him as an important witness against Pearce, who is here on another charge of libel—I did not subpoena him here last sessions; he was not in the building with me before I went before <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Grand Jury—I met him here; we did not come together—I subpœnaed him because I would not trust to his coming, for all through he wanted not to appear in the case; he was broken down about my prosecuting his wife—he did not come down to Court with me to-day—my daughter and I came by train; he was here before us—I don't know how he came; he has been married to my sister eleven years—I have known him off and on the whole of that time, but for seven years previous to my going into the house I had not spoken to him.—my sister and I were brought up together, and after I was married I went back and lived with my family for years in Granville Square, where they now live, and she has lived with, me at different times—we have been on friendly terms up to the time she and her husband separated and after—he was by deed to allow her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—there have been many orders made against him for payment; he paid up to the time he fell ill and did not earn any more—the furniture was not seized and claimed by me: it</p>

               <p>was seized by Hollingsworth, who had a bill of sale on it, and I borrowed money and redeemed it—I have not been a witness many times in the superior Courts; I can't tell how often; I think once or twice—I have no recollection of being a witness at the Middlesex Sessions in 1864 on an appeal case—yes, I remember it; a man named Hawkins was convicted of exposure to children outside Harvey's shop at Knightsbridge—I did not swear that I had seen those children behaving indecently; I was taken there to speak the truth, and I did to the letter—the children did not swear that I was not on the spot at all; they admitted that what I said was the truth—I was a witness at Maidstone on the trial of a man for perjury in swearing he was in a railway accident at Ludgate Hill; he was convicted—I gave evidence for the defence—the Judge did not say he had a great mind to send me for trial—I did not make <hi rend="italic">facsimile</hi> copies of four of the Claimant's letters; I did copy the letters he sent to me before I parted with thorn, and I have got the copies at home—I did not make <hi rend="italic">fac. similes</hi> and represent t them to be originals—I did not trace the name on glass with tracing paper—I did not give up two letters on the receipt of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and keep two; I never received a farthing from either side—I gave up two letters which the convict wrote to me offering me a bribe; to Mr. Dobbinson; before parting with them I wrote my name across them, and any letters bearing my signature—I will stake my life are genuine—I have been charged with stealing a watch, and honourably acquitted; it was at Clerkenwell; I was taken in mistake for another party—I was not charged with stealing fowls: a fowl that I had, one of 300 that I kept, was claimed by a sister-in-law of the convict Orton under an assumed name—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing, addressed to my father; also these three letters.</p>

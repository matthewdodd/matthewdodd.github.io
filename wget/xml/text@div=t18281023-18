On the 19th of September, I received three 5l. notes, four sovereigns and twenty shillings, on my father's account; I did not take the numbers of the notes - I put the notes into the drawer of our iron chest, which stood in the shop; I locked it, and put the key into the desk - I locked the desk, and put that key into my pocket; the prisoner was in the house when I received the money - he was our <rs id="t18281023-18-deflabel119" type="occupation">errand-boy</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What character did the prisoner bear? A. Very honest; he has been about two years with us - he appeared voluntarily before the Magistrate - but at the time he was charged with it, he appeared rather embarrassed; there were nine or ten of our workmen on the premises that evening - I was in the shop when my father told him to go with him to a public-house, where it was supposed a note had been changed, and he went; he was told he was suspected about eleven o'clock - there was nothing to prevent his leaving the house before that; I was present when he was given in charge - no silver or gold was found on him; his mother took his boxes away - I do not know whether they were searched.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, King-street, St. James's. I know the prisoner by having seen him come after Mr. Moor's men. On the 19th of September, about half-past ten o'clock at night, he came and asked me for change of a 5l. note; I asked who for - he said for Mr. Moor, St. James's-street; I gave him four sovereigns and 1l. in silver; I marked the note before I gave him the change - he saw me mark it; I put Moor's name on it; and put it into my cash-box, where I had no other notes; next day Mr. Moore came in with the porter; and about twelve o'clock he came with the prisoner, and asked if he was the young man I had changed the note for - I turned round and said Yes - he said "No, Mrs. Horner, I never was in your bar;" I said I felt quite confident that he was - he persisted in saying he was not the man, and was taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Moor's men frequent your house? A. Not constantly; they come at times, five or six at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Mr. Moor if he had any body else like the prisoner? A. The prisoner persisted in saying it was not him; I said "Then Mr. Moor must have a man exactly like you" - I only said that once; I described him to Mr. Moor before he brought him to me - he did not frequent the house, but came occasionally for the men; I never served him with a glass of liquor but once - if he had not come for change at so unseasonable an hour, I should not have noticed him; none of Mr. Moor's men had been to my house that day - I changed no other note that day; I was not out of the house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ALLIBAND. The prisoner's boxes were searched on the 20th, after he had been to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went to the lady's house she asked Mr. Moor if he had not somebody in the shop like me - he said he did not know whether he had any body exactly like me; I went back with him - he asked what money I had - I shewed it to him; it was two penny-pieces; I told him I had changed half a crown out of my wages at the public-house the night before the note was changed, and received 2d. out; he asked me to go with him - I went to Marlborough-street; the key of my box was found on me- the officer searched it, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>MR. MOOR. I had paid him 10s. on the Saturday night, when he was discharged on an understanding that he should come three days in the week till he could find another situation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discharged for any impropriety? A. My father thought him too intimate with the female servants.</p>

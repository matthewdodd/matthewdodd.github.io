             informed me where the bottom of my still was, and every thing else; I went to the Prisoner's house, and he abused me pretty handsomely; then I got a warrant, and he said what fool of a Justice granted me a warrant? I said, those that would answer it; but afterwards he owned he had cut it to pieces, and bought it for half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth?</p>
               <p>Duke. It cost me 15 s. He sent two people to me, and they said he would make me a new one, and he has made up one, and I would have taken it rather than have made any combusture .</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that these people were sent by him?</p>
               <p>Duke. I do not know: I would have taken it, but I told him he should have said that before I had taken out a warrant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know the Prosecutrix is a very wicked woman, and keeps a disorderly house. I gave a market price for it, for it weighed but four pounds .</p>
               <p>Duke. I have no other witness, and there is no occasion for any, for my character is very well known.</p>
               <p>Pris. I gave the woman 3 s. for it, which is 9 d. a pound; and gentlemen of the Jury, do you think that cost her 15 s.? I have a thousand witnesses to my character.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Ward in the Strand , and was there when the thing was brought in; and Mrs. Ward said she would have her go to her brother, who is a brasier in the Strand, for he was a proper person to buy it; and I heard the Prisoner Bottles said she found the pan upon a shelf in a shed, since her father's death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the girl sold the pan to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny . No. The Prisoner is a man that always bore a good character, and I believe, upon my soul, he would be the last person to buy any thing that was stolen.</p>

            , a founder. I believe the Prisoner to be a very honest man, and if he had believed it to have been stolen, he would have had no hand in buying it; and he gave the value of it, for, considering the iron and all, he gave more than I would have done; for I could not have turned it to so good an account, because he is a worker in that commodity.</p>

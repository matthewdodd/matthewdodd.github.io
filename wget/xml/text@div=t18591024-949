I am a servant at Christ's Hospital—on Saturday, 13th August, I was in Newgate-street, on the opposite side to Mr. Greer's shop, and saw two men at his door, one of them had a key in the door—I watched them 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour, they continued all that while—the one with the glasses on (<hi rend="italic">Clark</hi>) had a key in the lock—he kept at the lock all that time—I went across the road, but did not go up to them, and just as I got across, I heard them lock the door, and then I made a full stop—I was about two doors off them—the prisoners are the men—they then went away from the door and separated—I saw them again that evening together by the General Post-office about ten minutes afterwards—I had seen the prisoners two or three nights previous at a public-house together—I am quite sure they are the persons.</p>

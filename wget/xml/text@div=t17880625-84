             came into the room, the constable took them to the watch-house, where he searched them, but found they had no pockets on.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon them? - Nothing but their clothes, but you will observe when the constable came I had been absent from the place a certain time, I do not think there was any money found upon them; if there was any, it was but very little, I had in my pocket when I first went into the room, twenty-eight guineas for certain, but as I took one out, I had twenty-seven for a certainty, that was all gone; these are the two women, I never saw any thing of either of them before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's council. Pray Mr. Byrne how long had you been at the Hummums? - How long had I lived there?</p>

               <p>Did you hear my question? I will explain it? - I had been at the Hummums,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250088"></xptr>I believe about a month; my master lodged there, his name is Hilton, he is a Lancashire man, I believe he is at the university of Cambridge; I had lived with him two years, and travelled abroad, I am almost sure he is at the university of Cambridge, I was, discharged on account of attending this prosecution, he said I might come down to him again if I chose.</p>
               <p>Was your master at the Hummums at that time? - He was not.</p>
               <p>How long had he been absent from the Hummums? - He comes there in the course of twenty-four hours, for about an hour or two.</p>
               <p>You, I take it for granted, had a proper room appointed for you to sleep in at the Hummums? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was too much a man of fashion for that; do you usually carry all your money in your pocket? - No, Sir, never; I generally carry about a guinea in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Upon this occasion you happened to have it all? - Not all the stock.</p>
               <p>You had been in the city? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you been in company in the city? - I had been at an ale-house, opposite the mansion-house.</p>
               <p>You was drinking a little matter? - I drank, I believe in the course of an hour or two a pint of beer, and an overtaker.</p>
               <p>That is a thing that makes one drunk, overtakes the little intellect one has and puts it to rest: So you had walked from the mansion-house to Bridges-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were quite sober I take it for granted? - I was sober and sensible.</p>
               <p>And therefore having picked up a woman and going to a house where they would not take two women in wish you, you went home to deposit your cash, and left five guineas, and brought the rest out; then you picked up the same woman and went to the same hotel, and asked her to go with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She said lord! lord! did she not say my lord? you was the Italian Count that night, was not you? - I was Mr. Byrne.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you represent yourself to be an Italian Count; now, I ask you seriously? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I am upon my oath now.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you did not that night at the hotel, represent yourself to be an Italian count, a foreign count? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>A foreign nobleman; upon the oath you have taken did not you represent yourself to be a foreign nobleman? - No, for the third time I did not.</p>
               <p>So then you had the usual compliments on these occasions, cakes and wine, and so on: Did you ask for change for a 50 l. note when you went into the house? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then of course you were not answered by the waiter, that you had better change a one and twenty shilling piece, instead of a 50 l. note? - The waiter came in when I called him, and says I, what have we to pay, that was after we had been two hours there, I gave the waiter a guinea, and he gave me change.</p>
               <p>Then you swear you did not say any thing about changing the 50 l. note? - I might mention something to the girl about changing a note, but I do not know what I said about it.</p>
               <p>Do not talk about might, what did you say? these gentlemen do not let any foreign noblemen so impose upon them? - As I have been a clerk in the city, I perhaps might mention something.</p>
               <p>Where was you clerk in the city? - At several places, at Martini, Martini, and Company, in Winchester-street, about four years ago; and that is the reason I might talk about bank notes, and things of that kind.</p>
               <p>So when you get to a bawdy-house, having been clerk to a banker, you talk always regularly about bank-notes? - No, I might say some trifling matter; I have already said what I have to say on the subject.</p>
               <p>Court. You have already told us, you did not ask for change of a 50 l. bank-note?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250089"></xptr>- No, I did not, we were in conversation and singing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. To what tune do you set your conversation about a bank-note, Mr. Count, which of your Italian tunes? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>You must recollect, as I shall presently have my Lord's authority for desiring you, and we will judge about your sobriety presently? - I tell you again that I really do not recollect what I might say; I might say something about it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know you did? - I certainly know I did, I know I might say something.</p>
               <p>What did you say about a bank-note? - I really do not know what I said about it, it might be some trifling matter of no consequence, upon my oath, I do not recollect what I did say, I might say something about a bank-note, I know very well I might say in the course of conversation.</p>
               <p>Court. He says they were singing; who else was there? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was a duet then? - Only us three.</p>
               <p>And you were amusing yourselves singing for two hours? - Part of the time singing, part of the time drinking, part in conversation.</p>
               <p>Attend, because your answers are taken down in short-hand: Did not you ask for change for a 30 l. note? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask for change for 30 l. and you was answered by the waiter if it was a 50 l. he could give you change? - No, I was not so answered, I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner Hughes say, she supposed it would come to a 10 l. note, and at last to a twenty-one shilling piece? - I do not recollect any such conversation.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it did not pass? - I do not know what conversation she might have with the waiter.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she did not? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Now, will you go further and swear that no such thing passed, because to this there are two witnesses, that you asked for change for a 30 l. note, and was told if it was a 50 l. they would change it, and the woman said it would come down to a twenty-one shilling piece? - I do not recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that no such conversation passed, because a man so flush of money would have said, I do not want change? - I had more prudence than you might have had perhaps in such a case.</p>
               <p>Therefore you left five guineas at home, and carried out twenty-seven; however that was your prudence which you take to be very much above mine? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did not that conversation pass that I have stated? - Conversation about what?</p>
               <p>You have forgot it? - What about the bank-note?</p>
               <p>Aye, about the bank note? - I'll swear I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Was not this the conversation that led to your giving the man the guinea to change, after flourishing with all your countships about 50 l.? - I paid him a guinea.</p>
               <p>How came you to quit the service of the banker? - I wished to travel, my character is known here, I went from there to Mr. Butler's a lawyer in Lincoln's Inn, the editor of Coke upon Littleton, and lived with him for about two years, and Mr. Butler recommended me to this young gentleman; no part of my money was ever found.</p>

Did you hear any cry of any kind before you went to the place? - I heard no cry at all, any further than I said to him, when he stood on the lamp-iron, we dare not burst the door open without you cry murder; he cried murder directly; somebody said, that will not do; you must go in doors and cry murder; then it will do.</p>
               <p>What did he cry out when he first called? - He said he was robbed of thirty guineas and his watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did he say afterwards he had lost his watch? - No.</p>

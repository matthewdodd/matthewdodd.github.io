                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 3, Union Square, Union Road, Borough—on 5th April I was on Tower Hill—there was a crowd there of about 100 or 150 persons—a man was tied up with a rope, and was trying to untie himself—I went into the crowd—I saw the prisoner there—I heard something click at my side—I looked down and saw the prisoner with my watch in his hand; he passed it to his left side, and I caught hold of him—a policeman came up, and I gave him into custody—the watch was worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was on Tower Hill on 5th April, about 2.30 in the afternoon—there was a crowd there—I saw a rush amongst the crowd, and went up—I saw the last witness holding the prisoner, and he gave him into my charge for stealing his watch—the prisoner said "I have not got the watch, you can search me"—I took him to the station, and searched him—there was no property on him.</p>

I let the customers out of the house about twelve o'clock—I came out myself at half-past twelve—I saw Peacock there and the prisoner, and several persons round—Peacock said to me, "Here is Mr. Carrington"—I said I did not care about Mr. Carrington, he must leave there where he was—Carrington stood up and said, "Oh, is that Mr. Bob?"—went in front of him and said, "Yes it is; what do you want with him?"—he challenged me, and said, "If you will come to Ball's field I will fight yoo"—I agreed to fight him, and in going to Ball's field he came to his own garden-gate—he went in there and said, with an oath, "If you come in here I will give you <hi rend="italic">sugar"</hi>—I was going towards his garden-gate to ask if he meant to fight—I had my coat off at that time—when I got to the railings he gave me a round-handed blow over the rails—I put my hand up, and the blow came on my right arm—he made a second blow, which came on the back of my right hand—the blows were not with his fist, nor did I see any knife—he then went and sat down on a barrow—my arm bled—Peacock said to me, "Look at the blood, how it is running down your arm!"—I said, "I know it is; I will give him in charge; you get a policeman"—I ran inside his garden-gate, took the prisoner by the collar, and held him till the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Denmark-place, Camberwell. On 17th Aug. I was at the Rose and Thistle—I came out about ten minutes past twelve o'clock—I saw the prisoner sitting on his basket—he accosted me about a trifling debt of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards heard him give a challenge to the prosecutor to go to Mr. Ball's field to fight—the prosecutor accepted the challenge on the spot, and took his coat off—they went off together, and I walked behind them—I saw a repetition of blows across the railings—I did not see any instrument—the prisoner struck the first blow, using the words, "I will give you <hi rend="italic">sugar</hi>"—I saw the prosecutor's arm was saturated with blood, and his hand was cut also—I went for the policeman, and saw him find the knife.</p>

I went to where the prisoner lives, which is twenty or twenty-five yards from the Rose and Thistle—I found this knife in a barrow, in which there were some flower-pots and some matting—as I was searching the barrow, the prisoner put his hand in, and I told him to keep away, if there was a knife, I could find it myself—I found the knife under the corner where the prisoner was sitting—I told him that was the knife he must have done it with—he said no it was not, that had been there ever since the morning—I had before that asked him where the knife was that he had done it with, and he said he had no knife—I said he must have one, and he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a small penknife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Camberwell. I saw the prosecutor that evening—he had an extensive wound on his right arm, about four inches long, penetrating through the muscles to the bone, and there was a wound of a more superficial character on the back of his right hand—the depth of the wound on the arm was about a quarter of an inch—it extended under the arm where the muscle is—if it had been a little higher, it would have divided the <hi rend="italic">brachial</hi> artery, which would have been very serious—probably death would have followed before assistance could have been rendered—the hemorrhage would have been so great—I should say the knife</p>

               <p>had gone in with great force—a knife like this is quite calculated to make such a wound—the wound is not healed now—it went outside the arm—if it had been inside, it would probably have been fatal—it appeared to me to have been done in the way of a chop down—when it hit the bone it slid down into the muscles—the bone was simply cut upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never had an angry word with the man; I have no ill-will towards him: I never struck him with my hand or a knife; I had no knife in my possession, but the little knife with a broken blade; I never knew there was a knife in the barrow—I was perfectly sober, and knew what I was doing—I was returning home, and sat down in front of the Rose and Thistle; Peacock came out, and I spoke to him; he then spoke to Bush, and said to him, "Do you hear how this fellow is going on;" he said, "He is talking as his belly guides him;" I said, "Is that <hi rend="italic">Bob?"</hi> he said, "Yes, it is, why don't you come into this house? "I said, "That is my business;" he said if I came up the steps he would kick me down; I said, that was more than him master could do; he struck me with his left hand; I called the policeman, and told him to take him in charge; he said he did not see the blow struck, and I must take a summons: Bush then struck me with his right hand; I said, "It is no use to go on so, come to Ball's field, and I will settle it;" I said that, meaning to get away; I went on to my own house, and went into the garden: he came up and said, "Are you not coming out?" I said, "No, I know myself better; I don't get my living by fighting: the first that strikes me in my own place, I will give him <hi rend="italic">sugar</hi>;" he struck at me over the fence, and finding he could not strike me, he rushed in and collared me on my own barrow, and pushed his fist in my face five or six times: I said, "Now, Bush, don't be penny wise and twopence foolish; what do you want with me?" he was then going to put on his coat, and his sleeve was all blood; he said to Peacock, "Go and get a policeman;" the policeman came, and I was sitting on my barrow; he said to me, "Have you got a knife?" I said, "No, I have not had one for seven or eight hours;" he said, "This has been done by some sharp instrument;" I have none but what I use; there was a harrow there, with some flowers in bloom in it; the policeman came and found the knife there; as to striking the man, or having any animosity against him, I declare to God I never had; it is a spite from the landlord of the house, because I lodged an information against it, because the parties who came fron there late at night have destroyed my property; he told me it should be the worst day's work I ever did in my life, and it has come to this; I have tried to do all I could for Bush; when he was lying about, I offered to lend him a suit of clothes to go to get a situation: I gave him three pairs of shoes, and have given him pints of beer—I had never any intention to strike him orany man with a knife—I have been in Camberwell eight or nine years, and had a good character—I have a witness here.</p>

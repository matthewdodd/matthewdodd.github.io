On 7th October my wife showed me a bad half-crown—I said to the prisoner, "Where did you get this from?" he said "I have been doing a moving job down at the corner;" I said, "What corner?" he said "In Oxford Street" (Green Street is two doors out of Leicester Square, not running towards Oxford Street, and over half, a mile from it)—he then said, "I will take it to the carman"—I gave him in custody with the coin.</p>

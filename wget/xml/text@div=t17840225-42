             sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the two prisoners carry some lead into a shop where they buy iron, it was about eight o'clock on Sunday night last was three weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know where they got this lead? - No, I do not, there were eight different people came to see after it, and neither of them knew it.</p>
               <p>You do not know of any person that had lost any lead? - No, I do not know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment for stealing lead, the property of a person unknown; now I take it clearly, that to support such an indictment as that, though you cannot identify the lead, yet you must prove that some person has lost lead; there has been a felony committed in stealing the lead, but then it cannot be proved that it is the same lead that was found on the prisoner; and I take it to be clear law, that you must lay a foundation that some one has had lead stolen from them, but as there is no evidence of that kind, there is no foundation for this indictment.</p>

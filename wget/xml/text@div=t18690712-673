I am a draper, of 77, Norfolk Terrace, West<lb></lb>bourne Grove—the prisoner was in my service about seven weeks—on a Sunday morning, I think it was June 27th, I came home rather early from chapel, and before I got in I heard someone walking out at the shop door, close it, turn the key, and run down stairs—I accused the prisoner of having been in the shop; she denied it—I asked her for the key; she said that she had not got it—I said that I knew she had, and if she did not give it to me I should give her in charge—she then said that she had been in the shop, and she thought she must be under a planet, because she could not help <hi rend="italic">furraging</hi> about—I asked her for the key; she said that it was up in the sitting-room—I said, "Go and find it"—I followed her—she raised a book on the table, and said, "There is the key"—she begged me to for<lb></lb>give her—I let her go for the present, but gave her in charge in the even-ing—these stockings are the same make as I had in stock, my peculiar custom is to ticket at the heel; the tickets have been torn off, but the stitches are left—this flannel is make peculiar to our trade, I do not know any other shop in London that keeps it—I had it in stock at this time—I identify this silk and the dress-piece, and this tweed cloth—I had such articles in stock, and missed them, and this piece of calico has my figures, 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on it.</p>

I am a shirt dresser, at 66, Shaftesbury Street—on the 17th March I left my place at 11 o'clock at night; and left between eighty and ninety dozen shirts all safe—my father and mother and one of the hands I left in the house—in the morning I found about six dozen of the shirts, value 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., gone—these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I identify as part of the goods—I know them by a private mark on the band.</p>

            . The prisoner was a sort of a chairwoman in the house where I live. I missed some things, but thought not proper to take her up without some proof against her. I went, and by enquiring at the pawnbrokers I found at Mr. Davis's on Ludgate-hill 2 of my shirts pawned there in the prisoner's name. Then I took her up; she confessed she had pawned 7 others at Mr. Wybourn's in Fleet-street; we went and got them according to her directions; we found also 2 yards of linnen cloth, a pair of silk, and a pair of worsted stockings at Mr. Wybourn's. I took her before Mr. Alderman Blunt, where she confessed the same.</p>

            . I am constable. I was sent for by the prosecutor, I took the prisoner in custody; she was charged with robbing him. She very strongly denied it at first. Said he, how can you deny it, when we found 2 of the shirts upon Ludgate hill? then she begged for mercy, and confessed to the taking 7 more, and said they were at Mr. Wybourn's; I took her there, and found them, and also a remnant of cloth, a pair of silk, and a pair of worsted stockings, which she owned she had pawned.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wybourn, I took in these seven shirts to pawn of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis. I had the other two shirts of the prisoner; the prosecutor promised me, before he took the prisoner into custody, that he would not do any thing in regard to the woman's prejudice; because the good woman at the bar I have known for four or five years. I never heard any thing to the good woman's disparagement in my life.</p>

               <p>My husband works for the people where the prosecutor lodges: a gentleman that is gone to sea left me these five shirts; when I was taken up I told him I was obliged to pawn them; he says they are his shirts: ask Mr. Davis, he'll give me a good character, I always go there.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are these nine shirts your property or not?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are; they were new when I bought them; some were ready made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never, in order to induce the prisoner to a confession, promise you would not prosecute her?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She never made any confession before she was taken into custody; I do not remember a word of promising not to prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Boddington. He never promised any such thing while I had her in custody.</p>

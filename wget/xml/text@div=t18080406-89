               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner write. - A. I have seen him write; I am certain that receipt is the prisoner's hand writing.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of April, 1805, and down till lately was the prisoner your clerk. - A. He was; and before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In that character was he entrusted and empowered to receive money on your account. - A. He was; it was part of his business to go out and receive small bills of our customers.</p>
               <p>Q. When he so went out did he carry with him any book. - A. Not generally.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came home what was of course his duty. A. To have paid the money and to have it entered in a day book; and when he paid it in, the first letter of his name, C. was always inserted; he generally accounted to me or Mr. Paulain, junior.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is the bill. - A. The bill and receipt, the whole of the writing part I take to be Mr. Cook's.</p>
               <p>"The amount of the bill is four pound fifteen shillings. Received, April the 26th, 1805, four pound fifteen shillings;" the bill delivered up to lady day last in the day receiving book. On that day he accounted with Mr. Paulain, Junior.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness, sir, to look at the entry, 26th of April, 1805; do you find that he accounted with you for the sum of four pound fifteen shillings as received from Mr. Tipcap. - A. He did not.</p>

            , JUNIOR. Q. I ask you, sir, whether on the 26th of April the prisoner accounted to you for the sum of four pound fifteen shillings, as received from Mr. Tipcap. - A. He never accounted to me for that sum of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness, sir, to refer to your ledger, to Mr. Tipcap's account; do you find any entry there of January 12th, cash - two pound five shillings. - A. Yes. and June 1st, cash two pound ten shillings; both 1805.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these two entries your hand writing, - A. They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they like yours. - A. At first sight; not when I come to look at them; the two first are not mine.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18080406-89-person857">Q. </persName>
            Independent of the two, who are the persons that made the entries in that book. - A. I was one, and Mr. Levasque the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cook use to make any entries in that book - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at these two entries, at the hand writing; are you able to form any belief whether they are or are not written by the prisoner - A. I have very little doubt but they are written by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are to tell us from the character of the hand writing; from the mode in which you have observed the prisoner to write, not from any suspicion you have, but merely from the characters of the hand writing, abstracted from all other circumstances. Do you believe that is his his hand writing - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Lavesque. Look at these two entries, you are not to contract into your consideration any thing of your suspicion from the appearance of the hand writing; whose hand writing do you believe it to be - A. I believe it to be the hand writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. This book in which these two entries are made is your ledger - A. Yes, and that ledger is copied from the day book; we never make any original entries in the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any entry in the day book upon which this entry was copied - 
               <persName id="t18080406-89-person858">A. </persName>
            There is none.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you balance your accounts - A. Once a year.</p>
               <p>Q. This offence is stated to be three years ago; you must have had three postings of your annual accounts and never brought the charge against him till now - A. No; not till we found it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not your customers complained that money which they have paid has been again charged to them, and whether on examination Mr. Paulain, junior, has received the money of your servant and has not accounted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060063"></xptr>it by mistake - A. Such a thing has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, have you not had a complaint made by your customers of a sum of money being charged a second time which has never been accounted for by Mr. Paulain Jun. when it has turned out to be paid to Mr. Paulain - A. I never knew such an instance but once; that was more than two years ago; that was to the best of my belief the sum of three pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not found fault with the slovenly manner in which Mr. Paulain Jun. kept his accounts - A. I have done it several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that book, is that entry the handwriting of the prisoner - A. I believe it to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you from that belief upon the handwriting of the figures - A. I form it upon this opinion, that no person with us could have written it but Mr. Cook, except Mr. King, who can write that hand.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all I want. Had not Mr. Paulain an opportunity of looking at the book every day and every night, when he settled your accounts - A. He had.</p>

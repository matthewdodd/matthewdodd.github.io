                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Salter; in January, 1848, we lived at 7, Palace-row, New-road; the prisoners came to lodge there at the latter end of March, or beginning of April, 1846—the little girl was born there in the following October or November; a boy named John William came home; he was then about two years and a half old—he was a healthy nice child then; I have heard the parents very cruelly use it; the last time was when I was at the foot of the stairs, and heard the father violently beating it; the mother said something, and he said, "D—n its little eyes, I will beat its b—d belly in"—I heard it screaming, and heard him say, "I will knock its b----y brains out;" he then appeared to dash it against the wainscot—the mother was in the room—the child cried very much, and about ten minutes afterwards it came down stairs for a <hi rend="italic">halfpe'th</hi> of milk; it was in a very bad state of crying, and seemed very trembling; he scarcely knew how to walk down stairs—he pulled up his clothes, and said, "Look here, Mrs. Salter, what my father has been doing." I looked at his legs, and from the bottom of the loins to the calf of the leg he was so emaciated, that the blood was raised to the surface of the skin; it was bruises—there were many other such occasions before that, the mother was always very cruel to it from the time it came home; scarcely a day passed but what it was bruised—it was in a very thin delicate state when it left in April, 1848; it was bruised from head to foot—I have given it food in consequence of the cruelty of its mother; the father was urged to beat it by the mother—the language used to be very shocking on both sides—the father used to be away for a month together; but for the last three months, scarcely a day passed without my hearing one of them beating the child.</p>

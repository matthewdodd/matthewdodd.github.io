            ; they were both taken one evening, the 27th of October; I found a bill on Garobbo of my own, which I know was placed in a drawer with a lock of hair in it; the bill I had at Sadler's Wells, and I found the duplicates which corresponded with the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>ANN JACOBS sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when the prisoner, Garobbo, left you? - A. On the 22d of October; she asked my leave on Sunday night to let her go to Somerset-house to receive her monthly money that her husband allowed her; she told me if I would let her go at ten o'clock, she would be back in an hour; I told her she might go; she went out at ten, and did not return till three o'clock, she was then in liquor; I was very angry with her returning so late and being in liquor; she said, she had a letter from her husband, and that she was to have another, and the other prisoner brought it; I did not see the other prisoner at first; she called me up stairs afterwards, and said she had received a second letter; she then asked me, as she was late with her work, to let the other prisoner stay and help her, if I would give her a bit of victuals, she would pay her for the work; I said a bit of victuals was no object to me, if she was honest; she said, she was as honest as untold gold; they went up stairs to go to work, as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Garobbo capable of doing work? - A. She said she was; she went and laid down, I am positive, for I begged her to lie down; the other prisoner came down, and was cleaning some candlesticks in the kitchen, and I saw them both making the beds in the two pair of stairs; I went up stairs, and fetched the candlesticks out of the same room; part of the time Rockwell was down stairs, and part of the time she was up stairs;

             came down stairs, and asked me if I wanted any thing; I told her I wanted some tea and sugar; I gave her the money for it, and I never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. After they went away, did you miss any thing? - A. I went into the back parlour, and there I saw her own things gone out of her box; they had both been there about an hour before they went away; in the course of two days following, I saw my cupboard door undone, and there I missed my card of lace, part of it is in Court now.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that lace worth? - A. There were nineteen yards and a half on the card, I valued it at forty shillings; I went to my drawers, and there I had a caddy that had five guineas in it, which I put by for my rent; it was locked when I left it, and I found the five guineas gone; in the one-pair back room, where they had been making the bed, I missed that and a fore-finger ring with hair in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that worth? - A. Three or four shillings; I missed a handkerchief-pin, a short window-curtain, and an apron; some of the lace I have seen, and the handkerchief I have seen, at Marlborough-street.</p>

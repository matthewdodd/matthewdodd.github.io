About 10 minutes past 9 o'clock on Monday morning, 12th May, the prisoner came up to me in Bow-street—he said, "Have you heard anything about the fire that took place in Earl-street"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "It was me <hi rend="italic">as</hi> set it on fire"—knowing him for some considerable time, I said, "Nonsense, I will not believe it"—upon that he gave me this letter, addressed to Mr. Simp<lb></lb>kins (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Simpkins,—The fire that occurred at your house this morning was caused by me, but what made me do it I cannot tell; the person that brings this to you will tell you where I am.

The prisoner was brought to the station by Hornsby, who produced this letter to me, saying that the prisoner had made a statement to him that he had set fire to the premises of Mr. Simpkins in Earl-street—the prisoner said, "It is quite correct"—I asked his name and address, and entered it on the charge sheet—I then told him that he was charged upon his own confession with setting five to the premises No. 10, Little Earl-street, the property of Mr. Simpkins—he said, "It is all right, it is all correct; I did it"—he appeared quite sober and as sensible in my opinion as he is now—he was calm and collected.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at Robinson Road, Cam<lb></lb>bridge Heath—on 5th February, about 4 p.m., I was driving a horse and van in Queen Victoria Street, and noticed before me a Hansom's cab, No. 7638, going at about four or five miles an hour, not more—I then saw the near wheel go over a lady's leg—that was Mrs. Walklin—the driver looked round several times after the accident, as though he was agitated—I saw his features; the prisoner is the man—he did not stop—I stopped at the European, and watched him over to the Bank of England—I did not take my eyes off the cab till I jumped down and gave the number to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Protection Society against street accidents have interfered in this case, but I have not received one penny from them, and do not expect to—I did not see the prisoner again till 20th April—my van had no hood; I had a boy with me—it was a very light afternoon—the cab started faster after it ran over the lady—I did not see her go off the pave<lb></lb>ment and run against the shaft—I did not see her till she was down—he whipped the horse when he got to the Bank of England, not before.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband lives at 333, Cambridge Heath Road—on 25th January I was in the Poultry, opposite the Mansion House, and was going to cross to the Mansion House side—I went off the footpath into the road, and received a blow on my nose by the shaft of a Hansom's cab which was going towards the Bank—I caught hold of the skin of the horse—the cab drove on, and I fell, and the wheel passed over one of my legs—the cab did not stop—I managed to get off the road, and was assisted by a gentleman—I was attended by a doctor, and was confined to my bed for three weeks—as far as I noticed the road was dear when I started to cross.</p>

On the 14th of January an election took place at Guildhall for the office of Bridgemaster—Michael Gibbs, Esq., and Thomas Farncomb, Esq., the present Sheriffs, were the Sheriffs—three candidates were named, David Gibbs, George Ledger, and a third, whose name I do not recollect—he did not go to the poll—a show of hands was taken, which was declared in favour of Mr. Gibbs—a poll was demanded on the part of both candidates by Liverymen, in writing—this is the demand on the part of Mr. Ledger—the time for the poll was then fixed by the Common Sergeant—it began at three o'clock that afternoon—six poll-clerks were appointed—I was present—among them was William Jacques—he was sworn—this is the oath—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"You swear you will truly and indifferently take the poll at this election, and that you will set down the name of each voter, and his company, and place of residence or abode, and for whom he shall poll, and that you will poll no person who shall not be sworn, or shall not affirm, according to the Act in such case made and provided; so help you God".</p>

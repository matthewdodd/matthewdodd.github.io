I never saw the prisoner before: I was quite close to a lamp, which gave me an opportunity of seeing his face. I am sure he is the man that stopped my mouth; the other two went away before him, I do not know which of them it was that took my hat. On Monday was a fortnight he was apprehended. I was robbed on the Wednesday; a person that came out at a door, at the time I was being robbed, took notice of the prisoner, and laid an information against him.</p>

               <p>I did not know the prosecutor before the time this robbery was committed. I live near the place, and was near the place at the time.

He says, I have been robbed! I have been robbed! My wife then held up the candle, and he picked up an old hat, which he has now; he told me at that time, it was not his own; that they had taken his own away. I am sure the prisoner is the man I saw passing by; I have met him often in White's-yard. I am punctual to the man; the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140099"></xptr>said, at the same time, he had been robbed by that man, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did he say he had lost two guineas? - The prosecutor did say he had lost two guineas, but he found it afterwards at home, as he informed me. We could not pursue him; he had got off, and turned down Saltpetre-bank, where he lodges, which is a dangerous place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Castle-street, Leicester-square. On the 1st of Jan., at two o'clock in the morning, I went to call on a friend in New<lb></lb>castle-street, Strand, and met the prisoner there, who I had seen at my house occasionally—he was in company with another person, whom I knew—we drank together—I then went to a coffee-house, in Newcastle-court, to breakfast—the prisoner followed, and went in with me—it was then a little after five—we breakfasted there together—I had several half-crowns and two or three shillings—I had just changed a sovereign, and had spent some of it—I had been much fatigued, and fell asleep there—the prisoner was the only person who was with me, as the house was just opened—when I awoke he was gone, and I missed all the money I had—about one the same day I gave information to a constable, went with him to the prisoner's lodging, and found him in bed—he said he knew what I came for, he had got my money, and had taken care of it for me—he gave me half-crowns to the amount of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said that was not all I lost, and he gave me another half-crown—I then left, and just as I came out I met another constable—I told him that I had been robbed, and he said I must come back with him—I told him I had get part of my money, I had not got all—we then took the prisoner to the station—I had had about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether, as near as I could calculate my money.</p>

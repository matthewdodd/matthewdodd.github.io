             (police-constable H 56). I heard of the robbery, and was looking after the prisoner - I heard she was at the tread-mill - I went there on the 4th of December, and took her - I asked if she knew that I was waiting for her - she said yes, and she was very glad of it; she had done it on purpose, as her father used her so very ill - she told me where the property was pawned - I went there with the prosecutor and found it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HERBERT. I am apprentice to a pawnbroker, in Kingsland-road; this property was pawned there- I cannot say by whom.</p>

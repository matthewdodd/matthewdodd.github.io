               <p>About half past one, the prisoner came in, and he called for a glass of brandy and water and a crust of bread, which I gave him, there is a fire place near the bar at which he stood for some time, very near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250117"></xptr> half an hour, during the time he was standing there, he was asking a few questions which I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Did he converse with any body in the coffee room? - Not any gentleman, Sir, he spoke to me and my mistress; as we had had some suspicion of him I went upon the stairs, to give him an opportunity in case there was any thing in his way to take, there is a glass door to the stairs, and I could see into the coffee room, and I saw him walk up to the table called No. 5, at the far corner of the room from the bar, there were some newspapers laying on the table, that I saw him turn over, and there was a bason standing there that a gentleman had been having some soup, and a spoon in the bason.</p>
               <p>Could you see the spoon in the bason from where he was? - Yes, I saw him take the spoon from the table, and he walked away towards the street door, I went that way intending to stop him, and my mistress caught hold of his coat-sleeves, and the spoon was taken from him; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>The spoon produced and deposed to, marked T. M. P.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. He went to the table for these newspapers and turned them over? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Much company in the room? - No.</p>

               <p>Had he any soup that day? - No.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Price. What is the value of this spoon? - I should suppose about five shillings.</p>
               <p>From what part of the prisoner did you take the spoon? - I cannot tell, it was not in his hand, but from where he took it, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You swear that you took it from him? - He gave it to me with his hand.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. I take the law to be clearly this, that if this man took away the spoon from the place where it was, not making use of it as a customer and visitor, but with intention to steal it, that is clearly a felony.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Blackfriars-road. The prisoner was in my employ for nearly twelve months, and worked on the premises as a clipper—he had no authority to take any work or anything off the premises—on Friday evening, the 4th of April, he left my house about five minutes past eight o'clock, at his usual time—in consequence of suspicion I sent for him to come back, and told him I suspected he had some property on him belonging to me—he at first denied it—I sent for a policeman, and while he was gone for he pulled a piece of leather out of his pocket, with a piece of something else, and said that was all he had got, and he hoped I should forgive him—he placed it upon the table—it was my property—it had my mark upon it—I afterwards saw him searched at the station, and some lasting found on him which he had no authority to take—these are the things produced—I afterwards went to his lodgings and found a great quantity of materials of every description belonging to me—he had not the slightest authority to take them—he had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

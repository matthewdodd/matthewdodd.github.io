The day after Christmas-day, some people came and told me, the young men that robbed me were taken. I went before Justice Berry, where one of them was admitted an evidence. When Madding was taken, the accomplice swore, he sold the things to him: Madding said, he did not see the goods, nor knew nothing of the two lads : after which he acknowledged he knew them both.</p>

             desired I would go along with him on the Thursday Morning before Christmas week, saying, there is a mercer's shop he could break open: we went to the house between twelve and one o'clock at night, and he cut a hole in the window-shutter with a knife, and punched a tap-borer against the glass and broke it, then he put in his hand and took out about fifty-two or fifty-three silk handkerchiefs, a quantity of cheque handkerchiefs, and some birds-eye ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this house?</p>
               <p>Mace. It is in Whitechapel, next door but one or two to the Bishop Blaze. We carried them home to a lodging house where we lodged in Church-lane, right against the Punch-Bowl: there are a great many people lodge these. In the morning, about seven, I went and knocked Madding up: he lives in the New-change, Rag-Fair: he opened the door and let me in, and I chucked the handkerchiefs down; he looked at them, and said, if I had a thousand, he'd buy them. We bargained, he was to have given me 6 l. for them: he often buys stolen goods: he said, if I would bring the King's Crown to him, he would buy it: he went out, and I never saw him till eight o'clock, then he brought me three pounds, and said, if I'd call in an hour's time, he'd give me three pounds more. I did, he gave me but two pounds ten shillings, so he cheated me of ten shillings. Wooldridge was with me at the time we had used to go picking pockets of handkerchiefs, and sell them to him all over snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was you bred to?</p>
               <p>Mace. I am an apprentice to a weaver, but I left my master about half a year: Wooldridge did work at brickmaking.</p>

            . I am a single woman. On the 24th of December last, at about nine o'clock in the evening, I was going home from Wheeler-street to 29, Montague-street, Spitalfields; I was met by the prisoner and another young lad, and when I got <placeName id="t18160110-66-crimeloc379">facing White Lion-street</placeName>

I don't know whether the person who was stopped was the prisoner, as I lost sight of him. They had taken the shawl from him before I came up.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SPITTLE. I am a watchman of the Liberty of Norton Falgate. On hearing the cry of stop thief, on this evening, I saw the prisoner running towards me in White Lion-street; he was the only person running, and I caught hold of him; in a minute the shawl was brought to me by a person, who said the prisoner dropped it. I gave the shawl and the prisoner into the custody of the night constable.</p>

            . I am a weaver. I was at my own door, in Wheeler-street, four doors from White Lion-street, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately saw a person run from the prosecutrix,who was not above two yards from me; I immediately pursued the person, and never lost sight of him until he was taken; it was the prisoner; I saw him drop the shawl in White Lion-street; when I found he was stopped by the watchman, I went back to pick it up, but another gentleman had picked it up, and gave it to the watchman.</p>

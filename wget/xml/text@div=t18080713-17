               <p>COURT. Do you know what name they called the child - A. He was called after the father's name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp In what state of mind was Main at that time - A. He seemed to be grieved about the dispute that he had with the woman Dean; I continued with him three hours at the White Hart; after I left the White Hart I went down to the sand house, where I had slept all the summer.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a building are these sand houses - A. They are about twelve feet one way and nineteen the other; they are built with brick, sticks laid on the top of them and covered with straw; there were six sand houses in a row; I slept in the third and the prisoner slept in the second.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you reached home did the prisoner come home - A. In about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child come home with them - A. I do not know. Main said, Bob are you here; I said, yes; he said I thought you had not come away; I said, yes, I said I have come from the house this quarter of an hour; he said if he had known when I came away he would have come with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any light with him - A. No light as I thought. I went to bed and went to sleep; within the course of two hours I was alarmed by my shirt sleeve being on fire; I pulled off my shirt and came out naked; Hollingsworth lent me a blanket to put round me; I went to the prisoners at the bar, they were standing about twenty yards from me; I said how, in the name of God, could these sand houses be set on fire. The man was dressed and the woman had a gown and petticoat on; whether she had a cap or bonnet on I cannot say; I said, Reuben, sure you was not so foolish as to bring a lighted pipe in; he said no, by God, I had no light at all; I then went and alarmed the three other people that were in the sand houses; then I heard him crying out the child, saying my child is burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the child crying at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to have got the child out - A. The child might have been got out when I got out; but whether it was dead then I cannot say; we could not have gone in the sand house, but we had hoes and rakes that we could have reached him and dragged him out; the next morning I went in the sand house, the child was in a lump of straw laying within a yard of the sand house door; I took a hoe and found out the child; the straw blazed up; there was a jug of water brought and throwed on the straw and on the child; I carried the body out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any time previous to this that the child might be saved - A. Yes; if I had known it when I first came out of my sand house the child might have been saved; at that time the prisoners were standing a little way from the sand house, and if I had known I could have gone in and taken the child out myself without either hoe or rake; the back part of the prisoner's sand house was on fire.

               <p>Q. Do you call them sand houses because you put sand in them - A. Yes; the sand is spread on the ground to dry, and whenever an opportunity offers they put it in to keep it from being wet. I asked Main what cause he had to ask Mrs. Wilson for a match; his answer was to light his pipe when he went by the kiln that was then burning; he signified also that instead of lighting his pipe as he first intended, when he came to the kiln, he altered his mind and carried the pipe in the sand house.</p>

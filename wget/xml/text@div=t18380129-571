                  </hi>. I am assistant to George Drake Sewell and Thomas Cross, of Frith-street, Soho. I recollect the prisoner coming to their shop, on Wednesday, the 17th of January, between four and five o'clock—she asked for a small piece of sarcenet, which she had; and then asked the young man for a short length of furniture of a particular pattern, for which she paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic"> 1/2 d.—</hi> when she was gone I missed between fifty and sixty yards of black silk, worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was on the counter when she came into the shop—in consequence of information, I went next day to several pawnbrokers, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Bartram's shop, with some of the silk lying on the counter—it was part of the piece which I had lost—I gave her in charge, and said I was sorry to see her in such a situation—she said if I would allow her to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> she would pay me for the silk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say where she got the silk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said she bought it of some woman living in St. Martin's-street—we went there, but she had not done any such thing.</p>

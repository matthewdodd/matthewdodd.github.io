                  </hi>. I am one of the directors and guardians of the poor of the parish of St. Marylebone. On Oct. 9th, I attended a meeting of the board, and afterwards; in company with some other gentlemen; I went round to see the state of the house—when I came to the ward in which the prisoner was, I discovered a great quantity of water on the floor—I went in and saw that a quantity of oakum had been, burnt, and the floor was burnt about three quarters of an inch down in depth; it was very much charred for about two feet round—there were four females in the ward—I asked who had set fire to the oakum, and the prisoner replied, "I have done it, and I will do it again "—I fetched the master and matron, and they gave her into custody—over this ward is the sleeping ward of the elderly women.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an inmate in the workhouse on Oct 9th, in the same ward with the prisoner—I did not see her do anything on that day—I saw the oakum on fire on the floor, and I fetched a pail of water, and threw it on the fire—I do not know who set it on fire; I did not see any<lb></lb>body set fire to it—I did not see the floor burning, only the oakum—the prisoner was in the yard when I threw the water on it; she had been in the ward before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant overseer of Marylebone parish—the workhouse is in that parish—after the fire, I saw the prisoner in the able bodied women's ward, where Quinlan was and two others—I saw about eight or nine pounds of oakum burnt on the floor, and a space of somewhat more than a yard in extent charred to the depth of about three quarters of an inch—we' have since had it taken up and examined—I inquired who had set it on fire—the prisoner was just outside the ward door, throwing her arms about in rather an excited manner—she said, "I did it, and I will do it again "—she went some little distance across the yard; and said; "I will fire the b—place; I won't work."</p>

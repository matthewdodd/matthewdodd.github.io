No; I bought them in July or August; I bought these of him in June; I gave him seven shillings and sixpence for them; he told me they were his own, and being reduced, he was obliged to sell them. I bought them on my master's account: I cannot say when the last purchase was; we make no entries only of pledges; I bought I know of him again; I do not know what books they were exactly; they were some poems; I gave him about two shillings and sixpence a volume.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Peatt in Whitechapel. The prisoner brought me some books; I bought them; he came again, I bought more; these three books instead of five volumes. I stopped him; I asked him if could bring the two other volumes; he said yes; he would go and fetch them. I followed him, and lost him in the Commercial-road. The next morning at noon he brought the two other volumes; he said they were his master's property. I asked him whether I could step and ask his master whether he was correct; he said yes; and he was to call in the evening. I never saw him any more until he was in custody. These are the books.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my books; I lost thirty two in all.</p>

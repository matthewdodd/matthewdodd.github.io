                  </hi>. I am time keeper, in the employ of Kirk and Perry, the contractors for building the military huts, at Woolwich. On Wednesday afternoon, 18th July, I went with the last witness to the house of the pri<lb></lb>soner—I saw the witness get partly into the house, and the prisoner tried to force him out—I saw the prisoner with a small instrument—I could not swear whether it was a file, or a small carpenter's tool, in his hand—I saw him with a saw afterwards, but first of all I saw him with some small in<lb></lb>strument—I saw the edge of it—it appeared to me like a small chisel—it might be a file—I afterwards saw him strike with a saw three times dis<lb></lb>tinctly—I am sure that was afterwards—he did not hit him, nor myself—I was trying to assist the prosecutor at the time to get his leg out—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor then received a more severe stab, and he was forced to let go his hold of the door—he had hold of the door before—I suppose he did not feel the severity of the stab till the last stab—then he said he had been so stabbed that he could not hold the door—my deposition was read over to me—this is my signature.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house to summon him on the complaint of William Forrest, on 18th July, about half past 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening—I found him near his residence, coming along the road—I said to him, "Russell, I have come about stabbing that man"—he said, "Come in, and I will tell you all about it"—I did not make use of any threat or promise—he said, "Forrest came to me this afternoon with a warrant; he poked his knee in the door; I tried to get him out; I was sharpening a saw with a file, and I poked his knee two or three times to make him take his leg away."</p>

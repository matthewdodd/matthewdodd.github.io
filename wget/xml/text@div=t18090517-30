The prisoner and two others came to my house on the 5th of May, about half past seven in the evening; they had two pennyworth of rum each, and asked for change of a pound note, which I gave them - a half guinea, a seven shilling piece, and two shillings in silver; the rum was paid for; they gave me a good note. After the other man had got his change, the prisoner wished to pay for the liquor himself; the other man then desired me to return him his note, and he gave me the change back again; he consented then for the prisoner to pay for the liquor; he then asked the prisoner why he did not pay for the liquor; the prisoner felt some time in his pocket, and said he wanted change for half a guinea; he gave me no half guinea; the other said I might as well change my note as you change your half guinea; he then desired me to give him the change again and take the note; I put him down the change I received of him; he then threw me down a note, very closely folded up, and they all three of them went out of the house as fast as they could go with the money.</p>

I was called out of my bed between three and four o'clock - I went to my shed, found the door open, and the lock and staple had been drawn; I missed a quantity of soot which had been loose about the shed - I stated it as ten sacks at first, but that was not correct; I suppose six sacks were gone - I went to No. 10, Cock-alley, and found the prisoners there; some soot was on the floor of the room they were in - I called for a basin of water to try whether it was my property or not, and it was; because there was saw dust mixed with it as there had been with the soot at my shed - we cannot help taking up the ashes of whatever there is mixed with the soot, and this was saw dust of mahogany - I compared it with that at my shed, and found it was the same - it is very common in the trade to mix saw-dust with soot.</p>

I asked if they lived there, and she said No- they then said they had taken it of the landlady the day before; I gave an alarm, and

               <p>Jennings. We were doing work for ourselves, and we had been out to try to get a little soot - we put it down against the wall by the London tavern; that was what I told the officer, and that it belonged to me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you absent? A. About five minutes - the prisoners went out, and said they were going to the London tavern for more.</p>

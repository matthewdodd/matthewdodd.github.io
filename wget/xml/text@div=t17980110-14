He was brought there upon a charge against him from the General Post-office, respecting a note which had been traced to him; I desired that he would state the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any sort of promise of advantage, or threat of disadvantage, to induce him to give an account of the business? - A. No, it was a voluntary account; I desired him to state the circumstances; he said, that last Saturday seennight, which carried it to the 11th of November, when he had done ringing his bell, he was coming from the cheesemonger's shop, at the corner of Bull and Mouth-street, where he had left his bell, which he usually did about five minutes before six in the evening; he trod upon something soft, he gave it a kick before him, and then picked it up, and put into his pocket, it was a pocket-book, but he did not look at it then, but went to his usual duty at the Post-office; that he went home to his wife's apartments, in Gower-street, where, on Sunday morning, he opened the pocket-book, and found in it two ten pound Bank-notes and six five pound Bank-notes, but there was nothing else whatever in the pocket-book; that he went on Sunday morning to a public-house, the sign of the Goat, in Cheyne-street, near Gower-street, where he saw the landlord and landlady of the house; he asked for the newspaper; to see if they were advertised, but he did not find any advertisement; he did not tell the landlord or landlady that he had found any thing; on the next morning, Monday, he went to his duty at the Post-office, he there paid one of the ten pound Bank-notes to Chalfont, a letter-carrier, who was to make his payment into the Treasury; he did not tell any body of having found the pocket-book; he called at several public-houses, between Monday and Thursday, to look if the pocket-book was advertised; on the Thursday, he paid three of the five pound Bank-notes to Mr. Aldridge, a grocer, in King-street, who had accepted a bill of fifteen pounds for his accommodation, which was soon becoming due; on Friday, he got cash for the other ten pound Bank-note, of one Ladbrooke, who keeps a public-house in Smithfield; I asked him what was become of the remaining three five pound Bank-notes, he said they remained in the pocket-book, which was at his lodgings in Gower-street.</p>

               <p>Q.Was Mr. Ferguson present at that time? - A. He was present at the time; to whom he gave the key of the box, which he said, contained the pocket-book and notes; I beg leave to say, that the prisoner was perfectly unembarrassed in giving this account, and equally so when I told him he must go to Bow-street.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I live in Cheyne-street, Bedford-square; I have known the prisoner some time, he has been a customer of mine for several years; he applied to me to lend him four or five pounds the latter end of August of beginning of September, or if I could not, if I would accept a bill for him, which I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he provide you with any money for the purpose of this bill? - A. The bill was due on Saturday the 18th, I think, and on the Tuesday preceding, I was serving some customers, he told me the bill was almost due, and said, because he would not put me to any inconvenience to find the money myself, he had provided the money as he had promised me, and laid me down three five pound Bank-notes; he told me there was the fifteen pounds, and I believe, went out of the shop immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of those three notes? - A. I looked at them to see that they were properly signed, I folded them up, and put them into a pocket-book, and in the course of the week, I made several payments, but whether I had those notes when the banker's clerk came to me, I do not know, but I rather think I had; when the note came to me, it was brought by a banker's clerk, I think from the house of Glynn.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pay him in Bank-notes? - A. I paid him all in Bank-notes, but whether they were the same three or not, I cannot say.</p>

            , or bearer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, by reference to books, if these notes were all unpaid on the 11th of November? - A. They were; whatever have come in have been since that time, some of them are outstanding now.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you not distinguish the notes by the letters as well as dates? - A. We do the small notes, but not so high as a five pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Robinson.) Q. Tell me, whether you know them to be the notes that you have described? - A. No. 4938, that is one that was inclosed in the letter, I know it by the initials of my own name, inclosed in a circle; No. 6354, I know that by the same mark, it was sent in the same letter, at the same time; No. 7556, that is likewise one that was inclosed in the same letter, and has the same mark; No. 7748, that was also included in the same letter, it has the same mark; No. 1699, that has got the same mark, and was in the same letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these were all put into the letter, and given by you to Fuller? - A. Yes; (the notes and the bills read by Mr. Shelton, and compared with the indictment.)</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100025"></xptr>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the letter belonging to that gentleman; I picked up the pocket-book in the way I have before stated; I must have been a madman to have circulated the notes in the Post-office, if I had stole them; I had no idea of their being stolen; I leave the rest to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Chalfont) Q. Did you tell the prisoner for what purpose you wanted it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he owe to the Treasury of the Post-office? - A. His payment on that day, was 8l. 7s. 7d. which I paid on his account.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Kitchener) Q. Is your business that of a tea-dealer? - A. Yes.</p>

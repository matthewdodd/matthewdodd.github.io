            - I have heard her say so, and heard him call her Nelly - I have heard people call her Ellen - the blows were struck at the side of her head, not close to the crown - she had nothing but a cap on - she could not say any thing, only she said, "Oh Mary, it is the poker he has got" - I said, "McCarthy, do not kill your wife" - I took her away from him, and took her into the next, room, and he went and sat down at his dinner again - he said nothing in answer to me, for I took his wife from him, and dragged her into the next room - he was striking her at the time she said, "Oh Mary, it is the poker he has got" - she had nothing in her hand, that I am sure of - nothing at all that I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she attempting to lay hands on him at all? A. No; she fainted away when I took her into the next room, which I had come out of, she could not walk herself - I carried her by the shoulders - she is well now and out of the hospital - I do not know whether she is quite well - I saw her last Friday - I have not seen her since - she was here on Friday - she did not talk about coming again to me - she was three weeks at the hospital - she went to the hospital directly it happened - I went with her - I took the same woman to the hospital that the prisoner was beating.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she provoked him in any way? A. I cannot say, not knowing Irish.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was fetched on Wednesday, the 13th of August, to King-street - I did not find the prisoner there - Mary Collins was in the room with the woman - I got there about a quarter before three o'clock in the afternoon - I ordered a cab to be sent for, to take the woman to the hospital, and I went after the prisoner - I saw the woman in the hospital the same afternoon - she was the same woman I took to the hospital; she was in a dreadful state - I found the prisoner, about three o'clock, at a granary, close to where they lived - I told him he must go with me- he was pointed out to me as McCarthy - he asked me what for - I told him for beating his wife - he said he wished he had given her another blow, or another hit, and killed her - he then put on his smock frock and went with me - he was not sober, nor yet so drunk as not to know what he was saying; he had been drinking - I took him to Green bank station-house, and as I went along, somebody gave me this poker - it was very fresh with blood about the nob, and that part, very fresh indeed - it was given to me a little after three o'clock - I do not know what has become of the woman - I have looked for her, and can hear nothing at all of her - I saw her on Friday afternoon; she left here with me - I have never seen her since - she said she was going home to a woman's who lives close by King-street, but she has no proper home - I have been searching for her, but cannot find her - I have been to the house she lived at, and about the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. I remember the woman being brought to the hospital on the 13th of August - I cannot say I remember who brought, her or who came with her - she was brought in some time in the afternoon - I do not remember the policeman being there - she had two or three contused wounds of the scalp, extending to the bone, at the upper and back part of the head - the skull is rather thin there, but it is not the thinnest part - the wounds were rather considerable - I examined them - there was no fracture of the skull - they appeared to have been inflicted with much violence - they might have been made with that poker - it is probable an instrument of that kind made them, or they might have been produced by a fall - there was no indentation of the skull - there was laceration of the scalp, exposing the bone- there was a wound; it would be difficult to describe the size of the wound, as it extended in different directions, over the space of three or four inches square - that was the whole extent - I do not mean to say there was an entire separation of the scalp for that space, but it was two or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040016"></xptr>three wounds, which, altogether, might have covered that space with contusions - and all there were contusions, besides the wounds - the scalp was not separated from the bone before the examination was made, at least it would lay down on the bone, in that situation, but on sponging it, it could be raised up, and the scalp could be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Altogether, how many injuries were there: wounds, bruises, and altogether? A. Three or four - there were two or three wounds - we call it a contused wound when the edges are separated - a contused wound is accompanied by bruises and contusions - the head was injured to the extent of three or four inches square - there was danger from inflammation attending these contusions and wounds- I should think a great quantity of violence must have been used to have produced them - the woman was perfectly sensible all along - she appeared to have lost a considerable quantity of blood - I should say this poker was a very dangerous thing to strike with - it would be very likely to endanger life - if it was handled two or three inches from the end, it would still be dangerous - the nob was likely to have made an indentation of the skull, and that might probably cause death - it is most probable that it would - there was not any other woman brought to me that afternoon with an injury on her head - I cannot remember the date exactly - we had no woman brought in that week who was similarly affected to so great an extent.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM OSMAN re-examined. I saw Mr. James at the hospital - he gave me a certificate on the following Wednesday - I did not see him the day the woman was taken to the hospital - I am sure it was on Wednesday, the 13th of August.</p>
               <p>MARY COLLINS re-examined. I saw Mr. James attending to the woman - I held a saucer while he shaved her hair off - Ellen McCarthy was the woman he attended, I am certain - I know this is the poker - I have often seen it in the woman's room - I do not know who gave it to the policeman - I did not go into the room afterwards, as the landlady locked the room up - they lived some time in the house - I was often in their room - I am almost sure that is the poker - it was either that or one like it - there was blood upon it when the policeman had it - I saw it in a woman's hand in the room in less than five minutes after this was done - there was then blood and hair upon it - I saw it in the policeman's hands afterwards - it appeared the same poker, and was bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he strike, gently, violently, or uphanded? A. He had his hand up, and seemed to be striking with force - I do not know whether it was with all his force - he had hold of the bottom part of the poker, because I tried to stop his hand with it - he seemed to have hold of it in this way (taking hold of it near the middle) - but I cannot exactly say, for I was frightened - I did not take hold of the poker, but of his hand - some of the smaller end of it was out of his hand - I tried to stop his hand, but was frightened, seeing the woman bleeding.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My old woman went into another man's room, and next morning he reported at the place he worked at, that she had done so and so - one of the men told me about it, and told the foreman too - as soon as I came home to dinner, we got to a few words together; and this happened at the same time, when I was a little jealous of my wife. There is nobody to speak for me. As to this witness, any thing she likes, she will do it. This is not the first time she has come against somebody.</p>
               <p>MARY COLLINS re-examined. I have had no quarrel with the prisoner, I am certain - I have never been a witness in any case before - I have been before a Justice, but never a witness against any body - I was before a Justice about three years ago, as I got a great deal of ill usage myself, and I went to complain - that was on my own case- it was against some men and women for beating me - the magistrate fined them 5l. each.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You have been before a jury about that child? Witness. This child in my arms is my own - I am not married - I have been before a Justice to father it.</p>

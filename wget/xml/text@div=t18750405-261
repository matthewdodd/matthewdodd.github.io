                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 17th March I received some shillings from Mr. Barker, and in company with Inwood, another officer, I marked those shillings with a cross—I gave them to Inwood with certain instruc<lb></lb>tions—about half an hour after Inwood came back to me, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said I went to Mr. Barker's premises, 48, Bishopsgate Street, where I saw the prisoner—I was with Mr. Barker then, the prose<lb></lb>cutor or manager of the establishment—I told the prisoner I was a detective officer, and I had received information that two persons had been there to purchase some scents, for which they paid five shillings—I said "It is nothing but fair to tell you that those shillings were marked"—he said "I have sold no scents, and I have not received any money"—I asked him to come from behind the counter, and I told him I should take him to the station, but before doing so, I should search him—he said "Well, sir, if you will</p>

               <p>come with me I will show you where they are"—he took me behind the counter at the further end and pointed to where these five marked shillings were on a shelf behind a mortar—I told him he would have to go to the station, and he said he had got some more money that he had taken, and he took the purse, and was in the act of pulling something out, when Mr. Parker interrupted him—those are the five shillings that I had previously marked, and given to Inwood—I afterwards searched the prisoner at the station, and found eleven shillings on him—I went to his lodgings and found a quantity of scents and other articles which I produce—they have the labels of Barker &amp; Co. on them—previously to me taking him to the station, he said he was very sorry for what he had done, and begged' Mr. Barker to forgive him, and not let him go to the station—I afterwards showed him the articles that were found at his lodging—I said "The land<lb></lb>lady has told me that you brought these to her at. various times," and I asked him if he wished to account for them—he said some he had bought, and others he could not account for.</p>

                  </hi>. My father carries on business as a wine merchant and druggist, at 48, Bishopsgate Street—I am the manager—the prisoner has been a salesman in the drag department about three years—he had no right to take money, there was a cashier whose duty it was to take it—when the prisoner sold goods he would make out a duplicate invoice—from certain information I received on 17th March, I gave seven shillings to Davis, and he marked them—on the same afternoon I went with Davis to our place and saw the prisoner—I stood outside while the officer went in—he said "You have been selling some scent"—King denied it, and then he said it was no good trifling or something to that effect, and said "I shall search you"—King said "If you will come across with me I will show you," and Davis followed him—I could not see King take the money up, but he handed it to Davis—he then said "I have other money here I have taken"—he took his purse out of his pocket and I interrupted him—I said "We shall accuse you of this"—I said it was a shameful thing, and he went into a. long ex<lb></lb>planation—these things produced are our property—some of them are labelled with our label, and the others are similar to what we have in stock—the prisoner had no authority to take any of those away—he did not buy them—the selling value of what the constable purchased was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these are our regular invoices.</p>

I assisted Davis in marking the seven shillings—I went on to 48, Bishopsgate Street with a young man named Batchelor—I saw the prisoner there, and in my presence Batchelor pur<lb></lb>chased these two boxes of scents containing three in each box, for which he gave the prisoner three marked shillings—the prisoner did them up and gave. them to Batchelor—I afterwards purchased these six bottles for which I' paid the prisoner two marked shillings and he gave me a ticket to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the man over the counter downstairs—I did not pay the" 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was the prisoner's duty I believe to go down with me, but I left the prisoner's department and went right out of the house—I then went back to Davis.</p>

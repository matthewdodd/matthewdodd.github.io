Some time ago I was in Mr. Lake's employ, and was engaged in printing some notes of the Beverley Bank—some impressions were imperfect, and I laid them on the shelf of the press I was at work at—I took one impression home—the prisoner lodged in the same room with me—I knew him by the name of Cornelius Veto—since he has been taken I have looked for that impression, and have not been able to find it.</p>

On 9th May I was in Mr. Wood's, a pawnbroker, in the City-road—the prisoner came in and asked where he could get a country note changed; they could not tell him, and as he went out he asked if I could tell him—I said I thought one of the Banks was the most likely place—he had a piece of paper in his hand, he went out—in about two minutes I went out, and saw him going up the City-road, towards Islington—he turned back, and went into a loan-office, came out again, and I stopped him, and asked where he had got the note—he hesitated some time, and at last said his master had sent him to Long-acre to get it changed—I asked who his master was—he hesitated some time, and at last said his name was Freeman, a furniture-dealer, in the Hackney-road—I said his account did not satisfy me, 1 took the note from his hand, and said he must come to the station—it was in two pieces, as it is now—when I had taken him to the station I went to the Hackney-road, but could find no Mr. Freeman—I went back, and told him so—he said he met a man in a public-house, near Shoreditch Church, who told him he would give him employment, and gave him the note and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to ride to Long-acre, to get it changed; that he rode as far as a public-house in Bishopsgate-street, and then got down—I said the City-road was not the way to Long-acre.</p>

On Tuesday evening I was at the Keys public-house, in Fleet-market, I saw him there and secured him - I did not know him before. It was under the gas lamp, but I was so agitated I could not call out.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEWIS. I am a porter. On the 31st of August, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Fleet-market, and saw three men hustling the prosecutor; they then ran down the market-the prisoner was one of them. I did not help the prosecutor. When the prisoner took the seals I was about two yards from them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale cheesemonger, of Giltspur-street; the prisoner was my clerk for eight or nine years—he succeeded his father—I placed every confidence in him—it was his duty to take cash and notes from the till, ascertain the amount, and pay it into the bankers'—he occasionally sent Meeking, who is in my employ, with it—this cash-book should show the amount paid in—he debits the bankers on 25th July with 162<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was his duty to keep a counterpart of the bankers' book—here is in it a refer-ence to folio 303 in the bankers' book, where I find only 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered—this ticket is in his writing; at the bottom of it is" 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. returned;" that was for light gold—I discovered this about 3d Aug., having taken stock, and found great deficiency.</p>

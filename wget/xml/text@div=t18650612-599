                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Hasletine, of the Mason's Arms, Buckingham-place—on 26th April, the prisoners came in—Peck asked for a glass of ale, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-sovereign—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and was going to give him the coppers, when Burgess said, "Why need you change a half-sovereign when I have got coppers"—I thought there was something wrong, looked at the change on the counter, and found a bad half-crown amongst it—I said, "You have taken the good half-crown out, and put a bad one in"—Peck said, "It is all good and right," and took the change away—Young was in my house at the time.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see a third man with the prisoners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I got the change from my bar-parlour—I had several pounds' worth there—they had plenty of opportunities of changing the half-crown while my head was turned to take the change for the glass of ale—I saw Peck in custody at the station about half an hour afterwards.</p>

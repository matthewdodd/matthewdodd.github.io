I am a pawnbroker's assistant, and reside in the Hackney Road—on Saturday, 9th July, I was in company with the prisoner, and had a little to drink—he invited me to go to his house to sleep—he lives at Barking—we all lay down about 12 o'clock—there was another young man with me—as I was getting into bed, I noticed the prisoner put his hand into my friend's pocket, and then put some money on the table—I then took out mine and laid it on the table, and three keys—I partially undressed myself; I took my coat off and laid it on the back of a chair—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket; I wore that as I slept, and a black chain attached—I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a pocket-book in my coat pocket, and about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my waistcoat pocket—I went to sleep about 12, and did not awake till 6—I got up, and found my chain was left, but the watch was gone, and the money as well; the purse was still there—the window was shut when I went to bed; it was partially open when I woke—I woke the prisoner, and asked him where my watch and money was—he said, "Where's my wife?" I told him I knew nothing about his wife—she had not been in the house—I saw her the night before—he quarrelled with her, and she left—he appeared to know nothing about my watch—I informed the police, and enquiries were made—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch—I saw it at the Barking Police Station four days afterwards.</p>

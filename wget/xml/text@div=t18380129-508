                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Anderton, a grocer—he lives at No. 26, Old-street, St. Luke's. The prisoner came to the shop on Tuesday, the 16th of January, between five and six o'clock in the evening—he asked for some articles of grocery—I cannot tell what—he gave me a sixpence—I slipped it into the till—there was other money there—soon after I found in the till a bad sixpence—that is all I know.</p>

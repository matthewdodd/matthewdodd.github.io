On the night of 18th May, I was on duty near Chandos Street, Strand—White spoke to me in Chandos Street, and pointed out the prisoners, who were standing at the top of King William Street, in conversation, for three or four minutes—they then went on, and Vine left Bunce and went into the Marquis of Granby, Chandoa Street—Bunce walked on towards Bedford Street, and waited about—I watched him twenty minutes or half-an-hour till Vine came out again and joined him—I spoke to them in Bedford Street, and asked if they' had any. thing about them—Bunch said, "No"—I said, "I shall take you in cus<lb></lb>tody</p>

               <p>on suspicion of having counterfeit, money in your possesion"—they refused to be searched in the street, and we took them to Bow Street—the corner of Russell Street, Covent Garden, Bunce tried to throw me down; made a rush at some area railings, and threw something down, done up in tissue-paper—it rattled on some iron wire over the area; it sounded like money, I heard it jink—he endeavoured to get from me, and to kick me; we had a struggle—nobody would assist me, and I drew my truncheon and struck him across the shoulders—I afterwards handed him to another constable, and went back to the area, where Mill handed me seven counterfeit florins and some tissue paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched the prisoners at the station, and found on Bunce four shillings, thirteen sixpences, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, good money, and several pieces of paper in which money had been appa<lb></lb>rently wrapped—I found this bad florin in his right hand pocket, not the pocket where the good money was—he said that he knew nothing about the florins—I found on Vine 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., six sixpences, and 14 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

I am a plasterer—I was in Chandoe Street, and saw the prisoners come there about 6.50—Vine pulled a can out of his pocket, and gave it to Bunce—they both went across the road together, met a little girl, gave her the can, and told her to get some bread—Bunce then walked down to Chandos Street a little way, and I suppose Vine gave a nod when the girl was coming back—they met her, and she handed Bunce the change and a loaf, which he tied up in a handkerchief—they walked away together towards the Strand, where they stood at the corner for ten minutes, talking—the constable came up about 7.15—I called his attention to them, and saw Bunce struggle with him—I saw him move something out of his hands—the girl is not here—she went away—I could not see what shop she went to, because it is the second shop round the corner, in a court.</p>

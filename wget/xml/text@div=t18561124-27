I was at the Antelope in Pimlico, in plain clothes, on 1st Oct, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the prisoners come in together—King asked for half a quartern of gin—I saw a half crown given by Brown to King, and he went out—Brown had a purse in her hand—I noticed it so as to identify it—King came in again in about five minutes, and joined Brown—they stopped about five minutes, and drank their half quartern of gin, and then went out—I went to Mrs. Humphreys, who lives next door—I there heard something—I then followed the pri<lb></lb>soners, who were just turning the corner into Eaton-place West—they turned to Eaton-square and came back again—I saw Brown leave King,</p>

               <p>and she went into Mrs. Humphreys' shop, and came out again, and went to the corner, and moved her hand to King, and he ran down Wise's cow yard—I took Brown, and gave her to another officer—I ran after King—I found him down the yard, and brought him up—on our way to the station he took this purse from his right hand coat pocket, and threw it away—I took it up, and found in it four half crowns and one crown piece—this is the purse and the coin—I can swear this is the purse that Brown had in her hand in the Antelope—it is a very remarkable one—there was a quantity of good money found on Brown.</p>

King came for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps, and gave me a half crown—I kept it in a drawer by itself—about five minutes after he was gone something was said to me by the constable—I looked at the half crown, and found it was bad—I bent it, and put it on the mantelpiece—there was no other half crown but that in the drawer—in a quarter of an hour afterwards Brown came in for a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper—she gave me a half crown—I bent it, and detained it, and kept the paper also—I placed that half crown at the other end of the mantelpiece, where there was no other money—I told Brown it was bad—she demanded it back—I refused to give it her—she said she had just taken it of a person—soon afterwards I gave both the half crowns to the constable—these are them—I marked them both.</p>

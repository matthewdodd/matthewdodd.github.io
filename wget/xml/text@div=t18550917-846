On 28th Aug., about 3 o'clock, I was on Tower-hill, and saw the prisoners coming away from the Tower-stairs—I had known them before—I saw Crawley pass this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Rider, who put it in his pocket—I could see that it was a watch—they walked over Tower-hill, and I followed them about 100 yards—I took hold of Rider, and asked him to give me the watch which he had in his pocket—he took it out, and was going to throw it away, but I took it from him; while I was struggling with him, Crawley got away, and was taken by another constable on the Friday following—I knew him well by haying him in custody, and am sure he is the boy—I first saw them forty or fifty yank from the stairs—I did not see Rider run at all.</p>

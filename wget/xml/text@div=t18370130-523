                  </hi>. I live at Ealing, near Hayes, in Middlesex. On the night of the 21st of January I saw the two Whites and Powell at the Jolly Horse public-house—about twelve o'clock I saw Ryder and went home with her—when we went into the house she fastened the door—I put the articles stated into my pocket, which I laid in the chair, and stripped and got into bed—I expected her to follow, she did not, but she got up in five minutes and opened the door, and the three male prisoners came in—I am sure of them—two of them put their hands over my mouth and tried to stop my breath—I cannot say which two it was—Ryder was in the room at the time, and she cried, I do not know for what—she had opened the door to them—they hallooed and rapped at the door first—I got away from them and saw John White routing my pockets—I had several blows in the room—as soon as I could get my clothes on, I tried to get out—they did not stop me from getting my clothes on, but I had several hits while put-log them on—they let me put them on, and then shoved me out of doors—when I got out I found I had lost four handkerchiefs, a nightcap, two pairs of stockings, a pair of trowsers, a bag, a crown, and three shillings—was struck, but I cannot say by whom—after I came out I went back to the room and asked them for a small parcel, and they all three came out and fell upon me and struck me violently—I had two black eyes—I slipped by them and ran away—I am certain of the three men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman. On this Saturday evening, between twelve and one o'clock, the prosecutor came to me representing that he was robbed—about that time Powell came up—I asked the prosecutor if he was one—he said he was—I took him into custody, and he said if I would allow him to speak to the prosecutor he would tell the b——fool where his parcels were; but instead of telling him, he shoved the watch-box door back and made his escape—I called King, and we got the constable—we went to White's and took them both into custody, and afterwards retook Powell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I was called, and went to Ryder's house—I found a padlock outside the door—I then went to White's house and apprehended them—the prosecutor identified them, in bed with another man—I went from there to Powell's house and found him in bed—King identitifed him directly he saw him—Powell wished to speak a few words to him and he said, "This man has not been robbed at all; if you will go to Ryder's, there are the things as he left them"—I said, "I can't get in; there is a padlock outside the door"—he said, "Go to White's, you will find the key there"—he said he heard a screaming in the house, and went to the girl's assistance, and that the prosecutor said he would set fire to set house—I went to Ryder's and found the padlock off, and the door fastened inside—White's mother was there—I said I had come for the man's clothes—Ryder said he had brought nothing into the house—I said I must go up stairs—she said, "You need not go up stairs; the man did not go up stairs"—I went, and on the stairs found the braces, which the prosecutor claims—we went back to White's, but found nothing.

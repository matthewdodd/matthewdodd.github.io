                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Lancaster-place, Strand. For the last three months I have not been in any business on account of ill health—before that I was with a friend, who is a solicitor, merely to occupy my time and to increase my income, intending to go into mercantile pursuits again—I know the prisoner—I first became acquainted with him on the 21st of July, at least he crossed the road in Fish-street-hill, as I was crossing towards the Monument—he came up to me, and claimed my acquaintance, saying he had met me at the Lyceum theatre—I said he might have done so, but I did not remember him—he reminded me that he was speaking to a gentleman named Myers, who I had formerly known, and had a sort of bowing acquaintance with—he said, "I think you will recollect that gentleman"—I said, "Yes, I recollect him, although I know very little of him now"—he walked and talked with me—he did not seem inclined to go, and I did not tell him to go—we went to a public-house called the Half Moon, in Gracechurch-street, where I wished to see somebody on business—I called for a pot of stout, which we took together—we came out together, and parted near the Monument—he said he saw a friend of his—I said, "Don't let me detain you," and he left—I met him again on the following Wednesday—he came running up to me at the pit door of the Lyceum theatre, and said, "How do you do, sir?" and asked if I was going into the theatre—I said I thought I was, and said, "Are you going in?"—he said, "No, I am going westward, but in all probability shall look in on my return"—that was all that passed then—I went into the theatre, and saw no more of him that night—on Sun<lb></lb>day, the 28th, I saw him on London-bridge Wharf, I think it is called—I was waiting, to see a person I expected from Gravesend—he came up, and said, "How do you do?"—I think he asked me if I would have some stout, and I declined—I said no, in consequence of ill health I should go home—I went home to my chambers—I said, "If you have nothing better to do, if you like a blow up the river, I shall be very glad to give you some tea"—he accepted the invitation and went to my lodgings, in Lancaster-place—I</p>

"You wretch, you shall not remain in my room, no man can be safe with a man like you; I insist on your leaving my room this instant"—he said, "I shall not, till you give me money"—I said, "You are mistaken in your man; you have mistaken my character alto<lb></lb>gether, in, supposing I will give you a shilling: it is very evident to me now</p>

               <p>how you get your money"—he then said, "Then I won't leave the room," and threw himself down in a chair—I insisted on his going—he said he would not—I said then I must to get assistance to have him taken out—I went out, and in the course of eight minutes brought a policeman back with me—immediately we got into the room the prisoner had put out the lamp, and was in the act of re-lighting it—he said immediately he saw the policeman, "Oh, policeman, take this man, he has been taking indecent liberties with me"—the policeman said, "No, you are my prisoner," or something to that effect.</p>

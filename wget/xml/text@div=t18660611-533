R. C. S. About midnight, I was called up by the prisoner and Mrs. Abdy—the prisoner asked me to go to his wife, as she was stabbed—I went to her, and found her quite dead on the floor, partly in the room, but with her extremities in the passage—I found six knives there—I made a post-mortem examination, and found a wound above the left clavicle, dividing the sub-clavian artery, and penetrating the left lung——the cavity of the chest was full of blood—the wound was the cause of death—when I went up to the dead body, the prisoner asked me if his wife was dead—I said, "Yes"—he said that it was a very bad job; he had done it, and jealousy was the cause of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the table, with five others—I did not notice any plates on the table—the point of this knife is in pre<lb></lb>cisely the same condition as when I received it—the blow would not have crooked the knife—I observed nothing about the other knives, except that they were very old—it is possible that if it struck a bone that might have turned the point.</p>

I have known the prisoner above seven years, and his wife about two and a-half years—I have seen her commit an act of violence on him by catching hold of his neck-handkerchief—he had his handkerchief like this (<hi rend="italic">twice round</hi>), and she caught it in this way (<hi rend="italic">single</hi>), and twisted it—she was just upon strangling him; he could not speak, only a <hi rend="italic">glutter</hi> in his throat—he was making a noise in his throat—I caught hishandkerchief, took a knife out of my pocket, and cut the handkerchief, and that released him—on another occasion, I saw her do the same thing with the same effect, and he said to me, "Groves, here; cut my handkerchief, or else she will strangle me, and I cut it—that was the second time.</p>

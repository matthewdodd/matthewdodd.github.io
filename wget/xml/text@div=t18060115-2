               <p>Q. Were them pieces taken away at the time the warehouse was broken open? - A. They were, I saw them afterwards at the Thames police office; I examined and measured it with another piece, and believe it to be the same canvas that was stole; the mark of Castle Lee was cut out, it was marked 2996, it is the number that is put on by the excise.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are an officer of the Thames police office? - A. Yes. I went to the prisoner Bryce's house on the 5th of November; he was at home, he keeps a tallow chandler's shop at East Smithfield; I went into the little parlour, I took two bolts of canvas that were standing on the floor, and three remnants were laying alongside in the room; they were apparently cut from the same bolt. I found another piece in the closet; I asked him how he came by it, he told me he could account for it elsewhere, he said he would shew the magistrate the bill of parcels, but he did not think it worth while to shew me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask Bryce whether he had any objection to your searching his house, did he not say with all my heart? - A. He did. I produce the canvas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (to Watson) Have you examined them pieces of canvas? - A. Yes, I have measured it, and I find it corresponds; I believe it is the same canvas.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you measure it? - A. The day after it was taken; they measured thirty-nine yards each, including the remnant, I chalked it on the piece, it is now erased by being handled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say you believed them to be your master's property? A. Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150004"></xptr>Q. Do you mean to swear it? - A. Only my belief.</p>

            .) Do you think that is the canvas that you lent to the prosecutor? - A. Yes, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you speak to belief only, because the Castle Lee fell a great quantity of this sort of canvas? - A. Certainly. I will not swear to it. There was thirty-nine yards marked on the bolt; but here is another circumstance, the gentleman that we bought the canvas off, is a quaker, it has the London number of their stamp; he always books what canvas we buy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge, have you got the bill of parcels here? - A. No, but the man shewed it at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do all bolts of canvas run nearly those yards? - A. They run from thirty-nine to forty, and so on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not got anything particularly to say. In respect to my stealing that, I never did. I never stole an article in my life. I had these goods, that the prosecutor took away from me, of Captain Sharp, for which he traded with me for soap and candles; unfortunately for me, he is gone up the Straits, and I cannot bring him forward.</p>

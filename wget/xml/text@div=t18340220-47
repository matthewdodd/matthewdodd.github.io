               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Gifford showed you the shoes, did he? A. Yes; I have known Gifford about a month - he had called in at the same time as the prisoner - he called in as he went by, to know what business the prisoner had there - I told him he was about buying a pair of shoes - the policeman did not stay there - we all went out of the shop together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the policeman desire the prisoner to come back with two shillings and ten-pence, and he should have them? A. He said that certainly - that was merely a joke - I told the prisoner I could not take less than three shillings - I should have had very little profit on them - the policeman said he should have them if he brought two shillings and ten-pence - nobody searched the prisoner that night - he was searched on Thursday, the 6th - I did not think he had them.</p>

            ; I was in his shop on the Saturday when the prisoner came for a pair of shoes; he tried on this pair; I had soled and heeled them, and put a patch on the right shoe, and darned it up, by which I know them; Gifford afterwards had the same shoes; I was there on Monday at ten o'clock, when the prisoner called for a pair of boots; Kay said he had none to fit him; he then looked at a pair of shoes, and said he thought he should buy the pair he had seen before; we asked him to leave a trifle on them; he said no, he would call another time; I went out about six o'clock in the evening, leaving Kay there; the prisoner had not come back then; the shoes then hung on a nail, within five or six inches of the window; I came back about nine, and they were gone; I met the prisoner on Wednesday, between three and four o'clock, in Bethnal-green-road; he saw me and ran away, and then I stopped for about five minutes till he came out of the gateway where he had gone in; on coming out he saw me and immediately covered his apron over the shoes which he had on his feet, and pretended to be stooping to trundle a hoop; I could distinguish the shoes to be the same, for he passed close to me; I went away and saw him again on Thursday morning, going for a loaf for his master; he had a pair of old slippers on then; I saw the policeman about ten o'clock that night, and gave him information; I went with him to the prisoner's master's house, 28, Searle-street, the same day; I found the shoes there which I have been speaking of; the prisoner was there at the time, and had the shoes in his hand; I saw him give them to the policeman, who put them behind his coat, and asked me for a description of them, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you talk to him when you saw him walking in the street? A. No, he walked pretty quick by me; I had soled and heeled the shoes, and welted them. I know them by my work, and the nails, and the welting, and the patch inside, the heels and soles, and nails.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I was not in Kay's shop on the Saturday evening - I was passing by and stopped at the door - the prisoner was inside the shop - they were agreeing for a pair of boots - I asked Kay if he had a small pair of boots for a boy of mine - he said he had not- Kay asked the prisoner three shillings for the boots - he offered him two shillings and sixpence - I walked away, and heard no more of it till Thursday, the 6th of February, when I went to No. 28, Searle-street, in consequence of information - I saw the prisoner there, and asked him for the boots which he had bought of Kay - he said he had bought no boots of him, but he had bought a pair of shoes - I came back to Plum, who went back with me - the prisoner was still there - I asked him for the shoes, he handed them to me - I put them behind my back, and asked Plum if he had mended the shoes - he said he had - I asked if he had no particular mark on them besides mending them - he said there was a crack inside of the right shoe - he described them, and I took the prisoner into custody - I asked him where he bought the shoes - he said he bought them in Bethnal-green-road, of a man in a fustian jacket, and he did not know who.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Kay long? A. For two or three months - I said he might give him two shillings for the boots - I heard the prisoner say he would bring two shillings and sixpence - I did not desire him to bring two shillings and tenpence - I merely said in a joke, two shillings and sixpence - he had offered two shillings and sixpence, but did not show the money - he said, "I will bring them back in half an hour with the money" - I believe I came out of the shop before Kay and the boy - I was in the road - the prisoner came out - Kay, I believe, was the last that came out - we came out one by one - I told the prisoner if he gave the two shillings and sixpence he could have them - I said nothing about two shillings and tenpence I am sure, to the best of my recollection - I am not in the habit of going to Kay's shop often - I was away from the shop about ten minutes after seeing him with the shoes - he handed me the same shoes, but I mistook the word shoes for boots, and I asked him for boots - and he thought they were boots I wanted.</p>

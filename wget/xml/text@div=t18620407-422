I keep the Harper's Arms, Theobald's-road—on 17th March the prisoner came and asked me for half a pint of porter—he then altered his mind, and said that he would have a glass of six ale, and put down a half-crown—I tried it with my teeth, bent it, and said that it was bad—he said, "God's truth!" and I handed it back to him—he took it up—I asked him where he took it, and he said in change of half a sovereign—he paid me a penny, and said that he would pay the halfpenny another time when he was passing, and I let him go—on the 20th he came again—I was not serving; but my barmaid said to me, in the prisoner's presence, that it was bad, and I saw a bad half-crown in her hand—he was given in charge.</p>

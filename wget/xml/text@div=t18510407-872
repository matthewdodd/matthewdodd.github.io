                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 16, Castle-alley, White<lb></lb>chapel. I know the prisoner—she came to Mrs. King's house, where I was taking tea; I believe it was ten weeks ago—she rapped at the window outside with a scrubbing-brush, and said she would have the b—h (Mrs. King) out, and she would have her life—Mrs. King went out—I went out and said it was a great shame for her to call a married woman a b—h—she said, "You are a couple of old wh—s," and hit me in the forehead with the brush—a little blood came—I went into the room, and fell on the ground—I was taken to the London Hospital, and remained there five weeks—I suffered much pain.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living as servant to Mrs. King, at 16, Castle<lb></lb>alley. I remember Mary Bryan coming there to tea with Mrs. King—I law the prisoner come up and tap at the window with a scrubbing-brush, wd she said to the mistress if she got her outside she would have her life—my mistress went out, and the old woman (Bryan) followed her—I heard a noise, and went out, and saw the prisoner with the brush in her hand, and she struck Bryan with it just over the nose—she went and sat on a chair, and went into a faint—she was taken to the hospital.</p>

I am a general dealer, and live at 3, Fryingpan<lb></lb>alley, Petticoat-lane—the prisoner has been my servant nearly twelve months—I am married—Mrs. King lives next door to me. On 18th Jan. I sent the prisoner to get a scrubbing-brush from a neighbour, who had borrowed it—she was gone a very short time when I heard her cry "Murder!"—I hastened down-stairs, and found her in Mrs. King's passage, on her hands and knees, with Mrs. Bryan, Mrs. King, and Mary Driscoll all three upon her—they had her by the hair of her head; they were very savage—I said, "Oh my God! three of you on the girl; you will kill her; loosen her hair"—King and Driscoll did so, but Bryan still kept hold—I said, "Mrs. Bryan, why don't you loosen the girl's hair? you will kill her"—she said, "I will: and I will serve you the same"—</p>

I am the wife of Henry Leary, a labourer—I reside in the first-floor of Mrs. King's house. On this Thursday I was looking out of my window and saw the prisoner come from the court with her mistress's scrubbing-brush in her hand—Mrs. King called out of her door and said to the prisoner, "Go and fetch your bastards from Ireland"—the prisoner turned round and saw!, "Do you mean me, Mrs. King?"—the old woman (Bryan) rushed out of the passage, and caught hold of the prisoner by the hair, and threw her into the passage"—the prisoner cried out "Murder!" and I cried out from my window, "What a shame! don't kill the girl; give her fair play"—Mrs. King, Bryan, and Driscoll fell on to the prisoner—I hurried down-stairs, and found her on her face and knees in the passage, and Mrs. Sampson was undoing Mrs. Bryan's hands out of her hair—I did not see the blow struck—I lifted the girl off her face and knees; she then began to cry, ad went into her mistress's place—I afterwards went to Mrs. King's place, and Mrs. Bryan said to Mary Driscoll, "I have a good mind to break your back, as you did not fetch the candlestick out aid split her head with it, as you did not assist me"—the prisoner was used shamefully—I attended at the police-court, but was not examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in James's-place, Lower-road, Islington; in consequence of what my apprentice told me, I went to a wall in my premises, and saw the prisoner in the act of stamping up three pieces of lead—he was then in the back kitchen of an uninhabited house, belonging to Mr. Perkins—I have always understood it was his—I saw the prisoner, after he stamped up two small pieces, put them up the chimney—I then went and fetched my lodger, and told him to watch while I went to give information to Mr. Wrigglesworth—but before I went I saw him stamp up another piece, and put it in the jambs of the chimney—I went and got Mr. Wrigglesworth, and brought him—the prisoner was in my house, in company with two others—I keep a beer shop there—Mr. Wrigglesworth came with a policeman, and while one was making his escape, the prisoner got from Mr. Wrigglesworth and ran away—I pursued him, and then returned and got the lead.</p>

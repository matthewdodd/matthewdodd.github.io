No; he was horse-keeper - he left some days after the box was lost; I have not seen him since, but believe he can easily be found; he was before the Magistrate at the same time as the prisoner - the prisoner said Cooper handed it to him, and employed him to take it - Cooper went out of the way two days after.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Sikes and Co., snuff-manufacturers, of Redcross-street. They sent this box to the Bull-inn - I was fetched when the prisoner was apprehended, and asked him how he came by the box; he said he found it behind the Royal Exchange.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say that Cooper gave it to him there - A. No; nor did he say any thing to the Alderman about Cooper in my hearing.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Monday night, at half-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Paul's-alley, Redcross-street; I asked him what he had under his coat, he said what was that to me - I said I insisted on knowing - he said he was only going a little way with it, and that he picked it up somewhere about Whitechapel; that he did not know what was in it. I took him into Mr. Reeves's, broke it open, and found it was snuff; a bill in it lead me to Mr. Sykes's - he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090027"></xptr>nothing about Cooper then. But two days after he said Cooper gave it him; he also said he had sent a private letter to the Alderman that contained all about it. I took Cooper before the Alderman.</p>

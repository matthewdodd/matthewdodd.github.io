            . I am a patrol. The prisoner came to me, said he had been in Mr. Hodgkingson's employ, and had been sent to receive 2l. 18s. 6d., and under those circumstances he wished to surrender - Mr. Hodgkinson had given instructions to the officers to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have a wife and two children- Mr. Hodgkinson gave me 1s. a day to support them and pay my rent - after receiving the money I met a friend, who gave me some ale, and I lost part of the money; I was afraid to return.</p>
               <p>MR. HODGKINGSON. I merely took him to oblige the overseers, to run on errands.</p>

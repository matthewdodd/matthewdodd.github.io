            . I am a gardener, and live at the workhouse of St. George, Little Chelsea. The prisoner was also in the workhouse. About eight o'clock on Easter Tuesday evening, after I got home, the prisoner seemed as if he had had a drop of drink, and he seemed to have some money; Mr. Houison came in on Wednesday morning to see the men; master examined us all, and I saw the prisoner in the water-closet playing bo-peep - he was looking about him, and before Mr. Houison got to him I saw him stoop down and make a hole in the earth; he came out of the privy - nobody else went in there before Mr. Houison went up to the prisoner, close to the privy; after he left the privy he stood among the rest of the people - there were about two hundred and forty paupers; Mr. Houison said he was the person, and he would swear to him; I went to the place about ten minutes after, and saw the earth was fresh stirred up - I just pulled it away, and there were two watches under the mould; I gave them to Carter, the master of the workhouse - Mr. Houison claimed them.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George's, Hanover-square. I have two watches, which I received from Houison, who charged the prisoner with breaking his window, and stealing them - I have had them ever since; the prisoner said nothing to the charge - I secured him.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOUISON. These are my watches; I had them to repair - they are two of the three which were stolen on Easter Tuesday; I received them from Carter, the master of the workhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in great distress; I worked in the garden for seven or eight years, and had no encouragement for it, and that tempted me to commit the crime.</p>
               <p>JOHN DREW re-examined. He worked in the garden sometimes, but was very lazy, and would do nothing hardly.</p>

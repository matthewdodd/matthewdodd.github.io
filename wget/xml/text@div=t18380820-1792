                  </hi>. I am an attorney and solicitor—I carry on business under the firm of Blacklock, Bunce, Vincent, and Sherwood—I am the only person interested in a pecuniary point of view in that from—the prisoner entered my service on the 1st of January, 1835—the first year I paid him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the second year I increased it 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making it 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 1st or 2nd of November, 1836, I increased it nominally to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but he was only to receive the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the other 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be appropriate in another way—he attended to the Chancery department only—I intrusted him also with the receipt and payment of money generally in the office—he kept a cash book to enter the payments—I gave him cheques from time to time to make disbursements—I never gave him less than a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—he never entered in that account any sums but those I advanced him for that purpose-in June, 1837, I looked at the state of that account, and in consequence of that investigation, I took that book account from him, and discontinued that employment—on that occasion I forbade him to receive money, or to interfere with money in any way—he was not to meddle or interfere in any way with the money belonging to the office—I bought an iron box, and gave directions in the office, that if any money was received in my absence it was to go into that iron box, and not be carried in the clerks' pockets, but if I returned before night-time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200021"></xptr>
               <p>the money was to be immediately handed to me—I usually left the office after post time, about a quarter to seven o'clock—I did not return after that, unless there was a consultation, or any thing of that nature—the money received while I was in the office was to be paid to me directly, and if received after I left for the evening, it was to be placed in the iron box—the box was not locked—the key was left in the office-Heath had the care of the key, and Heath had the account intrusted to him which I for<lb></lb>merly intrusted the prisoner to keep—the arrangement extended to all the clerks in the Chancery office, and the same arrangement existed in the Common Law office as well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect whether the prisoner has acted on that by receiv<lb></lb>ing money and handing it over to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In one instance, in December last, be handed me one guinea received from Mr. Westmacott—he brought it to me in the office—I do not know Mrs. Brewin at all-a Mrs. Cowper<lb></lb>for waite was an old client of the office—the prisoner never accounted to me for two guineas received from Mrs. Brewin, in October last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before we go into any other matter, Mr. Vincent, let me ask you if it is true, that in June, 1837, you expressly forbade the prisoner meddling with cash on any pretence whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes I did, when I took the book away from him on the 10th of June, 1837—my firm ostensibly consists of four persons—Mr. Blacklock, who is dead, Mr. Bunce, who has resigned his share of the business to me and retired, and the stipulation was that I should keep up the name of the old firm—that was not in writing—Mr. Bunce is here now—he is one of the Masters of the Court of Queen's Bench—the fourth name in the firm is Mr. Sherwood, he holds a public situation in the Common Pleas—he is not a partner of mine, nor in profits of the office at all-his name was merely added to it by way of bringing his son in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that if I came to your office with a suit, depending to look to the responsibility of four persons, I must look to yourself, and yourself only? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is all—I should suppose our names are in the Law List—I have not looked at it, but I have no doubt they are—I believe Mr. Sherwood is Chief Officer under Fines and Recoveries, under the new Act for taking acknowledgments from married women—I believe he is Chief Clerk of the Court—I do not know what title they give it—there are or six offices now amalgamated into one under the new Act, and I believe he holds them all—there are many offices he held—he was Clerk of the Judgments, and Clerk of the Dockets—I believe he it now called Chief Clerk of the Court—he is an attorney—he is on the roll and takes out his certificate—he never interfered in my business except to take the money while I was out-to look after the money while I was at the assizes—he is named in the firm, but I will not admit he is a partner-his son is about twenty-one years of age—he is articled to me—I do not practise in the Court of Common Pleas at all—I am obliged to keep business in one Court as well within I can-our connexions are all northern agents—I do not recollect a case within five years that I have had to go into the Common Pleas with, but if a client was sued there, I should certainly have to go there—I keep his son strictly at work—he is always in the Chancery department—I intend that to be his department—that is the department where the prisoner was also em<lb></lb>ployed—I have sometimes two hundred suits in that department in the course of a year, agency and proper—I think when we were burnt at the fire in the Temple, I had to make a list, and could not make out quite two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200022"></xptr>
               <p>hundred—the fire was on the 6th of March—I lost every thing-great deal of money must be disbursed in the course of those causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But that you forbade the prisoner to meddle with since June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I desired him to sit in the office, and that the out-door work should be done by other clerks—I forbade him to meddle with my money—I never bring an action in the Common Pleas if I can avoid it—an attorney always chooses what Court he will go into—I cannot take on myself to say, among eight hundred causes, that I may not have had one, two, or perhaps three causes in the Common Pleas, but I avoid the Common Pleas—they were not causes of my own, but as an agent-as proper, I never do certainly, but as agency, if a case has been ordered in the Common Pleas, of course we should do it—I may have brought actions there as agent, but I do not recollect—my books are burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the cause of Brown <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Newell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were three causes, I think the reason of that was it was a bankruptcy, and in case we lost one trial, we were to have the opinion of all the Courts on it—it was brought in the Exchequer, Common Pleas, and King's Bench—I have brought actions in the King's Bench—Mr. Bunce has had no interest in the business since the 19th of May, 1834—Mr. Blacklock is dead—he was appointed Master in the King's Bench, and left the firm—the prisoner had nothing to do with Common Law business at all—it is a thing he did not understand—he was very clever in his own department-bankruptcies I generally take myself—he was handy to any thing I wanted—he was three years and a quarter in my employ-towards tbeend of January, or beginning of February, I believe he was arrested, and he wrote me a letter requesting money—I did not receive the letter myself—he wrote to the clerks in the office, begging them to ask me to advance money to take him out of custody—they told me of it—I did not advance him money on that occasion, but I forbade him ever to come into my office again—he did come again after he came out of confinement, and I turned him out and sent him away—he wanted a private interview with me, and I would not grant it—he said he wanted to explain something—I said his explanation must be put in writing; I had forgiven him twice, and I was not going to forgive him a third time—he sent to me to know if I would see any attorney on his be<lb></lb>half, and he sent his brother to me to know if I would see a friend on his behalf—I afterwards saw Mr. Westmacott—he came to me to know the charge I had against the prisoner—that was some time in February—I have tried to recollect the date, and if it is right on the draft of some papers which have been saved, I think it was the 23rd of February, but Mr.; Westmacott can tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, on that occasion, charge the prisoner with having em<lb></lb>bezzled or taken away any of your money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not go before a Magistrate then—I was drawing a case, and the fire happened—I did not go before a Magistrate at all—I went before the Grand Jury, in March or April—it could not be March—I was too much engaged in consequence of the fire then-when I went before the Grand Jury, in April, I did not prefer the present bill—I think I preferred this bill the following Session, I think it was about the latter end of April or May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, in all that time, ask the prisoner for any account of these two guineas, or give him any opportunity of explanation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; because his friend Mr. Westmacott "had told me I could not do otherwise than pro<lb></lb>secute—I told him the nature of the case, and he refused to have any thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200023"></xptr>
               <p>to do with it—I did not give the prisoner any opportunity of explanation—I would not see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you, was not an offer made, on the part of the prisoner, that he would go before any Magistrate, and enter into a full explanation of all matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to me, certainly—I swear no such offer was made—I never saw anybody but his brother, and Mr. Westmacott—I never saw George Shaw the brother but once to speak to him after I discharged the prisoner—that was when he made the request that I would see Mr. Westmacott-neither George Shaw, nor Mr. Westmacott, told me that the prisoner was ready to appear before any Justice whatever to enter into an explanation of the transaction-George Shaw did not offer to pro<lb></lb>duce the prisoner, and to go before a Magistrate to answer any charge that I might have to make against him—he never said any thing of the kind-nor did anybody else ever make that offer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you, did not Mr. Shaw, or Mr. Westmacott, offer to refer any doubt you might have about the prisoner's accounts to any gentleman in the profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Westmacott came with the officer for security—I think Mr. Westmacott very likely did offer to do so-but on entering into explanation Mr. Westmacott was of opinion it would be dangerous for us to enter into any thing of the kind—I think it was the 23rd of February, or perhaps a week after, that Mr. Westmacott told me so—we had two long interviews on the subject—I refused to have any thing to do with the prisoner, but not with any person on his behalf, for I saw Mr. Westmacott—it was never proffered to me to see any one else—the prisoner was in the employment of Mr. Smith when I became acquainted with him—it was not at my solicitation or request that he left Mr. Smith—he came to me in November, 1834—he stated that Mr. Smith had not behaved well, and he was then at liberty to leave him—I had a clerk named Edwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you had not sent Edwards repeatedly to request him to come to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had sent one or two notes to see him in the spring of that year, hearing he wanted a situation—I did not send Edwards to him several times to request him to leave Mr. Smith and come to me—he came tome on the 1st of January, 1835—he never did his own business in my office in his own name—he has done business in my name, but on my ac<lb></lb>count, not on his own account—I have no such book as a Chancery ledger—there was a posting-book, but that is burnt—I had a book with a peen cover—there was a Chancery day-book and two others—the items were collected under different heads into the posting-book, and that has been burnt—I will show you what books I have—there are several green books, but I know the book you are inquiring about—that is burnt-in November, 1836, I took to posting all the books myself—the book which I posted is burnt—there was a heading in that book of entry, with the name of Shaw on the top of it, and there was the name of Pell-Pell's son is an articled clerk-Shaw was not an articled clerk—I have no posting-book here with, the name of Shaw in it—that was the only book which ever had his name in it—I can show you a spe<lb></lb>cimen of what was the way of doing business—I have brought the books that I have had since—I do business in the same way-here is one book which was saved—(<hi rend="italic">producing one partly burnt</hi>)—that is the prisoner's own posting-book, which was burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that never to your knowledge, or in any way</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200024"></xptr>
               <p>whatever, the prisoner practised on his own account in your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him leave to defend himself in an action, hut nothing else—he never acted in my name—there are four articled clerks in my office, two are articled to Mr. Sherwood, and two to myself—they are under my control, and get their instructions from me—Mr. Sherwood is not a partner in any profits in my business—he is not a partner at all—he has no right to practise in my office, but I was very ill in 1835 and 1836, and that was the cause of the arrangement—the articled clerks pay premiums, which I take.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So as to have as many articled clerks as the law allows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She knows that I received two hundred guineas last March, for one clerk articled to Mr. Sherwood—I know by law an attorney cannot take more than two articled clerks at a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this young man articled to Mr. Sherwood as a partner of yours, carrying on business in the partnership with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, but I can send for the articles—Mr. Sherwood does not do business as an at<lb></lb>torney at all—I recollect the terms of it, because I altered the articles—he was articled to Mr. Sherwood, but to obey my commands—I do not know that Mr. Sherwood cannot act as an attorney—there is a clause in the Act of Parliament to fit this very case—it is the clause for regula<lb></lb>tion of the Courts—there is an exception in that Act for the holder of the situation, which Mr. Sherwood fills—he may practise, but he does not—the names of the four articled clerks are, George Pell, and George Massey Heath, articled to myself; and John Sherwood and Edward Lewis Mayor; articled to Mr. Sherwood—they are both articled to Mr. Sherwood-l con<lb></lb>sider Mr. Sherwood, jun. as the clerk of his father, obeying my com<lb></lb>mands, and working in my office—Mr. Sherwood has no share in the pro<lb></lb>fits, no control in the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now we will come to Mrs. Brewin. When did you first see her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till after I discharged the prisoner—I preferred this bill in May—I saw Mrs. Brewin in March or April—I should think it was April—I went to her at her house at Hackney—I had never seen her before—I knew nothing of the business done in my office for her till Mr. Anderdon the Chancery Barrister's bill for fees came in, and then I found the name—I think that was soon after the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I discovered that a fee in Mrs. Brewin's case had not been paid, and that led to the discovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you no knowledge of the case before Mr. Anderdon's bill for fees came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had not found a case for his opinion among the papers of the prisoner—I knew nothing about her business, or how it was done, till I had a conference with Mr. Anderdon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then will you swear she was ever your client at all, at any one moment of your life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she was brought by Mrs. Cowperthwaite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, of your own knowledge, that she was a client of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray have you ever been in this Court before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have been here several times—I was here the other day on the prosecution of Cain—I think you were in it too—that case was not con<lb></lb>ducted by the prisoner—it was conducted by myself—I think the prisoner had no share in conducting it—that case took up a good deal of my time and attention in the week—I think that was just the week before the prisoner was arrested and taken out of my office—I should think it was.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200025"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever prosecute or attempt to prosecute any other clerk of yours for embezzlement, as you call it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never took one to Bow-street—I applied at Bow-street for a warrant against one of the name of Birch—that is about two years ago—the Magistrate refused the warrant—he said he thought it was a matter of account, and not embezzlement—he went away with the cash of the office without giving it to me—I think it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had not given me an account of every thing except 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had only been in the office about fourteen days—he had done nothing during that time—he charged a salary I had never greed to give him, and so set it off—he left all the work undone in the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you again, whether you did not tell Mr. Westmacott you had an account opened under the head of Shaw, with your knowledge, and that you had allowed him to practise in your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I admitted that there was an account in his name—I did not tell him I allowed the pri<lb></lb>soner to practise in my name—I explained to him how it was—I think it is very likely I told Mr. Westmacott that I allowed the prisoner to intro<lb></lb>duce one or two matters into the office—he was not to have the profits—he was to introduce them for his own accommodation—he supplied his re<lb></lb>lations with law at my expense—there was one case of Lee I gave him leave to defend at my expense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he was not to have the profits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he never received a farthing in his life out of any of the rubbish he brought in—I believe I received what there was—I never gave him leave except in the case of Wallis <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Philpotts, which forms one of the indictments on the present occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray did you ever say to any one that you were determined to have the prisoner in Newgate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; never to any one—I said I had taken the opinion of counsel, and I was to prosecute him—that I had the opinion of Sir John Campbell and Mr. Bodkin—the prisoner knew it was to be so—Mr. Westmacott told him—I went with an officer and apprehended him at his own lodgings—he had not ran away—he left word where he was living in case I wanted him—he wrote me an impudent letter telling me where he was to be found, and there he was found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have mentioned Mr. Wallis, and one of the indictments being a bout his business, did you take him before the Grand Jury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I en<lb></lb>deavoured to take him before the Grand Jury, but he would not go-at first he said he would go, and then he said he would be d-d if he would—he did not tell me he had no charge to make against the prisoner—I have seen the officer who took the prisoner, since he was taken—he came to me to know whether I wanted him—I said nothing to him about the prisoner's making any resistance—that I will swear—I asked him what were the expressions the prisoner made use of when he was taken into custody, and he first of all told me, in the pre<lb></lb>sence of Mr. Sherwood; and when Mr. Sherwood thought it was material to put it down in writing, he said, "Oh no," and would not say any thing more—I allude to Mr. Sherwood the elder—he came to our house-what<lb></lb>ever was said, was said by Mr. Sherwood—I asked what were the words Shaw said when he was first taken into custody, when he got into the street opposite a public-house, and he repeated the words—Mr. Sher<lb></lb>wood was about to take them down, and then he said he would not give any more—I cannot tell the officer's name—I think his number was 189—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200026"></xptr>
               <p>think I had this conversation with the officer just before the trial was about to come on on the first Session—he came to Mr. Sherwood's house in Woburn-square—he first of all came to the Temple—I wanted to know what he wanted, and desired him to call in Woburn-square—he was not sent for to come to the Temple—he came of his own accord—I never sent for him, but I thought it was something important he wanted to commu<lb></lb>nicate, and I desired him to come to Woburn-square—he said, "He wanted to beat you," or something—Mr. Sherwood wanted to take that down, and he said he would not say any thing, and Mr. Sherwood said, "You had better be off, you have been tutored," or something—Mr. Sherwood had nothing to do with it except as a friend—(<hi rend="italic">William Sands, policeman S</hi> 189, <hi rend="italic">was here called in</hi>)—that is the man I speak of.</p>

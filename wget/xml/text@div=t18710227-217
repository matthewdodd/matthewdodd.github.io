                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 663). On Saturday night, 8th February, about 8.30, I was on duty in Walbrook, and saw Griffiths and Cox standing opposite Mr. Howell's public-house—Cox went into the public-house three times—she said something in a whisper, and I gave a signal to Hunt, who was in plain clothes, and went on my beat—about 9.55 there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in Cannon Street, and I saw Griffiths and Cox there, and Martin, to the best of my belief—they seemed to be fighting; hitting one another.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 599). I received information from White about 9.45, and went into Deacon's coffee-house, kept by Mr. Howell, and there saw the three prisoners and the prosecutor together, with a pot of ale before them—I watched them for more than an hour—when I had watched them about a quarter of an hour Griffiths went out with the prosecutor—they all went out, and I followed them into the "Three Crowns," Dowgate Hill—I went in, and saw them all drinking together there—I called the attention of Newnham, another constable—I saw Griffiths put her arm round the prosecutor's neck, while Cox and Martin covered her, to prevent observation—Griffiths and Cox then left the house with the prosecutor, and Martin remained inside—I afterwards saw Griffiths and Cox leading the prosecutor into Great St. Thomas Apostle—they propped him up against a wall, and left him there—he was very drunk—I asked him if he had lost anything; he told me something, and I took Griffiths and Cox in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It did not occur to me that they had robbed him before he left the public-house; but I thought they might before they left him—the place where they propped him up was 300 yards from the public-house—he was not too drunk to come to the station; but he was kept there all night, because he was drunk—he had a cap on—I heard that a friend lent it to him because he lost his hat; but I do not remember hearing that he lost it in a fight—sixpence was found on Griffiths.</p>

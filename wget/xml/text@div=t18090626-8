Nothing of my property; something like a duplicate; that strengthened my suspicion; I enquired of her what induced her to leave my house that morning, she said she had gone into Little Brittain to a particular acquaintance of hers, Mrs. Cox, the White Swan; I went with the constable and enquired, I found by the mistress of the house that she had not been there; she then said that she had been down Ludgate-hill; I sent the constable to the pawnbrokers, and other people to different pawnbrokers; the first thing that was found was a curtain at Mr. Flemings; it was pawned there for seven shillings.</p>

I did, I had others of the same pattern; I had only missed it that morning, they were going to be washed and calendered, and he put up again; that was the first thing that caused my suspicion. On it being brought before her she owned that she had pawned it that morning. The three candlesticks were sent in to me by a pawnbroker very near to me, his name is

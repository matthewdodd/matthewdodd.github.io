                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Johnson, and live at Shirley-common, near Croydon. In Jan., 1848, I was living at Peckham—the prisoner was introduced to me, and brought me a child to nurse—it was a boy, about three months old—she called it Louis, and in the course of the year I had it baptized by the name of Louis—I was present at his baptism—the prisoner did not tell me her name when she brought the child—she was to pay me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for bringing it up—she afterwards sent some flannel for it—for the first three months she came to see it four times—at the end of the three months, in April, I received this letter from her—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"My dear Madam, in consequence of a sudden death in my employer's family, I have unexpectedly returned to London for a few days; if the weather will permit me to-morrow, Thursday, I shall probably see you to take out my dearest baby for an hour, if he is well enough. I am afraid his father will be determined of him going to France, to his mother; a proposal I strongly oppose. My hand trembles, I can scarcely write; perhaps you may enter into my feelings. My love and kisses to my dear baby, with kind regards to yourself and Mr. Johnson. Yours very sincerely, S. Tavern. Clarendon, April 26th, 1848.—P.S. While writing, a circumstance has occurred which will probably prevent me from coming to-morrow; I will say Friday; if it will be improper to take out my dear baby, please write to Miss Harrington, and say he is not well; I shall see her to-morrow, but not say I have written to you. Excuse haste and trouble.")—I did not see the prisoner again till February, 1849—no money was paid me in the mean time—I received letters from her—she passed by the name of Drake in Feb.—she came then, and said she could not leave home before, on account of her mother being so ill—she said she would take the child to an institution in Boulogne, that its father had been brought up there—she paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and still owed me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she took the child away, but not the clothes—I went with her to the Dover station—she paid her passage to Dover, and I saw her go off with the child, in the train—next night she came back to my house, at Shirley-common—she said she had been to a doctor, and he had told her the child had got the water on the brain, that it would not live long, and that she had better bring it back to where the child had always been brought up; that she would not take it away any more if I would keep it, for she would go to service, and do the best she could for the child—I agreed for it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the future—it was very ill at that time—I did not see the prisoner again between that month, Feb. and Nov.—I</p>

I received this letter from the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"My dear Mrs. Johnson, with a trembling hand, and aching heart, I write you this letter. You will be sorry to hear I have been obliged to sell the greatest and best part of my clothes to pay my expenses. I am better, but I am a poor ceature, scarcely able to go about; when walking in the park on Saturday, for the benefit of the air; I accidentally met with Mrs. Musgrove, a relative to the family I lived with in Manchester; my appearance excited her pity, and she offered to take me with her to Madrid, in Spain, which I have accepted; otherwise I could not have got a place, nor am I able to take one. I hope the sea air may do me good, if I have strength to bear with sea-sickness. I did not write to you before; had I done so, they would have seen my letter; they are all strangers to me, and I do not wish them to know my affairs. You say I am unkind to the child; I hope and trust you will never be called to encounter with the trouble I have; I have suffered great privations on his account to pay you the money I have. I do not wish you to get him more things than I am able to pay for; my heart's desire is to pay you; it will take me some time to earn what I already owe you; my wages are but 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per year; had I had my health, and stayed in my place, my wages would have paid you, and brought him up respectably, but I cannot do impossi<lb></lb>bilities. I have not heard from him since I saw you, nor is it in my power to do anything for him but what I can earn; I wish you would let him go to the parish; if I am spared with life to return to my native land, I will then take him, and do all that lays in my power for him; should I die in going over, I shall request what few things I have left to be sold, and the money sent to you; but you must say it is money I borrowed from you; if it is known, my parents will curse me in my grave. My heart is broken at writing this, but I know not what else to do. If I had not done this, I must have been starved to death. If I am spared with life, you will hear from me in a few months; it may be six months, or it may be twelve, before I return to England; if I live, I leave London at six o'clock this evening. Kiss my dear child for me. I hope you are all well; good night, and God bless you. Yours sincerely, Sarah Drake. Nov. 26th, 1849. 22, Edward-street. I leave here to-night.")—I went the same day to Edward-street, Dorset-square, and got some information, which made me go to Harley-street, but I did not know the number, and did not find her that evening; but on Wednesday morning, the 28th, I went to 33, Harley-street, at a little after ten—I took the child with me—I saw the prisoner, and said, "Good morning"—she said, "Oh, it is Mrs. Johnson; I thought I should see you, by my dream"—I said she was a very cruel woman to cause me so much pain and trouble—she said she could not help it, she could not send me any more money, that she did not know until the night before, that she was not going abroad, that the family had put it off till the spring—I said, "Now, don't say so, Mrs. Drake, for you have no intention of going abroad"—she asked me to walk into the kitchen a few minutes, until she had seen her mistress—I went in, and waited there a few minutes, and then came back to the housekeeper's room, to the prisoner, and told her I must leave the child there, that I was not to take him home any more if I found her—she asked me to take him back for a week—I said, "Mrs. Drake, I must not take him back any more"—she said he was looking a great deal better, and he had got much stouter than when she had seen him last—I told her he had grown a very hearty little fellow, and had got quite well—I said she had better take his pelisse and hat</p>

Providence so provided for me, that I have kept it from any one in the house. I hope and trust you will not expose me. Yours sincerely, Sarah Drake, 33, Upper Harley-street, Cavendish-square. Nov. 29th, 1849")—on Saturday, 8th Dec, I went down to North Leverton, in Nottinghamshire—a coffin was shown me there, with the body of a child in it—it was the child I had had to nurse—there were no clothes in the coffin—Smith showed me a red frock, a black petticoat, and a flannel petticoat, and I recognized them as belonging to the child—I also saw the handkerchief that was round the child's neck when I left it, also a pelisse and a cap—after I discovered that the prisoner's name was Drake I called the child Louis Drake.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>after ten o'clock in the morning—she came into the kitchen with the child for a few minutes—I saw her return into the housekeeper's room, which is down stairs, on the same floor as the kitchen—I had occasion to go into the house<lb></lb>keeper's room while Mrs. Johnson was there with the child—I noticed her leaving the house by the area steps, and saw the prisoner run and ask her a question—she then went away without the child, and the prisoner returned into the housekeeper's room—I do not know how long she remained there—I never saw the child again—about half-past twelve I saw the prisoner in the kitchen—she said the woman (Mrs. Johnson) had caused her a great deal of trouble, that she (the prisoner) had been responsible for money, and that the woman said her husband would summons her—(I had not heard what Mrs. Johnson had said to her at the area steps—I was so placed that the prisoner could not see me when she went up the steps—I was in the servants' hall, but the door was nearly shut)—about a quarter of an hour afterwards, she asked if I had got a small box which I could let her have—I said I had one, and I would let her have it—she said she would get me another soon, that she had got clothes which were of no use to her, and she wanted to send them to her sister's children—she did not have the box—she did not ask me for it any more—the servant's dine at one, but it was half-past one that day—she asked the housemaid to help at dinner, because she wanted to write a letter—she told me to go in to my dinner, that she had to go up-stairs for her paper and pens to write her letter—I then went in to my dinner, as she desired me, and next saw her at twenty-five minutes to three, after my dinner—she came down stairs into the kitchen, and told me she had packed her box—soon afterwards I went up into the room where she slept, and I saw a box, packed in a wrapper and corded—the wrapper was sewn with white cotton, and was all over the box—it was one of the boxes she had brought with her on Monday—it remained there all night—I brought it down stairs the following morning, at seven, by her desire, and carried it into the butler's pantry, on the lower floor—it was heavy, I could scarcely carry it down—there was no direction on it—she told me to take it down, and give it to Mr. Glass, the butler, she would send a boy with it to the station, that she did not wish the other servants to see it, because they might think she was send<lb></lb>ing things out of the house—I put it on the floor in the butler's room, and told him what the prisoner desired me to say—I saw it again about an hour and a half afterwards, still in the pantry, and then lost sight of it—this is the cover of a letter the prisoner gave me to post that day (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I do not recollect whether I posted it at Devonshire-street or Great Marylebone-street—it was one of the post-offices in the neighbourhood—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the wrapper, I know it by the sewing.</p>

Drake, 18," on it—it has a little blood and other matter upon it—I produce the clothes that were in the box, and the handkerchief that was round the neck—I afterwards showed those clothes and the handkerchief to Mrs. Johnson, and also the body of the child—I was present when Mr. Blagg examined the body.</p>

On 3rd Dec. last I was called to examine the dead body of a male child, shown to me by Smith—from its appearance, I should judge it to have been from eighteen months to two years old—it appeared to have died recently, not longer than a week at any rate, and I think not so long—I observed a contusion on the</p>

               <p>left side of the forehead, and also on the left ear—the face was swollen and livid, and the tongue was compressed between the teeth—I made an internal examination of the head—upon removing the scalp, I found extravasated blood on the brain, and marks corresponding with the bruise on the left side of the head—there was a contusion visible on the left parietal bone, and there was a corresponding mark under the skin on the pericranium—there was also a bruise on the left ear—in my opinion, the blows I observed on the head were sufficient to have caused death—they were caused by some blunt instru<lb></lb>ment, or by the child's head being beaten against something, I cannot say which—a blunt instrument would have caused those appearances—a handker<lb></lb>chief was fastened round the neck; it was passed twice round the neck—the inner fold was tight, the outer loose—there was a mark round the neck, but I did not notice before I took the handkerchief off whether that mark was produced by the handkerchief as it was then tied, or whether it was produced before—I untied the knot of the handkerchief, and took it off—I then found a mark round the neck, caused by a ligature—there were decided appear<lb></lb>ances of strangulation about the child—the eyelids were swollen, the tongue compressed between the teeth, the nails blue, and the fingers contracted—those were the external marks—I think the handkerchief as I found it was not sufficiently tight to prevent respiration, unless it had been held or hung on some substance, decidedly not—the mark of the ligature round the neck indicated a sufficient compression of the throat to cause strangulation—the appearances of strangulation which I saw were sufficient, in my opinion, to have caused death—in my opinion, death was caused by strangulation and the blows combined—either would have produced death, but, finding the two, I am led to the opinion that both combined to produce death.</p>

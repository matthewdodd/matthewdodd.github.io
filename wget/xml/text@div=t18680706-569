I am residing at the St. George's Hotel, Aldersgate Street—on 24th June, between 11.0 and 12.0, I was in Bishopagate Street—I had a watch and chain with me—I met a man and woman—the man addressed me, and then made a snatch at my chain, took my watch out of my pocket, and ran away—I ran after him, and lost sight of him a few minutes—after that I saw a constable bringing a man back, and I charged him at the station—the man ran in the direction of the City, from Bishops<lb></lb>gate Street—I did not see any other men about at the time—I was not quite sober.</p>

On 24th June, a little before 12.0, I was in Britannia Place, Bishopagate Street, and saw the prisoner running—the prosecutor was following ten or twelve yards behind, calling out, "Stop thief!" and "Stop him!"—I pursued the prisoner, and took him at the lower end of Britannia Place—there is no outlet there after 10 o'clock—the prosecutor charged him with stealing his gold watch and chain—he said he was innocent, and asked the prisoner not to charge him, as he was a hard-working man—he was running from the direction of Bishopsgate Street.</p>

I walked sharp, and a policeman came running down and caught hold of me. The prosecutor said he had lost his watch. I said I knew nothing of it, and I hoped he would not prosecute me.</p>

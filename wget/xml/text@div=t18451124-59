                  </hi>. I am a bookseller and printer, and live at No. 310, Strand. I printed a work called "The True Law of Population," about three years ago, or perhaps more—I had 800 perfect books of it last Feb.—they were put into a back warehouse, in which there was a press—I ascertained they were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184511240080"></xptr>
               <p>there then, because I had an offer for them—the prisoner was in my employ at that time as a pressman, and worked inthat apartment for about eighteen months—I discharged him on the 3rd of Oct.—I missed some of this work on the 1st of Nov.—I printed some handbills, and went to Mr. Durien's on the 10th of Nov.—he showed me about twenty-seven copies of this work, and said it was all he had left—I had asked if he had any such paper to sell, pointing to some of it on the counter—I had sold some of the work bound before Feb., but those I put away were un<lb></lb>bound—I had not sold any unbound at any time—those I found at Mr. Durien's were in sheets, not bound—I have two outlets to my premises, one in a stable-yard, called One Bell-yard, and the other from the Strand—the entrance for the workmen is up the yard—that was the prisoner's way in and out.</p>

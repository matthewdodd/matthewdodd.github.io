               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.They had not been disguised? A. No; one was cut into boards, but the top piece laid on it, and had the mark on it; the timber had been rafted together in the dock, but they sometimes separate by winds - I once knew a man named Somerhall; I have heard he is now a carpenter and builder at Hammersmith.</p>
               <p>JOHN SCOTT. I live at Kennington, and am a carpenter and builder; I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years. On the 14th of March, he came and asked me if I wanted to buy any timber, as he had a stick or two to dispose of, and wanted to make up some money - he asked me 2s. 3d. a foot for it; I said I did not want it, and could get it any where for 2s., but I would give him that for it if it was good - he brought one the next day, and I paid him 3l. 15s. for it; I had it cut into boards, and put it out to dry - he came on the Wednesday following, and asked if I would take the other stick; I said I had no objection, and he brought it about ten o'clock - I told him to get a receipt; he went away, and a person came and claimed it- I got an officer, and took the prisoner; he said he bought it of Somerhall, and asked me to do every thing in my power to have Somerhall taken - my premises are a mile and a half from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you used your best endeavours to find Somerhall? A. Yes, and have offered a guinea reward for his apprehension; I do not know him - I know the prisoner well: the timber was brought openly in the day time - he gave me the receipt in his own name; I knew where to find him, and took the officer to him.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me, told me to go to Crabtree dock, and draw a stick of timber from there - Somerhall overtook me, and said they had got the timber up; he helped me to load it, and it was taken to Mr. Scott's.</p>

               <p>I had a silk handkerchief took out of my pocket, I think it was the 14th of August; it cost me seven shillings and three pence; I should suppose it was very little the worse for wear; it never was washed; it was on <placeName id="t17950916-7-crimeloc33">Snow-hill</placeName>

I did not see any body take it at all; a woman that was sweeping the street said, there goes the man that picked your pocket; I turned round as quick as I could to pursue him; says she, him in the green coat; I called out, stop the pick pocket. I ran as fast as I could, and he ran likewise; but the crowd thickened, and he was taken about thirty rods from the place where he took my pocket handkerchief; he slung the handkerchief away, and it was picked up. I did not see the picking of the handkerchief up, but I thought I see it fly in the air.</p>

               <p>On Friday, the 14th of August, between one and two in the afternoon, I was at the end of the Old-bailey; I heard the cry of stop thief! I looked up Giltspur street, and I see the prisoner at the bar running; before I came up to him I see him throw the handkerchief out of his hand; I did not stop to pick it up then, I had it afterwards; I followed the prisoner and took him running, about one hundred yards off. The gentleman came up, says he, he has picked my pocket of the handkerchief.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160028"></xptr> I took the man to the counter, the prosecutor went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did the last witness give you a handkerchief which he had picked up? - Yes; he gave it to me to look at, and asked him if it was mine? I told to the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Giltspur-street, and I heard the cry of stop thief, and the man ran by me, and he crossed over towards Cock-lane; which is nearly facing, and in crossing over be threw the handkerchief from him. The man came and took hold of me, and let him run forward.</p>

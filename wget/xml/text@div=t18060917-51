I did not, they refused payment, they said it was a forgery; upon that I returned back to Seagoe's coffee house again; one of the partners kept behind me till I got near to the coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Seagoe's coffee house, did you go into the coffee house. - A. I went to the ground floor of the coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same person that you saw there that had given you the draft. - A. The self same, that person was the prisoner; when I came in he asked me if I had got the money, I replied no; I told him they said it was a forgery, and they had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170038"></xptr>paid me the money; that was Mr. Pattisal and another gentleman that was with him said it was a forgery; then he replied, I must go to the person that gave it me; I made an answer no, you must not go at all; he got up up and I got hold of him by the collar, he was too strong and too nimble for me, he got out of the door, I made hue and cry, and he was making off across Holborn, making as it were for Brookes street in Holborn; Mr. Pattisal was at the door then, he made hue and cry, and in consequence of that he was taken before he got across Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get up to him at the time he was taken. - A. I was close by, I saw him when he was taken, he came into the coffee house after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing at the time he was taken or afterwards. - A I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the draft to see how much it was for. - A. Yes, one hundred and fifty pounds, upon Messrs. Bond and Co. he gave me the direction to go to Messrs. Bond and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you have any doubt that he was the person that gave you the draft, and whom afterwards you found in the coffee house. - A. I think it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you entertain any doubt. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it you saw him at Seagoe's coffee house. - A. About three in the afternoon, I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought him a letter from Gray's inn. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He opened the letter in your presence did he not. - A. He had broke the wafer as he came down stairs, he had not entirely opened the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you saw the letter in his hand before it was completely opened. - A. Yes, it was not completely opened.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you saw him take the check that you was to go with, out of that letter. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He took it out of that letter which you had brought sealed, and desired you to go to Mr. Bond with it to get the money, and he would wait your return. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then when you informed him that the bankers had not paid it, they believed it to be a forgery, he said he must go to the man that sent it. A. He said he must go to the man that gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the person that gave it though you brought it from another person, to whom did you give the check to at Messrs. Bonds and Co.; when they refused payment you left it there. - A. I left it with Mr. Pattisal.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. You are the master of the Seagoe coffee house. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.Seagoe coffee house is in the city of London is it not. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before this time. - A. I never saw him before that day to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his name. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the coffee house at the time when the check was given to the porter. - A. I was in the way when the prisoner came in first, he called for a glass of brandy and water, and said that he expected a letter in the name of William Williams; in the course of ten or fifteen minutes a porter brought the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Metcalfe. - A. The same man, I called the waiter and sent the letter to him; he came down and sent the porter with the draft, I saw him do that; I saw nor heard no more of it till I heard a bustle with the prisoner at the bar, I heard the bustle of the prisoner running out, and being brought in again in custody. I was not there when Metcalfe first returned; the prisoner is the same person, I have no doubt of his person.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Metcalfe, the porter, coming with any draft to your house. - A. On the 8th of August last, he presented a draft, the draft which I have in my hand, for one hundred and fifty pounds for payment; I asked him how he would have it, meaning what sort of notes, he said it was not material, I then asked him for whom he received it, he told me for Mr. Williams; knowing it to be a forgery, or at least strongly believing it, or having little doubt about it, I desired him to walk into the accompting house, that I might question him how he came by it more closely; I asked him who he was, he said he was a porter of Gray's Inn; I then told him he must go back to Mr. Williams, from whom he had it, and I would go with him, and if he was stopped on the way by any person to receive the money from him to take them in custody, I should be close at hand to assist him in taking them; he went to Seagoe's coffee-house, and I went after him, he went in, and in a short interval of time the prisoner at the bar rushed out of the coffee-house; I immediately cried out, Stop him, and followed him, before he had got across the way he was seized; I do not recollect who took hold of him first, he was brought back to the coffee house, I had hold of him myself; I sent for an officer and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass there from the prisoner at the time he was apprehended. - A. He expressed a readiness to go any where, he made no opposition after I got him; there were several that stopped him, and there was a mob collected, as is usual on these occasions, in two minutes, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken to a magistrate. - A. He was taken to Bow-street, and was afterwards committed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I assuredly say that I am intirely innocent of the charge I am indicted for, I laboured under very heavy embarrasments, in consequence of that I made application to a person for money, he sent me this draft to Seagoe's coffee-house, and the consequence of my not going by my right name was for fear of being arrested; I sent the porter with the draft; when he returned, in consequence of seeing people with him, I ran away, the person that sent me the draft was to have half the money; I made application to find him out but I could not; being in embarrassed circumstances the person promised to assist me, he sent me that draft, which was the only way of bringing me into trouble.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you the name and the address of that person that sent you the draft to give to the jury. - A. I have not his address, his name is Cook.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Pattisal.) You have heard what he has said to the jury, did he say it to you at that time. - A. No, I do not recollect any such circumstance taking place, or any thing like it,</p>
               <p>Q. Did he account to you now he came by the draft. - A. He did not, he was rather desirous of going before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing of this sort pass before the magistrate. - A. No.</p>

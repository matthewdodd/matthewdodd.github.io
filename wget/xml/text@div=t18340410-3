               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You said he said something to his two palls, what do you mean? A. Why, those he was in the habit of keeping company with, men equally as bad as himself, who assisted him as well - my husband is not here - I believe him to be at Manchester at this time - I saw him last, two years ago last March - he failed in business, took the benefit of the Act, and went to Manchaester to work at his business, and as soon as he is better off, I doubt not he will make us comfortable - I have not heard from him for two years last August - I have no doubt, as soon as he has provision for me and my children, we shall hear from him - there is a reason for his not writing - his letters are always good, and he is a good husband; but a friend wrote to threaten to send the parish-officers after him, if he did not support his family, and that is the reason I do not hear from him - I get my living by needle-work as a <rs id="t18340410-3-viclabel22" type="occupation">milliner</rs>

               <p>Q. Are not you a fortune-teller? A. I never get any money by that; if any person chooses to ask my advice, and chooses to give me any money, I take it; but am I to be knocked down for that? - I can tell a good many people's fortune without any cards, with half-an-hour's conversation with them - I never made any charge for it in my life - I never know the names of any persons who come to me for advice - I know

No, nothing of the kind - I never said so, on my oath - there was no duplicate of a gown among the duplicates I lost - I never stated that there was - the duplicate for the gown was not lost - I never stated it at any police-office - I had a duplicate for a gown at the time - I have lived in Paradise-row, Bethnal-green, that is eight or nine years ago - I have lived in Bennett's-court, about eight months, it is close by - this was on Thursday evening, the 6th of March - as I came down Carter-street, the clock struck three quarters past eight - that was the time the attack was made on me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did anybody come in to fetch him out? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. You cannot swear he was never out of the room from eight to ten o'clock? A. No; I think he went out once, about five minutes to nine; but I think I could swear he was not out more than five minutes during the whole time I was there - he was very drunk - I did not go till eight o'clock, and only had two pints of ale, I was not so very drunk - I was quite as sober as I am at the present moment.</p>

I know the prosecutrix - I have had my fortune told by her - she said to me that I should be well paid for my trouble, if I would come and say, I heard the prisoner say he would have his revenge on her - she has told my fortune three or four times - I live next door to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you keep a shop, or are you a servant? A. I make all my own goods - I have known the prosecutrix nearly twelve months - I am very intimate with her - the prisoner lives in the same court as I do - he used to work at an iron-founder's, in George-street - she called me in one day, when I was at my work, and said, if I was to come up and say Watkins said he would have his revenge, I should be well paid for my trouble - I answered, I heard him say no such thing, and would not come up and say it - this was about a week after the prisoner was taken - she did not mention at the time that he was the man who robbed her - it was after she had been robbed - I knew she had been robbed, from what she said herself - that was all that passed between us - I named this to my mother the very same day - it was after I was before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am single. I know nothing of the prosecutrix, only by her telling my fortune - she has told me my fortune three times, different things - I paid her 2d. for each fortune - I knew her to tell several others - I do not know whether she was paid for them - she asked 2d. for telling the fortune - I paid her before she told it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she demand 2d., or did you ask how much you had to pay? A. I asked her, and she said 2d.</p>
               <p>MARGARET McNIELL re-examined. This is my bag - the handkerchief and apron are mine - there is blood on them - they are covered with blood - I told Esther Bacon her fortune - they come to me frequently; but I never made any charge: I dare not - she never asked me what she was to pay - she never paid me beforehand - nobody pays beforehand - I cannot say whether she has paid me three, or four, or five times - she did pay me, but voluntarily.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How do you account for the blood being on the handkerchief and apron? A. I had them on - the blood was the consequence of the assault - that is not one-fourth or one-tenth part of it - the blood still comes out of my ear a little, and from the pain in my head I am not able to work.</p>
               <p>[The deposition of WILLIAM KINGDOM, being read, was as follows: "Last Thursday evening, at eight o'clock, I went to the Dyers' Arms, and called for some liquor - I saw the prisoner sitting at my left side - I had not sat there long before three or four men came and called out 'George' - he got up and left the house; I would swear for not four minutes - he came and sat down again, and was there until ten o'clock."]</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KINGDOM re-examined. Q. What was the mistake you say you pointed out in that deposition? A. What I have sworn here is the truth, and nothing else - when it was read over to me, they said, I had said he went out at half-past eight o'clock - I said, "He went out at half-past eight o'clock, and was not away five minutes" - they said, I said half an hour - he was sitting in company with a young man they call George.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could the prisoner be out of the room half an hour without your knowing it? A. No, he could not, nor a quarter of an hour - he was not out above five minutes from eight to ten o'clock, for his chair remained as he had left it - he came back and threw himself down in it - nobody had occupied it - I was not in company with him: in fact, he was a stranger - I did not know his name before - he was very intoxicated, and his wife sat opposite him - I had a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco; and I know the time could not be longer than that - I never knew his name except as Thomas; but he was quite a stranger to me - I swear he was not absent more than four or five minutes - I am still foreman to Mr. Smith - I have lived with him going on for two years.</p>

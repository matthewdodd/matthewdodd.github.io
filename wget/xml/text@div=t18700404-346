On 29th March, about 4.30, I saw the prisoner on a van laden with mackerel, on Tower Hill—I saw him taking out mackerel from a box and putting them in his breast—he then got off the van, and threw them behind some sleepers, against a hoarding, and walked away to Lower Thames Street—I followed and asked what he had been throwing behind the sleepers—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have thrown some dead fish there, which you took out of a box; come back with me—I took him back, and found three mackerel behind the sleepers.</p>

I am foreman to William Rogers, contractor, of 98, Lower Thames Street—on this day I went to Broad Street Station for a van of mackerel, and after they were loaded I went to Tower Hill—the prisoner was with me—I had hired him for the day, as the young man who usually went with me had stopped away—I had not, employed him before—I should have paid him and charged it to the master—I left him in charge of the van while I went to see after my master's business, and when I returned he was gone—I afterwards found he was in custody—he had no authority to take any fish; if he had wanted a couple he could have had them by asking—the boxes were all in good condition when I delivered them, all nailed down—I did not see any broken, and I had no complaint—I can't say if any had been touched—it was the prisoner's duty to have remained with the van till I came back—I was surprised to find him gone.</p>

               <p>On last Saturday fortnight, while I was sitting in my shop in Berwick-street, about 100 yards from Mrs. Corby's, where the prosecutor lives, I heard Mrs. Corby cry, stop thief; I ran out and saw the prisoner running; he had got about ten or a dozen doors down Berwick-street; I saw him drop the cloaths as he ran by my door; I followed him and took him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man you saw drop the cloaths? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of that bundle? - It was taken before the justice; the things mentioned in the indictment were in it (repeating them); he had a chissel in his hand when I took him; he was searched, and the stockings and handkerchief, four keys for door locks, and eight pawnbrokers duplicates, were taken out of his pockets at the justice's.</p>

               <p>I was sitting in my own apartment on Saturday afternoon the 22d of March; I heard somebody go along the passage between the hours of four and six; I ran to the window, and saw the prisoner pass by with the cloaths under his arm; knowing them to be the property of Ostliff and Reed, I followed him, and cried, stop thief; seeing Mr. Saunders in his shop, I called out to him; Mr. Saunders came out, and saw the prisoner drop the bundle; under Mr. Saunders's window I picked them up; there was in the bundle six coats, four pair of breeches, and two waistcoats; the bundle was carried before the justice, and then put into my care; I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>I was coming from the Bull's Head, Oxford-road; a man ran past me, and dropped the bundle, and ran on; I picked it up; I was got but a little way, when somebody called, stop thief; being frightened I dropped the bundle, and ran along; I do not know what was in it; these keys belong to a house I kept myself, I accidentally happened to have them in my pocket at that time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. CORBY. When the things were taken away, I went up and found the door open; there was the mark of a chissel, the bolt of the lock was forced out of the staple.</p>

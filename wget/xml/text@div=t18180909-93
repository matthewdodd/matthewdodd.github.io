On the 14th of July, the prisoners, Reading and Sanders, and another person, came into my shop a little after two o'clock in the afternoon - They both asked to look at some blue prints; I showed them some - They objected to the pattern, and asked me if I had any more? I showed them others; they objected to them also, and asked me if I had any like a gown which Sanders had on? I said I had not. They said they were sorry they had given me so much trouble, and went out. I turned round to put some things in the window, and saw them standing before the window; they then came in again with another person, who is not in custody, and asked me if I sold stockings? I showed them some white cotton; they then asked for some black worsted. While I was doing that Gould came in, and asked me for a 3s. 6d. shawl, I showed her one - She objected to the pattern. I pointed to one in the window, she said she did not like it, and went away. I showed the other three some more black stockings - They bought none, and went away. In about ten minutes after, I missed thirteen yards of printed cotton, and went in pursuit of them across Finsbury-square. When I got to Mr. Cater's, his young man ran out - I went with him, and saw Reading and Sanders about one hundred and fifty yards off, with one or two others; when they saw us, they began to run, and dispersed in different directions.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090043"></xptr>Wood took Sanders and Gould, and I took Reading. Mr. Cater took the print out of Gould's apron - I said it was mine; it has my private mark on it. I saw it in the window while they were looking in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Gould go near enough to take it herself - A. No, Reading and Sanders were both near enough to take it-Reading was nearest to it. No person was serving in the shop but me. I did not see it taken; it is worth 26s. - it was some distance from the door. They must have been in the shop when they took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The prisoners were strangers to me. It was impossible to take it outside the shop. The window is inclosed in front about four or five feet high; they could not see it except through the window - They must have put their hands through the things which hung before it to get it. I went from behind the counter to get the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your family in the shop - A. No, my wife was in the back-parlour, but she could not see what was passing in the shop without standing up - She gave no alarm.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Finsbury-place, at the corner of Chiswell-street, my shop is about five minutes' walk from Mr. Hodgett's. On the 14th of July Sanders and Reading came to my shop with another woman, and wanted to match a print which one of them had on; they staid there about five or ten minutes, and left without buying any thing. In consequence of what passed my shopman pursued them. In a few minutes after, I saw Reading pass the shop, and ran out and took her. I found the print in Gould's apron, my man had stopped her. I delivered it to Mr. Hodgetts. He and I both assisted in taking Reading.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cater. The prisoners, Reading and Sanders, came into the shop with another girl. In consequence of what had happened, I pursued them about five minutes after they left the shop. As soon as I got out I saw them coming out of the next linen-draper's in Chiswell-street, which belongs to Mr. Spurrier, and is about twenty doors from ours. When they got about ten doors farther they saw me; Gould and another woman was with them talking together. I got up to them, tapped Sanders on the shoulder, and told her I wanted her-the others immediately ran away. I gave her into Mr. Spurrier's charge, pursued and took Reading, and gave her in charge to Mr. Hodgett's; I then pursued Gould, and found her behind a watch-box in Moorfields, where she had concealed herself; she had something in her apron - I asked her what it was? I pulled her apron on one side, and saw it was a piece of print; she said it was given to her. I took her to Mr. Cater - She dropped his property in the shop. The prisoners were all searched in my presence. No money was found on either of them.</p>

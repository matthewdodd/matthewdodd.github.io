               <p>Station, Aldersgate Street—on the evening of 31st March, Mr. Watts arrived by a train and gave me directions about his luggage—I left two of his boxes at Champion's Hotel, and returned for the third, which I found all right, and carried it to the top of the stairs—I put it down about three yards from the exit, as a fellow-servant wanted to speak to me—it could be seen from the street—when I came back it was gone—Parrott gave me some information, and I went to Barbican and saw the prisoner carrying the box—I asked him what he did with it—he said that a lady authorized him to take it to Fenchurch Street, but did not mention any number—there was no lady there—he said that he could not see her, and was just going to return with it—he was walking towards Finsbury—I took him back to the station, and gave him in custody—he had got five or six hundred yards from the station when I overtook him.</p>

            . I am a watchman at St. Giles's; on the night of the 31st of October, when I had called the hour of twelve, I saw the two prisoners standing on the pavement with Mr. Skillern, I knew the prisoner M'Cawley before; I asked what business they had with the man. He said, we are going to see him home. I asked them where he lived, but they did not know. I took up my lanthorn, and saw that his pockets were turned inside-out, and he was bleeding at the mouth; I took M'Cawley to the watch-house, and my brother-watchman took the other. We searched them, and found a 3s. piece on Flannagan, but nothing on M'Cawley. The prosecutor being ill, could not appear against them until a week afterwards; M'Cawley, when at the office, had the hat on his head which I have produced. We took Mr. Skillern to the watch-house also.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was he - A. He was very bad, his lip was swelled, he seemed sensible, but did not say what had happened to him. When he got to the watch-house, he said, that he had not got his own hat on. He was stupid, but I think it proceeded from the blows he had received - He bled very much. Neither of the prisoners attempted to run away, we secured them directly - They had no opportunity of escaping.</p>

            . I live at No. 18, Wild-street; on the night of the 31st of October, I was returning from Drury-lane Theatre, as I was coming through Broadcourt, Long-acre, I saw Mr. Skillern lying on the iron bars of an area, the two prisoners, and a tall thin young man, were standing by him; two men came by, and asked what was the matter with him; they said, they supposed he was drunk. The two men said they would contrive to get him home; they stooped to raise him, but he seemed quite lifeless. M'Cawley struck one of them, and he asked who it was, M'Cawley laughed, and said, it was only fun; the men then left, and one of them said, he was afraid they were after no good with him; I followed the men a little way. When I returned, the two prisoners had got Mr. Skillern up against a door-way; they searched all his pockets, I saw them do it, but what they took I cannot say; they held out their hands once or twice to the tall man, I saw them give him a handkerchief; I do not know what else they gave him. The watchman came up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040017"></xptr>immediately, and the tall man ran away; the watchman asked them what they were doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. How long have you lived in Wild-street - A. I lodge there, I am a servant out of place, I had lived there five days then. I have been out of place ever since the 20th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different places have you lived at within the last two years - A. I had lived with my aunt antil I went to Mr. Selby's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left him, why did you not go back to your aunt - A. I left my aunt in July, in consequence of a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this-A. About twelve o'clock; the Play was over about twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go straight home - A. I stood talking with some young women who had been to the Play with me; I had not been to the Play for four years before. I went before the magistrate about this, and was told they were all gone. I heard no more of the business until the watchman came to me.</p>
               <p>Flannagan's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - I had been at Drury-lane Playhouse on that evening, and coming up Drury-lane, I met the gentleman, there were a crowd of people round him. The watchman came up, and he was told to take him to the watch-house; he refused. They then told us to take him along Drury-lane; immediately two watchman came up and took us; they asked him what he had lost; he first said £40. then 40s. and then 8s.</p>
               <p>M'Cawley's Defence. I gave 8s. for that hat, at the corner of Drury-lane. The hat-maker says, he knows he sold it to me; but as there is no stamp in it, he cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Skillern. Did you see the last witness - A. I remember seeing a woman standing by, but I do not know whether it was her or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the Play with her-A. No; I never saw her.</p>
               <p>Court to M. A. EDWIN. How came you to go to lodge in Wild-street - A. Because I knew the people who lived there. I gave my master warning myself.</p>

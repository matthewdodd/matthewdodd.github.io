               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I cannot produce it, for as the bills became cancelled, so did I destroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LAWRENCE</hi>. The original bill was accepted by Thomas Ratley, and indorsed, among others, by Samuel Long and Joseph Donovan—I do not recollect the address of Mr. Ratley on the original bill—on receiving the bill, I advanced the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less the premium on the policy—the bill was to run three months—when it became due, it was taken up, with a bill for 275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, by the prisoner—that second bill contained the same acceptance and the same indorsements—when that became due, it was taken up by a renewed bill for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash again—that went on, with several renewals, until 7th Sept., 1844, when there was a balance due to the office of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a bill was given by the prisoner for that balance, in addition to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the bill that was so given—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was given to me personally by the prisoner—it became due, and was dishonoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never brought 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a bill to him, during the whole six instalments; I sent it every time.</p>

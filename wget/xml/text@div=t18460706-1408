                  </hi>. I live at Dundee. On Friday, the 26th of June, I had a vessel in the London Dock, and a box in which were some bottles of otto of roses, which I saw safe about two o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner came on board at six to take a passage, as he said, to Bombay, where I was going—he went into almost all the rooms, and afterwards went into my room, and was going to put on my coat, which hung up there—I was called and told the ship was robbed—a policeman was brought on board—I found the box was gone from my chest—it has not been seen since—I missed it while the prisoner was on board—the bottles of otto of roses have cotton round them—the cotton was picked up on the water, and smelt of otto of roses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice on board the ship. I observed the prisoner go over the side of the vessel on to the jetty—he was going away from the ship—I was sent by the second officer to fetch him back—I brought him back as the painter had given information about him—I followed him some distance—he went to the gangway of the ship, and instead of going up the ladder he ran off at the main chains, took his hand out of his pocket and <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> something into the water—I heard and saw the splash, and saw the cotton drop into the water—I picked it up—it smelt strongly of otto of roses.</p>

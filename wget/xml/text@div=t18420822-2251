                  </hi>. I am a news agent, in Fishmongers'-alley.

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you first become acquainted with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Mr. Lee's service—the agreement was that he should be a weekly servant at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—no one was pre<lb></lb>sent when it was made—I discharged him on the 23rd of June—I found out this case about three weeks ago, before I discharged him—I have not had any interviews with him since he was discharged—I know a Mr. Saf<lb></lb>fery—about the middle of December I found by my books that there were accounts standing against certain customers to the amount of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went through them with the prisoner, and be stated he was not able to get them in, and he suggested the possibility of a loan—he said he would get a paper, and put it in due course—he did so, and a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was obtained—I have paid that up as far as the prisoner was concerned—I believe I stated that at the Mansion-house—I did not state that I had paid the loan to the Society—I swear that—it has not been paid, and two of ray friends are liable for it—when I found the prisoner was guilty of these delinquencies, I placed it in a friend's hands, and gave fresh securities—I had discovered something when I discharged him, but I felt extremely reluctant to give him in custody for the small amount I had found out—I have not repre<lb></lb>sented myself as his brother—a Mr. Dodd advertised for a clerk—I saw the advertisement—I did not go to Mr. Dodd—I did nothing on the sub<lb></lb>ject of it—I did not then state myself to be the brother of Mr. Ste<lb></lb>phenson, the news agent, nor send any body to Mr. Dodd's house—that loan was the only business I had with the Loan Society, except being security for a little money to furnish the prisoner with a few things—Mr. Lee, the prisoner's former master, gave him into custody for embezzlement—I do not state that to prejudice him, but that the Jury may know his true character—that was two years before he got the loan for me—I did not go for it myself, but I sent him, and be became liable for it—the loan is more than I have indicted him for, but not a twentieth part of what I might have indicted him for—I have no hesitation in saying I would not be seen in one of these Loan Societies, and if the prisoner had paid me the money he received, there would have been no necessity for that loan.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that the prisoner was taken into custody by Lee, was the prisoner at that time in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was discharged by the Lord Mayor—I employed my attorney to bring an action against Lee, but I did not go on with it, because I thought I should be nonsuited—I held a situation as chief clerk in a wholesale warehouse with a salary</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Hunt, of Well-street, Southamp<lb></lb>ton-street, Camberwell; I keep a straw-bonnet shop. On the 30th of June, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, three young women came into my shop and looked at some Tuscan bonnets, but bought no<lb></lb>thing—they were about to leave, when a customer came in—one of them then selected a bonnet at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and placed it on the counter for me to wrap up; and in returning to place the other bonnets this was among into a box which was on the ground, she stooped down, as if she was putting them into the box, and hastily quitted the shop—I directly went to the box and missed four bonnets—I he young women were convicted at Hone<lb></lb>monger-lane on my charge—I here was another charge against them also—I have the four bonnets here—I they are all mine, and what I lost on that occasion, three Tuscan and one Rutland.</p>

I knew the deceased child—it was given to me on 11th Aug.—the father sent down to me to ask if I would suckle it—I was in bed at the time—I got up, and went and took the child—the prisoner was not there—it was about half past 10 o'clock at night—I kept the child until the Saturday, and then took it to Dr. Lloyd, in Basinghall-street—he said it was sinking—I went to the station, and an officer went with me, and found the prisoner in a public house in Golden-lane, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I kept the child until the following Tuesday—it was then given up to the mother—when it was first brought to me it was not capable of taking nourishment from me as another child would—it improved a great deal while it was with me—I did not see it after the Tuesday until it was dead—that was the Wednesday week after—it was then lying on the bed in the prisoner's room—I had been up in their room several times before the Thursday when it was given to me, and have suckled it—the prisoner was not there when I went—one day I went about 2 o'clock—there was no one in the room then but the little boy, four or five years old—the child was lying on the bed crying—I gave it the breast—I should say that I have gone there, and found it alone, and suckled it, two or three days a week, for about a fortnight before it was given to me on the Thursday—I did not then observe that the child was ill—it was very delicate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside in Basinghall-street. The deceased child was brought to me by Mrs. Wheaton, on Saturday, 13th Aug., it was in a state of extreme exhaustion, proceeding partly from the diseased condition of the child, and partly from want of nourishment; it was affected with scrofula—that is frequently a result of want of nourishment—I saw it again the next day, the 14th, it was still in the charge of Mrs. Wheaton, it appeared very much better next day—I saw it again on Monday, and the improvement continued—I did not see it afterwards till it was dead, on Wednesday, 24th Aug., and on the following day I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the child generally was very much emaciated, and the mesenteric glands were enlarged, showing the evidence of scrofula, but not in an advanced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190060"></xptr>
               <p>stage—the stomach contained a small quantity of fluid, apparently wine mixed with milk—the structure of the stomach was healthy, and the organs generally, but small—the mesenteric are the glands by which the food carried into the system passes—a child affected by scrofula requires a more frequent supply of nourishment—I attribute the immediate cause of death to a want of a proper supply of nourishment—I think it would ultimately have died of the disease, but it was not so far advanced as to be the immediate cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose in consequence of the scrofula attacking the mesenteric glands, sufficient nutriment was not taken up into the system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The child required a more frequent supply in consequence of that disease—all women's milk is not equally nourishing—a good deal will depend not only upon the state of mind of the woman at the time, but also upon the food she takes, a deficiency in the quantity or quality of the milk might cause the want of nutriment—the scrofula in this case was no doubt inherited, the stomach was not much swollen—I had no opportunity of examining the mother—scrofula would influence the milk—the disease in the child was quite in an incipient state—as the disease advances it generally produces a great deal of irritability, but it goes on to a considerable extent before it produces death—that would depend upon the strength or weakness of the child.</p>

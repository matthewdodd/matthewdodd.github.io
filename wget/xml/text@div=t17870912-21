               <p>Do you know which of them it was said that? - No, I cannot tell, for they had beat me so, that I could not lift my head from the ground.</p>
               <p>Which way did they go? - I could not tell; some gentlemen came and picked me up but I cannot tell who; and whether they carried me or led me I cannot tell; I was taken to the turnpike, and then to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you saw any body you knew? - Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Was it the prisoner that was brought to you? - Yes, to know whether I knew him or not; he turned his back on me at first, then they made him turn his face, and I knew him immediately; and then they had him away.</p>
               <p>Was you sure at the time you looked at him that he was one? - Yes, he was the man that knocked me down first.</p>
               <p>Look at him again? - I am sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120043"></xptr>Did you see him again afterwards? - Yes, on the 9th, they brought him into the ward to me, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Were any other people there? - Yes, the Lord Mayor was present; he asked me if I knew the man; I said, that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did they point him out to you, or did you point him out to them? - I pointed him out to them.</p>
               <p>Did you point him out yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody pointed him out to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again immediately? - Yes, I had not the smallest doubt.</p>
               <p>Look at him now? - I am sure he was the man that knocked me down first.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing him before he knocked you down? - Yes; but it was a very little space of time just enough to see him, so as to know him again.</p>
               <p>Did you see him, so as to discern his face after he knocked you down? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Were they going the same way you were, or did they meet you? - No, they came across me.</p>
               <p>How far were they from you when you first saw them? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Had you no suspicion of them when you first saw them? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Where were you when you first saw them? - On the causeway next the road side, they came down a lane that goes up to Cannonbury-house.</p>
               <p>Was it so light you could easily discern their faces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light or moon-light? - Day-light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you know me before this happened? - I had seen him, but never had any acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where had you seen me before? - In the fields at Islington where I had worked.</p>
               <p>Court. What was he doing? - Nothing but walking about.</p>
               <p>By himself or with others? - By himself in a brick-field.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him more than once? - Yes, I had seen him several times.</p>
               <p>So often, that when you saw him coming to you, you knew you had seen him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he saw me afterwards the same night at the turnpike; he said he did not know either of the men, and again three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court to Brett. Had you ever had any conversation with the prisoner at any of those times before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever speak to him before? - Yes, I may have said to him, how have you done, or the like of that.</p>
               <p>When you were at the turnpike did you say any-thing about it? - My senses were quite gone, and I do not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Jury. Does this illness of body proceed from the wound you had when you were robbed? - Yes, they cut off the calf of my leg, and beat me in a terrible manner.</p>

             a bricklayer; says he, is that all? I thought it had been for something worse; he said, he thought we had no right to break a door for a warrant; after that we secured him and took him away; he said, had he been drunk instead of sober, he would have been cut to pieces before he would have come with us; it was Sunday, and we took him to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards take him to the hospital? - Yes, I went with him after he was committed on the Monday to the hospital, in consequence of hearing of the robbery of the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Can you recollect his words? - He said, that is the man (pointing to the prisoner) that gave me the blow on the side of the head; he said, he knew him before by sight but had never been in his company to eat or drink; the prisoner desired my Lord to ask us officers if we had ever had any conversation with the man before; my Lord asked the wounded man if we had ever had any discourse with him about the prisoner; he said, we never had any thing to say to him before.</p>
               <p>Are you perfectly sure that you had no conversation with the prosecutor before? - I never saw him before in my life.</p>

               <p>I keep the turnpike at Ball's pond; the prisoner came through the gate with his ass the same night this man was wounded; then four gentlemen came through, and in about ten minutes after they brought this man to the gate, and asked if he could lie there all night; I told them it was not a fit place; they said, he had been run over; the man said, he had been robbed of half a guinea and sixpence, and a silk handkerchief; I asked him if he knew the people that did it; he said, no, he could not swear to anybody.</p>
               <p>Was the man very ill at that time? - Yes, he had had a blow upon the back and upon the back side of his head, but he never said he had been cut till next morning at five o'clock, when we saw the blood running about; he was shockingly cut; I asked him again; he said, he could not tell anybody who they were, for they jumped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120046"></xptr>out of the hedge and knocked him down; he told me there were three of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did the prosecutor say what sort of a man it was that knocked him down? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor what dress he had on? - No.</p>

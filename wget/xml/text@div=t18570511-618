               <p>last—the supply was made to him by what is called a wet meter—I know the premises—this drawing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) correctly describes the service, and the way the gas gets into the meter, and out of it into the pipes for the supply of the premises—there are two connecting pieces of pipe, and if a meter is removed, the gas would cease to be registered, and the Company would be deprived of the gas—before 7th Nov., I had received information from a person named Walters, in consequence of which, on 7th Nov., I put down a dry test meter about sixty feet from the defendant's house—if a dry meter is correct, it registers the same as a wet meter—I afterwards made several examinations of the test meter, and on 22nd Nov. I took the state of it—it was 13, 600, it having been at 0 when it was put up—the state of the wet meter was 189, 300, it having been at 176, 200 on 7th Nov.—that shows a consumption of 13, 100 feet—about 500 feet difference between the two metres would be reasonably accounted for by the single light—the meters, according to my judgment, acted correctly one with the other—I again, on 17th Dec., examined the test meter—it was at 41, 600, showing a consump<lb></lb>tion since 22nd Nov. of 28, 000 feet—the other meter had only registered 192, 800, showing a consumption of only 3, 500 between the two dates, so that the balance against the Company was 24, 500—I deduct about two feet an hour for the single pipe—1, 000 feet would be a very ample allowance—I again examined the test meter on 27th Feb., and found it at 116, 600—the other meter was at 257, 900, the difference being 9, 900—that consump<lb></lb>tion of 9, 900 feet, would have gone on for about ten days—I went to the defendant's premises on 27th Feb., saw a girl in the bar, and spoke to her—the cellar door in which the meter was, was open, and I saw the defendant in the cellar—on getting up to the meter, I found this piece of India rubber pipe with unions (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) affixed to the meter, so that it would carry away the gas—it had a piece of cane in it, to keep it expanded—one end was attached to the service pipe, and the other to the fittings, passing over the meter—there was a light in the cellar—the defendant said that he had occasion to take the meter down, as his light burned badly last night, and he was going to send notice to us—nothing further passed till I went for Mr. Hersey, who was outside—he looked at it and told Mr. Silcock that it was a very serious affair; that the Company were defrauded to a very great extent, and that they must make an example of it—he said that he hoped he should not be the first, for the sake of the respectability of his family—a candle was brought afterwards, and there was no escape of gas; if there had been, there would have been an explosion, we could not have taken a light there—if 24, 000 feet had escaped in a quarter of a year, a person could not have gone down there with a light with safety—the defendant's meter was taken down on 4th March—it was tested, and found to be quite correct—the test meter was tested on 27th Feb., and found to be correct—I had also examined it before it was put down—the defendant's meter had been proved about twelve months before.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110087"></xptr>
               <p>should expand—each chamber holds a certain quantity of gas—it is not exactly like a safety valve—a pressure of one-tenth of gas will work the meter—if the leather is worn out, it would lead to an error, but it is regu<lb></lb>lated by the arms—the gas will not escape from the chambers until the arm is extended—I do not consider a dry meter a more certain test than a wet one—I put down a dry one because it is more convenient—if I had put a wet one in an exposed situation it might have been frozen—wet meters are liable to be affected by frost in exposed situations—I do not call a cellar an exposed situation—I should not object to pass a night in this cellar—the pipe connecting the service with the meter has not been out of order—we have been doing something to it very lately; not because it was out of order, but to test the soundness of the pipe which we were laying in the ground—that was done two or three days ago, for the purposes of this case—they were sound, and nothing was done to them but what was necessary to test their soundness—no repairs were done to them—Walters is a gas fitter—I am not ashamed of a gas fitter, but I objected to mention his name at first, because I thought it was not quite prudent, it might prevent us getting infor<lb></lb>mation—I am not going to work Walters again, as well as the dry meter—I may be wrong, but I want it to be understood, that if persons give infor<lb></lb>mation, their names shall not be mentioned—I have to make a quarterly return to the Company—I do not know that the defendant has been charged on a calculation of the lights burned on the assumption of the meter being down; he was charged for 29, 000 feet, which was estimated from the gas<lb></lb>burners when the meter was down—that is the extent that was calculated in proportion to the working of the meter while it was up—it is a simple rule of three question—we had notice of it then—I cannot say now whether we had that notice through the gas fitter; he is the person to give the notice—I found that Walters was the gas fitter, but it was not through him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dry or wet, if the meters are in good order, do they register accurately the number of feet of gas which is consumed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—dry meters have been used a dozen or fifteen years, and wet meters a much longer period—although they act differently, they make an accurate register, and the result is the same—these two meters were in perfectly good order—I tested them on 27th Feb. and 4th March—it is impossible that if they had been out of order while the gas was working through them, that they could have been in good order again when I examined them—about eight gallons of water is sufficient to charge the wet meter to the proper water line—I never gave any one permission to do this—I was not aware that this India rubber pipe had been used—the calcula<lb></lb>tion of 29, 000 feet is a simple rule of three sum by which we ascertain the consumption for the time, but in that instance we had notice, and the meter was taken down at Mr. Silcock's request, he being of opinion that it was out of order, and it was proved and refixed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The soundness of the pipes that you tested were the service pipes between the defendant's meter and the test meter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if a wet meter freezes, the consumer gets no supply; and if the water gets too low, he will be without light, but varying according to the degree—when the water is below the water line, the consumer gets an advantage, as the chamber is enlarged—he gets rather more than is registered, but when the wet meter was examined there was a sufficient quantity of water in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief inspector to the Metropolitan Gas Com<lb></lb>pany. On 27th Feb. I was sent for to Mr. Silcock's; I went into the cellar, and found him and his man there and the last witness—the pipe connecting the inlet with the outlet of the meter was disconnected, and the two pipes were united together by this india rubber pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the Company lay down the pipes to the consumer's house, and from the house the pipe belongs to the consumer—I asked the defendant to give me an explanation of the meter being disconnected and the pipe being put there; he said that the meter was out of order, and he had taken it down, and put the pipe, as the supply was so bad—I asked him if he had given any notice; he said that he had not, he thought the fitter would have done so—I said that it was a very serious case, I had had information that he had been taking gas in that way for a very long period, and that the Company were determined to prosecute all these cases for the sake of example—he said that for the sake of his respectable family he hoped he should not be the one to be made an example of—I asked him if he could give me the name and address of the fitter who had placed the india rubber pipe there; he said that he could not, he only knew him from his occasionally coming into his public house to get beer, and that the pipe was the fitter's property, and he thought if I would give him time, that he could find him—I told him he had better come to the principal office, in John Street, in the after<lb></lb>noon, and give an explanation; he came, and then said that the pipe had been up two days, and that he had also had it in use before Christmas, about six or eight months previous—I inquired if he had given us any notice at that time; he said that he had not, neither had he said anything to the collector when he called for the money—he said again that the cause of his removing the meter was his having a bad light—I arranged with him that he should attend at the Company's works on the following Wednesday with his meter, for the purpose of having it tested, to see whether it would give sufficient light, and to have some experienced person with him on his part; he said that he would produce his gas fitter, that he thought he should be able to find him by that time—Marriott went down to his house to take the meter down, and it was brought to the works, but he did not attend—he sent a respectable gas fitter in his neighbourhood, Guy—I saw the meter proved; it was perfectly correct and allowed sufficient gas to pass for more than the number of burners he had—I did not test it when it was put down, but it was proved by the Company—if it acted correctly on 22nd Nov., and acted incorrectly afterwards, it would not be possible, in my opinion, for it to get into good order again by the time I examined it—when I was in the cellar I smelt nothing, nor was there any explosion; if there had been an escape to any large amount, I should have noticed it.</p>

We missed the mare on the 24th of March, between four and five in the morning. I had seen her safe at half-past eight the night before, I found her next day (Sunday) about three o'clock in the afternoon at a livery stables in Berkley-mews, Portman-square, Harold shewed her to me. On Tuesday morning I saw Moores - he saw the mare, it remained at the stable till Tuesday, I was never with him when he saw the mare - it was in Harold's stable. There were more horses there - she was a dark brown Welch mare, fourteen hands and a half high, heavy in fold, had a star on her forehead, and a cut tail - I am sure it was my mothers. The prisoner lived for sixteen years very near our house, and has been about the place from time to time ever since; he was never absent above a month or two, I had seen him at Wooburn not long before.</p>

On Saturday morning between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner on the Bayswater-road, I was in a neighbour's garden, I live at Bayswater; the prisoner was in the road, he called to me, and said he would give me 2 s. to lead the mare to town, I did so - he went with me. I took it to Mr. Barker's on the Bayswater-road - he deals in dead horses; the prisoner asked me if I knew any body who bought horses, I said there was a knacker's up the road, we took her to Barker's; the prisoner offered to sell her to young Mr. Barker, he said he did not like to buy such things of strange people; we then went to Tyburn-turnpike, he offered to sell her to the turnpike man, who refused to buy her; we then took he down to Berkley-mews, we there saw Moores, and offered to sell her to him, he would not buy her, but took the prisoner in custody, and put the mare in a stable in the mews - she was a dark brown mare, very heavy in fold.</p>

            . The prisoner and last witness came into Berkley-mews with the mare, the prisoner said he had got the mare for sale. I asked him the price, he said 6 l. - I asked if he would take less, he said No, that he had been offered 4 l. for her. I asked where he brought her from, he said from Wickham, that his uncle was dead, and had left him a cart, horse and harness, he had sold the cart and harness, and he wanted to sell the mare, being distressed for rent. I had him taken up, and put the mare in Harold's stable - she was a dark brown mare, and heavy in fold. I thought her worth 12 l., I was present when she was delivered to Mr. Rance - I saw him take her away after he had sworn to her.</p>

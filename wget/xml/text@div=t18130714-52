At the moment the four men ran against me I was alarmed, and felt something at my breeches pocket; I put my hand in my breeches pocket, and felt my book was gone. The same moment three of the four went towards Gray's-inn-lane, the fourth, (the prisoner,) crossed over to Brownlow-street, and came towards Holborn; I pursued him, and took him momently.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your pocket-book contain - A. Seven one-pound bank notes, and a check for thirty-five pound; it is not dated, and sundry memorandums. The next morning my book, and check was found.</p>

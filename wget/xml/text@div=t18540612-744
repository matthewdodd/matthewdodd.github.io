                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Gill-street, West India-road. I was married to the prisoner on 2nd Jan. last, at All Saints' Church, Mile-end—people said they thought he was a married man at the time, but I thought he was not; he had told me nothing about it—shortly after we were married, I was with him, and my mother met a woman in the street who said that if I was his second wife, she was his first—he then left me, walked away, and said he was not a married man—he stayed away from me after that.</p>

Joseph Lyons, bachelor, and Elizabeth Normington, spinster, married, Jan. 2nd, 1854.")—I also produce a copy of the register of the prior marriage, and have compared it with the register, it is a true copy—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "St. Matthew, Bethnal-green, Dec. 19th, 1848. John Baldock and Elizabeth Sloman, married by banns by me. T. Gibson, Curate.")—Susannah Loder is named in the register as a wit<lb></lb>ness; she was one of the bridesmaids—she is now married, and her name is Core.</p>

            . I am a clergyman; I have been for upwards of forty years Chaplain of the Presidency of Bombay. In the year 1794, I was acquainted with Miss 
               <persName id="t18160214-54-person611">
                  Mary

I was applied to to marry Captain Harrower and Miss Usher; I believe that application was made to me through my clerk. I did not in point of fact marry them. At that time I had the Rev. Mr. Owen, the Company's Chaplain at Calcutta, on a visit, at Bombay.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, did Mr. Owen leave your house for the purpose of marrying the Captain to Miss Usher - A. I think he did; I cannot positively say. After that time, I continued to know the lady, who had been Miss Usher, and she afterwards went by the name of Mrs. Harrower. The Captain and she lived together as man and wife; I recollect once receiving an invitation to dine with the Captain, and she presided. That was not an entertainment given on the occasion of the marriage; I was invited by him, and came to the entertainment, at which she presided as Mrs. Harrower; I never knew that there was any separation between them until he left India. I believe I only saw them this time I dined with them. In the course of the fulfilment of my duty, I used to transmit copies of the registers of marriages solemnized at Bengal to the Company. I take this book into my hand, which was produced by the last witness, and here I find a copy of a register certified my myself; the entry is not in my hand writing; this purports to be a copy of the original register, and at the end of the book, I find my signature, certifying that all the copies of registers, here inserted from the 14th of February, 1778, to the 8th of December, 1799, inclusive, are true copies, and I always compared them with the originals before I signed my name.</p>

               <p>A degree of confusion here arose, upon the testimony of Mr. Borrowes, upon the question, whether the book produced, contained the original transmissions of copies of marriage registers at Bombay, sent to the Company in their ships, at different periods, and all doubt was cleared up by the witness's father's testimony, as follows. - </p>
               <p>I believe I can now account for this now. The Court of Directors sent out word to the Govenour that the copies of the registers of marriage were not regularly sent home, and it occured to me, that the best way of convincing them would be to send home a fresh copy of all the registers, together with these interpolating remarks, of the original transmissions, "so far transmitted by such s ship,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140039"></xptr>so far by such a ship, and so far by such a ship."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERJEANT BEST. Do you mean now positively to swear that you examined the original registers, word for word, with these entries from the year 1773, to the year 1799 - A. I can't recollect at this distance of time; I can't venture to swear I examined them word for word, although I believe this to be a good copy.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. GURNEY. I saw the lady who was formerly Miss Usher at the latter end of December, 1813, I saw her at Mr. Cook's house; she was then living.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive these three letters from Mr. Cook - A. I received a bundle of letters from Mr. cook, but I cannot tell whether these are the actual letters I received. What I received from Mr. Cook, I received when I was coming to England. I made a communication to Mr. Giblet that the prisoner's wife was living in India; I made this communication in June, or July, 1814. I arrived in London on the 3rd of June, and shortly after my arrival, gave the information to Mr. Giblet; I attended at Bow-street to give evidence against this gentleman; between one examination and another, I understood that he was on his bail. He called upon me; but I think it was prior to my being at Bow-street; I believe it was at a time, at which I was given to understand, that I would be examined; he begged that I would not give evidence against; him he staid with me perhaps ten minutes; he did not request me more than once, not to give evidence against him. I told him I had seen his wife before I left India; I told him I had seen his wife at Mayhem, at Mr. Cook's; I declare I can't recollect what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERJEANT BEST. I communicated all this information to Mr. Giblet, as the prosecutor; he is the prosecutor, and the father of the second Mrs. Harrower; it is only within the last month that I was called upon to give evidence; during the whole of 1815, Giblet never called upon me to attend; Giblet has became insolvent, as I have heard. I saw the first Mrs. Harrower in 1813, at Mayhem; she was not raving; she was at liberty in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not she a lunatic - A. Yes, she was a lunatic; but she was perfectly quiet; I might have been half an hour in her company, and that was the first time I had seen her for several years; she was very much altered.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. GURNEY. I have no doubt of her being the person, I had christened her, and knew her from her child-hood.</p>

            . Examined by MR. GURNEY. I was a residant in India, in the year 1794; in the course of the time I was there, I knew Captain Harrower; I knew him in Bombay; he returned there after his voyage to China, and other places; I knew him from the month of February, 1794; I was in the sea-line myself, and settled in Bombay, but I don't know when; I declare if I knew, I would tell you; I know I was many years in Bombay without going to sea, perhaps I may have been sixteen or seventeen years; in the course of those years, I very often saw Captain Harrower; I knew of his being away. I was intimate with him, after the period of his supposed marriage, and dined with him frequently after. I did not know Mrs. Harrower. I was walking one evening on the Esplanade, and some gentlemen took me there; I told them that I was not invited, and I did not know Captain Harrower; but they said you must come, we'll have some fun. The Captain had an entertainment in a shed on the Esplanade. I did not see Mrs. Harrower there; if I did see her, I did not know her. There were above sixty persons at that entertainment; but I cannot positively swear that the Captain was there. I don't know that I had ever any conversation with him respecting the subject of his marriage; he was living then with Mrs. Harrower, as man and wife; I dined with them frequently, and he might dine with me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERJEANT BEST. I was not acquainted with them until after their marriage; I have been from Bombay six years on the 2nd of this month, after I had been thirty-three years there. Lately I did not associate with Captain Harrower, and it may be twelve years since I have seen him.</p>

            . Examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I know Captain Harrower, and have seen him write. (The three letters which had been shewn to the witness the Rev. Mr. Barrows, were here put into the hands of the witness.) Those are his hand-writing. In the year 1814 I was acquainted with Captain Harrower. in November or October, in the year 1814, I had some conversation with him about his marriage I went to Calais with Captain Harrower. He called upon me two days before he went to Calais. He said there was a conspiracy against him to charge him with bigamy. He said he had not another wife living. I told him I had heard to the contrary. He said he wished he might never enter the kingdom of heaven if he had; and he called God to witness that he had not, and he asked me to assist him to get out of the country. I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140040"></xptr>'if you are an innocent men I will assist you;' and I then went with him to Caluis. Prior to my leaving Caluis, I went to him one day on the pier, and said to him, 'Harrower, I am going to ask you a question, which I hope you will answer me truly: if you do not, I will never know you again.' I said, 'is there a Mrs. Harrower at Bombay?' He said, 'there is;' and I entreated him never to come to England again. I received two letters from him while he was at Calais; I have one in my pocket, dated 12th of January, 1815; that was the first letter; I cannot say whether it was six or seven months before he was apprehended. When he came from France, I believe he came to his solicitors in the Borough, and I believe he went thence to Scotland. When he was residing publickly in England, he was residing at Caldicatt-hill, near Bushy. I told him he was not safe, because I knew he had another wife living.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not quarrelled with Captain Harrower - A. No; Captain Harrower for some reason withdrew himself from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been at variance with him - A. I have never quarrelled with him. I have never been in his friendship since his second arrival in England.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you communicate publickly, what he entrusted to your bosom, as his confidental friend - A. Almost as soon as I arrived in England.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you communicate - A. To various persons about town.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not communicate to Mr. Giblet - A. I did not know Giblet at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Your answer is, that you did not know Giblet? Do you mean to swear that you did not know him - A. I knew Mr. Giblet as a man residing in Bond-street.</p>

             SIR, I now write to you from Goa, where I arrived this day. Hormigee will give you a copy of the agreement to keep. Mrs. Harrower will be easily managed, if she is spoke to resolutely. She is turned, and of course any person speaking to her in a determined way, will make her obedient. When she used to be in those heats, I found by telling her to obey, and threatening to put her into the room, that she did obey. It will be necessary sometimes to put her into the room when she is obstinate. As to her habits of cleanliness, she does not like to bathe; but you must make her. She was one of the most cleanly women living; but her habit is quite altered now, as is herself, I hope you will pay particular attention to her. Her wants are but few. You will call on Hormigee and Mr. Stewart and you will write to me twice a year. Your monthly allowance will be paid by Hormigee. She has a good stock of clothes; and when they are out, you will get her some more fit for her condition. I will send some out every year. My house at the Hill contains every thing for her room. I sent you the beam. That will be a good place when finished. Write to me twice a year. I shall be out with you in one or two years more, when I get all settled in England.</p>

               <p>HENRY ADKINSSWORN. (Examined by MR. GUR-NEY.) I am an officer of Bow-street. The first application that was made to me to look after Captain Harrower, was by Mr. Giblet, in 1814. I have no recollection at what time in the year. I looked after him much, but could not find time. I apprehended him as soon as I could find him, which was in Houndsditch, in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>MR. BARON RICHARDS. Prisoner at the bar: the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140041"></xptr>case is now closed on the part of the prosecution; and if you I have any thing to urge in your defence, the time for so doing is now arrived.</p>
               <p>Capt: Harrower then addressed to the Jury the folloving.</p>
               <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY.</p>
               <p>On the part of the prosecution they have been afraid to call Mr. Giblet, for fear he should be cross-examined. I am the victim of a foul conspiracy, and not of a desire to satisfy the laws of my country. The moment I was married, Mr. Giblet's attornies made out instruments, which he told me were proper for his daughter's stand my benefit. I understand these instruments are illegal. Upon these instruments he got 10,000l. from me. I have been in the habit of associating with gentlemen, and was totally ignorant of this man's character. I could not have supposed that such a man could exist. I could not conceive the existence of a man who could --his own child. After Mr. Giblet got this ten thousand pounds, I said, 'if we should have children, I would make over the furniture, plate, and other things, to Mrs. Harrower;' and I asked him to take my plate, in order that my wife might be taken good care of; that if we had children my wife might not lie at the mercy of a child.' He said, 'No, you have been too liberal already; but if you wish it, you must put it in writing.' - I did so; I put what I meant into writing. The instrument was drawn out, and I understand it is different from all other instruments-for it is drawn so, that if I had not married Mrs. Harrower the property would have been hers not withstanding, and also at her disposal after my death. This man sitting here (pointing to Mr. Giblet, who was sitting in the centre of the Court)-out of the money which was hers. I could not think that a father existed who could - his own child. I thought I could not do too much for a family to which I was so nearly allied. In a few months after, he borrowed 1,270l. more; and about the 15th of March, 1813, he came and begged that I would serve him by lending him 2000l. He told me he was going to Mr. Coke's in Norfolk. to buy a large quantity of cattle, and that he should be ever grateful while he lived. He said, 'I only want it for a fortnight, and then I will pay it back.' And his wife said, 'Don't be afraid, Capt. Harrower, we always pay ready money, and a butcher never fails.' I gave an order for the money on my agents, Messrs. Percher and Co. in Devonshire-square, Bishopsgate-street. This man is now about to s-me. He brings this charge against me, in order that I may not be able to look after my property and my wife. On account of the best and most amiable of women, who deserves the best of husbands, I from time to time put off asking for the money; but at last I applied to him. - 'You want no money.' was his answer; 'you only do it to distress me.'-'Distress you,' said I; 'God forbid I should distress the father of my Susan.' I then said to him, 'I must have money or security.'-'You don't want security; it is as safe as the Bank.' In this way I was put off. I wrote a letter to Mr. Giblet, saying, you have had thirteen thousand pounds, and your son had four thousand pounds, and you cannot pay me back a penny. Be candid; tell me your circumstances; while I have a shilling you may depend the father and mother of my Susan shall never want half of it. He gave me bills payable at my agent's a thousand pounds a month till paid. I went to Scotland in 1814 with my wife. The whole time expired, and no payment was made. He told my agents, if we took any legal proceedings against him, he would throw the whole into Chancery, and we might starve. There is a gentleman here; that gentleman, Mr. Carr (pointing to him) who is in my agent's house, and who can prove what I say. Not a farthing was paid, but I was threatened with its being thrown into Chancery. This was the gratitude I received. After this, I said, 'I must and will have my money, or security.' He then tells me, that</p>
               <p>'I have another woman in India, another wife.' And he threatened, that if I took any legal steps he would cast me into gaol on suspicion for two years; and I might there lie until I rotted. I replied,' I close up that business; I only want my money or security.' He says to my wife,'Be a good girl, and do what I tell you. We will get the 10,000 secured to the family, and heavy damages beside to the amount of the rest of the property. You shall burn or destroy the marriage settlements. You shall have the first floor to live in, and then in a short time you can marry whom you please. This is my case. There is not a man who can ever put a blemish on my character. I left my father's house at ten years old, without a sixpence; I never borrowed a shilling, nor ever was in debt. This is my prosecutor, (Pointing to Mr. Giblet) I will only appeal to the feelings of all men; could they believe a father existed in England who would-his own child. On the occasion I last alluded to my wife brought the carriage to me, and told me this conspiracy was found against me. She asked her father, can you give me any proof there is another wife existing? can you take me to any person who will tell me there is another wife? it does not signify, he said, do as I tell you, and we will get all the property. She replied, if it had not been for the money, I should never have heard a word of this. Money, father, is a blessing to some; but a curse to you. She said to me, for God's sake Harrower, let us go; for you may depond upon it, he will ruin us both if he can; he is in such a rage because I don't do as he bids me; you must go with me. I went into the carriage with her. This gentleman, (pointing to the witness

            ,) came to me, and brought a pair of pistols, and said I might depend he would protect my wife. I went with her; but it was not to fly the laws of my country; it was to protect my wife against her family, who had so barbarously used her. I then gave orders to my attornies to get the money from this man Giblet, in some manner or another; at last he gave a warrant of attorney to pay one hundred and twenty-five pounds per six weeks; he paid one installment; he paid part of another; there he stopped, and I could not get a farthing more. The next steps I took was when I found there were several executions against him, I put an execution into his house; the moment he found that, his son and he joined to put my execution aside; they became bankrupts, and out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140042"></xptr>of 7000l. that I proved under the commission, I shall not get a sixpence for the whole; they owe 60, or 70,000l. there is only-l. on their books to pay that sum; there wont be- in the pound. I have no wife but my Susan; she, and she only, is my wife; I have no other wife, Let the world take her from me, still she is my wife. The lady in question was living with me; I don't know that she exists; I don't know that she lives. My wife has opened every letter that came to me from India, and has seen the contents of it before myself. In this conspiracy, Mr. Thompson comes as a witness against me; he joins with Mr. Giblet, and they say lie cannot prosecute us; he will have no power to do any thing if we can only secure him in Newgate. The whole is a fowl conspiracy.</p>

His Lordship then observed, least they might be misled by an erroneous supposition, that the whole question for their decision was, whether or not the prisoner married

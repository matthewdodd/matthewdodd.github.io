                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to a musician, and live in Great Russell-street, Bedford-square. About a quarter past four o'clock, on the morning of the 7th of December, I was walking in Holborn, near Gray's Inn, I saw the prisoner—she said it was a cold night, and asked me for part of my cloak—I gave her part—she came under it—I put it round her—we walked together in that way from Gray's Inn to the top of Southampton-street—I then found her hand in my pocket—I took hold of it, pulled it out, and took from between her finger and thumb a sovereign—I said I should give her in charge, for robbing me of a sovereign and some silver, and when I got to the station-house, I found she had got two shillings as well as the sovereign.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He gave me part of his cloak as far as Russell-street—he was going down there—I told him it was not my way home—I said I was close at home, would he come home with me—he said he had not money sufficient to satisfy me—I said it was a wet morning, and a trifle would be acceptable to me—he said, "I will tell you what I will give you; the cloak will cover you, I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; come down to me square"—I said, "If you do not wish to come home with me, there are plenty of houses of accommodation." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is not true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He said if I did not go down to the square with him, I must re turn the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I refused to do so, saying I was ready to go to a house with him—he then said he would give me in charge—there were two policemen passing—he said, "I shall give you in charge to these men, for robbing me of half a crown"—he then put his hand into his pocket, and said I have got 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I charge her with robbing me of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—is it likely he would take a sovereign out of my hand, and leave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is not true, I gave her nothing—I took the sovereign out of her hand—I did not then know she had the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told the policeman 1 had lost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., till I found the sixpence in my pocket—she kept walking the way I went—I was going home—I had been out to a quadrille party, where I had been to play an instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Holborn—I saw the prosecutor bringing the prisoner across the road to me—he said she had robbed him—I asked him of what—he said, "Of half a crown," and then a sovereign—he said, "Stop, I will look in my pocket"—he counted his money, and found it was only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked how it happened—he said he was foolish enough to throw his cloak round her, and in going along she took the sovereign and silver out of his waistcoat pocket, and that he had taken the sovereign out of her hand—I took the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of her bosom' myself.</p>

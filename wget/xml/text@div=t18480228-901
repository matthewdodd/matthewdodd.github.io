                  </hi> I live in Prosect-place, Hornsey—I am in the employ of the Great Northern Railway Company, as inspector of works. On 8th Feb. I observed that some posts had been removed from their stations on the railway—I gave directions to John Mattison—I afterwards went with a policeman to the prisoner's house, which is near the railway—the policeman went first—in about five minutes he came to me, and I went into the house—I found a quantity of timber in a room on the first floor—I found a piece of deal scantling, five oak fencing-posts, some fir boards, and some scaffold planking—one piece is marked "T. B."—the contractor for the railway is Mr. Thomas Brassey—I found four large fencing<lb></lb>rails in the cellar, and some pieces of posts—I know the property of the Company pretty well—all these were articles that were on the railway—I saw from four hundred of five hundred bricks in the cellar, which had the same marks as the bricks of the Company—I had been in the prisoner's house on 12th Nov.—these articles were not there then.</p>

               <p>from Mr. Gayman, and on 8th Feb. I saw a little boy, named Wilks, bring a post off the railway to where he was living, which was at the prisoner's house—I went there with a policeman, knocked at the door, and inquired for Mrs. Willks—the policeman rushed in, and demanded the piece of timber—she said there was none brought in there—I said there was, and said some<lb></lb>thing about the boy—the prisoner came to the door presently afterwards, and inquired what we wanted—the policeman said, "The piece of timber"—he said there was none brought there—I said there was—he said if there was he would reprimand the boy, and send him off next morning—the mother called the boy, and said, "Was any timber brought in?"—he said there was—the policeman said, "Bring it out at the front door"—the prisoner said it should be taken out at the back—we were not inside, the door was ajar—we asked the prisoner to let us in—he said we should not go in—he resisted letting us in for about ten minutes, he pushed against the door—another policeman came up, and we pushed from without—we succeeded in getting in, and took the two boys and the prisoner to the station—we went back about eight o'clock, and searched the house—we went up into the rooms, and found a great quantity of timber and rails, and the post was brought out at the back door by the boy—there were some rails in the room, some in the cellar, a quantity of bricks, and some hoops—as far as I saw, the property belonged to Mr. Brassey—I had seen property of that description at Mr. Brassey's—I saw this form there—it has "T. B." on it; that is the way his boards are marked—I cannot swear to the bricks—these two oval hoops, and one round one, were in the cellar—they are such as were on the railway.</p>

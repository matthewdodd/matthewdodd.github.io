On the 25th of November, a little after eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my lodging; I was up - he knocked at the door; I answered him - I did not know him before; he asked me for a person named Johnson - I told him my name was Johnson - he said he came about the 4l. 9s., the robbery, and charged me with having robbed a gentleman in Cock-hill, Liquopond-street, the night before; there is a house in Cock-hill, where I occasionally sleep - he did not mention who kept the house; I told him he must be mistaken, I was not the person - he said Yes, he knew I was the person, for he had a description of me, as having a tooth out in front - I said I had two teeth out, and then went down stairs to the kitchen, to see my landlady; the prisoner, and a watchman named Reeves, followed me - the watchman had stood at the side of the door: the prisoner called him, when he came down stairs; I went into the back place - Brown and Reeves followed me; they shut the door - Brown desired Reeves to search me - previous to that I had taken 2l. 12s. out of my pocket, and had it loose in my hand; Reeves searched me, and took two sixpences out of my pocket - I dropped the 2l. 12s. out of my hand by accident; Brown called for a light, which a little girl brought - he picked up the money, and Reeves gave her the two sixpences he had taken from my pocket; we then went into the front-kitchen, and he told me not to be alarmed, that I was no prisoner, and he had not come to hurt me, that he had got what he wanted, which was the money; I told him where he was going, I would go with him; as they were both going away he said, if I knew when I was well off I should keep quiet and say nothing about it - I said I was innocent of any charge, and asked where he was going; he said he was going to see the gentleman on Cock-hill, whom, he said, had been informed I had robbed - I told him I would go with him; he said, if I would go I might, and that I could follow him, as I knew where he was going; I desired him to wait while I got my bonnet and shawl to go with him - I went up, put them on; we went out together, and as we went along he asked if I knew where they sold good gin; I shewed him a public-house - we had some gin there - I went into the gin-shop and had some gin with him, and Reeves - the prisoner paid for it; we then went straight to Cock-hill, and on our way they wished me to have move, but I declined till we got to Cock-hill - I had some more there; he then told me he had an appointment with this gentleman at three o'clock in the afternoon; I asked him where the appointment was - he said at his own house; I asked where he lived - he would not tell me; he said he would bring the gentleman to Cock-hill at three o'clock, if I would be there; I said I would, or else he said he would see me at eight o'clock, when he was on his beat - he is a patrol; he never came at three o'clock, for I sent, and went myself at eight o'clock and stopped till nine, but he was not on his beat; I never saw him any more till I saw him at the watch-house the night following - he said he had seen the gentleman, and returned him the money, and he gave him the 12s. for his trouble - I had gone to the watch-house to see for him; this was on Wednesday night, between eight and nine o'clock - he said he had got a receipt and could shew it to me, but he would not, and I then gave him in charge for robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take the 2l. 12s. from your pocket for? A. I thought it would be more safe in my hand; I did not give it to him - I tried to take it up when it fell, but he called for a light and prevented me from touching it, and took it up himself against my will; put it into his pocket, and took it away against my consent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. I believe you are an unfortunate girl? A. yes; I understand he is a patrol - Reeves saw all the transaction - I have not taken any pains to bring him here; I have not seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you go down into the back-kitchen? A. I became alarmed, and went down to tell my landlady of it - I suppose he thought I was going to make my escape, and followed me; the landlady was preparing her breakfast in the kitchen - I went through there into the back-kitchen, that is not very dark, but is not so light as this place; there is a door opens into the light kitchen, and there is a little hole; there is a great deal of rubbish in the place; I swear the money fell out of my hand - there might have been a little rubbish thrown over it in the scuffle - I had passed part of the night before with a gentleman at a house on Cock-hill; the 2l. 12s. was given to me by a gentleman between eleven and twelve o'clock the night before - he was three or four hours in my company; he gave me no more than 2l. 12s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the road, making any observation to him, about the woman who keeps the house on Cockhill having told of the robbery? A. No: I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say "D-n her, I meant to have given her half the money if she had not nosed upon me?" A. Nothing of the kind - he did not say the gentleman lived sixty miles from town, and could not stop to prosecute me; he said he was to meet him at his own house, but at the watch-house he said he was to meet him at the Spread Eagle; I went to the watch-house on the Tuesday night, but did not find him till Wednesday - I have seen his wife repeatedly since this, and told her I did not want to hurt him, - I did not wish to see her and the family go to destruction; and she said I should have the money back - I did not say I would not appear against him: I was bound to appear.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 26th of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, Johnson made this charge to me, and I took the prisoner Brown- (having been to his house, and brought him to the watch-house,) the girl stated the charge in his presence; he said he had paid the money to a gentleman at the Spread Eagle; I said "Then perhaps Brown you can point out the person at the inn who called the gentleman" - he said he could; Harper and I went with him to the Spread Eagle; he said it was a waiter at the tap that called the gentleman - we inquired at the tap, and found they kept no waiter - he made some excuse, and we went over to the house to find the gentleman there, but we could find no gentleman - a female at the tap said, in his hearing, he had made an application there that morning, and he was in company with a woman when he made the application, and that was at twenty-five minutes past nine o'clock: he said at the watch-house that the gentleman he paid the money to went off by the nine o'clock coach; I do not recollect that he made any answer to the female: we went to the tavern, and made inquiry, but could find no gentleman there who had been robbed; Brown was with us all the time; we then returned to the watch-house: he said he had a receipt which the gentleman gave him; the ward-beadle told him if he had the receipt, he should not be locked up that night; he said he would produce it to-morrow before the Magistrate, but would not produce it then; he was locked up in an hour or two, and remained in the watch-house till then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took him as soon as the charge was made? Yes - there are a great many cuds about the inns there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect a gentleman who had been robbed at a house of ill-fame would have told every body of the circumstance? A. No.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Cock-hill. Johnson was in the habit of coming to my house at times; she came there on Monday night, the 24th of November, at a quarter to eleven o'clock, with a gentleman; I was not at home, but my servant informed me so - I did not see her; she was brought there, between nine and ten next morning, by Brown and Reeves, and said she had been at my house the night before; Brown had knocked at my door, at a quarter to five o'clock that morning; I asked who was there - he said a gentleman in the first-floor had called to him, and said he was robbed; I said "If you will wait a moment, I will take a light of you;" I did so, went up stairs, and asked a gentleman in the bed-room what was the matter - he said he had been robbed of 4l. 9s.; I told him not to make an alarm; I knew the person who had been there well, but I could not tell what time she had been away; he dressed, and went down; I then let Brown and Reeves in; Brown said he was not satisfied but what the woman was in the house; I told him he was welcome to search it - he did so, and found nobody - Brown, Reeves, and the gentletleman went away together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the gentleman say he lived in the county? A. No; I was out when they came in - I came home at two o'clock in the morning - my servant is not here; my house is shut up at eleven; I described the prosecutrix to Brown, and told him where she lived.</p>

            . I am a watchman, on the adjoining beat to Brown. Mrs. Abrams made a communication to me respecting a robbery; I went with Brown to the prosecutrix - when Brown told her the charge, she ran down stairs into the back place - I got into the dark place two or three seconds after Brown, and I found her in a stooping situation, by the side of some dirt; the prisoner asked her where the money was - she denied knowing any thing about it; he called for a light, and said he considered the money was deposited in the dirt; I saw him find the money in the heap of dirt - it was covered all over with the dirt; there was not a piece of it to be seen before the dirt was raked over - it could not have been placed there by accident; she was close to the dirt when she was stooping; I was with Brown when the gentleman came out of the house; he said he was going sixty miles on the following day; when the money was taken out of the dirt, she asked him what he had got; he said 2l. 12s. - she then exclaimed that was all she had robbed the man of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were her words? A. She said"That is all I took from the gentleman;" she said nothing, in my hearing, about the landlady of the house; I did not hear the gentleman call out of the window - I was not near enough; Brown called me - he has been a patrol about two years.</p>

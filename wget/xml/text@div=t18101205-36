I received money where I leave beer. I received a good deal of money in halfpence on that day. I received between three and four pound in halfpence. I put it in a box, nailed to the left side of the dray. The box was locked, and I had the key About half after five, I put in the box a five-shilling paper.

            . I am a serjeant in the West London Militia. On the 6th of November last, about half after five in the evening, I was in the act of locking up the premises where I had been at work, in Castle-street; it comes into Saffron-hill. The prisoner came running down Castle-street, ran against me, and asked me to let him in; that he had broken a window upon Saffron-hill, and they were after him. I took hold of him by the collar. A boy, at the time, said, that is him. I led him along to see what the depredation was to the place, where the dray was.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050022"></xptr>The two brewer's servants were looking about for him. The prisoner put his two hands into his pockets, and turned out eighteen shillings and sixpence. He said to them, I will give you all, let me go. I took the prisoner to the office, and delivered him to Cook, the officer.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Rawson. On the 15th of August, about twenty minutes to ten o'clock, I was in Black Lion-lane, and saw the prisoner and another boy coming down from the front of Mr. Wild's premises, in a private road; I went up to them, and said, "Halloo! what have you got there, a fowl - will you sell it?" he said, Yes - I said, "Have you been buying it?" he said Yes, he gave 1s. for it; I said,</p>
               <p>"Are you sure of it?" he said,"Yes - I bought it of a man in the Green-lane, with a donkey and panniers;" I took it in my hand - it had its wing broken, and was very dirty underneath; I said, "I will take you to a man who I think will own it;" I took him to Mr. Wild, and he claimed it; the prisoner did not say anything - he was about forty yards from the prosecutor's when I first saw him; this was before ten o'clock - he was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Then he told you he had bought it? A. Yes, and he offered to take me to the man, but I did not go, because I knew it to be Mr. Wild's.</p>

On the 15th of August the prisoner was brought to my house, with the fowl (which I knew to be mine); I had seen it, to the best of my recollection. the day before - I had seen the prisoner the day before, go past my house with two other lads, and told them it was no thoroughfare, and they turned back: the prisoner said he had taken the fowl, together with the other lad, but he had not thrown at the fowl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Partington then present? A. He was present part of the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out into the fields to go bird's-nesting, and saw the fowl in Mr. Johnson's field; we tried to catch it, and then I took it; we came by the gentleman's house, looking to see if we could see any one to own it, and the gentleman took me.</p>

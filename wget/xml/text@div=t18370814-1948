Two trunks were left in my care—the prosecutrix called repeatedly, but never asked for the trunks—she called last Wednesday week—the boxes were there, but the contents were not—when I was informed that the boxes were broken open, I sent to her master to let her know—I applied to the prisoners, who were my brother's men—he is a baker—they were in his employ at the time—these trunks were put into the cellar, when the house was under repair—I accused these men of breaking open the boxes—one or both said that they had done so—they were not together when I asked them—each of them confessed they had broken open the boxes—they said they had taken the contents away, and they would return them—they did not tell me what the contents were—they brought part of the contents back, and they are here in the custody of the officer—Beck brought me a bundle containing the things—the other said he never took any thing out of the house, and I never saw him bring back any thing, but be acknowledged he broke open the boxes—he said he knew they were in the cellar.</p>

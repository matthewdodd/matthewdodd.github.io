                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>,357). On 14th May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in plain clothes in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner there with a bundle under his arm—I saw him pass a policeman in uniform, and take some boots out of the bundle, and put them inside his jacket—I saw him endeavour to pass another policeman without his seeing him—I then went up to him, and asked him what he had under his arm inside his jacket—he said, "A pair of shoes"—I asked where he got them from—he said, "I bought them of a man in the street"—I took him to the station—the shoes appeared as if they had been taken down from somewhere—no holes were punched in them, and the heel-strings were not cut—he was coming in a direction from Mr. Towers' shop, and about 300 yards from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. James Towers, of 77, Drury-lane. On 14th May, about a quarter or twenty minutes past six o'clock, I missed this pair of shoes—I can speak to them by the mark—they were safe hung over the window at six o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cross Street, Rotherhithe. On 17th April, about 1 o'clock in the day, I was in Cross Street—I saw two boys fighting—it was the prisoner and the deceased John Boulton—Boulton was rather taller than the prisoner; he was thirteen years old—there were several more persons there at the time, but only three men were there besides the children—the prisoner, Hambrook, was one of the men—when the boys were parted I heard Hambrook say to the prisoner, "Give it him right and left, and hit him once under the ear, and he won't want to fight again"—I did not hear him say which ear—the boys had two rounds after that, and the last round Selless hit Boulton underneath the left ear, and he dropped down, and gave a scream, and curled up his feet—he was taken up, and taken into a doctor's—Selless ran over to his mother's, screaming, and said, "Oh, mother, have I killed him?" and he ran to the doctor's as fast as he could, and he was not at home when he went.</p>

Q.</hi> You are sure that you were there while the fight was going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did not come up just after it was over, I was there, and saw it—I was just going to my work—when I first saw them, I was about the length of this Court off, and I went over—there was no crowd round them—there were five or six boys round them, that was all—I saw three men come up—I knew some of the boys by sight—I knew the men—I did not know one of them—one was Mr. Ventham—I did not know Hambrook before—I did not know the other man's name—I did not see anybody go up and try to part the boys before I got up to them—noone went up and parted them, until I told a young lad to go up and part them, and he went up and parted them—the other boys never touched Boulton at all—when the boy parted them, this man said, "Keep up to him, young one, and give him right and left"—I was as close to them as I am to this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">the foreman of the Jury</hi>) when he said that—I did not hear the other men say anything—they did not come over at all, only one man came over—after the boy dropped down they came over, but not before—the three men were standing together over by the chapel—Hambrook was the first man that came up—he stood away from them—the two men stood together—the boys were fighting on the other side—Hambrook and the other two men were standing on the pavement, near the chapel door, while the boys were fighting across the street, and after the boy parted them, Hambrook came up and said something, whispered, and told him where to hit him—I can't say how many rounds there were before he made use of that expression; I did not count them—I dare say they were fighting somewhere about ten minutes before any<lb></lb>thing</p>

               <p>was said—then the boy parted them, and Hambrook walked up and said to Selless, "Keep up to him young one, and give him right and left"—Hambrook never touched the boy when he fell—I know John Ventham, I saw him there while the fight was going on, he stood over by the chapel; he was one of the three men—Hambrook did not go over and pick the boy up when he fell; he put up his hand and went away; he did not speak to any person, and send him to get some water for the boy, a woman brought some in a tub—I did not hear Hambrook tell her to get it—a <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> of people came up after the fight was over—at the time the boy fell there were several personi in the road, and when he fell a crowd collected—Hambrook was right inside the crowd, close to the boys—the crowd was pressing round us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Rotherhithe. I was called to see the deceased—I saw him about an hour after his death, I believe—on the following Tuesday I opened the body, the cause of death was the rupture of a blood vessel at the base of the brain—I certainly do not think that was likely to be caused by a blow under the ear, or behind the ear—there was no extravasation, there was no rupture of a blood vessel near the ear; it was at the base of the brain—the upper portion of the brain was in a very excited state, the vessels were all gorged with blood, and the boy tumbling would be quite sufficient to cause it—I think it was from a fall; I should say certainly not from a blow.</p>

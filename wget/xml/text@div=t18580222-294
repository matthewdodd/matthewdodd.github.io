                  </hi>. I keep a gutta percha warehouse, at No. 257, Totten<lb></lb>ham Court Road. On 8th Feb., some person came to me to know whether I would buy some gutta percha; I asked him to leave me a sample, to see whether it was good, as an excuse, and in the mean time, by going to the station, I found out who had lost it—on the 9th, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner came, and said that he had brought the gutta percha that some one had been a little before to know if I would buy—he produced some; this is some of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had a policeman there, who took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in leather and gutta percha, at No. 7, Little Earl Street, Seven Dials—I know the prisoner; he was in the service of Mr. Dyer. On Saturday, 6th Feb., I and my wife were aroused by a knocking at the door, at a little before 6 o'clock, and, on coming down, I found the glass broken and the shutter removed from the top window; the bolt had been forced out—some gutta percha had been lying within reach of this glass; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is my property—I know them by chalk marks on them—I lost thirty pounds weight, value about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and other articles, to the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether.</p>

About 7 o'clock on this night, I went to Mr. Barnard's shop, in Tottenham Court Road, and in a few minutes the prisoner came in with a bag of gutta percha; this is some of it—I came out, took him into custody, and asked him how he came in possession of it—he said that a tall man had employed him to bring it from Camden Town—he gave his address at the station, which I found to be correct.</p>

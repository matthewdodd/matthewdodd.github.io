                  </hi>. I have one partner; we live in High-street, White<lb></lb>chapel, and are linendrapers. On the 23rd of September, I saw this piece of merino taken from inside the door-way, by a man who, I believe, was the prisoner—I followed him, running away with it, about two hundred yards—he dropped it—I picked it up, and returned with it—to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the man—this is my property—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running towards me—I crossed into the road, and the minute he saw me, he turned short between the cabs on the rank—he entered George-yard—I sprung my rattle, and he was stopped by Conway—I took him to the prosecutor's shop—the prosecutor said, the minute be saw him, that he was the man who stole the merino—the prisoner made no answer.</p>

I live at 146, Tooley Street—John Morgan Pugh was my husband—he was thirty-eight years old and a tailor by trade—he left home about 8 o'clock on Tuesday evening, 18th November, sober and perfectly well, and his health was good up to that time—he was brought home in a cab, a little after 12 o'clock, by two constables; we got medical aid as soon as we could, but it was about two hours after—Dr. White's assistant came, and he was taken to the hospital the next day at noon—I was with him there—he died on the Saturday night following the Tuesday—when I first saw him he said his inside was burst.</p>

I am manager of the Black Bull public-house, Free-school Street, Horselydown—I have known the deceased three or four years—on Tuesday, 18th November, he came in a little before 10 o'clock—he was sober—I served him with drink, and he stood talking in the private bar until past 11 o'clock—he was quiet, during that time I served him with three 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth's of gin—the prisoner came in about 11. 15—he was sober—when he came in Pugh met him, and he said "Good Evening," and Pugh treated the prisoner with some drink, and after that an argument arose about where the generous feelings emanated from, whether the head or the heart—I heard the prisoner call the deceased "A b fool," and the answer was "and so are you a b fool"—I believe it was the prisoner's voice I heard first—my attention was called away just at that time—I told them there was no occasion for those high words, and I went and served another customer—I next heard a fall in the compartment where they were,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187312150049"></xptr>
               <p>and went back to them—the deceased was lying on his back, and McGaw was lying on him, on his side—a man named Oxlade was then in the compartment—McGaw instantly got up and lifted the deceased up, and seated him in the corner, and said "I hope I have not hurt you, Pugh"—he made no reply; he made a groan as though he was hurt—the deceased asked me for a chair—I told him I could not now give him a chair, as it was 12 o'clock and I must close the house—I did not think he was hurt then, and I insisted upon their leaving the house—the deceased walked out in a stooping position—he made a kind of groaning noise—McGaw left first and the deceased soon after.</p>

I live at Horselydown—on Tuesday night, November 18th, I went into the Black Bull, about seven minutes to 12, into the compartment where McGaw and the deceased were—I remained there—about two minutes before 12 I heard them arguing in a very excited state, and I heard the deceased say that the heart was the main action of the body, and McGaw called him a b----fool—I had not heard any bad language used before that—Pugh said "You are a b----fool, too"—McGaw said "If you tell me that again I shall pull your nose;" and the deceased put his pipe down on the counter and turned sharp round to McGaw and told him it would not pay him to do that, and with that McGaw laid hold of Pugh with his left arm and they struggled together and fell on the floor—the deceased fell underneath, and McGaw on the top of him, they appeared to fall heavily, and both fell together—Mc Gaw got up, lifted the deceased up, and he went and stood with his elbow on the corner of the counter, and then the manager came from behind the bar and spoke to McGaw—he then opened the door, said "Good night," and passed into the street—there was no one else in the house but Pugh, myself, and the prisoner—no blow was struck on either side—the prisoner appeared to put his arm round the deceased's neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the deceased was brought there on Wednesday, 19th November, suffering from a Bevere injury to the abdomen—I attended him—he improved rather on Friday, and on Saturday he became suddenly worse, and I sent for a Magistrate—a police inspector came about 6 o'clock—at that time the deceased was perfectly sensible—at the request of the inspector I asked him whether he thought he should recover from his present illness, and he said he did not think he should live an hour—I said nothing to remove that impression—a statement was taken down in writing by me—I could hear very well indeed what he said, his voice was quite strong—he gave the statement in reply to questions by the inspector—I had finished writing, and the inspector was about to read it over when he died—I was afterwards present at the. <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he had sustained rupture of the bladder—that is a fatal injury—there is only one recovery known—direct violence pro<lb></lb>duces</p>

McGaw said that if I repeated such a statement again, he would throw me over. I repeated it, when he caught me round the neck, put his foot behind me, and threw me heavily on my back, falling on my stomach. I felt very much hurt at the time. McGaw assisted me in rising, and then left; I left the public-house to go home, but was not able to do so; I met two policemen, who took me home in a cab. We were previously friends, and bore no ill will to one another.")</p>

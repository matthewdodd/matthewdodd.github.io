I lost out of my house the several things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) the value of them is fifteen shillings at the least. I was in the kitchen; I had sent my son on an errand; when he returned, he asked me if I had sold any old clothes, I said no; he told me a woman was gone out with a bundle in her lap; I desired him to keep his eyes on the woman while I went up stairs. I went up and found the dining room door open. A basket which contained the foul clothes was emptied: I came down and pursued the prisoner across the fields adjoining to the house and took her; I found a bundle upon her; I said I insisted upon seeing what was in her bundle; upon this she let loose her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160018"></xptr> right hand and dropped them in the field. I brought her to the door and charged a constable with her.

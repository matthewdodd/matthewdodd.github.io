On the 8th of March, between two and three o'clock, we were playing in Broad street, these two prisoners came by; Harding shoved Sexton up against me; he went further on and went into Mr Miles's shop; presently he came out with two rugs under his arm. Sexton stood at the door while Harding went into Mr. Miles's shop; they walked to the top of Broad street.

On the 8th of March, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I believe all the three boys came together; from their information I ran down Marshall-street into Silver-street; I went into the Bunch of Grapes in Pulteney-street; the corner of Green's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoners in the house - A. Not the first time; I saw the prisoner Harding coming up Green's court, he had two rugs under his arm, I followed him into the door of the Grapes, and told him they were my property; shortly after Petherick came in and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PETHERICK. On Wednesday the 8th of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I took them rugs off the tap room table at the Bunch of Grapes; Harding was standing close by, I took him to Marlborough street office. A person came in and gave me information, I went to the public house by the office; one of the lads pointed out Sexton. I brought him to the office.</p>

               <p>Harding's Defence. I was not at work on the 8th of March, I went to the Green Man and Still to meet a friend coming up from the country; on my return I met a man, he said he would give me two or three shillings to take them rugs to Green's-court; I went into the public house. Mr. Petherick came and took me.</p>
               <p>Sexton's Defence. On the 8th of March I was sent by my mistress to pay the tax gatherer in Swallow-street, as my master was out of town; on my return I went into the public house where the officer was to get me a pint of beer. Mr. Petherick came and took me into the office.</p>
               <p>Harding called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at an hotel in St. Paul's-churchyard—on Monday night, 12th July, I met the prisoner Smith in St. Paul's-churchyard—I had never seen her before—she said, "I am very thirsty, will you give me money to get something to drink?"—I said I had only 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—she said, "That will do, come along"—at that time I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket—I went down Cannon-street, and she</p>

               <p>stopped me at a corner and said, would I give her the 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at that time she took my watch out of my pocket; it was suspended by a chain—I felt the pull at my chain—at that time the prisoner Walmer came up; he asked me if some person, whose name I forget, was living in Cannon-street—I said I did not know, and the prisoner Smith passed her hand to Wal<lb></lb>mer at the very time he was asking me the question—Smith then began to run—I thought it very strange that she ran away without getting the beer—I felt my pocket, and the watch was gone; the chain was hanging down, the ring was broken off—I ran after Smith, and called, "Police"—a policeman caught her in Friday-street—on the third day, when I went before the Lord Mayor, he asked me if I should know the man if I saw him—I said, "Yes"—I was taken down to the cell and I picked Walmer out; there were a great many more there, I suppose about fifty—Walmer was standing in the cell amongst others.</p>

I apprehended Smith, who was running down Cannon-street in a direction from St. Paul's-churchyard, and the prosecutor was following her—I overtook her in Watling-street, and the prosecutor came up and charged her—she denied it, and said he had been in the company of two other females previously—she was taken before the Lord Mayor the next day, and remanded till Tuesday, 20th July—on the day of the remand I was called outside the court by one of the officers, who pointed out the prisoner Walmer to me as a man who had tried to pass a bottle to the prisoner Smith, on the day of the first exami<lb></lb>nation—I then took the prosecutor outside, and asked him if he had seen the man—he saw him there on the steps of the court, and he said that was the man who came up to him.</p>

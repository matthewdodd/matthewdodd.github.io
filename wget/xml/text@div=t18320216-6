            . I am a Police-constable of Union-hall. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I saw signed by Mr. Lawson, the clerk of the peace for the county of Surrey - (read.) I saw the prisoner in Church-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green, on the 15th of January, and took him into custody; he resisted, but I overcame him.</p>

               <p>and convicted - I knew him well before, and am quite sure</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very young when I was sent away in 1826, and not capable of knowing right from wrong; I was seduced by a man, or never should have done what I did: I was on board the Justicia hulk for three years - the captain's clerk I owed some money to; he said he would put down my name to go aboard out of spite, and that was the reason I came away - I brought nothing away belonging to the ship; I have been away two years and a half, and if my witnesses were here I could prove I have borne a good character since I returned; I worked for a Mr. Maud and several others - I can have dozens of characters since I have been home.</p>

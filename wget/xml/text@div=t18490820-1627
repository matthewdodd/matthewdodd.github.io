                  </hi>. I am a bonnet-shape manufacturer <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Somerset-place, Hoxton. In consequence of information, I sent Swaine to the prisoner's house, and gave him some money, with directions—he after<lb></lb>wards produced some bonnet crowns and a quantity of property to me, part of which are mine, and were made on my premises—I afterwards went to Bourne's premises with Zinzan and two men, and found a quantity of goods, and among them sixty-four bonnet-fronts, thirty-four crowns, five bonnets, and some willow squares—I firmly believe they are all mine—I have pro<lb></lb>perty of the same description on my premises, and missed property of the sort—the willow squares were of a German make, and very peculiar—I never saw any of the same kind before, and I am well conversant with the trade—the prisoner said, "You have robbed me, and you have been b----y well robbed yourself"—his house is near "The Three Loggerheads."</p>

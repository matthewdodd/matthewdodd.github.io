                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the Monday after Christmat-day, I went to my work in Church-lane, Whitechapel, about five o'clock in the morning; Edward Carthy was with me—that is about a stone's-throw from the prosecutor's—I stood at the bottom of the gateway; I saw James Day pick up a bundle—it contained this cashmere, and six pairs of slippers—Day brought the things to me and Carthy to look at, and the prisoner ran round the corner as if he came from Whitechapel Church—he said to my mate, in broken English, "<hi rend="italic">Dey</hi> be mine; <hi rend="italic">dey</hi> be mine; give them me"—he pulled the slippers out of my mate's hand, and ran away—he left the cashmere with us—my mate delivered it to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. On 30th Dec, about five o'clock in the morning, I and my mate Neil were going to work; Day kicked against a bundle, he picked it up, and it was some boots—the prisoner came as if from Whitechapel Church, and said, "They are mine; they are mine"—I said, "If they are yours, how came you to leave them there"—he said he left them while he went to get half a pint of coffee—I said to Day, "Don't give him the boots till I go and get a policeman"—I went, and while I was gone he took the boots and ran away.</p>

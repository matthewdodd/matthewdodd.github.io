                  </hi>. I am independent, and live in a house of my own in Weymouth-terrace, Hackney-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. The prisoners took the house of me—George is the father, and William the son—George's wife took the house—I have received no rent—the wife was to pay the rent for William or George—there was no agree<lb></lb>ment in writing—I agreed with them to have a room in the house free, and they were to pay me 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I believe Mrs. Walker was to be my tenant, because Mr. Walker never resided with her—on the 21st of Novem<lb></lb>ber the prisoner William came up stairs to me with part of a blind, which he said his father intended to sell or pawn, and he could not because it was only half a one—he was there about half an hour—I went to bed about eight o'clock—I locked the room door, and thought he was gone, but he must have crept under the bed, and I locked him in—I put my gold watch on the table before I lost sight of him, but I saw it when I went to bed—I missed it in the morning as soon as I get up, and found my door unlocked, which I had left locked—I went down, and the prisoners had just gone out—they came to the house again—the father was taken into custody the same day, and the son gave himself up two or three days after—I spoke to George Walker about the watch, and he said his son had taken it, but he had pawned it—I did not make him any promise at all—the son has had a bad example set him.</p>

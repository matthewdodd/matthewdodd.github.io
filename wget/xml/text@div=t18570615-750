On Saturday, 30th May, he left home about 2 o'clock—he was then sober, and in good health—he was brought home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about 10 minutes to 12 o'clock at night—I thought he was then very tipsy—he had a black eye—he only said, "Where is my wife?"—he did not speak after that—a medical man attended him—he died at half past 6 o'clock on Sunday morning—I saw blood come from his nose and mouth in the course of the night.</p>

On Sunday morning, 31st May, I was called upon to see Hudson; he was quite dead—I examined him; the cause of death was fractured skull, causing the rupture of a blood vessel, and a pouring out of blood on the brain—it was consistent with a fall on the pavement in a struggle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller and stationer, and live at No. 11, Agar Street, Strand. On Saturday night, 30th May, I was in my back parlour at past 10 o'clock—I heard a scuffling noise; I went to the door, and saw a mob collected, and saw Mr. Kendall and Hudson quarrelling—Hudson was intoxicated—I heard high words between them, and they said they would fight—I persuaded them not to fight—they were both sparring together—I tried to separate them, but all at once they rushed together—I saw the prisoner's mother there, and she tried to part them—they fought together, and then Hudson fell—I heard the sound of the fall on the back of his head; you might have heard it some distance—the mob rushed in, and I was so agitated and frightened I ran in doors—Hudson fell direct on the pavement with the blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it not the deceased who would fight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, being intoxicated, he was very quarrelsome—he made a rush at the prisoner—they went so quick together, that I could not tell which struck, I was so agitated—when Mrs. Kendall was between them, Hudson struck over her shoulder; I think he was rather too far off to touch him—I could not say that it did not—it was after that that they rushed together—Kendall appeared as if he was defending himself from the man's attack—they were both like <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> together, because Mr. Kendall had been very much annoyed by his calling him a thief—when they closed together, they fell almost immediately; he being tipsy, he had not strength to stand—he was extremely enraged—the prisoner seemed to be defending himself all through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen Eraser, an upholsterer, at No. 11, Agar Street, Strand. On Saturday night, 30th May, I was passing up Agar Street, to my house, about 10 minutes or a quarter past 10 o'clock—I heard some words between two men—I turned round, and saw Mr. Kendall—I knew him as a neighbour, but never spoke</p>

               <p>to him before—the other person was the deceased—as they were quarrelling I heard a slap over the face—they were in the attitude of fighting, <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>—I said to Kendall, "Don't fight, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>"—he said, "How would you like a slap in the face, and to be called a b thief?"—they then both flew at one another as if they were going to fight, and I got out of the way—they fought and fell—I did not look at Kendall sufficiently to see what state he appeared in—Hudson seemed to be reeling about, but I did not take particular notice of him—he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He seemed to be in a great rage, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in a great passion—I saw Mrs. Kendall, the prisoner's mother, there—I did not see her interpose; I passed into my own dwelling; I saw them fall—I heard the slap, but I cannot say who gave it—I saw them close and hug together like men who fight—I did not exactly notice whether Kendall appeared to be defending himself from the attack of the other; as far as I could see, it was so.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a ham and beef shop in Horseferry Road, Westminster. On the night of 30th May I was in Agar Street, and saw the prisoner and deceased standing and talking to each other—as I passed up the street, I heard a slap in the face; I turned round, and saw them both in the attitude of fighting, but it seemed to me at if Mr. Hudson was commencing it, and Mr. Kendall was on the defensive—I did not observe any blows particularly struck at that time—Mrs. Kendall parted them—after a few minutes Hudson rushed at Mr. Kendall, and hit him over his mother's shoulder, which caused Mrs. Kendall to get out of the way; he then closed, and clutched Kendall round the waist, and tried to throw him, and they both wrestled together and fell together—one of the bystanders picked up Hudson, and found him insensible and incapable, and placed him on the step of a door—when they fell, I heard Hudson's head go against the pavement, and make a great report.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

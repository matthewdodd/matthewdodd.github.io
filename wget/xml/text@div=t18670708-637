                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Breedon, a solicitor, of London Wall—the prisoner was occasionally employed by him to serve writs—on 15th April I filled up the writ of summons, now produced—it is in the Court of Common Pleas—I gave it to the prisoner, and also a <hi rend="italic">prœcipe</hi> of it, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the stamp—the <hi rend="italic">prœcipe</hi> is filed in the Court of Common Pleas, and has to have the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp on it before it is filed, and the original has to be stamped and filed and returned to me again, that would then become the original writ in the action, and the defendant would be served with a copy of the original writ—at the time I gave the prisoner that writ it had no stamp on it—he came to my office on 23rd May, and handed me this writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), saying that he had served the defendant the day before, as he was coming home from the Derby—I thought it was the original, with the proper stamp, and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the service—he called again on 25th May, on some other matter, and I told him not to come to the office again, as I understood he had forged the seal of the Court of Common Pleas to that writ of sum<lb></lb>mons—he said, "I have not, the clerk at the Common Pleas Office must have put the wrong seal on it"—he then left, saying he would come in a few minutes to see Mr. Breedon, but did not return, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

On 7th June, about ten p.m. I met the prisoner in Vauxhall Road—I asked him if his name was not Thomas Bassett—I did not know him before—he said, "No, you are mis<lb></lb>taken, my name is John Clark"—I said, "I think your name is Bassett, I hold a warrant for your apprehension for forging the seal of the Com<lb></lb>mon Pleas to a writ"—he said, "No, you are mistaken, my name is John Clark"—I said, "John Clark will do for me, you must come with me, "and took him in custody—he said, "It is no use, my wife told me I was a fool when I had done it, but how can they call it a forgery, it is not like the seal that ought to be attached to the writ of summons, it is more like obtaining money under false pretences; I served Mr. Murray with the copy at Barnes, on the Derby day, as he was getting out of his gig"—I found a writ and two copies on him.</p>

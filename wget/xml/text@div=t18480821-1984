                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Henry Penny, of the Old Bailey. I went by his orders on 18th July, to Frederick Edwards' house—he is a beer-seller—an arrangement took place between us—in consequence of that I went to St. Mary Axe, about three hours after I had seen Edwards—I there saw the prisoner Williams—he touched me on the shoulder, and said, "Are you waiting to see a party respecting some cards?"—I told him, "Yes"—he said, "Edwards is not here, he was drunk last night, be has made a <hi rend="italic">mull</hi> of coming"—I said, I was sorry, for he promised to be there at half-past one o'clock—he said, "Never mind, come along with me, I have got them"—we went down Lime-street, and some other streets, and at last I found myself in the Poultry-market at Leadenhall—we went into the Poulterer's Arms—I saw him go behind the bar and fetch two parcels, which were two gross of cards—he took them into the tap-room, and put them on the seat—I untied them, and looked at one parcel—I said they would suit me very well, and they seemed the same that we were in the habit of using, Dickenson's—I said, "They are Dickenson's, are they not?"—he said, "Say no more about that"—I gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these are the cards—he gave me this receipt.</p>

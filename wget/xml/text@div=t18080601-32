Yes, at the corner of George-street; I first met him at the corner of Marybone-lane; we went into the Angel to have a pot of beer; we went in about half past seven o'clock, and the prisoner and I came out of the house about half past eight; we walked from there towards George-street, Portman-square, which is my direct road, and he asked me the question of going home to his lodgings with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. I had seen him for five months, but never to carry on any correspondence with him; he asked me to go home with him; I refused it; by this time it was near a quarter to ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been all that time with him, from half past eight till almost ten o'clock - A. Yes; he detained me in the street and would not let me go. About this time we came to <placeName id="t18080601-32-crimeloc178">George-street, Portman-square</placeName>

               <p>Q. What sort of a cut was it upon your hand - A. There is the mark on it; upon this I ran from him and I went on the other side of the way for assistance; I met a coachman that was standing there; he asked me what had happened to me, and while I was talking to him there came another coachman; he passed at the time and he helped to support me down George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in great pain - A. Yes.</p>

No; when the coachman was helping me down George street I saw this man coming back again; I told the coachman that was the man; he answered he was the man and delivered up the knife to the coachman; the coachman said, deliver the knife into my hands, and supported me to the public house, the corner of George-street. Another coachman stepped up seeing me in the situation I was in, he supported me likewise; this coachman called the watch; the watchman came and they supported me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. The watchman took him upon my giving charge of him; he was brought to the watchhouse; when I came to the watchhouse I gave the knife up to Mr. Howell, the watchhouse keeper, and from there I went to Middlesex hospital.</p>

               <p>Q. You say the wound goes on well - A. It goes on well now if it comes to no worse.</p>

               <p>Q. I think you told me you never had any connection with the prisoner - A. No; I have had a little discourse with him; he has pressed me to live with him; but I would not; and this night refusing him made him make use of the instrument he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what way of life he was in - A. He told me he has been a sailor.</p>

             PODMORE. I am the house surgeon of Middlesex hospital: Sarah Wood was brought on Thursday the 12th of May, about eleven o'clock at night; on examining of her, I found a wound in the lower part of the belly; it was two thirds of an inch long, and about the same depth; it was the lower part of the belly below the navel.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the plaits of the petticoats that she wore, prevented the wound from being deeper - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had penetrated deeper, I need hardly ask you whether it would not be dangerous in that part of the body - A. It would. There was a wound in the palm of her hand near the wrist, about an inch and a half long and about half an inch in depth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a wound in that part of the body dangerous - A. It might have been; had it been a little more of one side it would have been near a large artery.</p>
               <p>Q. That had the appearance of a cut - A. Both of them were incised wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the petticoats being cut - A. No.</p>
               <p>Howell. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Podmore. Would a stab occasion such a wound as that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the edge of the knife took an oblique direction rather than a direct one - A. Yes; I was just going to say that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you attend her - A. She was brought in on the Thursday night and I discharged her on the Tuesday; believing her fit to be an out patient. She presently recovered of her wounds; they did not appear to be dangerous.</p>
               <p>Q. You discharged her believing the wounds not to be dangerous - A. Yes; she was an out patient.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the wound - A. I cannot say that I have seen the wound since she has been in the habit of coming there; the dresser has dressed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She promised to go down with me on board an Indiaman; that very evening she went into the Cross Keys, Marybone lane, and got drinking with six people. I did not cut her.</p>

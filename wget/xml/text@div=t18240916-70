I had three sovereigns, and a half sovereign, three half crowns, a shilling and sixpence loose in my breeches pocket. On the 7th of August I saw the prisoner in Whitechapel, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I was perfectly sober, she invited me to walk with her.

I said about twenty minutes, and gave her one shilling, which was all she desired - I then felt her hand in my pocket, and heard the money chink; I laid hold of her hand, and she sung out, and twelve or thirteen women came into the room; one took up the poker; another said her father was coming up, and said</p>
               <p>"Are you going to murder the girl;" some seized hold of me and dragged the prisoner from me - she then dropped a sovereign, which I saw another pick up; they then all got away, and I followed them down stairs; they ran out and shut the door, and one who remained bolted it; I got into the parlour and got out at the window - this was on a Saturday. I saw the prisoner again on Tuesday; I went with the officer in search of her, and am quite certain of her person. I lost all but the shilling I had given her.</p>

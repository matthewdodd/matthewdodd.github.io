            . I am constable of Whitechapel. Between two and three o'clock in the morning, the prisoners were given in my charge at the watch-house by the watchman; the prosecutor said he had lost a sovereign, three half-crowns, and some other silver amounting to 1 l. 16 s. I found a sovereign, three half-crowns, 1 s. 6 d. and 13 d. in copper, on Sullivan; she said she took the sovereign of a captain at Blackwall-stairs for cherries. Bryan said, "If you have got the money and know it is the man's why not give it him." I only found 2 1/2 d. on her. I locked them up. Bryan then said she took the money from the man and gave it to Sullivan; she called to me on purpose to tell me.</p>

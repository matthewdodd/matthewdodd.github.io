                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Howitt and Co., woollen drapers, of High Holborn. On Monday, 22nd June, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop—I had known him slightly before; he lived with Mr. Reynolds, in Fleet Street—he asked for Mr. Ro<lb></lb>main, who is our woollen buyer—I told him he was not within—he asked me to show him some black cloth, the same sort as we had sold him pre<lb></lb>viously, when he lived with Mr. Reynolds—I told him that we had none, but I showed him some near to it—he purchased some, and a yard of alpaca—they came to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid for them with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which he took from his trowsers pocket; he laid it down on the counter—I called Wade, the cashier, and he took it to the counting house; he brought it back, and asked the prisoner to write his name upon it—he went to write it in pencil, I objected to that, and told him that I should like it in ink, and he wrote his name—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him write this on it, "Wil<lb></lb>liam Stone, 39, Oakley Street, Westminster Road"—I gave him the change, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and three halfpence in copper, and he left—I discovered the note was forged about twenty minutes or half an hour afterwards, when one of the partners came into the shop, and I showed him the note—I went that evening to Oakley Street, but the prisoner was not known there—I found he had lodged at a lodging house in Oakley Street, but not at No. 39—I went the next morning to Mr. Roberts', in Shoreditch; the prisoner had told me he would be there—I waited for him an hour, but he did not come—I made some inquiries, and found him that afternoon at a beer shop in North Street, St. George's in the East, quite intoxicated—I told him to step outside, and asked him if he was aware that he had passed a bad 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he was not aware of it—I asked him if he had any of the change that I gave him—he said he would make it all right, and wanted</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I met a party whom I knew; he asked me to buy him two yards and a quarter of cloth and a yard of alpaca, and, not having any money, he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay for it; on my return I handed him four sovereigns; I told him that I charged him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., keeping the difference; I declare I had no knowledge of the note being forged when I offered it in payment; I received it from an acquaintance of some years standing, the man introduced to me by a party named Tyrrell; the follow<lb></lb>ing morning I went to Great Garden Street, which was the only address I knew where I could get a lodging; I found I had given No. 39 instead of No. 29; I was well known in London; there has not been the slightest imputation on my character, and it is not likely I should sacrifice my character for this; there has never been a charge against me, and I had not a guilty knowledge of the note being forged; as to my saying, "Eighteen months," I have no recollection of saying so.</p>

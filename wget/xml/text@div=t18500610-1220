                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Brandram and others, as foreman to the colour-works—they have a white-lead manu<lb></lb>factory at Rotherhithe—I have been in their employ thirteen years—the prisoner has been in their employ nearly nine years. On 5th Feb. he was loading his van under the crane at the mill-room door—he stood there to take his turn, and was loaded—he might have waited there ten minutes—near to where his van was there was behind the door a pile of twenty kegs of white lead placed one on the other in four rows, of five in each—they were of a particular size and quality, and a particular mark on them—I know what the prisoner had to take; it was four casks of 12cwt each, and two from 4cwt. to 4 1/2 cwt.—the small kegs were gallon kegs—this is one from the pile—after the prisoner had got the six casks that I saw loaded I had a com<lb></lb>munication from Murphy, and during the temporary absence of the prisoner I got into the van—I saw a slight aperture under the tarpauling—I opened it and I saw this keg there—I got down, and went to the place where the twenty kegs had been, and found only nineteen kegs, and each contained 28lbs. of superior quality—the prisoner was not to take any of this kind—he returned, and went on his journey to deliver his goods—I went to the superintendent, communicated what I had seen, and we followed the van together—the prisoner proceeded into the Deptford-road—I met a man, told him to stop Moss's van, and I went up to it with Mr. Villmowath—I said to the prisoner, "I want that keg you have got"—he appeared a little</p>

               <p>surprised—I said, "Come, let us have it"—he got up and got it down—I still remained with the van, and Mr. Villmowath and the prisoner went into the public-house—I still remained by the van till Mr. Villmowath said, "He is off"—Mr. Villmowath had said at first, "This is a bad job," and the prisoner said, "It is"—I left the keg till the policeman came and took possession of it—this is it—these sized kegs are not so much in use in our manufactory as others are.</p>

                  </hi>. I superintend the colour-department of Thomas Bradram and others, at Rotherhithe. On 5th Feb., I directed the prisoner to go to be loaded—between eight and nine o'clock Witted came to me respecting this keg of lead—after the conversation I followed the van with Witted, and saw the keg produced by the prisoner—when I first began to follow the van, it was going up the field towards the road—it was in sight of where I was—I followed it just outside the gates of the factory—it was stopped at the public-house, a few yards from the premises—we went up to the van, and Witted said, "I want that keg of lead you have in your van"—the prisoner hesitated a short time, and then lifted up the tarpaulin and produced it, and placed it on one of his casks of white lead—I said, "Moss, this is a very bad job"—he said, "It is," and he wished to return to the factory and wait till Mr. Andrew Bradram came—as there were a crowd of persons come up, I and the prisoner went into the public-house—I came out to get one of the witnesses to bring the keg in—the prisoner followed me out in a leisurely manner, and very shortly afterwards I missed him—I went to the corner of a street a few yards from the spot, and saw him running as fast as he could—the van was put into the care of another carman—the prisoner did not return to the factory—I did not see him till the 17th of May, at the police-court at Greenwich—he had been one of the regular carmen, and been there nearly nine years.</p>

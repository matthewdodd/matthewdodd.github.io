I saw the window open when I came out in the road. I saw the lower window of my house open; I am certain it was fastened the night before, it was a casement window. The casement fastened with a hasp that turned down.</p>

            . I am constable and serjeant of the sight at Kentish Town. I apprehended the prisoner in Kentish Town, it is the direct road to Finchley; he was coming towards London. The prisoner is the man; he had got a fustian jacket on; he was in the same dress as he is now; he had a bag on his shoulder; I went and met him in the road. I asked him what he had got; he said his own; he said the two bundles he had in his bag he had found the other side of Finchley. I asked him where he was going to; he said to Guy's Hospital; I said it was too early to go there; I took him to the watchhouse. When I came to the watchhouse I searched the bundles. I produce them. I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The razors in the bag are mine. There are six razors, they are all mine, and what is laid in the charge is mine. I had seen the razors in the case on the Sunday. This is my dictionary; here is another book mine; the books are all my own, they were in my house on the night of the robbery; here is a pair of gloves mine; all the things I have named are my property. They were in the house the night before the robbery; I fastened up my house myself on the night of the 3d of November, about eleven o'clock at night; I tried the window the very last thing; I am certain it was fast. When I fastened it up there was no pane of glass broken, nor no pane taken out at the time; when I got up the next morning. I found one pane out; and the window open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been up in the house between the time you got up and saw too window open - 
               <persName id="t18141130-43-person514">A. </persName>
            No, all the other fastenings were safe; I unfastened them in the morning.</p>

               <p>A. When that window was open, it would admit any person to go in, would it not - A. Yes, it was on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>JAMES LARRARD. I am a tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the breeches and waistcoat - A. These are things I delivered to Mr. Baker on Tuesday; they were for

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the bundle on the other side of Highgate. I do not know such a place as Finchley. I had a witness to prove my finding them. That witness I have lost; I do not know where to find him.</p>

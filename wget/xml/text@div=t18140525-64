On the night of the 9th of April, I fastened up my premises; I was the last person up. At half past four I was called up, with an alarm of my premises being broken open. I got up, and found my premises had been broken into and robbed. They had entered on the side next to Compton-passage, apparently by crows; there were impressions of crows in five different places. After they had entered the door, from thence they got into the window of the shop, went up stairs into another shop, and there they took furs and skins to the value of one hundred and fifty pounds. This shop that was so broken is part of the dwelling-house. There is a communication from the house to the shop by a small yard, all within one enclosure.</p>

I knew of the robbery; I wanted to collect the goods. I asked her how she had attained them; she said that her husband, or some person, had brought them from abroad. She left the skins, and was to come back within the hour. She made it a little better than an hour. I first sent for Mr. Collins, who had lost the goods, to know whether they were his property. When she returned, the constable was in the shop with Mr. Collins. I then told her I was very sorry for the situation she stood in.

               <p>Samuel Knight's Defence. On the 6th of May, I was at the White Horse, Moor-lane; a man was there; he said he knew a Russian merchant that had a lot of goods to sell; he said if I would sell them he would let me have a good commission. On Friday the 6th of May, he sent the skins to the White Horse. I asked my brother if he knew any hatters in the Borough, send them to them, and do the best you can. When I saw him again, he told me he had offered several of the skins to them, and they said they were damaged goods. He said he was to see a man at the Three Bucks. I went to the Three Bucks, and saw Mr. Stevens there. I took him to the Curtain-road; the man I had them to sell for was not come. I went back to the public-house, and told him the man was not come, and I told Mr. Stevens to go up to my brother to see the sample. I went to a public-house just by there. The officer took me. I told them to wait half an hour; the man that left the skins would be there. The officer would not stop. They took me away directly.</p>

            's Defence. I was coming over London-bridge; I met a man; he spoke to me; I did not recollect him at first; he said he had known me a long time by attending a sale-room; what he did now was by commission only. He then said, can you do any thing with any for skins; I said I would try. He took me into one of the arches on the bridge. I saw one white skin; he said they were two swan skins, and one Russia bear. I said I thought the swan skins were very ordinary. He said there were two dozen, I said I should shew them. I said I should like to know how many there were, because every person before they made a purchase wished to know the quantity. He said he would let me know the next day. He said, what part of the town do you intend to shew them. I said, Cheapside. He said he would meet me at the Cock and Bottle in Cannon-street; he said, do you know it. I said I could find it. He said he would meet me there tomorrow, by two o'clock. I came there two or three minutes after the time; I saw it was a shut-up house. I went to Mr. Brunswick's house, and told them I had a sample of skins to dispose of, He looked at them, and asked the price; he said first, how many have you. I said, I have no more than these, but I am told there are two dozen bear skins. He called a gentleman to look at them, and told me to call in an hour's time. I went, and was taken in custody.</p>

I have slept in the same room with him ever since the fire happened in Snows-fields; there were sixteen houses burned near us; and when I did not sleep in the same room with him and my mistress I slept close by.</p>

               <p>Q. When you go to sleep you sleep sound - A. I awake about two or three times of a night, about two o'clock, and between five and six; when I awake, I generally set up in bed, and see who is there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you burn a light in the room - A. No; there is a lamp outside; by which throws a light upon his bed; by which means I can see whether he is in bed or whether I am alone, and I am sure he had not gone out. I locked the door; I had the key in my window. There is only one key to the street door; that key I always keep.</p>

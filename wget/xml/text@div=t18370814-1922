On Sunday, the 23rd of July, I was on duty in Grove-street, in the parish of St. John, Hackney, and saw both the prisoners, about four o'clock in the morning, in a garden belonging to John Turner, which is enclosed by a sort of bank—they were in a strawberry bed gathering strawberries—I went up and said to</p>

               <p>Gossett, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "It is my property, "—I said, "I know better"—he said, "I know who it belongs to, it belongs to Turner," and that he had leave to be there—I then asked him to go with me to Turner's—he said he would not go—he then put his hand into his pocket, and said, "What will you take to let me go?"—I said, I must either take him to Turner's, or to the station-house—he then sprang upon me, and caught hold of me by the stock, and I was thrown down several times by him—Clitherow was standing by, and had not spoken—Gossett called to him, "Take his rattle away from him"—I had one in my pocket, but I had not shown it—Clitherow said, "I will not, let the man alone"—Gossett said, "If you won't, you b———, you may <hi rend="italic">cut</hi>, (meaning run,) if he does not let me go, will murder him"—after struggling some time, he struck me a violent blow on the nose, which obliged me to let go of my hold, and he attempted to escape by jumping over a bank out of the garden—he fell down in jumping over, which enabled me to come up with him—I took hold of him by the collar—he struck me several times about the body with his fist, and threw me down—I then got up and drew my staff out of my pocket, defending myself by striking him over the legs and arms, when he attempted to kick or hit me—I had not seen Clitherow from the time Gossett told him to go away, but while I was struggling with Gossett, he came up and took hold of me by the arm with one hand, and hold of my staff with the other—just at that time I heard a rattle spring, and supposing it to be Mr. Drewitt, a schoolmaster on the spot, I called to him to spring it again—I was then thrown down by the two prisoners with great violence, and Gossett commenced kicking me—he kicked me on the hand, and cut my thumb and two fingers—Clitherow then said, "Don't hit him any more, you have hit him enough"—Gossett then kicked me over the right eye—I called out, "Murder"—Gossett said, "You will halloo, will you?" and he then kicked me under the left eye—I then let go of my staff—I believe Gossett had hold of it at that time—he then hit me two violent blows on the head with it, while I was on the ground, and then ran away—in a few minutes I got up and pursued him, and overtook him—I was very close to him, but was so faint from the loss of blood, I was obliged to lean against a bank for support—Gossett seeing me there, turned back, and struck me a violent blow on the nose, which knocked me against the bank, and ran away—three young men met me, and led me part of the way to Mr. Teuish, a surgeon at Ho merton, who examined my wounds—I have never been on duty since—before this, Turner had told me to pay particular attention to his premises, they were so badly protected, not enclosed sufficiently to keep any body out—I saw no more of Gossett till the Monday morning, when he came to where I live, and said, "How came you to raise the report that it was me who ill-used you? I have come to clear myself, I can prove I was in bed and at home by one o'clock, and was not there"—Baker, a policeman, came in at the time to see how I was, and I gave Gossett into custody to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, and live in Grove-street, Hackney, adjoining Turner's garden. On Sunday morning, the 23rd of July, a few minutes after four o'clock, hearing a noise outside my house I got out of bed, looked out of window, and saw the policeman struggling with a man opposite my house—another man was a few yards distant, and he ran up also to them, and then they appeared all struggling together—I then immediately got my rattle, went to the other door round an angle of my house where I could not see them, and sprang my rattle—I heard a voice, which I supposed to be Bowman, calling out to me to spring it again, which I did for a short time, and heard cries of "Murder" and blows—I dressed myself and went out, but the parties were then gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>) On Tuesday evening, November 29th, about 10.30, I was with another officer, outside the "Crooked Billet," Tower Hill—I saw the prosecutor with Westbrook and a man not in custody, drinking, in one compartment of the "Crooked Billet"—West<lb></lb>brook's mother and grandmother were in the same compartment—they appeared to be quarrelling—Mahoney, Whiteside, Lang, and Howe were in another compartment—Mahoney was Quarrelling with Howe—Westbrook's mother and grandmother were upbraiding him for being in the company he was in, and he pushed them out of the house, with the assistance of the man not in custody, who went out with them—I then saw Westbrook place his hand in the prosecutor's trowser's pocket, and withdraw it—he threw something on the counter, saying "Here, I will pay for this pot" before that Mahoney and Whiteside had come into that compartment—Mahoney then went in front of the prosecutor, and began putting his hands round his pockets—he then went and sat down with Howe, who had come in with Lang, and appeared to pass something to her—I saw Rogers talking to the prosecutor and to the other prisoners—I fetched the prosecutor out of the house, and spoke to him—he was very drunk, and hardly able to stand—I was in a passage, with a half-glass window, so that I could look through into the compartment—I saw a Hanoverian medal, representing a sovereign, in the compartment, and Rogers' hand was over it—I took the prisoners all in custody, with assistance—Mahoney was very abusive, and said that I had got up this charge—I found on Westbrook 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, on Howe a sovereign and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and various sums on the other prisoners—the prosecutor's pockets were empty, except a halfpenny.</p>

I could see everything that took place; but I could not see what was on the counter—I know that some<lb></lb>thing was served, but did not hear Dempster asked to pay for it—Mahoney did not say to Dempster "Pay for the ale," nor did Dempster say "I have no money"—I did not see Mahoney shake Dempster's pocket, and take a strap from it; but I did not take particular notice—I could not see into the bar, or see the barman—I could only hear when they spoke in the ordinary way, not when they spoke low—I heard nothing about paying for the ale; but that might have been previous to my going to the house—I did not see Dempster with a purse—the prisoners were sober—Dempster said, at the Police Court, when he was perfectly sober, that he had not lost anything—Mahoney had then spoken to him.</p>

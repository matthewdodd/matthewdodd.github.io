               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you know either of these men before the time of the robbery? - No; I had a very great opportunity of seeing Coleman.</p>
               <p>Have you told us the expressions you made use of? - Yes; I never saw the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to say Coleman give me the ring? - I meant from hearing his name since; I never saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>Your expression was, Coleman give me the ring, you was mistaken in the expression? - I was.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was it? - I believe the sun had not been out, it was rather a dull cloudy day; it was near four.</p>
               <p>Was it dusk, or full day light? - It rather began to decline; I kept them there as long as I could, before I parted with the money, thinking I might see somebody; I cannot speak exactly to the time.</p>
               <p>They were quite strange to you? - They were, or I should have spoke of it at the office; Coleman had a laced hat on, I am certain of his person, the other I do not know, it was about his size, I cannot positively swear to the face; I was very little alarmed at the time.</p>
               <p>Did either present any weapon? - The tall one had a pistol; I observed he held it up with his hand under the right flap of his coat; the short one did not, the other did, I took it to be such by the brightness of the barrel; he held it out to me.</p>
               <p>Did not the sight of the pistol alarm you? - It had some little effect upon me.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it before you saw either of the prisoners? - It was better than a fortnight; it was the Monday before Christmas day they were taken, near three weeks.</p>
               <p>Could you in three minutes seeing him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090029"></xptr> and never saw him for three weeks after, know him so as to swear to him? - Yes; I can speak positively to Coleman.</p>
               <p>When did you first see them? - They were not taken up on my account; I first saw them at Bow-street, I believe it was the Wednesday after Christmas day, I had a note from the office to attend; they were both there, I saw them in the public office with several more, they were all intermixed, I pointed out the short one myself, I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>You lost a watch and mourning ring? - Yes; the ring was found at a pawnbroker's in Wardour-street, the next morning after it was taken from me, by a person going about with hand-bills; one of the officers came and told me; I went to Wardour-street, and saw the ring at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>What is the pawnbroker's name? - Payne.</p>
               <p>What sort of ring? - A white enamel'd ring; it was given me by Mr. Haldiman, in St. Mary Axe, it was his daughter's, a child of eight years of age, her name and age were engraved on the ring, I attended to teach music there; the ring was too small for me, I was not measured for it; I had notice of it, and did not put it on, but put it in my pocket, the ring I found at the pawnbroker's was the same; I was present at the office when the prisoners were examined; the tall man was asked how he came by it, the ring was pawned in the name of

            , he pawned it.</p>
               <p>Did he say anything respecting the charge? He said he had bought it of a soldier.</p>
               <p>Did Coleman say any thing? - Not that I heard; the tall one held a pistol out, I put my hand round to put it from me.</p>
               <p>The robbery was between Kentish-Town and Pancras, in the common footway, both in soldiers cloaths, no other person near us at the time of passing; I followed them across the other road.</p>
               <p>What induces you to think it was him, except the general knowledge of Coleman, was there any thing remarkable in his face? He had a remarkable face; westood face to face some time; at first I was not much frighttened, a little I was, but more afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you no intimation from any person in the office that he was the man? - No.</p>
               <p>You can swear at three weeks distance that was the man? - I am quite positive as to Coleman; I am not sure of the other.</p>

               <p>He was not in regimentals then? - No; I had seen him once before, he brought a watch about a fortnight before, and came in a few days and sold it to a hair-dresser; I knew him when he came again with the ring, he was not with me above five minutes when he pawned the ring.</p>
               <p>Was the shop light or dark? - Three candles in it; we are forced to keep a good light, to see the things.</p>
               <p>The people that come there stand in a bad light? - We put the light in front; we can see them distinctly, nobody else; when he came, we asked him where he lived, he said in the same street.</p>
               <p>Did you ask no farther questions? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Do you make a practice of receiving things, and only ask their names? - He appeared to be a gentleman; we enquired where he lived; if strangers come, we are satisfied with asking their names, and where they live; there was a hand-bill the next morning, we went down to Bow-street to let them know we had the ring.</p>
               <p>Can you swear with certainty Curtis pawned the ring? - I can; it might be a week after that I saw him at the public office in Bow-street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090030"></xptr>Was it not three weeks? - I cannot be sure; it was some time after, I had been at the office four or times about it.</p>
               <p>Was any body with Curtis when he came and pawned the ring? - No.</p>
               <p>To Duncombe. How long had you this ring before you lost it? - The day before; for the family was out of town, they went to Brighthelmstone or Margate.</p>
               <p>Court. The ring is dated August? - It is.</p>
               <p>Do you know the ring, look at it? - This is the ring; I don't suppose a gentleman of Mr. Haldiman's sort would pawn such a ring; I know it to be mine, by the name, and the ring not fitting.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Are there not ten thousand rings that will not fit you like that? - I cannot be positive, but there may be more rings like it.</p>
               <p>You would not be so certain, if you found it, or seen it on the finger of a gentleman, or any other situation than you saw it after you lost it? - Not if I saw it on any gentleman's finger; I should suppose the same gentleman had sent him one; it was about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Is it not in general dark at that time of year at that hour? - It was not dark; I saw Coleman's face perfectly well.</p>
               <p>To the pawnbroker's apprentice. There are boxes in your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are the candles removable? - Yes; we always put the candle so as to see them; we did I remember then, because I saw him perfectly well.</p>

(He produces the watch). This is the watch pawned by Curtis. The prosecutor looks at the watch and deposes it was his property. I will swear to the watch, it has my own name to it.</p>

               <p>Sometimes things are pawned in their own names, sometimes not, he pawned this in the name of Curtis; I knew him, and he was conscious for aught I know, no doubt he knew that, he said to me, if I had came clandestinely by the watch, you may be certain I would not have pawned it in my own name, where I was known.</p>
               <p>Court to Jolly. What trade are you of? - A watch gilder.</p>
               <p>Are you a watchmaker? - If any body bespeaks a watch, I make it up; the watch has my name to it, as the maker's.</p>
               <p>Is there any other mark but your own name; - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you put your name to several other watches? - I don't know that I have; I have made several others twenty years ago.</p>
               <p>What does 1202 mean? - Sometimes they put one number, sometimes another; ++ 1012, I think is the number to the best of my knowledge of the watch, I wore myself.</p>
               <p>Did you know that before you lost it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would you know the watch you lost from any other with your name to it? - Yes; if you would let me look at it, by the top case, and name, and number, the top case is almost wore off the thread of it.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing particular about the spring that you open the watch by? - The button is very much wore, and I knew that before I lost it. Upon my oath I knew that before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Did not you know it before you lost your watch? - I did.</p>

This old gentleman said one of the men had robbed him; I found nothing but the cloaths; at the office there were three or four serjeants, the prosecutor was desired to look round, and see if he knew any one; he looked for a considerable time, and said, if it is any man here, it is (Curtis); he was desired to touch the man that he knew, and he did touch him; he did not say Curtis, for he did not know his name; he then saw the cloaths on my arm, he snatched hold of the coat, and said, this is the coat the man had on that robbed me; he was desired to pull off his regimentals, and put that coat and waistcoat on; when he had done that, the old gentleman went up to him, and took him by the coat, and said, this is the man, I am positive.</p>
               <p>He expressed a doubt before the cloathes were put on? - He said, if it is any amongst the persons in the room it was him; he went and laid hold of him by the coat, and said, this is the man, I am certain, as soon as he put the coat on.</p>

               <p>He says he was robbed at a quarter past one, and he was detained eight minutes by me, which made it near twenty-five minutes; after we came from inspection, a little after ten, I stopped at the Three Tuns<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090033"></xptr> and had some beer, then I went home to my lodgings, and pulled off my coat, and put my necessaries by; we had had an inspection; I and the rest of my comrades drank six or seven pots of beer; I left the house about ten minutes before one, I was going over to the Borough along with this man, but we did not go, as I met a friend at the bottom of Tothill-street, and went and had a pint of beer with him, that detained me till about five or six minutes past one; I then went to Westminster Bridge, we were to come home and dine with the landlady, she asked us to dinner, we said, if we go to the Borough, we shall be late to dinner; we returned about six or seven minutes before two, and had dinner and a little beer; at the bottom of Tothill-street, there were some ruins and buildings there, I went on one side to ease myself, and saw the watch lying upon the ground, I said I had found a watch, I came back to her house, and did not go to to the Borough, but staid there the remainder of the day; the next day, as I had no money, I went to pawn the watch; the pawnbroker knew me very well, I told him I wanted a guinea and a half upon the watch, he said he would lend but one guinea; as I was late for guard, I came back and desired to have a guinea upon it.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner Curtis; he was at my house till within a minute of twelve, I saw him again about two, he was at my house about five minutes before two, my clock goes by the Abbey, within a minute; they both lodged at my house, and always behaved well, and were honest sober men.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember the time he came home that day? - I had a ham and fillet of veal, and more friends to dine with me; I said, what made you stay so late; I particularly remember the hour of dining, we generally dine about half past one; when they came in, I remember I said it wanted but five minutes of two, and you were to be at home at half past one.</p>
               <p>How long was it before they were taken up? - On the Monday morning, a gentleman came to search my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prothero deposed, she told him they came home within five minutes of two, or under, and that they both came home in a coach.</p>
               <p>What distance is this place from Pancrass, where the robbery was committed, to Tothill fields? - About two miles, or two miles and an half, it cannot exceed that.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Hemmet. Did they come home in a coach that day? - They said they did; I did not see it.</p>
               <p>(As neither Prothero nor Hemmet could remember what sort of a day it was, the Court asked the question of Mr. Arnold, who said it was a very fair day, but the sun was not out.)</p>
               <p>- Parsons, a hair-dresser, deposed, he had known Curtis several years, that Curtis had worked for him as a journeyman, and was very honest.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Parsons deposed, she had known him for eighteen y ears, had known him from a child, that he was very honest, and had never heard any imputation upon his character; that he always behaved well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker. On the night of the 22nd of February, I had been to supper with a friend, and drank rather freely—in coming home, I got into Bow-street, Covent-garden—I met the prisoner—we fell into conversation, and she wanted me to buy some ballads of her—I cannot say whether I took any liberty with her—I might have done so—she then snatched my watch from me—I took hold of her hand, and pushed her down—I fell on: the top of her, and called the policeman—she kept it in her hand till the policeman came, and then she threw it down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About five in the morning, I was called, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner on the step of a door together—the prosecutor got up—I took the prisoner—she threw the watch out of her hand—the prosecutor took it up, and gave it to me—he was not sober, but was aware what he was about.</p>

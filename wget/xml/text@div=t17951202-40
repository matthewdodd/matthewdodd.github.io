No; I laid hold of him by the collar, and charged him with robbing the stables; he said, the man that had run away (for there were two of them) had desired him to hold the candle while he tied up some things; I called the watchman, and he threw away the candle; I gave the watchman charge of him, and went into the stable, where I found the box-coat and the other things tied up in a bundle, in the first stall of the stable; as we were going to the watch-house, somebody said, it was an Old Bailey job; no, says the prisoner, I know better than that, for there is no locks broke: I locked the door when I went out, and I found it open when I came back; I don't know whether it was opened with a picklock, or what, for the locks were not broke.</p>

I am a bricklayer; I was coming through Park-lane, and I saw a man taking in some bricks; he asked me if I wanted a job; I told him I did; that I was looking out for a job; and he hired me to take in the bricks; when I had done work, I was going home, and saw a man in livery standing at a stable door, who asked me to hold a candle while he tied up a bundle; this man then came up, and the man run away; I asked him where he was going, he said he was going to order a pot of beer for Joe; and then this man took me up and put me in the watch-house.</p>

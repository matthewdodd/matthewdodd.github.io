             went to Mr. Pratt's house at Kingsdown on the afternoon of the 12th. I found eighteen bags of tobacco in an outhouse adjoining Pratt's house; these eighteen bags of tobacco were covered over with some faggots. In the house I found eight tubs, containing twenty gallons of Hollands geneva; I made a seizure of them, I got a cart and conveyed them to the Cock public house at Kingsdown; Mrs. Hackney keeps the house, I put them in Mrs. Hackney's parlour. Between one and two o'clock in the morning a number of smugglers came; the constable went out of the room, and just as he went out of the room four smugglers came in; two came to me, and two to the other officer, Pyat; they threw me and Pyat on the floor, the candle was knocked off the table; when the constable came in he took one of the smugglers from me; I got free of the other; I went to the assistance of the other officer. I took a pistol from Mr. Pyat, we called for a light, and found part of the goods we had seized were gone. One of the smugglers swore that he would have the remainder of the goods; I then presented a pistol and said, that I would shoot the first man that attempted to carry off any more of the goods. He says, fire away and be d - d, and takes out a pistol, which he had taken from the officer, and presented it to me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180064"></xptr> and said, he would shoot me if I attempted to fire at any of the others. There was a party in the house of smugglers, some with pitchforks and some with club sticks; the man that had a club stick they called Old Bob.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you known previous to this time the man who went by the name of Old Bob. - A.No, I knew none of them.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not know none of the parties. - A. None. The other officer, Mr. Pyat, locked the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. What locked you and the smugglers in. - A. No; we left the room: the smugglers were in the passage, Mr. Pyat locked the room up, and put the key in his pocket; there were three or four of them in the house till four of five o'clock in the morning; they swore that would have the remainder of the goods, but they did not make the attempt; afterwards they went away with the goods they had rescued.</p>
               <p>Q. What injury did you receive. - A. I received no injury at all; they threw me on the floor, and kept me on the floor, while the remainder of them took the goods away.</p>
               <p>Court. All this obstruction was on shore. - A. Yes.</p>

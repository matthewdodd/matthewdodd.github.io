               <p>MARY JOHNSON. I live in the Porter's Lodge belonging to Mr. Copland, in the parish of <placeName id="t18160403-20-crimeloc121">Acton</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18160403-20-crimeloc121" type="placeName" value="Acton"></interp>

In the afternoon of the 16th of March, it was broken open. I went out about four o'clock, leaving nobody at the Lodge. I returned a little before five, and found the door quite safe as I had left it; but the glass of the bed-room window was broken, to turn round the handle, and was open; I had left it shut and whole; that window was in the back part of the house; the person passing the lodge would not pass that window; the lodge is placed to open a gate; a person might have gone through the gate without seeing the window. I walked round to the front of the Lodge, and saw the prisoner there; I saw him in the room through the window plundering my drawers, before I had opened the door. The prisoner is the man; I stood looking at his face for full three minutes; after that, he turned himself round, and stood and looked me in the face; he then turned found again, and bent himself down, and went across the room; he then went towards that window I had seen open; there is only one in that room; he went out of the room in which I had seen him; I then saw him in my yard; he had gone through the window as I supposed. He did not come out at the door. I gave an alarm; a person of the name of Towers was the first that came to my assistance, and he pursued the prisoner. I entered my house, and found the things in a very bad state, some in one place and some in another, and very much disordered; the coats were near the window which was open, four of them, and two pair of pantaloons, they were not tied up in any thing; nothing else was near the window; they were in the drawers when I left the house; they are here; they belonged to my husband. In the front room. upon my drawers, and on the chair, I found some of the children's clothes, four frocks, two petticoats, shirts, and waistcoats, all of which I had left in the drawers; they are all my children's clothes; there were only two or three things missed, namely, a coral, a silver nutmeg-grater, and a shirt of my husband's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I should wish to know if she saw me near the house? whether she saw me near it, or whether I was not an hundred yards up the lane before she saw me at all?</p>

               <p>Witness. No; I saw him in the house, and afterwards in the yard, and pointed him out to Towers.</p>

            . I was at work for Mr. Copland, close by, and on hearing the last witness scream, I ran to her, and she pointed out the man to me; he was just running up a field when she pointed the man out to me; he was running in a direction from the lodge very fast indeed; I pursued him, and saw him jump over a hedge, and then I got a fresh runner; I never lost sight of him, except for about a minute going round the corner, where he threw the things away. Burrowes caught him; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BURROWES. I seized the prisoner. I saw him running away, and Towers followed him. I did not see him drop any thing, nor throw any thing away.</p>

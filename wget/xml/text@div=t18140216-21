I saw him pull my watch from me; he had got hold of the ribbon; the watch he had not got hold of. I tried to catch hold of it; I could not. I saw it in his hand. I called out to my brother that was with me, to assist me; he could not; there were so many about me. When he got hold of me they took Levy from me. I was surrounded by twenty I dare say of them. After I found my watch was gone, about a minute, I found another hand come out of my breeches pocket, which hand took my note out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand was that - A. The prisoner Harding's hand that was in my breeches pocket. As soon as I had lost the note I went and informed the inward keeper; he asked me what reward I would give; I told him I would give a pound for my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said what reward would you give - A. One of the turnkeys; I said, I would give a one-pound note reward. I came again on the next day, Sunday, the 27th, to see whether my watch was come forward; the turnkey said, he could restore the watch to me, but he must have a pound first; I gave a pound in silver into his hands, and I received my watch.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160012"></xptr>Q. Are you clear that Levy was the man that took your watch - A.Yes, I am positive to that, and I am sure that Harding took the note. After I found the situation I was in, I remarked the people that I catched in the fact.</p>
               <p>Q.Who gave you the watch - A. The inner locksmans, I believe they call him; he unlocked the gate.</p>
               <p>- EVERETT. I am a shoemaker; I am brother-in-law to Woodhouse; I married his sister. On the 26th of December, I went to see a friend of mine that is confined in Newgate for a small misdemeanour, and just as we entered into the middle yard my mother called out he had lost his watch. I was about a yard and a half behind. I saw the watch in Levy's hands. I catched hold of Levy, and was trying to get the watch; the others came round, and put me away. I could not see what became of the watch at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more - A. No; the others all rushed up stairs; my brother came to me, and said he had lost the five-pound note out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Woodhouse. Did you ever recover your watch - A. Yes, here it is; my five-pound note I never recovered. I offered fifty shillings reward for it. I understood the five-pound note was taken from the prisoner by the wardsman.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a push was it when your watch was taken from you - A. It was a squeezing up against me; there were a dozen or twenty round me; no violence; I think they call it a hustling; it was only pressing against me. I had a good deal of showing about; no blows was struck, it was done in so short a time, and when they had got their prey, there was a signal, a whistle; they then all flew up stairs directly.</p>

               <p>Levy's Defence. I was in the yard; I saw a row in the yard. He did not see the watch in my hand; I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Harding's Defence. He was two or three times in the yard; he never said any thing about me till last Wednesday. He told Mr. Davis, the turnkey, it was a man in a velveteen jacket. I never wore a velveteen jacket.</p>

            . I am a news-man. I was going down Forster-lane, on the evening of the 2nd of November, and I heard a cry of stop thief! at first, I thought it was some boys playing, I turned myself round, and the prisoner passed me, with some goods on his arm, running; I stepped after him, and took hold of his collar; as soon as I laid hold of him, he dropped the goods. I held him until Oliver came up.</p>

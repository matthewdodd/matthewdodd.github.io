               <p>WILLIAM HIERSON. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 28th of March, at seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the endive roots growing in my father's garden, which is inclosed-there were six or seven hundred of them; next day I found they were carried away. On the 31st I found fourteen score of them at Covent-garden-market, I am sure they were part of those my father had grown. When the roots are planted, most people trim them; they were not trimmed, by which I knew them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. We did not trim them because they were very small-other people always trim them. I saw them safe at seven o'clock on Sunday night-it was not dark then-it was night - I missed them the next afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not plants - A. No, roots.</p>

             re-examined. They are roots. When the prisoner was in custody, we neither threatened nor promised him; the prisoner said it served him right, and that Hudson was the man who brought him to it; he said, he wished he was hanged out of the way-that he took it out of my garden about nine or ten o'clock at night. I saw his house searched, and ten parcels found under his bed, which are mine - They are worth 8l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I call it a plant when it is first planted.</p>

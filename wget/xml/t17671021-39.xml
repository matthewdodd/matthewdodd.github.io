            . I am a servant at the White Horse at Mile-end; last Saturday morning I saw the prisoner at the bar take two turkies out of Mr. Horsenail's fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at the time?</p>
               <p>Martin. I was looking out at a window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he take them?</p>
               <p>Martin. He took one under one arm, and the other under the other arm, and went out of the field with them; I can say nothing farther.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We took him up but yesterday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going along the fields, I catched up one turkey in my hand, and put it down again, and went on, and never took one away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. What time of the day was it you saw the prisoner with the turkies?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was between eight and nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. I am a butcher, I have known the prisoner eight or ten years, he is a drover; all I know of him is, he has drove many a score of bullocks for me, and brought them home safe like an honest fellow.</p>

            . I suppose I may have known the prisoner near seven years; for what I know he is an honest fellow, he lodged at my house half a year.</p>

               <p>Ward. I keep a Public-house, where he might have taken a silver tankard, and other things, had he been so minded; he never took nothing of mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the Royal Sappers and Miners. The prisoner was a private in the regiment—last summer I sent my watch to Mortimer and Hunt's to be repaired, from Black Pool, in Cumberland, where I was then quartered—on the 13th of September, the prisoner was at Black Pool—I had occasion to send him to Woolwich on or about that day—I sent a letter to Serjeant Yolland, enclosing this letter to the prisoner to take to Mortimer and Hunt's, authorizing him to receive the watch for me—if that order was delivered, and the watch given to him, it was his duty to give it to me—he ought to have returned shortly after the 25th of September, and brought the watch, but he did not, and I did not see him again till he was at the police-office—the watch produced is mine, and the one I sent to London to be repaired.</p>

I am cashier, to Mortimer and Hunt—I know they received a letter from the prosecutor—the prisoner came and asked if Mr. Da Costa's watch was ready—I told him the party who had the execution of the order was not in, if he called the following day, I had no doubt it would be ready for him—Mr. Stafford had the execution of the order—he said the watch was sealed upon his desk—the prisoner came, and I gave him the parcel sealed up—I asked if he was authorised by Lieut Da Costa to receive the watch—he said he was—he was dressed in regimentals.</p>

            ; I had employed him to sit in an opposite shop of mine, and in consequence of some information he gave me by a note sent, telling me to come over directly; I went. I then went with brindle; he came out to me; I accompanied Brindle to a public-house; he and I followed Manning; we took him into custody. He had three pieces of calico in a bag. I told him that was our property; he made no reply, except some body gave it to him. It was a quarter of an hour after before Daley was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN, I reside<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030006"></xptr>in the house, and the taxes are paid by the firm.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL BRINDLE. I was employed to watch the shop of the prosecutors; I stationed myself on the opposite side of the way in a shop, a paper hangers just opposite; I sat in the shop; I had an opportunity of seeing all persons who went into or out of the prosecutors shop; about half past eight, I saw Manning go into the premises, he had nothing with him when he went in; he did not stay two minutes, when he came out with this bag; I did not see him speak to anybody in the shop; I did not see any body in the shop; I could not. In consequence of this, I gave information to the prosecutor, and went with him to the public-house. As soon as Manning came out of the prosecutor's shop, I followed him to the White Swan, in Wardour-street; I went in myself, and called for a glass of liquor. I am quite sure that Manning was the man who went into the shop, and came out with a bundle.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARAPIN. I speak to the time he was in the prosecutor's shop, because I looked at my watch; he did not stay two minutes in. I don't know what direction he might have received in the shop.</p>

             LOPPET. I am warehouse-man to the prosecutors. I recollect the morning on which this was detected. I left the shop between eight and nine; I left the prisoner Thomas Daley in the shop, to take care of it; he was the only one that was in the shop; he remained behind me in the shop I suppose a quarter of an hour. I don't know whether any one came into the shop while I was absent. I look at the property; I know it, it is my masters property; I believe three pieces cost us thirty shillings a piece; I believe that to be the cost price, but I am not certain.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. There are four persons employed in this concern. When I went to breakfast, the prisoner Daley was left in the shop; there was no one in the shop but Daley; the other porter was below stairs; he was not in the shop; but he could have come into the shop in a moment.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ANSTEY. The prisoner made a disclosure to me; I had not held out any inducement to him; it was at the police office in Marlborough-street, but not before the magistrate; he said he had been robbing us for six wix weeks. I asked him how many pieces of calico he had taken, and he said, about forty or fifty.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he mention these particular pieces - A. There was an allusion to these; I asked him how he had disposed of them, and asked him if it was to the man who had the three that morning, and he said, yes, to the same man.</p>

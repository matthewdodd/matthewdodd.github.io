            , to Lincoln's-inn; I placed myself at a distance, to see if any person came to claim the charge of the check. I saw the prisoner come towards Hinney; upon my seeing them together, I immediately went towards them. The porter said, this is the person, that gave him the check. I asked the prisoner if he had given that check to the porter; he said, yes. I told him he was my prisoner. I asked him how he came possessed of that check; he rather hesitated at that moment. I asked him who the gentleman was; to that, I believe, he made no reply. I asked him what profession the gentleman was; he said, he did not rightly know. I asked him the gentleman's name; he said, he could not recollect. I thought it a strange account. I asked him where they were when he had taken it; he said, in the street, near the square. This passed in the square, in Lincoln's-inn-fields. It was in a street near the square, but he could not tell the name of the street. I told him he would have to give a better account of it than that; I was under the necessity of taking him with me. We then went through the court, into Chancery-lane; he stopped at the printers in Chancery-lane; that was at my instance, we went in there. I desired him if he could recollect the gentleman's name and where he lived, to put it down in writing; he seemed to be apprised of my intention, and said, I am not afraid of giving you my handwriting, I assure you the check is not mine. We then went to the printers on our road to the Compter, we got as far as St. Dunstan's church, he then said, he had made an appointment to meet the gentleman in the street, or in an eating-house, which is a few doors off the Bar. I told him I would take any steps that he thought proper, in order to discover the party. He then said, if the gentleman sees me in the street with you he would not come up, and then we should not be able to see him. I was in my private dress. I told him I could not with any degree of propriety leave him; we would do the best we could. We went to the eating-house, and found no one. He had put down the name of Sampson on the paper. He then told me this Sampson was a brother clerk; he wished to go to Carey-street. We went into Tooke's-court; I sent the porter up to Mr. Hewett's to know whether Sampson was at home, and while we were waiting at the end of the court, Sampson made his appearance, about an hundred yards from where we were. The prisoner perceived him first, and beckoned him; Sampson hastened his pace, and came up to us; Carley spoke to Sampson; he said, Sampson, this check you gave me is a forgery. I said, it is challenged as a forgery; tell all you know of it. I asked Sampson how he came possessed of it; he said, he had given it to Carley. Sampson said, he had taken it of Mr. Livey in a money transaction. He said, Mr. Livey was a tallow-chandler, living in Chancery-lane. I went with both of them, holding one in each hand. Mr. Livey was at home; the check was shewn him. I asked him if he had paid away a check for forty-three pounds; Mr. Livey said, he did not recollect paying any check of that amount; he referred to his book, and said he had not. I asked Mr. Livey to write his name; which he did. I then produced the check which I had with me; I asked him if he had any knowledge of it; he said, he had not; it was not his hand-writing. I told him it had been presented to his bankers for payment, and found to be a forgery. Mr. Livey then turned to Sampson and Carley, and said. I hope you have not been doing this; you will both be hanged together. Sampson said, he had. This was in the hearing of Carley. He said, he had done it; he began to tell the motive of his doing it; he said to Mr. Livey, do not you recollect paying away a check of eight or ten pounds; Mr. Livey said, he did. Sampson then said, I spoke of the impropriety of giving a check in writing, not using the printed check; how easy it was for any one to forge a check of that kind. He then said, he did not do it with intent to keep the money, only to shew Mr. Livey the impropriety of so doing. I told them I was under the necessity of taking them both to the Compter, but we had better go to Messrs. Perring and Company first. We took a coach, and went to Sir

               <p>Q. While Sampson and Carley were together, did Sampson say any further - A. I put him in the coach; I think he began first I do not recollect whether Mr. Livey began first. The conversation began about the dangerous state he was in; he was saying he did not mean to defraud Mr. Livey out of his money; he intended to return it him. A question arose how Carley came to be possessed of the note, it being a forgery; Sampson said it was prepared in Carley's presence. I spoke further of the danger of the case, what an unpleasant state they were in. Sampson said, Carley had spoken first to him; he said, he wished he knew of any way of getting a little money, it would be of infinite service to him at that time; Sampson said to Carley, he did not know any way, unless by preparing a check; Carley said, in whose name; Sampson replied to Carley, I saw Mr. Livey some time ago prepare a check, I think I could make use of his name; the check was wrote, excepting the number of Sir

            's house, Carley took down the directory and gave him the No. of the house and I believe he mentioned No. 72. I rather think Sampson put it down, as a direction for the porter where to go. All this passed in Carley's presence, and in mine. We never separated until they got into the Compter. I asked Carley whether he had taken the direction from the directory; Carley said, he had taken it down, he did not know for what purpose. Carley was endeavouring to clear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140034"></xptr>himself of any knowledge of it being a forgery; he said, if I had any knowledge of it being a forgery I should hardly have given the direction to the porter where to come.</p>

            . Q. Now mind, tell us the truth - A. I am upon liking with Mr. Drewitt, the attorney. I am seventeen. I had been in Mr. Drewitt's office six weeks before this happened. The prisoner was a clerk there some time before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that check; who wrote it - A. I did; I wrote it. The prisoner and me only were present when I wrote it. On Saturday morning, the 13th of August last, at the time that Mr. Drewitt, junior, was out of town, Carley had a list of debts that he had to collect of a client of Mr. Drewitt's; he said he wished to know how he could get some money, he wanted money very bad; I told him I wished I could inform him how; he then asked me if I knew any way; I said, no. He asked me a second time; he said a few pounds would make him happy; I then asked him what he would say if I would write him a check; he said, could I? I said, I did not know; I had seen a gentleman write one at my father's house about a week ago. He then seemed very much pleased, and reached me half a sheet of paper, and told me to do it. He asked who the gentleman was that I saw write the check; I told him Mr. Livey; he asked me whether he wrote on a blank sheet of paper or a printed one; I said, on a blank bit of paper. I then fore a piece of paper off, and began to write it. I wrote that check. He previously asked me whether I would not date it back; I said, what for? he said, it would look a little better to date it a few days back. Before I gave it him, I asked him whether I should write it for forty-three pounds; he said, yes, that would do. Before I gave it him, I asked him who should take it; I told him he must not take it himself; he said, no, he would not take it himself, he would send somebody with it; he said he would send a porter with it from Lincoln's inn; I said, very well. I held it in my hand, and he took it from me. When he took it, he asked me if I knew the number of the house; I told him I did not. He then took down the Directory, and looked in it; he found it was Messrs. Perring, Shaw, Barber, and Company, No. 72, Cornhill; he then remarked that I had left out a name in the firm, I had left out Mr. Barber's name; I told him that was of no consequence, Mr. Livey did not put it in; he asked whether I was sure I was right; I said, yes; he tore a piece of paper off, and wrote a direction for the ticket porter, and wrote the number of the house; he went out with a view to give it to a ticket porter; he came back, and said there was not any ticket porter on the stand. I had got to go to York-street, Covent Garden; as I was going along I thought I had done wrong; I asked him for the check again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you write the check - A. Yes. He said, oh, no, it is of no consequence, I will go myself; I said, you must not, give it me; he said, no, I will send a porter with it. He afterwards sold me he had given it to a porter, but not the direction; he told him at was 72, Cornhill, and he was to meet the porter precisely at two o'clock in the inn. He then tore up the piece of paper that he had wrote the direction on; he said, if anything should happen he would having nothing in his possession; he said he could work no longer; he longed to have the money in his possession, and put his pen of oneside; he said he would go and meet the porter, and if I would be at the eating-house, Temple-bar, he would meet me there.</p>

            How much were you to have - A. That was not said; he said he would stop five pounds directly he got it; he told me he told the porter to bring small notes; he was very urgent for the time to come. At two o'clock he went out to meet the porter; I was close after him; I was frightened; I knew I had done wrong; I kept watching him all the time. When the porter came, he held out his hand as if he had got the notes; the porter took hold of his arm; the officer came then. I followed them until they came to Took's-court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The first word on this business was, Sampson said, Carley, do you know where I can get a porter; I said, yes, in the inn; I said, perhaps I can go. I was in the habit of seeing him have checks and notes; I thought he came honestly by it. Sampson appeared confused to the officer. I am quite innocent.</p>

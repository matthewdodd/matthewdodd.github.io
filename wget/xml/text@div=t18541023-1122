                  </hi>. I am a barrister, practising in this Court, and on the Welsh Circuit. On 18th Sept. last, I was in this Court, in the discharge of my duty; I was sitting in the end seat of the Counsels' table; I had just concluded a case for the prosecution, and was reading another brief—my eyes were directed to the table—I think it was a little before 3 o'clock—the prisoner came up to me—I did not observe him until he was close to me, on the other side of the ledge that forms part of the door of the Counsels, table—he said, "Do you remember Cardiff?"—I then turned my face towards him, and he jerked up something which I after<lb></lb>wards ascertained to be a pistol, close to my cheek, and fired it—the explo<lb></lb>sion of the powder made me stagger back for a moment, and I felt a smart rap on the cheek, which I presume was the powder—I do not think there was any wadding—I think it was only the powder; a small circular hole was cut in my cheek by the explosion—the skin was broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was that occasioned by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe by the explosion of the powder; it was a hole burnt, as it were, on the right cheek.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did your face bleed at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not at the time find any injury inside my mouth; but some days afterwards I found that the explosion, by pressing the cheek against the teeth, had lacerated the inside of my mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230054"></xptr>
               <p>was in court upon the occasion of any trial in which I was engaged, I had no communication with him, either directly or indirectly—I remember in a trial that occurred at those assizes, a person asking for air for a female whom I was examining, who was fainting in the court—Mr. Justice Wil<lb></lb>liams was presiding in the court at the time—I must slightly correct my last answer—a person suggested that the young woman was fainting; but she herself said that she was not, and did not require air—ray impression is (but I am not certain about that), that it was my learned friend Mr. Grove, who was conducting the case on the other side, who mode the request.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of any application, by whomsoever it was made, to the learned Judge, for air for the witness, did you turn round in an angry manner, either to Mr. Willoughby, or anybody else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; certainly not—I did not by any intimation, or sign, or motion of my body or hand, seek to intimate to the prisoner, or anybody else, any act of indecency on my part, or that of any one else.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here stated that he entirely repudiated the services of Mr. Clarkson, as his Counsel, and had done so before the Magistrate; the defence he was instructed to make being in direct opposition to his instructions. The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">stated that a similar case had arisen some years since in this Court, where he had been retained by the friends of a prisoner, and in that instance he had been permitted to proceed with the case. The</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, recollecting that your father-in-law, Mr. Humphreys, wag my legal adviser in 1843 and 1848, did you not about the time that the gentleman said, "If gentlemen would go more back, it would be better for Miss Howells," allude in the clearest manner possible to provocations which I had complained of receiving from my brother, Sir Henry Willoughby, to your father-in-law? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made no allusion to you at Cardiff; for I did not know there was such a person in existence—I did not leave my seat repeatedly during the trial, in order to confer with my attorney and wit<lb></lb>nesses; I believe I was engaged in the Court from 10 o'clock in the morning till 7 at night without leaving it—Mr. Owen was the attorney in the case, but as well as I remember he was sitting behind me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister. On the afternoon of 18th Sept. last, I was in this Court next to Mr. Giffard, close behind him—I had not observed the prisoner until I saw him close beside Mr. Giffard—I observed him place something by the side of Mr. Giffard's head, saying at the same time, "Do you remember Cardiff?"—I quickly rose from my seat, and I saw a pistol in the prisoner's hands—an explosion took place the instant it was placed at the head of Mr. Giffard, and at the same moment I felt something strike my right cheek, which was towards the prisoner—the prisoner was then laid hold of by some persons who sur<lb></lb>rounded him while I was stepping over the partition, and Mr. Barnett, the short hand writer, wrested the pistol from his right hand—I observed that Mr. Giffard's right cheek was very much blackened, and the akin was burnt about the size of a small pistol barrel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Will you swear that Mr. Giffard's face was blackened by gunpowder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared to be blackened by gunpowder; prior to the explosion there was no blackness on his cheek—it would depend upon cir<lb></lb>cumstances, whether the powder would follow the ball—I think it would not necessarily do so; there was something exploded undoubtedly—if the ball struck against the wall of the Court, of course Mr. Giffard's face could not have been pressed by the ball; it may have been pressed by the powder—if the muzzle of the pistol was held at a little distance from the face, I think it quite possible for the explosion to have burnt one side of the whisker.</p>

               <p>to where the prisoner had been standing—I saw that bullet applied by Mr. Pearson, the City Solicitor, to the barrel on the pistol which I took from the prisoner—it went easily into the barrel, but could not be shaken out again—I handed it in that state to, Russell, the officer, on the following morning.</p>

On Monday, 18th Sept., I was performing my usual duty in the Court—I heard something like an explosion—my back was turned to the prisoner at the time, and at the same time that I heard the explosion I heard something rattle, and, as I thought, strike against one of the partitions of the Court—in consequence of that, I commenced a search, and underneath the seat I found a pistol ball—it was not flattened, but one side of it was black—I believe it is here—it has been wrapped up in paper, and probably some of the blackness may have been wiped off—I should say, not being a very good judge of such matters, but forming the best opinion I could, that it had not been discharged—I think it must have fallen out against the partition—I gave the ball to the City Solicitor, and saw it applied to the barrel of the pistol.</p>

On 18th Sept I was standing at the top of the stairs in this Court—I heard the report of a pistol, and saw the prisoner standing—I had not observed him before—I directly went up and seized him—I said, "You have another pistol about you"—I put my arm round him, and felt another pistol in his pocket—he said, "It is loaded"—I took it from him, and produce it—I took him into custody—the pistol I took from him was loaded, and is loaded now, with ball and a proper charge of powder—there was a cap on it, and the hammer was down—while I was searching the prisoner, he said he hoped that no other person was hurt but Mr. Giffard, as he intended to shoot Mr. Giffard, as he (Mr. Giffard) had wanted to commit an unnatural crime at Cardiff.</p>

I have had many cases of insanity brought before me—since the day the prisoner was committed to Newgate I have continually seen and conversed with him—I happened to be in the prison immediately after he was taken there, and I saw him then—I am of opinion that he was then, and is now, of unsound mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician. I have for many years had my attention called to questions of insanity—I have seen and conversed with the prisoner, with the view of ascertaining the state of his mind—I first saw him in Paris in 1849, or 1850, at the request of his family—I was then requested to see him with a view of ascertaining the state of his mind, he having left England suddenly, pending a commission of lunacy issued by Lord Chancellor Truro, in his case—I had two interviews with him at that time at his lodging, in the neighbourhood of Paris—I then considered him of unsound mind—he was under various delusions respecting his family—I saw him again on the 19th of this month, and again on the 24th, in New gate—I conversed with him upon both those occasions, and examined the state of his mind—I considered him of unsound mind on both occasions—I have been in Court during the whole of this trial.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, who had a number of papers, to which he constantly referred then delivered the following defence:</hi> Gentlemen of the Jury; it is now my painful duty, unassisted by counsel and without any legal help, to call your attention to the defence which I shall make to the charge for which I am indicted; namely, for feloniously and maliciously shooting at and discharging (<hi rend="italic">the primer here suddenly broke off and said, "people seem to be hissing me;" upon being assured that such was not the case, he proceeded</hi>) a loaded pistol at Hardinge Stanley Giffard, with intent to murder him; and before I do so, I implore you to dismiss from your minds whatever you may have heard out of doors, and to weigh carefully and dispassionately all the circumstances bearing upon the question which you are called upon to try, in order that you may arrive at a just and righteous conclusion, as to whether there was that malice prepense in this act which is necessary to constitute the offence of murder; I labour under every possible disadvantage, in as much as this question has been already disposed of within the walls of Newgate. When I first saw Mr. Clarkson on the 18th Sept., I said to him, "Mr. Giffard has invited me to commit, or has unjustly charged me with committing, an unnatural offence;" Mr. Clarkson replied, "It is a delusion, I cannot hear it;" I then observed that the pistols were bought in 1848, for Sir Henry Willoughby; alas, he is my brother (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner requested that ladies might withdraw</hi>), because Sir Henry Willoughby had shown to me * * * *, and I subsequently added that I had banished myself from my country for the last six years, in order to avoid those frightful exhibitions, and still more frightful consequences; not only has Mr. Clarkson treated these my assertions as a delusion, but Mr. Davis, the chaplain of the gaol, as soon as he saw me, insisted that the Court would not allow me to go into any pro<lb></lb>vocations that I might have received, and brought forward the case of Munro, and then stood behind me, and declared that Mr. Giffard was per<lb></lb>fectly harmless, holding his arm in a particular manner; he told me that no good could arise from my alluding in public to his provocations and beastialities; and when he left me he stood at the door of my chamber, holding his hand in this manner (<hi rend="italic">raising his arm</hi>), exclaiming two or three times, "<hi rend="italic">bum, bum,"</hi> not connecting the two words with any third; and will you believe it to be possible gentlemen, my case has been prejudged by Mr. Davis on more than one occasion, for on leaving chapel one morning a Fellow prisoner said to me, "Oh, how cruel; his lecture to-day was more like a condemned sermon;" and on that morning he used the word, "Mind," five times in five minutes, stating that murder had been committed by the vicious under a delusion of mind; not satisfied with these allusions, Mr. Davis and Mr. Cope (I blame them not, because they are employed in what they consider to be their duty) have seized the whole of my papers, papers relating to any boyhood, and to my most secret thoughts and most private affairs, those relating to my family as well as all the papers relating to my defence, and have withheld from me three documents, without giving me copies of the same, in order to produce them as evidence against me; and will you believe it possible, after I had subjoined my remarks to the depo<lb></lb>sitions which were taken before Sir Robert Carden, and placed them in my portmanteau, whilst I was walking in the yard, some one tampered with the lock, the first ward being pressed down upon the second and third; I</p>

               <p>showed it to Mr. Keating, a fellow prisoner, and to Gutteridge and another officer; on the following morning, when we were in chapel, the wards were filed and repaired, so that there was no difficulty in opening the lock; now gentlemen, such tyranny is unpardonable; such a system of espionage is far more suited to the atmosphere of St. Petersburg than to this land of free<lb></lb>dom to which we belong; and I protest, in the face of God and man, against such cruelties, cruelties which I am sure will not be sanctioned by a British jury, by their lordships, or by the highest personage in this realm; gentle<lb></lb>men, having premised so far, under the full expectation that you will not allow your better judgment to be biased by anything that may have been advanced by Mr. Clarkson, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Cope, the personal friends of Mr. Humphreys, the father-in-law of Mr. Giffard, I shall now, with the permission of their lordships, go into the circumstances which induced me, alas! to discharge a pistol at the person of Mr. Giffard; I left France this time last year, because I was affected with a chronic diarrhea which might have caused my death, and I was residing in the summer at Clifton for the benefit of my health; I crossed the Bristol Channel in the first week of August, with the intention of seeing the historic castle of Cardiff; upon my arrival in that town I heard that the Courts of Law were sitting, and being very fond of listening to counsel I went to the Town Hall; this was the first time I had appeared in public since my return to this country; the case of Miss Howells <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Mr. Beynon, was about to commence; it was an action for libel, under the most distressing circumstances; Beynon published to the world that he had seduced Miss Howells, and thought by that publica<lb></lb>tion to prevent her being united in matrimony to the Rev. Mr. Hughes; Mr. Grove (and I wished much to retain him upon this occasion, but Mr. Sewell, my quondam schoolfellow, told me that he was not come<lb></lb>atable) was counsel for Miss Howells, Mr. Giffard for Mr. Beynon; during the cross-examination of Miss Howells, Mr. Giffard, seeing what an interest I took in the trial (I was sitting behind him) turned round to me and said, with a violent motion of his arm, "We shall soon come to the <hi rend="italic">rig;"</hi> and then turned abruptly to Miss Howells, and asked her whether she had never slept in a public house, cruelly, as it struck me, connecting that question with the motion of his arm; Miss Howells said, "Do not be so hard, I wish to speak the truth;" when I saw that she was fainting, I suggested that the windows might be opened, and a cup of water given to her; under the direction of the learned Judge, Mr. Justice Wil<lb></lb>liams, the windows were opened, and a chair was brought for her; a gentle<lb></lb>man who was standing behind her then said, "If gentlemen go more back, it will be better for Miss Howells," or words to that effect; from that mo<lb></lb>ment Mr. Giffard commenced every possible outrage against all public decency, and at that nick of time, when it was to be presumed that her "gem of gems" had fallen, Mr. Giffard having previously left the court to confer with the witness Pascoe or the attorney, falls down on the table, and after a short pause—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner here entered into details of alleged indecent gestures and motions on the part of Mr. Giffard and Pascoe</hi>)—I directed Mr. Giffard to state his case against me to the Court, and I appealed to his Lordship; Mr. Giffard continued grinning, and holding his hand in this manner (<hi rend="italic">raising his arm</hi>); and after a short time the black cap, that emblem of death; yes, gentlemen, two black caps, were brought forward; Mr. Gif<lb></lb>fard then implored my forgiveness, then that of the learned Judge, then that of the Jury, then that of the Magistrates, and then that of the public collectively, and myself individually; I nodded, and said, "No, no;" and I</p>

               <p>submit to you, gentlemen, supposing I state the facts correctly, but only upon that supposition, I submit to you, under the correction of their Lord<lb></lb>ships, that had I then taken the law into my own hands, this indictment would fall to the ground; I returned to Clifton, intending, if possible, to forget these unpardonable insults; I could not do so; I called upon the celebrated Dr. Simmonds; I told him what had occurred at Cardiff, and what had been the conduct of my eldest brother for many years; he gave me some composing draughts, but I felt as excited as ever, and I told my friends that I would not survive the disgrace that had been heaped upon me by Mr. Giffard; I then went to see the unfortunate Miss Howells, and I told her mother and brother how unwell I had been, and of course what had passed would never be obliterated, and I then left for Chester; the state of my mind in that city will be best described in a letter written by me to Mr. Justice Williams, enclosing certain papers—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner inquired whether h was permitted to read the letter, and was informed by the Lord Chief Baron that he could not</hi>)—his Lordship did not deny the facts to which I called his attention, but expressed his sorrow that he could not afford me any remedy—I therefore resolved to see Mr. Giffard as soon as I possibly could, and therefore I entered this justice hall, alas! with two loaded pistols; and as I informed Sir Robert Carden, the one intended for Mr. Giffard was loaded with a ball, which was too small to be screwed down, and which I thought might fall out, for the ball in another pistol was screwed down with such force as to require to be un keyed by a gunsmith's vice; that pistol, as I told Sir Robert Carden, was intended for another person; I have just observed, that I thought the ball which was in the pistol which was discharged at Mr. Giffard might fall out; that I submit to you did actually take place, if there be any truth in Mr. Giffard's evidence; for what does he say? Mr. Giffard says, "The prisoner pressed (I do not think it could be possible, for where is the ball?) or held close to my face, a pistol which he discharged;" the hand could not have been stained with blood, for the face was not stained; how could it have been? according to the evidence of George Russell, be<lb></lb>fore Mr. Alderman Finnis, the pistol was directed, and must have been directed, obliquely; the pistol was held some little distance from the face; it never could have burnt one side of the right whisker; he has very little hair on his face; how is it possible that the effect of the explosion was to burn "a small circular hole in the middle of his face, corresponding in size and shape with the calibre of the pistol;" I ask you how is it possible, there being no pressure? because I never could have pressed it against his face, otherwise the ball must have gone into his head; nor could the inside of the mouth have been lacerated; those facts, which are sworn to in order to show that some grievous bodily harm has been done to Mr. Giffard, are, I submit to you, not true, and have been bolstered up by the ingenuity of a very acute special pleader; the evidence of Mr. James Drover Barnett is im<lb></lb>portant, inasmuch as it goes to show that I did not intend to shoot at Mr. Giffard with the other pistol; "The prisoner," he says, "immediately stepped back," proving to demonstration that George Rutland's further evi<lb></lb>dence given on the Saturday, and not on the Monday, was not true; Mr. Barnett further says, that the ball was picked up on the floor of the Court, near where the prisoner had been standing, showing that the ball might have fallen from the pistol when jerked up by me, as sworn to by Mr. Giffard; and in that respect flatly contradicting Mr. Giffard's assertion (for no wad<lb></lb>ding whatever was used in the screw pistol), that his hand and face were stained with blood, and that a circular wound was burnt in the middle of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230062"></xptr>
               <p>his face; does not Mr. Giffard swear to these untruths in order to excite your sympathies?—George Russell swears, "I did not hear what Mr. Clark<lb></lb>son said to you," and yet we were in a small room, say 15 ft. by 12ft.; "I did not hear him say, "It is a delusion, I cannot assist you;'" on Mon<lb></lb>day, Sept. 18th, he swore before the Magistrate, as he admitted in that box, "the pistol was held obliquely;" as for saying that I hoped no persons had been injured but Mr. Giffard, when I looked at Mr. Giffard, I saw that he had not been hurt in the least; and according to the evidence of Mr. Barnett I immediately stepped back. The evi<lb></lb>dence of Mr. Robert Marshall Straight goes to show that the charge of powder was small; I do not think it necessary to quote the passage; you heard him explain it; "I heard an explosion, not so loud as I should expect from a pistol loaded with ball, but certainly louder than an ordinary percussion cap;" if what he afterwards says be true, the evi<lb></lb>dence of Mr. Giffard falls to the ground; he says, "I distinctly heard some<lb></lb>thing strike and rattle against"—perhaps the floor; but he says, "Against one of the partitions of the Court;" he further observes, "The ball was not flattened"—another proof that the ball might have fallen out; "and the charge of powder was small." This evidence, coupled with Mr. Barnett's assertion, proves to demonstration that the prisoner did not intend to shoot at Mr. Giffard with the other pistol, as sworn to by that George Rutland; not, be it remembered, on Monday, 18th, but on Saturday, 23rd. Had he not been tampered with, gentlemen, by the family clique?—was it not an afterthought?—was it not a lie, <hi rend="italic">veritas est magna et proevalebit?</hi> Gentle<lb></lb>men, I have thus attempted to state, very imperfectly, the unhappy circum<lb></lb>stances which led me to discharge this pistol at Mr. Giffard; I apprehend, with the greatest deference, under the correction of their lordships, that the question in point of law for your consideration is simply this—Was a loaded pistol (recollecting that the ball might have fallen out) fired at Mr. Giffard with the felonious and malicious intent of murdering him, against the statute? I presume, in deep humility, that it will be for you to say—though, alas! I have no law books, nor any assistance whatever—whether that malice prepense, which is necessary to constitute the offence of murder, can be identified with that excited state of mind to which I was goaded on by the atrocious and the grossly beastly conduct of Mr. Giffard, in which excitement I unhappily continued until the pistol was discharged at or near the person of Mr. Giffard? His Lordship will probably say that it is no defence in law whatever the excited state of mind I might have been in, and whatever may have been the provocation; but perhaps there may be extenuating circumstances. If you are of opinion that there is the slightest untruthfulness in anything that I have advanced to-day, then let me be condemned, unpitied. I will say, if that great, that accomplished, that learned Judge, Mr. Justice Williams—if Mr. Grove, if Mr. Mills, if Mr. Llewellyn, will declare that there is the slightest false premise in any of the questions which I have put to-day to Mr. Giffard, then. commit me to Bedlam, that I may pass there the remainder of my days. To use a strong and energetic imprecation, may the flames which may now be burning on the unknown site of Sodom and of Gomorrah scorch me to a cinder, and may I fall, "like Lucifer, never to rise again," never to hope again, in the pit which is without a bottom If, on the other hand, you believe that it was an over-susceptibility of feeling—yes, rather the high-minded chivalry of a Picton, which induced the passing traveller in some poor way to take the part of a sinking maid, who was no less injured by Mr. Giffard than the</p>

               <p>prisoner; and if I endeavoured to exhibit, in the presence of my earthly Judge, a lamb like meekness, rather than the proud and noble bearing of the British lion, when Mr. Giffard attempted to stab his victim to the vitals by falsely insinuating to the Jury that I had been guilty of a crime that ought not to be mentioned—when his beastialities were so crying and so insulting to the Court, that he was summarily sentenced to die by a wise and good man, the learned Mr. Justice Williams; if you believe that, smarting under the greatest provocation that can be imagined, my mind was goaded on in a state of nervous irritability to load the pistol as it was loaded, and then to fire the pistol as it was fired at or near the person of Mr. Giffard; I call upon you, gentlemen, to restore me to my liberty, and to teach the family clique, Mr. Clarkson, Mr. Giffard, Mr. Humphreys (who must naturally feel for his son-in-law), and their personal friends, Mr. Davis and Mr. Cope—to teach Mr. Sewell, my quondam schoolfellow, who offi<lb></lb>ciously volunteered to serve me, who introduced to me his friend, Mr. Morris, with the repeatedly expressed intention of seeing Mr. Justice Williams and Mr. Groves, and yet who, <hi rend="italic">semper fidelis</hi>, has forsaken me and betrayed me—to teach, I say, this family clique—not forgetting the suborned and perjured witness, George Rutland—to know and to feel that the star of my destiny shall not wax pale, through their dark, their crafty, their tortuous, and their wicked machinations; that the day of his deliverance has arrived to the "prisoner of hope"—to him, who, as far as Cardiff is concerned, has been "more sinned against than sinning;" and that doubtless there is a God whose name is the Lord Jehovah, that judgeth iniquity.</p>

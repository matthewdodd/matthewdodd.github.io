               <p>Q.Did you lose any of your property after you let the lodgings to him? - Yes, one pair of linen sheets, and a tea spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these linen sheets and tea spoons let as part of the furniture? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you let him these lodgings, was it part of the bargain, that you was to find him in tea spoons? - I was to find him in every thing for his use, that was wanting, and necessary; he was only one week in the lodgings, before he went away, I suspected he had taken some things out of the room, and I employed a constable to come and take him up; and I looked and found the things were missing, and he was taken before a magistrate, and committed, the spoon was at one pawnbroker's, and the sheets at another, they are both here.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, the prosecutor lives in Westminster, in Great Peter-street, in the parish of St. John's, the Evangelist. On the 20th of January last I was sent for to take up this man, for robbing his lodgings, and I took up the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day the robbery was committed? - I believe not, it appears by the duplicate found on him, to be the 16th of January, I found four duplicates on him, and two led to the discovery of the sheets and tea spoon, I have the four duplicates, I found also a letter directed to a woman, nothing material to this business.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I produce a tea spoon, a person pledged it in the name of William Hill, I think it was the prisoner, to the best of my recollection. I never saw him before; I lent one shilling on it, it was pawned the 15th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. To Munday. Shew him one of those duplicates? - This is mine.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. The things are mine, there is my own name, and my husband's on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other marks besides your name on it? - No, that is the same spoon that I missed, there is no mark on the sheets, but I have another pair at home like them, they are my own work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never denied pledging the articles, but far from a felonious intent; I had a chest of tools coming out of the country, and I should have redeemed them as soon as my circumstances would admit, and while I remained in the place I did not know that there was any harm in so doing, I had no intent of felony, far from it, because if I had, I had an opportunity of taking away other things in the place; I pledged them for as little as I could help, because I meant to redeem them again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190084"></xptr>as soon as my circumstances would permit.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Machin and others. On the afternoon of the 3rd of April I was in their sale-room, and saw the prisoner take these books up, place them before him, and walk away - they were tied together; he had got about eleven or twelve yards when I stopped him, and delivered him to an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not to be a sale of books the next day? A. Yes - there were a great many persons in the room; it is the custom to inspect the books the day before; the prisoner had not gone out of the room - there were several tables between the place he took the books from and the door; I had seen him before - I do not know whether he has bid at the sales; there is a reward of 10l. to be paid to any one who detects a felony in the room - if the prisoner is convicted I expect to get that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there an opportunity for the prisoner to look at them where they were? A. Yes, but he had removed them about twelve yards - he was perhaps eight yards from the door; they had been on the floor, but there was a table against where they were, and he might have looked at them there; he had them in front of him.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL SMITH MACHIN. I know the place where these books were; there is a table and two shelves - it is the rule for persons to take them from the floor, lay them on the shelf, and examine them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not the custom there for people to put shoes on their feet, and clothes on their backs? A. Yes, on the spot, but if they were to walk down the room with them they would be stopped.</p>

            . I am a porter. I was in the sale-room, and saw the prisoner walking away with them- as he was passing near me I asked if he wanted a porter; he said No; he would carry them himself, and when he had passed me he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he carrying them openly? A. They were partly concealed by his great coat - if any one had looked at him they might have seen part of the books; he had passed the sale table - there were other tables in the room.</p>

            ; so far from wishing to rob the prosecutor, I myself gave him information in December last of a man whom I detected with property in his pocket, and Mr. Machin attended with me two days, but the man was discharged.</p>
               <p>MR. MACHIN. I have not the least recollection of the prisoner's person, but I believe he is the man who did detect a thief, but he then went in another name.</p>

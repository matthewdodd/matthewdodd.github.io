               <p>Q. On the 2d of May did Mr. Nare and Mr. Veesey meet - A. They did, I have the memorial that they signed.</p>
               <p>Q. That is there declaration of the prisoner being a bankrupt - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any adjucation of their being bankrupts - A. I have the gazette from April the 30th, to May the 4th; and from the 3d, to the 15th of June.</p>
               <p>"Whereas a commission of bankruptcy is awarded, date, the 11th of May instant; the 15th of June next, they are required to meet then and finish the examination."</p>
               <p>Q. On the 11th of May was the first meeting, did the commissioners meet - A. Yes, Mr. Nares, Mr. Christian and Mr. Veesey.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 18th of May, did the commissioners then meet again - A. They did, and on the 15th of June the commissioners met again, on that day Mr. Gibson surrendered and passed his commission. Mr. Whittaker was brought from the King's-bench on purpose to be examined; he was not brought till a late hour, there was no blame to him, it was the mistake of the officer, he did come and declare that he was not prepared, he requested untill the Wednesday following: From information of his absenting, the commissioners did not think proper to give him till Wednesday, they gave him till Monday, and then if they found it necessary, they would give him further time. Mr. Christian stated to the prisoner, that if he did not appear that day and surrender to his commission, he would commit an act of felony, and suffer death without the benefit of Clergy, although he did not receive a shillings of his property. On Monday the 17th of June, they met in consequence of that adjournment. The prisoner did not then appear; the commissioners waited in attendence; I remained part of the time, and the messengers the other time; a little before twelve he was proclaimed. I was present, he was summonsed in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180044"></xptr>usual way, on the steps at Guildhall, as the clock was striking twelve.</p>

               <p>Q. Now you tell us on the Saturday he requested an adjournment did you make any appointment with him to assist him in prison in adjusting his occompts - A. I did, he appointed Sunday at six o'clock at the King's Bench prison, I was to carry all the books and papers that he had previously selected; I took the books and papers at the time appointed, and when I came to the gate they informed me the prisoner was gone.</p>

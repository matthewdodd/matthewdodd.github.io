               <p>Q. Did you feel her take it - A. No. I staid by the door until an officer came to me. As soon as the prisoner sat upon my knee she got up, and went to the door, and called her companions, and she and some of her companions went into the next door. I sent for an officer, and staid by the door until the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your purse when she sat upon your knee - A. Yes, I am; there was nobody else but she to take it. I came to London to pay some people.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her before - A. No, and then I was in company with her five minutes, not more.</p>

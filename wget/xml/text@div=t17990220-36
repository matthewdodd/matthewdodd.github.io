             sworn. - I am a salesman in Whitechapel: On Saturday, the 2d of February, Mr. Siborne sent me a load of hay, between one and two; I went to the lad, and told him his hay was sold, and he must get his horses up, and he missed one of them; I went down the yard, and found the harness, but not the horse; I searched every where, and made enquiries, but to no purpose. On Sunday I went to the Ducking-pond, in Mile-end, there I saw Mr. Monk; he asked me if I had lost any thing; I said, I had lost a horse; he said, he thought so, for he had had two brought to him; she was not in the slaughter-house; I soon afterwards saw her in the stable, and Mr. Monk's man took her to Mr. Simmons's yard, in Whitechapel; I saw her taken there; her fore feet were white, and her near foot behind, and she had a lump under her belly, on the left side. I had seen the prisoner on the Tuesday and Thursday; he used to come up with farmers' teams.</p>
               <p>- MONK sworn. - I am a scavenger and horse-boiler; The prisoner brought me a horse the beginning of January last; he said, he lived servant with Mr. Brockhurst, of Hornchurch; he said, his master had two cast off horses to dispose of, and that he had desired him to call upon me, to know what price I gave for them; I told him, they were very low now, we did not give more than from eighteen to twenty-five shillings a piece for them. He called upon me again on the 2d of February, in the forenoon, about eleven or twelve o'clock; he wanted to know if the lad had not left a horse there; I live at the Ducking-pond, Mile-end; I told him, no; then he said, the stupid blockhead had gone with it all the way to Covent-garden market, and he must leave it as he comes back. In the afternoon, the prisoner returned, leading a mare in his hand; it was an old black mare with a long tail; it had a white foot behind, and white fore feet, and under its belly a lump; he wished me to settle with him directly, for his waggon was gone on a-head; I then paid him twenty-six shillings, and two shillings for himself; he was very particular in having a note back for his master; he said, it did not belong to his master, but to a widow, of the name of Robinson, at Hornchurch; the prisoner gave me his name as John Tower; I gave him this note which I hold in my hand; he said, he was going to call at the Artichoke, in Mileend; I went there with him; he wanted to know if he was not to have something to drink; and just before we got to the door, he said, I can only have a glass, and be off, for my waggon is gone on ahead; I said, no, we will have no drams, we will have something else; I then had an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Beck, who keeps the Artichoke; and, in consequence of what he said, I called the prisoner into a little back room, and told him, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200034"></xptr>thought he had not come honestly by the mare, and I would have nothing to do with it; he said, I had no occasion to be afraid of that, it was Mrs. Tomkins's mare, and he drove Mrs. Robinson's mare; I told him, I doubted it, and he gave me the money back again, note and all, except the two shillings; he said, his master should call for the money; I stepped out to get Mr. Beck to assist me in apprehending the prisoner; and while I stepped on, the prisoner absconded; I looked about the yard and the premises, but could not find him; I heard that he had gone down the road at the rate of ten miles an hour; I made all the enquiry I could to find an owner. Mr. Parsons came to me on the Sunday, and I sent my lad with Mr. Parsons and the mare, and I have not seen her since. On the Monday, a man came to me and demanded the money, not the prisoner, I had him secured, and from him I learned where to find the prisoner; and he was taken up on Monday, the 4th of February, on the other side of Stratford. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOMES sworn. - On Monday evening, the 4th of February, I went with Monk and his brother, to Stratford, and apprehended the prisoner between six and seven in the evening; he confessed he had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any offer of favour, or threatened him? - A.Neither.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure the mare that I afterwards saw was mine.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Monk). What is the value of the horse? - A.If it was in market, I don't know that she would fetch above forty or fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was from half past eleven till two, at the Neg's-head, and going home, I saw this horse, and a parcel of boys pelting it with snow-balls and stones, and some people said, it belonged to Mr. Monk; and I led it home to Mr. Monk's, and Mr. Monk desired me to take it over to the yard; and there I left her, and went about my business.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Potter On the 14th of April, between the hours of two and three o'clock, the prisoner came in the shop to look at some prints; I shewed her some that laid on the counter; she did not approve of them; I went to the shelf to take down some others, and the instant I took them down and turned my eyes towards the counter I saw her shuffling something under her petticoats, which led me to suspect her; I desired the porter to inform my master; my master came down stairs, he asked me who was the prisoner; she had bought two yards of print of me, and Mr. Potter took the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Potter in the hearing of the prisoner what you had observed - A. I did, Mr. Potter took the money for the print; then he said to her I believe you have got something which is not your own, he took hold of her; she resisted and was very abusive; she said no man should touch her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to search her - A. Yes; he told her to be quiet, he would send for a constable and have her searched in a room up stairs; while they were taking her up stairs, before she was half out of the shop, I observed a-piece of calico, in the middle of the shop, in a tumbled state; it had the appearance as if a person had attempted to fold it in a small parcel to carry it away; I am sure it was one of the article for sale in my master's shop, it had my master's mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand this I your shop mark on it; do not goods sold at your shop go out with the shop mark on them - A. Yes; sometimes at the finish of a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this piece might not have been sold before with the shop mark on it - A. I will not venture to swear that there was not precisely the same mark on a piece of calico sold before.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you sold an entire piece of calico to this woman - A. I had not; she bought two yards of print at a shilling a yard.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of this woman; I found her in the shop, a little way from the counter; the prosecutor ordered me to take her up stairs and search her.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went up stairs had you looked on the spot where she was standing, to see if any thing was on the ground - A. I did not; I watched her for fear she should drop any thing. When I got her into the room; I searched her; I saw no property on her; Mr. Potter said he was very certain that he saw some property about her when he attempted to search her; the prisoner said she was quite innocent; Mr. Potter went out of the door; he brought in a piece of calico; he charged her with taking it; he ordered me to take her in custody; she set herself down in the arm chair and turned her arms into the holes of the arm chair to prevent me from taking her; I was under the necessity of sending for Dodson.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you both together secured her - A. Yes; she then said she hoped we would overlook it; it was the first time, and she never was in a prison in her life.</p>

            . I was sent for by Mr. Potter; I found her up in the dining room; Mr. Potter charged her with robbing him of a piece of calico: I took the piece of calico along with the prisoner; she suffered me to search her; she was very quiet with me and said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Potter. What passed after your foreman gave you the information - A. Mr. Mitchell pointed out the prisoner to me; I then asked her what she bought, she told me two yards of print at a shilling a yard; I folded the print up and took the money for it of the prisoner and gave her the piece of print; I told her that she had some property about her that we suspected was not her own; she was then standing close by the counter; she denied the charge; I pulled her gown and apron of one side, I saw something white, which I supposed to be calico; I then moved her about three yards from the counter; there I kept her and sent for an officer; when the officer came I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she behave herself before the officer came - A. I did not mean to say how she behaved herself, but if you wish it I must. She behaved very riotously indeed; I had some very respectable customers in the shop; she said I was going to ravish her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct your eye to the spot of ground where she stood - A. I watched her very narrowly, and I am very much astonished I did not perceive the goods drop. After the constable came I picked them up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the goods picked up at the precise spot in which you held her - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a person had been looking at goods on the counter could these goods that you found by any accident have fell on that spot - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been removed up stairs before you picked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010041"></xptr>up the goods - A. I gave her in charge of the constable and was following her up stairs; Mr. Mitchell informed me that the piece of goods lay on the floor; I went back and found the goods upon the very spot where she stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with having taken them - A. I did, and she denied it; I persisted in my charge and desired the officer to do his duty; at that time there was but one.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the second to be sent for - A. The woman was very riotous, that was the occasion of my sending for the second officer; before the second constable came, she said she was extremely sorry, hoped I would forgive her and this was the first offence ever she had committed. The calico had my shop mark upon it; it cost me about ten pence a yard; there is eighteen yards of it.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went into Mr. Potter's shop; I asked the gentleman to let me look at some pieces of cotton for an apron; I choosed a piece; he cut me two yards of it; Mr. Potter came into the shop and asked me if I had not got some stolen property; I told him I did not know what he meaned; he said he was very certain I had a piece of Irish or a piece of print; I never laid my hand upon any thing in the shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 4, St. Andrew's-terrace, Waterloo-road. I am unfortunate—that house is not mine; I have one room in it—I had the key of it from the landlady, Mrs. Rackham, but I never took the key out with me—I came home about half past 2 o'clock in the morning on 8th April—I had gone out about 10 o'clock—when I returned to the house I found the street door open—other young women lodge in the house—the street door shuts, and if you pull a string which is outside you can get in—I don't know whether there is a lock—when I got into the passage I heard a rustling of some one coming down stairs—my room is the top room on the second floor back—I called my landlady to give me some Lucifer's; she gave me some—I struck a light and went to where I had put my key, and I found it there under the carpet and hearth rug, which are in the passage—I lit another Lucifer, and saw that the door of my room was open—I went into the room to look for the candle, which was removed, and I saw that my bonnet was removed—I looked in a box, and I saw my boots, hair brush, comb, and some other things, wrapped in an old petticoat, and my dress wag gone out of the box—I had left my candle on the wash-hand stand—the candle had just been blown out; I could tell that by the redness of the wick—I looked under the bed, and saw the prisoner there with my clothes on—I had to drag her out by myself; nobody helped me—I said, "You cruel creature, you have robbed me"—she said, "Don't call a policeman, and I will tell you who <hi rend="italic">put me</hi> on to your room"—I told her I would let her go if she would tell me who <hi rend="italic">put her on</hi> to my room, but she could not tell me any one—we had a hard struggle, and I called out—she took up a knife from a table close by her, and said if I did not let her take the clothes off before any one came she would stick it into me—she had got my silk dress pinned round her, a shirt, and a flannel shirt and a pair of drawers tied round her under the silk dress—she was dressed, and she had her bonnet and shawl on ready to go out—we struggled very hard—my landlady came in ten minutes, and she saw the prisoner take the flannel shirt and the shirt over her head—after that the prisoner went down—I could not help it; she was too strong for me—she went down and called for the police; three policemen came—the landlady had called the police before, and when the prisoner got to the door there was a policeman there—the prisoner wanted to give me in charge for an assault, and I told the police I would give her in charge for a robbery—one of the policemen brought her up stairs and saw my room—she wanted to go away then—this cotton shirt was torn down by the prisoner struggling—all the things were taken off her before she went down for the policeman—there</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say "I left my key under the carpet, and I found it there after this was over?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that is incorrect; I went for my key directly I went home, and found it there—I did not know the prisoner before; I never saw her in my life—I had not met her in Waterloo-road that evening—I did not offer to let her come home to my house; I never admit any one to my home, except one gentleman, who is very good to me—it is not true that the prisoner went home with me, and that I wrapped her in my bed-clothes; nothing of the kind—it is not true that I locked her in my room, and went out—there was no one in my room when I went out and locked the door—it is not true that there was a man there, and that the prisoner said, "Who have you got there?"—I never heard her repeat the words—she and I had a fearful struggle: I believe I scratched her face a little—I wrested the knife from her, and she cut me across the hand—there was no man there who said "We have her in our power now, and we will <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> her if we can."</p>

                  </hi>. I was a police constable, but I have left the force—I was called to the house in St. Andrew's-terrace, and saw the prisoner out<lb></lb>side the house; she said she would give the prosecutrix into custody for assaulting her—I took her to the prosecutrix, who was inside the passage, and she said she had robbed her—I took her in charge—the prosecutrix's hands were bleeding from a cut with some sharp instrument, and the prisoner was bleeding from both face and hands—I went up stairs and found the room in confusion—these things were on the floor—this cotton shirt is tied together, and this flannel shirt is tied together—these boots, bonnet, and dress I took, and the magistrate allowed the prosecutrix to have them—when I went in the room they were on the floor; they were given to me from the floor—the prisoner said she had been taken there by the prosecutrix, and I think she said she was drunk when she was taken there.</p>

I am taking care of it till it is let—he does not live there—it is let to young women of the town—the prosecutrix went out that evening about 10 o'clock—she generally goes out about that hour—I shut the street door that night at 12 o'clock—I shut it every night at 12 o'clock—it is always open at other hours from morning till night—I remember the prosecutrix coming to me that night about half past 2 or a quarter to 3 o'clock; she awoke me up—I was asleep—she asked me to give her some lucifers, as she heard some one rustling on the</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the prosecutrix that night—I met her in the Strand, and went home with her—we heard the chimes go half past 2 o'clock, just as we passed Waterloo church—I went with her to her door—I live at No. 3—I stood by the door to wish her good night, and she said, "O my gracious me, our door is wide open"—it was open—she went in, and I went in my house, and in about three minutes I heard screaming—I opened my window, and saw Mrs. Shuttleworth come out in her night clothes and call, "Police!" but no one came—she went in and came out again, and called, "Police!"—I saw the prosecutrix come out, and she spoke to a man outside the door—that was just before the policeman came up—I do not know what became of that man.</p>

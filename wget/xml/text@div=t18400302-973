                  </hi>. I live at East Ham, on the Barking-road. On the 28th of February the prisoner was one of my labourers—some of my men were engaged in threshing—I have some wheat in chaff—I have compared the wheat in chaff found in the sack, which the prisoner is charged, with taking with the bulk in my possession—they correspond in quality and ap<lb></lb>pearance—it was wheat of last year, and had not turned out so good as I thought it would.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 319.) On the 28th of February I was going my round at East Ham, and met the prisoner in a bye-road which leads to East Ham church—that would lead from the prosecutor's farm to the prisoner's lodgings—he had a sack with him—I asked him what it was—he made some answer which I could not understand—I told him to stop—he threw the sack down and ran sway—I pursued and took him—I took him back to the sack—I then asked him again what it contained—he told me corn, and begged very hard for me to let him go—he said he had a wife and six children, and it was the first thing he ever took—another officer came up—we took the sack to the station-house—I saw Mr. Adams exa<lb></lb>mine it.</p>

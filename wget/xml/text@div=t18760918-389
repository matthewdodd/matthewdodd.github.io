                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and goldsmith, of Ludgate Hill—on 24th July the prisoner was in my employment as literary copying clerk nothing to do with the business—to go to the room where he was employed he had to go by the end of the shop and if nobody was there he could run behind the counter and come out again—I kept articles of jewellery left for repair in a box, which Mr. Fisk missed—I do not know the whole of the contents.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Walton—on 24th July, about 5.45, I saw this box of jewellery safe—the prisoner passed through the shop a quarter of an hour afterwards and I missed it the same evening—he could reach the box as he passed through the lobby—I know nearly all the con<lb></lb>tents, there was a gold watch, the number of which I know, and there was also an amethyst pendant with the other articles—the watch and pendant have not been found.</p>

I met the prisoner on 2nd August, and asked him if his name was George Denman Dysart, he said "No"—I told him I was a detective officer and should take him in charge for robbing his employer, Mr. Walton, of Ludgate Hill—he asked if I had got a list of the property stolen, I said "Yes," and showed him the list, and he made a tick to those he had taken and a cross to those he did not take, and among the crosses was the watch, the chain, and the pendant—he said that he had not taken them, and if he had a little time he would collect his thoughts together and give the prosecutor every information, and that he should like to see me at Newgate—he asked me to furnish him with a 'list of the books and everything the prosecutor had missed—he said that he had put the articles in his pocket and pawned them, but knew nothing about the watch and chain—the watch and chain being in a case would be of large bulk.</p>

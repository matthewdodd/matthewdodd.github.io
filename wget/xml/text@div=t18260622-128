On the 16th of May I gave the articles stated (which were my property) to John Welch, to carry to my washerwoman, who lives in Thatched-house-row.</p>
               <p>JOHN WELCH. I took the bundle from Mr. Collett to the washerwoman's on the 16th of May - I went for them again on the 20th, and, as I returned, I met the prisoner in the City-road, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; he was a stranger; he said "My lad, will you go on an errand for me?" I said No, I was in a hurry just then - he said "You won't be a minute;" I said "If I won't be a minute, I will go;" he then gave me a letter to take to the last house in Nelson-terrace - pointing to it; he said I should have to bring a box back with a cord round it, and I had better let him hold my bundle till he came back; I said I could carry it with the box - he said "If you have that bundle you can't carry the box;" I left it with him, and when I got half way up the street, I turned round and saw him run - I pursued but lost sight of him - I went on till I saw Mr. Taylor; I told him of it; I saw the prisoner at Worship-street, but I was not sure of him at first, because he had not the clothes on that he had the first day - it was a black coat.</p>

            . I fetched the prisoner out of the lock-up place - the lad said he did not know him, because he had not his coat or hat on, but on another day, when he had his coat and hat on, he said it was him - he was then in custody on another charge.</p>
               <p>- MONTAGUE. I keep the Axe public-house, in Grub-street. The prisoner lodged with me - he is a tailor by trade. On the 20th of May, he was at home the whole day, and the whole week; on that day I was poorly myself, and he was in my bar the whole day. As to a black coat he has not had one for the last three months - he has no coat but the one he has now on.</p>

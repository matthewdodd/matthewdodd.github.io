On the 27th of August, I fastened up my shop, and was called up at near one o'clock in the morning; I found the shop-window had been taken down, and some person had been in; I afterwards missed some property which I knew to be mine - it had been safe when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty, and stopped the prisoner, between twelve and one o'clock, with this property - here are some horse shoes and nails; I asked where he got them; he said, "I brought them from my master's premises, in Three Cups-yard;" I said, "I am sure you are wrong, you don't mean to do this:" he said,"I did it on purpose to leave the country." I took him to the watch-house, and then went to the premises, and found the shutter down - I called up the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TOWNLEY. He had worked for me up to that time, but he had been away for two days, as he sometimes was - he had no right to get into my premises, and take my property; when I saw him he said, "Master, it is your property; I got into the shop, and took it out."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

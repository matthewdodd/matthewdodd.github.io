On the 15th of March I was at Dalston, and saw the prisoners - I was going home to Plough-lane, Homerton; Grover, who was three or four yards behind the others, spoke to me - they were going the same road; I overtook them - Grover asked me where I was going; I told him to Homerton-I wished to persevere forward, but he began telling me his wife had lived servant at a house which I knew; I wished him good night, and went on, but had not got far before Clark hit me a blow, and down I went - I suppose I had got within a hundred yards of Church-street when I received the blow right on my forehead; Clark came rather in front of me - I fell down, and during the skirmish I felt his hand in my pocket; with that, to stand in my own defence, I had at him - after I had been at Clark then the other young man came and pitched into me directly; I was beaten and hammered about by them - the Policeman came up, and I gave charge of Clark, but he made a rush from the Policeman, and struck at me again; I was sober - I did not lose any money.</p>

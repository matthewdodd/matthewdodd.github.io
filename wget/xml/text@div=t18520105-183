I then saw him place his hand on the outside of one female's pocket, and feel if anything was in it. They then separated for about two minutes. I watched Francatelli, and another officer followed Adam. They rejoined and conversed together, and on "God save the Queen" being played, I saw the prisoner Francatelli go up to a lady, and with his left hand feel her dress, and then put it into the pocket of her dress. The audience began to leave, and the prisoners turned round to go out, when I heard Francatelli say to Adam, "Push me." The other answered, "All right, Robert." I then saw something passed from Franca<lb></lb>telli to Adam, which appeared like a watch, as I saw it shine. Just before they got out of the door I took them into custody, telling them I believed they were there for the purpose of picking pockets. Francatelli said, "We have not robbed anybody." I asked him what he meant by the words he said, and calling the other Robert, he replied, "It is only a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi>" I took the stick called a life-preserver from Francatelli, which I produce. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not say to a few minutes, but it was a little after 10 o'clock, I first saw you in the Theatre.

               <p>—I noticed that particularly—that was not a peculiarity of his, but he did not put his gloves on, and that was the reason he put his hands into his pockets—he did not tell me that—I cannot swear that I know where his hands were during the three hours we were there—he had not his left-hand in his pocket all the time—we were occasionally very near ladies, and his hand may have touched them—I did not see it near to a lady's pocket—what part of the ladies his hand was near, would depend on whether they were tall or short, or whether they were standing—he did touch their dresses, he must have; and it must have been on their left side, as we were walking forwards—I may have touched several ladies, but what part of them would depend on whether they were tall or short—I had gloves—I kept my hand in my left-pocket, something like this (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>), but never loose about; I swear that—I had my stick in my right-hand—we were arm-in-arm the greater part of the time—we found it most convenient in the ciowd, because we could keep together—my left hand was in my great-coat pocket, or my breast, the whole time I was there—I will swear I did not touch any ladies' pockets—I may have touched their dresses with my knuckles—I do not know which side a lady's pocket is on—I did not touch ladies knowingly—I never did it on purpose—I paid no attention to any of the fair damsels there—I did not talk to them—I did not speak to a lady while I was there, nor to a female, nor yet outside the theatre; nor did Adam; I think I must have known it if he did—neither of us took any liberty with any lady, nor did we stare at them—I looked at one lady particularly—I did not notice whether Adam did—the lady I looked at was a long way off, in the boxes—there was nobody in the pit I looked at—I am assisting my father at the Coventry—I was apprenticed to the Earl of Hardwood's cook—I did not leave him before my apprenticeship was up, I stopped two months over the time—I did not leave because I bad been taking a little too much—it was me that said, "Push me, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>"—I swear the answer was, "All right"—I did not bear the word "<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>"—my name is not <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>—I hare been called <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> for a game, at the club—we call one another <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> for a <hi rend="italic">nickname</hi>—it was Edward Gilliss that called me <hi rend="italic">Bob.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I should like to know why you took that stick out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been in the habit of taking it out; I usually take a stick out when I go out walking sometimes I take that, and sometimes I take another stick—I brought this stick here to-day—I had my hat on in the theatre, and one hand was at liberty—we did not walk about a great deal; we stood at one place, and then walked again—my left hand did not touch any part of a lady's dress any part of the evening, because I kept it in my left pocket, and when my friend was not with me I kept it in my pocket.</p>

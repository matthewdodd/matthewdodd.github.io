                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Catherine-street, Lime-house-fields, in the parish of Limehouse. On the 6th of Feb., at night, I went to a box, which I kept on my first floor landing, to get some money, and found the lock had been broken, and from a small box inside that I missed a purse and six sovereigns, which I had noticed were all new, and of the present reign—I had seen them safe on Friday, the 3rd—the box had been opened by a key—the prisoners lodged in the house—they came home that night be<lb></lb>tween eleven and twelve o'clock, in a cab, and were not sober—they had lodged with me nine days, in an unfurnished room—I did not have any cha<lb></lb>racter with them—the man represented himself as a bricklayer, but did not go out while there till very late in the day, and not at all on Wednesday—I left my son in the house, on the 6th, when I went out between five and six—I returned at seven—he is thirteen years old.</p>

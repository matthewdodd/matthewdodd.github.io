I am a chemist, and live in Margaret-street, Hacknet-fields—I did carry on business in Cambridge-road, and left it early in May—I had a great many bottles and stoppers which Mr. Jones, the landlord, allowed me to leave in the shop in Cambridge-road—I was informed that the shop had been entered, and I missed from it about thirty bottles, more or less—I used to sleep there from Oct. till May—after the middle of May I was in the habit of going about twice a week to those premises—I did not miss any<lb></lb>thing till I heard they were gone.</p>

On the morning of 30th May I was called up by the policeman—I went to the premises, and found they had been opened, and sundry bottles had been emptied, and some taken away—I believe the bottles which have been, found are the same, but I cannot swear it—I had been in the premises on the night before, at a quarter before eleven, and stopped about ten minutes—I went to the prisoner, who is a customer of mine and a neighbour—he keeps a chandler's-shop and beer-shop—the police<lb></lb>man told him there had been a shop broken open in Cambridge-road, and several things missing—he said he had got the bottles, and they were left by two men who had three pots of beer, and had not get the money, and they said they would call the next day.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning, the 21st of April, while I was at breakfast, at about half after ten o'clock, Mrs. Weston came out, and cried out fire! thieves! I went out directly; I found Mr. Elmes at the bottom of the stairs, with his adze in his hand; there was a butcher there besides; they were afraid to go up stairs; I went up; Mr. Elmes and the butcher went up with me, and Mrs. Weston followed us; I had a knife in my hand. I found the garret-door shut; the staple of the lock was out, and lay on the floor; the bolt of the lock was shot. I found the bed and the bed-clothes all upon the ground. There was a sailor's blue jacket in the room. Mr. Elwes went up towards the chimney with his hatchet; we looked up the chimney, but could not see any light through it; Mrs. Elmes took his axe, and beat it against the woman's tail; he thought it had been a parcel of rags; he said there was nothing there: I put my hand up the chimney, and took her by the thigh. I said it was no man, I was fire, for it had not breeches on. She was, I believe, about three foot up the chimney; she was nearly as black as a coal. She burst out a crying: she said her husband was a soldier; that she had pawned his shirts, and was determined to rob somebody's house to get them out of pawn, or else she should be killed by him: she said a man had told her to rob that house.</p>
               <p>Did she say who the blue jacket belonged to? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she say how she got in? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises of favour? - No.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the bed that belonged to Peal? - I have been in the brokering business; I would not give above 5 l. for the whole; that bed is worth about 50 s. The prisoner's shoes were off; we looked about the room and found them, and she put them on.</p>

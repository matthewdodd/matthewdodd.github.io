I am a draper, of 100, Queen's Road, Bayswater—on 25th September, the prisoner came in for three pennyworth of black Scotch yarn, and gave me a florin—I gave him the change, and after he left found it was bad—f went after him, brought him back, gave him into custody, and he was remanded and discharged.</p>

I keep the Woodman public-house, George Street, Greenwich—on 9th October, about 6 o'clock, I served the prisoner with a glass of ale—he gave me a florin—I put it on a shelf by itself, gave him the change, and he left—about two minutes afterwards, a second party came in for a glass of ale, and gave me a bad shilling—I then examined the florin the prisoner gave me, und found it was bad—I went out to the prisoner and told him—he was about 200 yards off, apparently waiting for the other person—he said that he was not aware it was bad—I told him he must wait and gave both into custody, with the florin—they were both searched in the house—there is a hole in the floor, in front of the bar, where spirits are let down—the prisoners stood near there, and I afterwards found this bad half-crown and shilling close to where they had been standing.</p>

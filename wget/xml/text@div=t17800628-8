               <p>I was going along Red-Lion street the second of this month, about five o'clock. I saw the prisoner with a mob round him; he had a gown over his arm. There were a great number of people round him; they were going to take him to a magistrate, but did not know where. I went with him to Justice Girdler; there I was bound over to prosecute him. I know nothing of his taking the gown.</p>

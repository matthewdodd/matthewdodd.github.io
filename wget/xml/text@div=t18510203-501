                  </hi>. On 21st Jan. I was at the Clerken<lb></lb>well police-court, charged with assault by the prisoner Smith, who was ray potboy—I was discharged, on paying 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs—I had no silver, took a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note out, and tendered it to the officer for payment of the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but the officer paid the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Smith for me, and I put the note into my pocket again as I thought—I left the Court directly to get change, and the pri<lb></lb>soners and three or four more who were there, followed me—the prisoners were close to me in the Court—I crossed the road, and went to a public-house opposite, and there missed my note—the prisoners did not go into the house, and I went out into the road to see if I could see anything of them, but they were gone—I went back to the police-court, saw Mary Jones, and went with two officers, and found the prisoners and three others at the Golden Lion, Bagnigge Wells-road, which is about a quarter of a mile from the police-court—I asked them which of the five had picked my note up; they denied it, but not individually—I said one of them must have got it, and they must go back to the station and be searched—Hardy then came in, and said some of them must know something about the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—note—Kimber then said it was no use denying it, he had got it, and that Smith gave it him—Smith was present—Kimber gave the officer the note; he took it out of a tobacco-box—I gave them both in charge—I did not hear Smith say how he came by it.</p>

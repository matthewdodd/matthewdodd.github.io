            . I live at No. 27, White Lion-street, Pentonville. On the 6th of May, I lost a gold watch and chain and two seals, worth ten guineas altogether - at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the corner of Bartholemew-lane - the watch was in my fob; I was coming from Threadneedle-street, quite sober - on turning round the corner into <placeName id="t18330516-16-crimeloc77">Bartholemew-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I think I understand you, that at the time you lost your watch, the prisoner was the only person by you? A. Yes; the persons who ran on my giving the alarm ran about him or after him - I did not observe that he had any companion - while I was calling "stop thief" several persons ran calling"stop thief" also - it did not take him a moment to get my watch - he was taken in two or three minutes at the corner of Finch-lane - I did not lose sight of him - I cannot say what he might have done with the watch while he was running - I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

            . I am a patrol - I heard the cry of"stop thief" in Finch-lane, and met the prisoner running, and several more within three or four yards of him - I laid hold of him; the prosecutor immediately said that was the man who had robbed him of his watch - I took him to the watch-house; he denied the charge, and said something in the watch-house about his having come in a Paddington omnibus about seven o'clock that evening - the prosecutor was within sight of him when I heard the alarm.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What did he say about the omnibus? A. He did not say it to me, but to the inspector; he said he had only just got out of the omnibus, and that he left Paddington at quarter-after seven, that he got into the omnibus at a quarter-past seven to come to London- he went quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Monday week my brother, who lives at Paddington, asked me to come to his house, which I did; I left home about six to be there by seven, and got there about seven; I stopped there a little while, and about half-past seven took the omnibus - I told the man who rides behind, to drive quick; there was a stoppage in Newgate-street, and when I came to where the omnibus stops, I got out and ran; hearing a cry of stop thief, and seeing a mob running, I would not run that way, but ran the other way; the watchman caught hold of me and took me to the watch-house - the gentleman said I took his watch; I can prove I never did such a thing in my life.</p>

            . I am conductor of Mr. Bird's omnibus; I ride behind. On Monday evening, the 6th of May, I took the prisoner up between Marylebone-lane and Bond-street, a little before eight, and took him to the corner of Threadneedle-street, opposite Princes-street - we are generally there about the half-hour, or a little before, as our regular time to start is three minutes after the half-hour - when I took him up he said he was rather late, and ought to be home before that time; and when I sat him down, he paid me, he said he was behind time, and ran off from the omnibus up towards Threadneedle-street; he went into Threadneedle-street - I can't say whether I saw him pass Bartholemew-lane, but I saw him to the lane - he has rode with me several times before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he say anything to you about driving fast? A. He said, when he got out, that he was behind time; he sat off running the moment he left the omnibus, straight up Threadneedle-street; he ran along Threadneedle-street as if to go to Bishopsgate-street - I heard no cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q.It is ten days ago, are you sure you remember the prisoner from the circumstances? A. Yes; I don't know where he lived.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Do you know any of the other passengers? A. Yes; the regular gentlemen who I carry every evening - I believe the prisoner lives somewhere Whitechapel way, but I don't exactly know - I put him down in Threadneedle-street, beyond the Bank, just on this side Bartholemew-lane.</p>

            . I am a constable of the ward. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, a few minutes before I came in; he said he had just come from his brothers by the omnibus, and was going home - he behaved very well.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. RACKWITZ. Q. Was it dark? A. It was not day-light; there was a lamp just opposite - I am positive of the man; I cannot be deceived; I was very collected; I felt the watch go out of my pocket; he held my pocket down with one hand and took it with the other - I caught hold of his hand, but could not keep hold of him - I saw his face while I held him; there was no obstruction in the lane - after I cried stop thief several persons followed him, but I am positive I never lost sight of him - I did not turn up Finch-lane; he was stopped at the corner; I was close upon him, and did not lose sight of him when he turned into the lane - I did not observe any communication between him and the persons who followed - I was robbed by the shoemaker's-shop at the corner of Bartholemew-lane - he met me; he came running against me and dodged me - I tried to get out of his way, but he would not let me- I must have lost sight of him when he turned the corner.</p>

             re-examined.

               <p>JURY. Q. How many persons were in your omnibus? A. I had about seven when at the Bank; he was at the furthest end, being the second passenger I took up.</p>

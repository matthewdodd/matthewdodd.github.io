             deposed, that she being sent for found the Prisoner in Bed in a very work Condition, who told her, that the Child was born Dead; that there were no Marks about it, but that it was so limber that one might wrap it about one's Hand like a Cloth; and that the Child's Hands were open. Mr. Allsshaw deposed, that he found both the Arm bones of the Child broke, and when he opened it the blood gushed out at the Bowels; that it was very limber, but if it had been born alive it would have been Stiff; that there were no Marks of Violence upon it, not so much as a Scratch. Two other Evidences produced some Childbed Linnen which they found in the Prisoner's Trunk. The Jury considering the matter, <rs id="t17210525-59-verdict302" type="verdictDescription">

After they had robbed me. I stood longer than they chose; they said if I did not go they would blow my brains out; I went away to Paradise Row, where I lay all night.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James's, Clerkenwell; I was in company with the prosecutor; he was speaking of having been robbed; I asked him to describe the man; he did. The prisoner was carried up to Mr. Wilmot's; he desired to be admitted an evidence; he impeached three men; when they were carried to Bridewell to him, he did not know either of them. He went to a ruinated place, and he took this cutlass and pistol from under some bricks; (producing a cutlass and pistol.) The pistol was discharged at Justice Wilmot's door. The place where he took them from is between Field Lane and Plough Court, where some old houses are pulling down; he said the pistol was his own, the cutlass his companion's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing of whom he robbed?</p>
               <p>Dunmore. I heard him say something about a chaise and a man in it, and about breaking open the Sun Fire Office, and some other things.</p>

               <p>Gore. I believe the lower end of that road is Paradise Row.</p>

               <p>Gore. This man seems like the person, I can't be certain as to the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body else concerned?</p>
               <p>Gore. No, only Dempsey and me; Dempsey sold the buckles for 3 s. At the time of the robbery, Dempsey desired this man to take off his clothes, he said they would fit him, I said no, it is a sin to strip a man.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Do you remember that?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. And what do you think of it now?</p>

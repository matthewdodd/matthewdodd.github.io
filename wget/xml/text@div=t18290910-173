No - I am sure his name is Milner; I never heard him go by the name of Mellor - I did not know him at Manchester; all the sums the prisoner received were to be paid into my hands; he entered them himself in a rough cash-book in the office, which I have hear; I charge him with embezzling 27s. on the 6th of June, received from Inglis and Co. and 3l. 16s. 6d. on the 4th of August, from Charles Meekin.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when he came home wet one day, telling you he was going out to receive this 1l. 7s.? A. No - I cannot recollect his going out when he complained of being wet; I will swear he did not bring me home this 27s., place it on the desk, and desire me to enter it in the rough book. Three waistcoat-pieces which were found among his clothes have been kept back, considering them to have been stolen; they are at home, not exactly in my possession - I told the officer I meant to detain them, considering them Mr. Milner's; Mr. Milner has discharged an old servant since I have been there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was quite a stranger to you? A.

            . I have seen the prisoner write, but could not swear this receipt is his writing; it appears to me to be feigned hand; he has never accounted for either of these amounts; I am the person he should account to - the bill is attached to this receipt; it is for business done by Milner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know that he came to Mr. Milner's from the service of Mr. Glover, of Watling-street? A. I understood so; I have the rough book here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Turn to the 6th of June - is there any entry of 1l. 7s. from Inglis? A. There is no such entry; he was not authorized to collect on the 4th of August, so there is no entry on that day - there is no entry of the transaction at all.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did he not account sometimes to Mr. Milner as well as yourself? A. No - if Mr. Milner himself receives money he accounts to me for it; it is the prisoner's duty himself to put down the money he received - I never took money from him till he himself entered it, and the party he received it from; there is no entry of his without a name to it - I do not recollect an instance of Mr. Milner having given me money received by him, for he has not been able to attend to business for six months; I make up my account every morning - I pay cash into the banker's, but keep a floating balance; I have never been urged to make up my accounts quicker than I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, declaring that he had paid the 27s. to Dede, desiring him to enter it, as he had come home wet, but denying that he had ever received the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100086"></xptr>amount from Mr. Meekin's, and stating that the charge arose from vindictive feelings on the part of Dede.</p>

            . Q. Did the prisoner bring the bill with him? A. No; he asked for Mr. Milner's account, which had been left - our regular settling day is the first Tuesday in the month; I paid several others that day - I think he asked for the precise sum, as I always ask what they call for; I am positive of his person - if a stranger had asked for the account, and named the sum I should have paid him.</p>

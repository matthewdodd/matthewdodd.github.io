                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smith, of the Wheat Sheaf public-house, Church-street, Greenwich—on Tuesday, 14th January, about 12 o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me to give him a pipe—I did so; he turned his back and went out—I turned my back—my till was then quite closed—he then came in at the next door, and I heard some money drop—I turned round and saw him going out, and my till wide open—I missed 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew how much there was there before—there was no one else in the place—I flew to the door, and saw the prisoner parting from another man—I called to my servant, pointed him out to her, and sent her after him—he was brought back in three or four minutes—I said, "You are a good for nothing man to ask me for a pipe; I very civilly gave you one, and directly I turned my back you returned by the other door and took the money out of my till"—I do not remember that he made any answer—a great many people rushed in, and I gave him in charge.</p>

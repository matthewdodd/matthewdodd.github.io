            . I am an officer. I found the prisoner last Saturday night, in consequence of information, and under her bed I found this basket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into a house in the Seven Dials, where I met with this man; he asked me to go with him; I went and lived with him three days; he told me if I would live with him he would support me like a lady. On the evening in question he asked me to assist him down St. Martin's-lane; as we were going along he said he was about to take a room in King-street, Drury-lane; I told him I had an objection to that, and it was my intention to return to my brother, who is a Justice of the Peace in Dumfries; he went to a public-house, leaving me his basket to make what I could of it, and to get a yard of muslin, which I wanted; I waited from half-past seven o'clock till half-past nine; I then went home and told my landlady that I had got permission to dispose of the things; but on Saturday last the prosecutor came to the house and said he had got a letter from my husband, and he asked me to go home with him; I said I had no wish to live with him; he said "D - nation to my soul, I will either hang you or transport you;" he went out and got a constable.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DRURY re-examined. Q. Had you ever lived with the prisoner? A. No, I never had any thing to do with her in my life; she came to my place one night about a fortnight before; I and my comrade gave her a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever permit her to raise any money upon your cucumbers or basket? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her you would be revenged on her, and transport her or hang her? A. No.</p>

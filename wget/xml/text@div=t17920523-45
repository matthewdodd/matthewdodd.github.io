               <p>I lost a metal watch, chain, and seals, as in the indictment, and two or three trinkets, on the 8th of May, in my dwelling-house. The prisoner is a relation of a very old servant in the family, and on that account has been often employed by Mrs. Le Trobe; by that means she became acquainted with my servants, and with my nursery-maid. On the morning of the 8th of May, Mrs. Le Trobe and myself went from home very early; before nine; upon going out of our bed-chamber, I wished her to put on her watch, which I then saw hang at the bed's head; she went out without it, but gave charge to the nursery-maid not to permit the child to play with it: we did not return home till twelve at night, and I immediately missed the watch from the bed's head; I not easily finding it, I called the nursery-maid, and the whole room was searched; the bed, and every part; I understood the prisoner had been there that evening to see the nursery-maid, in the bed-chamber. I sent for a constable the next morning, by six o'clock; and at that hour the constable, the nursery-maid, and myself, went to Winchester-row, where the prisoner said she lived; we found out the house, but were informed she had been gone a fortnight; we accordingly came home; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230037"></xptr>out all that day; in the evening, I found the prisoner at my house in custody; she was searched before me by the constable, and upon her was found, I believe, about twenty-eight shillings, and two duplicates; I circulated hand-bills, and received an account of the watch from Sir Lawrence Cox's office; I saw the duplicate in the name of Mrs. Le Trobe.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA WILSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am nursery-maid to Mr. Le Trobe. The prisoner was at our house on the day he has mentioned, the 8th of May; we went up stairs into the bed-room, into my mistress's room, to shew her a bonnet, with a child; I left the prisoner to put away the chairs, and came down stairs; she said she would stop till eight or nine o'clock; and when she came down, she said she was ill, and must go home, and come on the Sunday following; the watch was hanging in the bed-chamber when we went up; when my master came home, he missed the watch, and called to me. The constable, a young man, and me, met the prisoner by accident, yesterday, in the street.</p>

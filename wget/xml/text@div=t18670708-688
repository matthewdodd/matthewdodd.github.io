                  </hi> I am n tailoress, of 5, Barchester Place, Poplar—on 13th June, about nine p.m., I was in Upper North Street, Poplar, and saw Hayes and Moore at a fish shop, having a bottle of ginger beer—there was a crowd a dozen yards off, and I saw Fitzpatrick in it, and the prosecutor—there was a cry of "Stop thief! "and that a sailor had been robbed—Hayes had then gone into the crowd—I saw two policemen come from the bridge, and I gave information that Hayes and Moore had gone round the corner—I had heard money, and saw Moore pass it to Hayes, who said, "What shall I do with this <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>. how shall we change it? "—some boys behind us then hallooed out, and Hayes left Moore and went down by Stink House Bridge into the crowd, where the sailor was—Moore went round Lantern Street, took his coat off, and kept it on his arm—I told a man to rim after him; for he was the man who had got the money—I did not see Fitzpatrick do anything to the prosecutor, but he was against him when I saw him—that was nearly a quarter of an hour before I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—the prosecutor was very drunk, and had a cut over his left eye—I did not see how that happened.</p>

"and I pointed out one of them to my landlord—I afterwards saw Moore in custody—he said, "What the—hell do you want keeping me here for? the man's money is all right"—there was a large cut on Wilson's eyebrow, as if he had fallen on a kerb-stone, and his cheek was grazed and bleeding—he also had a piece of sticking plaister on his nose, and I could see that he had had a little accident the day before.</p>

                  </hi> I was in North Street, and saw the sailor and the three prisoners—there was a cry, "The old man has got his hand in his pocket"—either Hayes or Moore said that, and they shoved him away and Moore said to Fitzpatrick, "I will be the death of you"—Hayes and Moore led the sailor away, and Fitzpatrick followed, and a few yards up Saverton Street they suddenly let go of him and he fell, and I saw Moore put his hand into Wilson's pocket, when round comes Fitzpatrick, and as Hayes and Moore were going to leave Wilson Fitzpatrick said, "No, that will not do; you have got all the sugar, and now you can go and buy tea, and leave me in the lurch"—they let go of Wilson, and he got up and staggered a little lower and fell; his knees hit the road, and his eye hit the pavement, which wounded it very severely—I said to Hayes and Moore, "Oh! pick him up; look at the blood running from his eye"—Hayes picked him up and said it was only a scratch—I said to Fitepatrick, "Where does the sailor live? "—he said, "Rosemary Lane"—he then said to Hayes and Moore, "What have you done with the change of the <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>.

I took him to the Sailors' Home, and met him next day, and was with him all day, and took him to get paid. We then went to a public-house, where he paid me.

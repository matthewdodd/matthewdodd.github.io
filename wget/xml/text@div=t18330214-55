             (Police-constable E 118). I lodge in Cromer-street - on the 7th of January, at half past eight o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner in Holborn, with something under his apron; I asked what it was - he said a pair of boots, which he had brought from Mr. Walker's at St. Giles', and he was going to a Mr. Walker's on Saffron-hill; I took him back, and he wanted to get across into Seven-dials - I took him to the station, and he then said,"To tell you the truth, a man gave them me to carry."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I had got a pair of boots, and I pointed to a young man who gave them to me, but he ran away. Witness. There was a young man at some distance who made away.</p>

            . On the 4th of this month between 7 and 8 at night, I was sitting in a room joining to my shop, and I thought I heard a noise; I came out and found the shop window open, I thought somebody had been playing the rogue, not suspecting any thing of thieves, but looking down Plumber's-Court I saw a woman, said I, woman or mistress, I cannot tell which, why do you open my sash-window ? I laid hold of her, and found a canister<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174401130009"></xptr> which I knew to be my own; said I, woman, why do you rob me? I took hold of her, brought her to my door, and then she dropped another canister , with a bladder of about 4 pound of snuff; I asked her how she came by them? she said she found them. The Prisoner was very much in liquor, I believe she did not know what she was doing - I knew her before.</p>

            . Mrs. Robinson keeps a coffee-house in Plumber's Court , in Holbourn, I was in the coffee-house, and heard this gentlewoman cry out she was robbed; I went out and took one of those canisters and the snuff off the ground - the Prisoner said she bought them; she was very drunk, I believe she did not know what she did.</p>

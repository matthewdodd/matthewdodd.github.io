                  </hi>I am clerk to Mr. Henly, a perfumer, in Tichbourne-street, St. James's. On the 21st of May, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a sixpenny pot of pomatum, and gave me a half-crown, which I put into the till—there was no other there—I saw Cobham some time after—he gave me a bad half<lb></lb>crown—I gave it back to him—I got it from him on the following morning—I then marked it in the presence of the policeman, who was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>I am shopman in the same place. On the 21st of May I went to the till, about a quarter or ten minutes to eight o'clock—I found two shillings, one sixpence, and a bad half-crown—I took the half-crown to Saunders—I got it back from him and put it into my own private drawer, and the next morning I was returning from my breakfast and saw the prisoner at the counter—a youth who was there was gone for some articles to serve her—I went and spoke to her, and she said the almond-oil was too dear, she would not have it, she would have a sixpenny pot of pomatum—I took it out, served her, she handed me a bad half-crown, I took it to Saunders, and then we sent for the master, who desired us to send for a policeman—I gave the two half-crowns to the officer.</p>

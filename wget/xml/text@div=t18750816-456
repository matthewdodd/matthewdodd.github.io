                  </hi>. I am a sealskin purse maker, of 3, Slades Place, Clerkenwell—last Monday night, I was at the Metropolitan public-house, in Farringdon Road, about 11.15, and with my friend William Mortimer, when I came out I saw the prisoner talking to two men—she came up to me and said "Take that Stanton; now I am satisfied"—at the same time stabbing me with a knife in the face and walked away—the knife remained in my face; I tried to pull it out, but could not—my friend tried twice before he could pull it out; I followed the prisoner up Farringdon Road, till I met a policeman and gave her in charge; I bled a good deal—I had my wound dressed at the station—I knew the prisoner well in the street—I have never had any quarrel with her—on the Sunday night, before this, I was drinking at the corner of Cross Street, Leather Lane, and she came in and called for a pot of beer; they would not serve her, and as we came out she said "There is Stanton, a bony b----," and she took out a knife then, and if I had nut run across the road she would have stuck it into me then; I had given her no provocation; I did not strike her; she was intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Peroy Circus, and am surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> division of police—last Monday night, about 11.30, I examined the prosecutor—he had a small incised wound half an inch below the lower eyelid of the left eye, extending upwards and backwards towards the ball of the eye; I attempted to probe it, but found its dangerous position; I did not force my probe in; it was at all events half an inch deep—the wound was not in itself dangerous, but it was in a very dangerous neighbourhood—this knife would cause such a wound.</p>

About 10.40 I was standing outside the Metropolitan, with the knife in my hand picking my nails, when he came out and made a hit at me, and I threw the knife at him; I did not do it with the intention of hurting him.</p>

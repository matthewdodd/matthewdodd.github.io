                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Earl Grey, in North Road, Hoxton. On 15th Oct. the prisoner came, with another man, between 6 and half past 6 o'clock—the other man called for a glass of bitter ale; it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner asked for a glass of half and half, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. together—the prisoner tendered, in payment, a good sovereign; I put it into the till, and took out a half sovereign, which I rang on the counter, three half crowns, and two shillings, making 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—immediately I put it on the counter, the prisoner put his hand over it—I am quite sure that the half sovereign which I gave out was a good one—the prisoner got the change with his right hand, and his left hand was on the counter at the same time—I looked rather hard at him, and he lifted up his hand, and said, "Here is only 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—I said, "No"—he had not the money in his hand, it was lying on the counter—I said, "I have some halfpence to give you"—the other man said, "Are you changing a sovereign? I have coppers enough;" and the other man paid me 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I said to the prisoner, "You don't want your change now"—he said, "No, not now my friend has paid"—I opened my till again, and took out his sovereign, and laid it on the counter—I swept the silver into my</p>

On 15th Oct I was called into the bar, and saw the prisoner there—my wife accused him of ringing the changes with the half sovereign—she said, "This is not the half sovereign I gave you, you have <hi rend="italic">rung the changes</hi>"—she gave me a bad half sovereign—I gave the prisoner into custody, and gave the bad half sovereign to the policeman—I marked it by his request—I gave the good sovereign to the constable.</p>

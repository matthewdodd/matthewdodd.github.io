                  </hi>. I belong to the schooner Topsy lying in Harrison's Wharf—on 8th February, about 12.10 p.m. I was in company with the prisoners—we had just come out of the Old George, and Nayler put her foot out and I fell over it—I then felt her take my money 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was loose in my trowsers pocket, most of it in silver—I told her that she had my money—she said she had not—Leary came up and I saw them part my money between them—I gave the three in charge, and going along Slater took some money out of Leary's hand as the policeman was dragging her along, and Slater dropped half a crown and a florin—Slater said "That is all the money I have got, say no more about it."</p>

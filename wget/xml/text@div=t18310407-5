I knew the prisoner by seeing him about the neighbourhood; I never saw him at my own house. On Tuesday, the 15th of March, at seven o'clock in the morning, I missed all my silver out of my till; it was 20s. or 30s., and a 5l. Bank note out of my breeches pocket - the till was in my shop, and my breeches up stairs on the bed; somebody must have come up stairs - I had the 5l. note safe at nine o'clock at night I am quite sure; the keys of the kitchen, the shop, and the till were all brought down stairs; I found them in the doors and in the till - two of the keys were in the back room, and the key of the till was in my bed-room the night before; I slept with my little boy, who got up before me - he is twelve or thirteen years old; Gorton, the Policeman, has since shown me my note, (looking at one), this is it - I have written Mrs. Jones, Randall-street, on it, of whom I took it at six o'clock the night before.</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son, and slept with him. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, and when I came down into the shop, I found the till drawn out and put on the counter; some papers and a knife laid on the counter - I had heard nobody come into the bed-room in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body up in the house when you came down? A.Frederick Hardy, the journeyman, was at work in the bakehouse under the shop - he is not here; he works for my father now.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 47, Oxford-street. On the 15th of March, about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to me and bought a pair of trousers and a waistcoat - he gave me a 5l. note: this is it (looking at one) - I wrote on it the name and address he gave me, and who he worked for; I have written"John Watts, No. 19, Barbican, at Mr. Gillett's;" I am sure he is the person - I never saw him before; the things came to 23s., and I gave him three sovereigns and a half and some silver in change.</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse, Kentish-town, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Dearlove's, the prisoner lodged with me ever since about Christmas - he was a journeyman baker, as I understood from him. I remember his going out on the Monday night, the 14th of March, at eleven o'clock, when I shut up - he did not return that night; I fastened up the house - he came the following morning rather intoxicated, and treated a person with something to drink at my house - he paid me 7s. 6d., which he owed me - I said he was rather flush of money that morning; he said he had met an uncle that morning, and drew him of 1l. - I heard him ask a man in the evening to accompany him to meet his uncle in Oxford-street; it was a man named Devereux, and another whose name I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>JAMES GIBLING. On the 11th of July I was at Mr. Jessop's, <placeName id="t18250915-18-crimeloc98">Bell-yard, Oxford-street</placeName>

I know this bridle - it is the property of Mr. Frederick Bull - it was missed on a Monday, and the prisoner was taken on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Has not your master a great many bridles? A. Yes; I am positive to this - there are other bridles like it in the harness room, but this has been champed by the horse. I went to take the prisoner and he said he had bought it of a person named Williams, who was formerly an hostler in the yard.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Jessop's yard, to get a horse on a Saturday - I saw the prisoner there, whom I had known for six or seven years - he asked me if I wanted to buy a saddle and a bridle; I said I would look at them; I then said I would have the curb and saddle, but not the bridle - he said he wanted 50 s. for the curb and saddle, and I agreed to have them; a young man, who was there, said, if I had not had them he would. I took the saddle and curb home, and on the Monday evening my man told me that a bridle had been brought to my stable; I went to the prisoner on the following Saturday, and said heard they had been stolen; he said the saddle was his own, and the bridle he had bought of Williams, and he would go and tell Mr. Jessop of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not persons in the line of business that the prisoner is, often buy and sell articles of this description? A. Yes, they do.</p>

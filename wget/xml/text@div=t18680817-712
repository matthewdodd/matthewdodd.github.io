About 11 o'clock on the night, 3rd July, I was in Clement's Lane—I saw the prisoner coming toward Clement's Lane, with four others—he had his arm straight down by his side, as if he was trying to conceal something—I asked him what he had under his coat, he said, "Nothing"—I took hold of his coat and found these trousers wrapped in paper—he said, "I found them in Carey Street"</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Sheffield Street, Clare Market, and am a jewel-case maker—on Friday, 3rd July, about 10.45, I saw a gentleman opposite my house, walking along rather the worse for liquor—he had a paper parcel under his arm—I saw the prisoner and four others near him, and saw the prisoner trip the gentleman up—they then ran away with the parcel—I have often seen the prisoner before; I am certain he is the same man.</p>

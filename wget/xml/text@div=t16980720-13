            </rs>. He was a second time Indicted on the Statute of Stabbing, and the Coroners Inquest. It appeared, that the deceased and others, being in company at the Sutler's near the Horse-Guards; the Prisoner intruded himself into their company, and sitting till each Man had spent his Six pence, the Reckoning was discharged: the Prisoner having gone out of doors, the Company supposing he was gone, engaged in a fresh Reckoning, and call'd for a double Tankard of Drink, which being placed on the Table, the Prisoner return'd, and taking the Tankard up, emptied it on the Ground; and being told that he ought to pay for it, he thereupon committed several Insolencies; and damning the deceased, he said, He would be damn'd by no such Pimp as he: On which, the Prisoner, having his Sword betwixt his leggs, drew, and stabb'd the deceased (over the Table) without other provocation; and the Company being so taken up in looking after the Deceased, gave time to the Prisoner to escape. But being pursued, was seized in Holbourn; and as he was bringing over Covent-Garden, he inquired if he was dead, and swore a great Oath he was glad of it. The Evidence agreed there was no Sword drawn, nor hand lifted, or Stroak struck. The Prisoner said, that the deceased threw a Tobacco-pipe at his face, and had his Sword drawn, but could not prove it. The Jury brought him in <rs id="t16980720-13-verdict59" type="verdictDescription">

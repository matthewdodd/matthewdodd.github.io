                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Great Arthur-street, Golden-lane. On Sunday, the 22nd of May, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Bushell's house, in Little Arthur-street, between five and six o'clock in the morning—she had nothing in her hand—she came out in about a minute and a half with a pail—I ran up the street, and stopped her with the pail—I took it from her, and took her back to Mr. Bushell's—I asked her why she did it—she made no answer at first, but the second time she said she did it to get her a lodging.</p>

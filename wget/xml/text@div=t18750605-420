H., Gill—I gave the "prisoner the goods believing that they, were for Mr. Gill for a public-house that he was building—the prisoner came again on 12th May and asked for a dozen of sash pulleys—he did not present any order—I did not say anything at first, but I went round the counter, locked the door and put the key in my pocket—I said "Where is the money for those goods you had in the name of Gill"—he asked me after some parley how long I would give him to pay—I Said "Not a minute," and I sent for a constable and gave him' in Charge—I had presented my bill to Mr; Gill on the 25th March.</p>

I was not working for Mr. Gill at the time I mentioned no name to him to allow me to have those things on credit. He knew it was not for Mr. Gill, it was for myself. The things I have had I was willing to pay for; if he had gone home with me he should have had the money; be presented the bill to Mr. Gill instead of to me. All Mr. Gill's orders are printed, therefore he must have known that did not come from Mr. Gill.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came down where did you find your house had been entered - A. By the bar at the front of the high road, next to Bethnal-green parish.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any shutters to the bar window - A. Yes; the screws that fastened the two shutters had been forced out, and a bit of the bar broken; the shutters were not taken down; the screws had been taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170005"></xptr>out; the shutter was forced back, so that they could enter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your property gone - A. Yes, about forty-five pounds in pence and halfpence; there was a great deal more. I can speak to forty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Now just tell me in what manner the copper money was placed there - A Twenty-five pound was tied up in five-shilling parcels in paper; I lost gold and silver coin; we reckon that we take twenty five pounds in gold and silver, besides copper, in a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose half guineas, shillings, and how many notes - A. There were eight one-pound bank notes, two mourning rings, one gold ring, and a family ring besides; we lost two time pieces, one of which was set in Derbyshire spar; we lost two bags, a tin box, a silver two-pence, a new shilling and a new sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered that your house had been robbed, did you and Legg discover any tracks near your house - A. Not so near my house as the new buildings where they took the wheelbarrow from; the buildings are about an hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. At these buildings did you find any of your property - A. Yes, we found our till and three wooden money bowls.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever had been at your house, they had disposed of your property there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from that place did you trace any track - A. Yes.</p>

Another bag, these were in this bag as it is now, all on the floor, by the side of a large box; the contents of the second bag is seven pounds and eleven pence halfpenny in halfpence, and six shillings in penny pieces; they are in the same state now as they were then. The third bag, these were told out on a box from a heap and laid out in six-pences; these amount to about five pounds, and nineteen shillings in copper, penny-pieces and halfpence. This is the fourth parcel, it was on the floor in an apron or a wrapper, tied up, this amounts to two pounds nine shillings in penny-pieces, in halfpence, and two shillings and three pence in farthings; the fifth parcel, this was on the ground, in the handkerchief were seven shillings and sixpence in penny-pieces and one pound one shilling and three-pence halfpenny in halfpence in these brown papers, it appears to be broken; there are several pieces of brown paper, string and all. This bag contains a few farthings and a silver shilling, but I cannot say which bag was in; it was found in one of the bags. Here is another parcel, this little parcel was between the bed-clothes, it is a handkerchief, it contains two shillings and seven-pence in penny-pieces, seven shillings and six-pence in half-pence and ten farthings.

            . Q. You went along with Armstrong, have you any thing that you found independant of what he produced - A. I found a quantity of penny-pieces and halfpence on a box, and in the box twelve pounds five shillings; I found eight pounds and fifteen shillings in halfpence, and three pounds ten shillings in penny-pieces, these are in five shilling papers; on searching the room below I found this guage rule, one of the joints is wanting. Vickrey found a crow, it was under the floor in a concealed place under the stairs; I took that crow to the prosecutors, I matched it to the window shutters and to the window frame; it exactly corresponded to these marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Wherever a crow had been used to the breaking of the house it corresponded with the marks - A. It did; I have no doubt but with that crow the marks were made; I likewise fitted the marks in the bar, it corresponded with the marks in the drawers of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Jones produce to you a joint of the guage rule - A. He did; which corresponded with this joint; I have matched it, it appears to me that that piece belongs to that rule, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. You say you have no doubt that crow found in this man's house was the crow that did break into that house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if any other crow corresponded so well you could speak so positive - A. I found the crow in the prisoner's house; it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKREY. Q. You are also an officer belonging to Worship-street - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You went and your brother officers to this house in which you found Ware and the other prisoners - A. I went about two minutes afterwards, I was not with them at the time they went in; I found this copper in this cloth as I produce them now, ten shillings and ten pence in penny pieces, one pound nine shillings and two-pence halfpenny in halfpence and three-pence farthing in farthings, making all together two pounds and three-pence-farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now describe where it was you found this - A. After seeing the money found by the officers, I went down stairs; there are only two rooms in the house; I went down stairs; I went into the lower room; in a cupboard to which there is a door opens under the stairs, there was a quantity of rubbish with the remains of some coals and some bricks intermixed together; I cleared some of that away and then I found the way underneath the floor of that bottom room; the floor was not laid to the ground by a foot or fifteen inches; I could not get under, I reached my arm in and discovered that cloth that I have been describing; I took it from under there with the contents tied up; after I had taken this out I proceeded further in the same place; I got this crow from underneat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go and fit the crow - A. I went alone, and saw the prosecutor and his sister; I fitted the crow to all the inner places, the drawers and the cupboard, every place that was broken open; it fitted exactly; I found that the drawers had been done with one end of the crow and the cupboard with the other end; I called the prosecutor, he saw me fit the crow. At the office this dark lanthorn was produced, this bolt and this crow, by the prosecutor, I have had them ever since; this dark lanthorn has a piece of candle nearly burnt out, and this crow bar produced by the prosecutor was too large for the marks, it would have made a larger impression.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Where did you find the crow that you gave to Vickrey - A. This crow bar was found by the buildings where the drawer was found.</p>
               <p>Vickrey. This bolt appears to have been taken off the shutter; it was given me by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the bolt off my window shutter, it was found by a man at the front door, he gave it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170007"></xptr>me.

            's house under the stairs; I do not know of any thing being placed there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts as nigh as you can recollect was the amount of the copper money in halfpence and penny-pieces, as nigh as you can recollect - A. I cannot tell, it was a great deal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are twenty one years old - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What business were you brought up to - A. To a looking glass frame maker.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not serve your time out, did you - A. No, sir, my master died two years and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You master died two years and a half ago, and before he died he turned you out of his service, did not he - A. No; I served all the rest of my time but six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you heard all the conversation of these people going to Mr. Jones' house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you did not know where the house was - A. No, but I heard them say where they were going.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not honesty to go and tell the prosecutor to be upon his guard, nor any body else - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If I were to ask you whether it was not the porter and you that went to the house and took away the property, you would answer me no it was the prisoners, that you and the porter did not go and rob the house - A. I did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Do favour us with the name of the potter - A. I do not know his name: I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You persist in telling us that you did not know the porter before, and this man whom you say was a stranger to you carried the money for hire - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were found some short distance from the prosecutor's house about seven o'clock in the morning - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you insist upon it you and the porter did not go to the prosecutor's house - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. When you heard them talk about Mr. Jone's you thought they were going to drink a pot of beer - A. No; I heard them say they were going to break the house open; this was about eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who said that - A.

             and all of them three said it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Then you went to a magistrate and put a stop to all this - A. No, I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to the office - A. Last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Not till you were in custody, to save yourself you turned informer, is that so - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is no doubt about that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Jones. There is a bag - I want to know whether you know that bag - look at it - A. This is my bag; it has been in my house two years, till it was taken out this last time; I am quite sure it was in my house, and secure on the night the house was broken open; it is tied together; it is a sailor's knot; my nephew left it behind him. This apron I can safely take an oath is my own; I have had it a twelvemonth or hardly that, it was in my house at that time. The time piece is mine, I had it about three months, my sister wiped it one day and wiped a bit of the colouring off the front; and the rule I am certain is mine, I know it by the joint being broken off, they took the long piece, and left the short piece behind, I am quite sure it is mine; the two penny piece was in the tin box, but I have no mark on it; the money was put away to be paid to different creditors on Monday; the five shilling papers is one new halfpenny and one old; and the penny pieces are put up in five penny pieces, and two old halfpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Dean, and live at No. 12, Turk's Head Yard, Clerkenwell. The deceased, Sophia Dean, was my hus<lb></lb>band's mother; she was about 50 years old; she lived at No. 10, Frying<lb></lb>pan Alley, Clerkenwell, with the prisoner, as his wife—on Tuesday, 24th Feb., she came to me about half past 1 o'clock in the morning—she had a blow on the side of the head, and was bleeding; it seemed as if it had been fresh done—I went with her to St. Bartholomew's Hospital; the doctor there saw her—I then took her home to Frying-pan Alley, and saw her next morning—she said that her head felt easier—I recommended her to go into the hospital on the following Friday—when she complained of her head, she said that it throbbed and <hi rend="italic">shooted</hi>—she had no other wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house surgeons of St. Bartho<lb></lb>lomew's Hospital. I saw the deceased on Tuesday morning, between 1 and 2 o'clock, when she was brought to the hospital—she had a wound on the upper part of the head, on the scalp, about three quarters of an inch long; it was not bleeding then—it appeared to be recent—I dressed it, and she left—I saw her again on the following Friday week; she then had erysipelas—she came again on the Saturday, and then became an in-patient; the erysipelas was rather worse than the day before—she died on the Monday night or Tuesday morning—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I was present, but did not make it—the erysipelas was the cause of death—ery<lb></lb>sipelas frequently follows wounds on the head—she had it somewhat severely, and it followed the wound—in my judgment it was caused by the wound on the head, from its being confined to the head and face, and from it so fre<lb></lb>quently following a wound on the head—a blunt instrument would have inflicted such a wound; it is possible that a person's knuckles may have done it, but only barely possible I think—I found nothing to cause the erysipelas but the wound on the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that in your judgment the erysipelas was superin<lb></lb>duced by the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so—I am as certain of it as I can be, from only seeing the patient some ten days after the wound—I would not say so certainly; I have formed a confident opinion upon it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house surgeons of St. Bartholo<lb></lb>mew's Hospital. I did not see the deceased until she came on the Friday, ten days after she first came to the hospital—she was then suffering from severe erysipelas of the head and face—she came into the hospital on the next day, Saturday, and into the ward over which I have the supervision; I examined her head, I found a small scalp wound, about three quarters of an inch in length, situated nearly on the top of the head—she died on the Tuesday morning, about half past 1 o'clock—I made an examination of the body after death—in my judgment the erysipelas was the cause of death—I believe the wound was the exciting cause of that erysipelas—I found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060085"></xptr>
               <p>nothing else to account for it; the other organs were tolerably healthy—I think it is not at all probable that a man's knuckles would produce such a wound; I think it must have been some blunt heavy instrument—judging from its situation, I should say it was not produced by a fall—I will not say a man's knuckles may not have caused it, it is possible, but not at all probable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it have arisen from natural causes, independent of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the wound was the exciting cause; there might be a tendency to erysipelas—it is quite possible that the erysipelas might have been there without any wound, erysipelas more frequently attacks the head and face, even without any wound, but in my judgment the wound was the exciting cause, because it appeared principally to affect the very neighbour<lb></lb>hood of the wound—it was more powerful there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Coroner of London. I was present at the inquiry into the cause of the death, of the deceased—the prisoner was there, and made a voluntary statement—before he made it the Coroner duly cautioned him, that whatever he said might be brought forward in evidence against him—this is in the Coroner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; "I came home on the Monday night, last Monday fortnight, and when I got into the house my mistress, who was the deceased, was tipsy; by that means she began upon me before I hardly got in doors; the very answer I made to her was, 'You begin upon me directly I come home;' by that means she called me bad names, and told me to go to my wh—s; she did strike me, and I struck her; I have got the mark by the side of my ear now; I did not strike her with the stick, only with my fist; by that means I walked out of the place and got tipsy, and my son was abed, and I went to bed too; about 1 o'clock, or a little after, her forehead broke out bleeding, and I persuaded her to go to her daughter, to go with her to the hospital, and I had a hard matter to get her to go and do it.")</p>

I am the medical officer of Clerkenwell parish, and have been so for fifteen years; during the greater part of that time I have attended the deceased, for a variety of maladies; among those, <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>; that is a disorder brought on by drinking ardent spirits to excess—I have also attended her once or twice for erysipelas of the face, and once of the arm; she was besides a very unhealthy person, subject to cough, bronchitis, and of such a constitution, in my judgment, that any slight circumstance might produce illness tending to shorten her life; I have so cautioned her over and over again very often—I trust it is not improper to add that I volunteer this statement.</p>

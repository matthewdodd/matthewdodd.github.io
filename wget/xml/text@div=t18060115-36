               <p>Q. Your wife then in fact found them? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - A. Four months. I had a good charactor with her, I frequently went out of the house, I cannot say I ever missed any thing during the time that she lived with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor? - A. No, I do not know that she was given to liquor, nor can I account how she unfortunately acted in that kind of way.</p>

               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Were these sheets from her own bed? - A. No, she must have taken them out of the clothes cupboard, where the dirty clothes were.</p>

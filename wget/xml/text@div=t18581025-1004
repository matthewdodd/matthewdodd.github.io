                  </hi>. I live at Burling-street, Blackheath-hill, and let out horses—on 9th September I turned a chestnut cob out to grass, about 7 o'clock in the evening—the following rooming about 6 o'clock it was missing—the other horses were there, but that was gone—I saw it again on 24th September—it was shown to me at a public-house called the Post-boys—I have had it returned to me—I know the prisoner; he was employed in my neighbourhood—he never had any authority to take my horses.</p>

               <p>12th September, I was on duty at the Horse-and-Groom—the landlord pointed out a cob there in a stable—I went to the prisoner, and saw him on the turnpike-road—he walked into a wood, and I went after him—I said to him—"Have you got a horse at the Groom?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "I believe you have stolen that horse"—he said, "I bought the horse, and paid for it"—he said, "I have got two carts and a donkey besides"—Mr. Perren came and owned the horse, and I gave it up to him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I have but a very little to say. I am quite aware that it is a very capital offence, but at the same time I am perfectly innocent of stealing the horse. I had been <hi rend="italic">hopping</hi>; I came up to Wrotham; I saw a horse feeding, and I got in conversation with the man that was with it. I sat down, as I was tired, and he told me that he had come to Wrotham to make a sale of his horse. I said, "Who do you propose to sell the horse to?" and he said, "Any one that would give money enough for him." I asked him at the same time for a bit of tobacco; he said he had none, but he would treat me to a pint of beer if I would go with him. I dare say there were a thousand people on the road going hopping. We had three pints of beer, and while we were having it the pony; it was only a pony, turned round and went up the hill, and got put in pound. The man requested me to go and inquire how much the money would be to release it; I went and asked. I said I was authorised to see if the pony was in pound; the stable<lb></lb>man said there was one, and he should have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before he let it go. I went back to Wrotham, and told the man what the ostler said: I stopped in the town till he requested me to go a second time about the horse. I did not altogether like the job: I said, "Why do you not go yourself?" he said, "I have been walking a great deal and don't feel altogether very well; you can tell him my name; my name is George Simmons." I went a second time, and told the ostler just what I had been told to say, and that the man had not got the money to release it out of pound. After that I left the man at Wrotham and went about my own business; I went hopping. About a fortnight afterwards I went back to Wrotham; I knew nothing about the horse then: the policeman came to me and said he should take me on suspicion of having stolen the horse. I am positive I never saw the horse before in my life till I saw it at Wrotham. I have no more to say; I can assure you I am perfectly innocent of stealing the horse; had I known it was Mr. Perren's horse, I would have got it detained myself.</p>

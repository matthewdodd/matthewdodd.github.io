It appeared by the Evidence, That there was a great Insurrection of the Mob on the 9th of April last, that they broke into Tooley's House, and burnt and destroyed his Goods, and released his Prisoners, amongst which was the deceased Arnold, who was famished, and so feeble and weak that he could hardly go. The Overseers of the Poor took care of him, and sent him to a Nurse, where he soon after died. One of Tooley's Neighbours declared, That he had heard most doleful Cries in Tooly's House in the Night, and that he saw a poor Wretch who had the Small-pox that run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16950703004"></xptr>through his Cloaths, that they stuck to his Back like a Searcloath, and as black in the Face as Leather. Another declared, That he had been kept in Tooley's House, and that he was allowed no more then a little Porringer of Drink, and a piece of Bread for a Day and a Night, and that almost every day two or three died, and that there had been 300 Men at one time in his House; that he had trepand Men, and sold them. The Prisoner, Tooley, called abundance of Witnesses, who said, That the Prisoners that were in his House had very good usage, that the Bread that he sold them was full size; that each Man had a Penny-loaf, and a penny worth of Cheese for his Breakfast; that they had a Mess of Broath for Dinner, with a Penny-loaf, a pint of Beer, and a quarter of a pound of good Beef; and that the Sick men were very carefully looked after; and if their Stomacks were so weak that they could not eat Meat, they had made them Water-Gruel, Mace-Ale, Thick Milk, Sugar-Sops, Candles, and such like, which was proved by a great many Witnesses.

            . I am Caple's daughter. I was sitting in the room with a young man; the prisoner opened the room door; I followed her down stairs, and asked where she came from - she said, from up stairs. I let her out, but seeing the quilt hanging from under her gown, I went and took it from her, and the young man helped me to secure her; she said it was her own.</p>

Not knowing the way down, I opened another door, and this young lady came out.</p>

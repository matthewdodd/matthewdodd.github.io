            Certainly I could see that the moment it was laid down; I took it in my hand, and told him I should keep that half-guinea and secure him; I desired my wife to send my servant out to get assistance; another man had come into the shop just at the time that I had given the prisoner the good half-guinea back, and asked for a quartern of soap; I went to cut it, and he desired me to serve the other gentleman first, meaning the prisoner; I told him I could serve him in a minute; I cut him a quartern of soap, and took his money; they were both in the shop at the time the prisoner offered the bad half-guinea; I went round the counter to lay hold of the prisoner, and they both went out of the shop; I followed them into the street, and took the prisoner by the collar with my left-hand, and called for assistance; it was some time before any body made their appearance; a third person came up in the street, of the name of Fowles, who was discharged, and the man that was in the shop called me all the thieves and bad expressions he could use; Fowles doubled his fist at me, and threatened me; the man that had the soap, brandished-a-stick over me, and as soon as they saw some neighbours coming to my assistance, they made a grand pull, and got him away from me; the prisoner ran up West Harding-street; I went after him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken; he ran nearly as far as Fetter-lane; Mr. March was upon the spot, and I delivered-him to him.</p>

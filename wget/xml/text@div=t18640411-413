                  </hi>. I am an outfitter of 84, Minories, on 29th March about twenty minutes to 6 in the evening, I saw a van passing by—a man not in custody, went to the tail of the van, and took a chest of tea off—I saw the prisoner following him very closely—I followed with my brother—they vent together to the Circus, but I was not near enough to hear their conver<lb></lb>sation—they went into Andover-passage and changed their hats, and changed with the chest of tea—the prisoner looked at me very hard, and said, "Does this chest of tea belong to you?"—I said, "No; but I know who it does belong to," and put my hand on his shoulder—he tried to throw my brother over his back, and then said that a man had offered him sixpence to carry the tea—I said, "It does not look like it"—he said, "It is no interest of yours to detain me"—I gave him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, of 84, Minories—on 29th March, about a quarter to 6, I was at our door, and saw a van going slowly by—two men were behind it; the prisoner was one, and the one not in custody took the chest of tea—I noticed the prisoner by his coat—it was the same as he has now—they walked up the Circus with the tea—we followed, and my brother said, "Where are you going with that tea?"—he said, "Is it yours?"—my brother said, "No, but I know who it belongs to"—the prisoner dropped it, and tried to make off, but we both caught hold of him—he said, "Do let me go; it will be no interest to you to lock me up"—I said, David, hold him tight"—the prisoner said, "David, do let me go"—we gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then the prisoner was not the first man to speak when you came up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, my brother was, he said, "Where are you going with that chest of tea?"—my brother spoke rather excited, and the prisoner threw the chest down and tried to run away—he would have gone if we had let him—the other man made off another way—there was about three yards between them when they were behind the van—we did not stop the van.</p>

               <p>on Saturday, August 18th, I was in the "Duke of Sussex" public-house, in Royal Mint Street, with a friend—the prisoner was there—I had some words with him, and he said, "If you will come out I will fight you"—we went out—he struck me on the arm, and I struck him on the side of the head and knocked him down, and when he was down he got hold of my leg and stuck me in the calf of the leg—I did not see anything in his hand—I sang out he was cutting the leg off me—there were five wounds on my leg—some one got hold of the prisoner and held him—I was taken home and the doctor attended me.</p>

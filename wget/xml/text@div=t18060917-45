               <p>Q. Should you know the gentleman again who gave you the money. - A. Yes, after I got the money I went to the corner of Nicholas-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him there. - A. No, I went to Clement's-lane where I had been before, and he was not there; then I went to the banking house door, he came up to me and said walk on, I went as far as Ball-alley.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember giving a draft to the prisoner. - A. Yes, he is foreman to a bootmaker of the name of Waylett; he came to me on Thursday the 28th of August, and told me his master would thank me if I would pay the account, it was only four pounds, I gave him a draft on Barclay's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You sometime afterwards had a suspicion of a forged draft. - A. I had, in consequence of that I did my endeavour in finding out the man; by the description the boy gave me I had a suspicion of the prisoner; I took the boy and desired he would go into Mr. Waylett's shop, and see if he saw the man in the shop that gave him the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were there any persons in the shop. - A. There were several.</p>
               <p>Q. That was about two or three o'clock. - A. Thereabouts; the boy came out and said the man was not there, I went into the shop, he was not there; at ten o'clock Mr. Waylett sent up to me, to let me know the prisoner was come home; I then went down with an officer and the boy, I directed the boy if he saw the prisoner to pull my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened the door. - A. The prisoner; the boy pulled my coat, I then asked the boy if that was the man, he said it was; I desired the officer to take him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When you desired him to take him in custody did you tell him what it was for. - A. No, his master was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time before the master came in tell him what he was apprehended for. - A. No, nor to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Waylett came in what passed. - A. The prisoner said he was charged with forgery; he was secured, and taken to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand writing (the draft handed to witness), - A. It is not.</p>

I kept my eye upon them. They went from the Pater-noster-row to Newgate-street, and back again. They met this little boy, named Wright; one of them, seemingly out of kindness, took him by the hand to lead him, to shew him the fire, while the rest of the gang picked his pocket, just at the end of <placeName id="t17700117-25-crimeloc163">Pater-noster-row</placeName>

Trigg pushed Harris on to take the handkerchief; he took it out: as soon as that was done, he that had the lad by the hand, ran away. Harris turned about and delivered the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170019"></xptr> handkerchief to Trigg; then I believe Trigg saw me, and I believe he knew me; he immediately gave it back again to Harris. Then I took hold of them both with my right hand, they were so close together, and I took the handkerchief from Harris. and carried them to Guild-hall, before Alderman Trecothick. I think Harris said he was but eleven years of age. I found four handkerchiefs upon him.</p>

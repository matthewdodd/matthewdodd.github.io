On the evening of the 10th of September, I had gone out about six o'clock, and returned about half-past twelve. I saw the servant fasten the street door after letting me in. I went immediately to bed, and heard her go to bed, and shut the door; there are two bolts, a chain, and catch-latch to the door - I cannot say whether it was locked. I had been in bed a very short time, when I heard a noise resembling the shutting of my street door; I sat up, listened, and not hearing any more, took no further notice, and went to sleep. About seven o'clock in the morning, the servant awoke me - in consequence of what she said, I went down stairs and found the street door on the latch, without any other fastening, and the kitchen window wide open; there is a small area in front of each window, and one of the gratings had been worn away, and broke off the end, for about a month, but I did not conceive the opening large enough to admit a man through. I missed three copper kettles, a coal skuttle, and a plated gravy spoon. About ten o'clock the officer called on me, and I accompanied him to Bow-street, and found my property, and the prisoner in custody; there was no violence done to the door, it must have been opened inside. I had not noticed the kitchen window on the night before - the opening between the bars and the wall, is ten or twelve inche wide one way, and about two feet the other.</p>

            . I am servant to the last witness. I let him in about one o'clock on the night of the 10th of September, and went to bed five minutes after. I bolted the door and chained it - I did not turn the key. I left the kitchen window shut and perfectly safe - the sash was closed, there was no fastening to the sash. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120013"></xptr>the last who went to bed. I heard a noise about ten minutes after I got to bed, but thought it was something in the street. I got up first, about seven o'clock in the morning; I found the drawers open, and missed a plated spoon, the window sash was thrown up, and the curtain drawn aside, part of the brick-work by the railing was broken down - it was not so the night before, it appeared to be done by the man's foot - there was brick dust about. I missed the scuttle and tea-kettles, which were in the house the night before. I went to the watch-house the next morning and found them.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was returning from St. Giles's a little past one o'clock last Tuesday morning, the 10th of September, and met the prisoner within a door or two of the Blue Boar Inn, Holborn, nearly opposite Red Lion-street, with three copper tea-kettles in one hand, and a coal scuttle in the other. I asked what he had there; he said, his own property. I said I was an officer, and must know where he brought it from; he said, from his own place, Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane, and was going to take it to his brother, as he expected to be seized on in the morning. I said it was an unseasonable hour, and he must go to the watch-house to satisfy me. In going along, he begged me to let him go, I refused, and took him to the watch-house in Eagle-street, and found the gravy-spoon in his left breast pocket. I asked his name and residence; he said he lived where he could. In the morning I told him I had found the owner out; he said, he might as well tell the truth, and that he got them from a house in Brownlow-street, that he got through the broken railing, and came out at the street door.</p>

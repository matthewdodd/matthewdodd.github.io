                  </hi>. I carry on a farm, at Ashford, in Middlesex. The prisoner came to me on 19th March, about 10 o'clock in the morning—he asked me if I would sell him some sheep and some skins—I showed him some sheep—I asked him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for three sheep and two skins, which he had seen and examined—I at last came down to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and, after a good deal of talking, he said that he would have them—I asked him when he could come for them—he said that he could not be there before half past 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I said that I would meet him at that time—I said, "You must bring the money for them, and I will go up to the field, and deliver them to you myself"—he said, "Yes," and that he would be certain to do that—I said, "Or else you won't have them"—he left; I went out, and on my return home, I found that the sheep and the skins had been taken away—after that the prisoner was taken.</p>

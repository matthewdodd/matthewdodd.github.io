             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was an apprentice at that time to Mr. Wilford. On the 14th of July, about six in the evening, I left the shop for a few minutes to seek for the errand-boy. There are two doors to the shop. When I came back to the glass door, I saw the other door open. I saw through the window somebody in the parlour that I did not know. I opened the door and went in, and saw the prisoner come out of the parlour. I saw one hat. I asked him some questions. I turned him about, and saw the other hat, and the shoes. I called the maid and Mr. Wilford, and secured the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I was called down to secure the prisoner; he then confessed the fact, and desired we would let him go to sea.</p>

               <p>I went to the shop for a halfpennyworth of Turner's-cerate; seeing the hats on the ground, I took them up, and put them on the counter.</p>

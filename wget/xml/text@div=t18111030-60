               <p>Q. When was it this happened - A. On Sunday evening, the <rs id="t18111030-60-cd327" type="crimeDate">22d of September</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18111030-60-off326 t18111030-60-cd327"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that evening - A. At Mr. Paris's the Bee Hive public-house in Nightingale-lane; I came out of the house about a quarter after ten o'clock, I was waiting for some person to go to bed with me at my lodging; I waited outside of the door, an English sailor came down Nightingale-lane, he asked me the way to Plough-court, I directed him; I saw him go as far as Redcross-street, and just as he got to the corner there came the prisoner and three other Portugueze, and Rosella Plunkett, I had seen her before. They came up as far as the Bee Hive door, some words occurred between them and the English sailor; the prisoner wanted to go back to the English sailor; Rosella Plunket appeared to be endeavouring to hold him; the other men had passed me; the prisoner said, d - n your eyes, you English b - r, I ll kick you to hell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that said to by the prisoner - A. To this man that asked me the direction; he was standing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300038"></xptr>still at <placeName id="t18111030-60-crimeloc328">Redcross-street</placeName>

When the sailor heard them words he walked up to the prisoner; the prisoner then went out in the middle of the road, as to what words passed between them I cannot say. The deceased came towards the English sailor and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the deceased before - A. No. The deceased got in between them, and Rosella Plunket sung out, oh, Manuel, do not now; she repeated it, and before she could say it the third time the deceased came to me, and put his hand on my left shoulder, and said, I am stabbed. I put my hand to his left side, my hand was all over blood. I unbottoned his trowsers, and he walked with me as well as he could to Mr. Paris's bar at the Bee Hive.</p>
               <p>Q. When you unbuttoned the waistband of his trowsers did you perceive any thing - A. Yes, it was just at the hip bone. When we came into the Bee Hive the deceased called for a glass of spirits; Mr. Paris said, you have got plenty of spirits running away from you, you do not want any. The deceased remained in the house, we went for a doctor, but could not get one. Some more of us joined together and took him up to a doctor's in East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him - A. Yes, and then I took a watchman with me and went to Mr. Bolingbroke's public-house, the prisoner was there and Rosella, I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself saw no blow whatever made, did you - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear the deceased's name - A. I did. On the Wednesday I went in the hospital, I saw him, he was then dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long was it after that you went to Bolingbroke's and caused the prisoner to be taken up - A. About twenty minutes or half an hour. I had been to the doctor's first.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in the public-house smoking his pipe - A. No, he was standing at the bar, and Rosella was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this - A. Rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the deceased at the time that you supposed he received the mischief - A. I have paced it since with eighteen long steps.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you say there was the prisoner, the deceased, the English sailor, Rosella, and the other men close to him - A. Yes, about as far from him as I am to you.</p>
               <p>Q. These three men, were they close together or parted - A. A little distance from each other, and Rosella close to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. You went for a doctor, you could not find one, and when you came back you found in the house the English sailor that you have been speaking of - A. Yes, he went with me and the deceased to the doctor's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got him to the doctor's shop you found he was very bad indeed - A. Yes, and then we thought it was best to take him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which the English sailor went away, saying, he would fetch a coach to take him to the hospital, and he never brought any coach, or ever come back again - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen either of these three Portuguese since - A. I have seen one, but at that time these three men went away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JONES. I am a seaman. I was coming up Nightingale-lane about a quarter past ten, I heard a woman say, oh, Manuel, do not do that; Walker was with me; we made the best of our way up to where the noise was; I saw a man running towards the Bee Hive door, he came out of the road, he said, I am stabbed; we took him into the Bee Hive, Tandy was there at the time. We assisted him when he said he was stabbed; he put his hand upon the bar and asked for a glass of spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came running out of the road you saw some other people there at the time - A. Yes, four or five where he run from, who they were I cannot say.</p>
               <p>- WALKER. I am a seaman, I was with Jones in Nightingale-lane, I heard a woman's voice say, Manuel, do not do that. Afterwards I heard a man sing out, I am stabbed; he came from out of the road, and where the man came from there were four or five in company, who they were I cannot say. The man told me his name was

             came to me at a quarter past ten, and told me that there was a man stabbed; I went with him and took charge of the prisoner, and brought him to the watchhouse. The next morning at half past three I picked up this knife by Nightingale-lane, about twenty yards from the Bee Hive.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLSON. I am a surgeon in East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home on the night of this Sunday did you find the deceased laying in your shop - A. Yes, about eleven o'clock. Upon examining him I found a wound upon the left hip, which I dressed; there was a considerable quantity of blood on the floor, his clothes was likewise wet with blood; I found him to be very low and very fast declining; I ordered him to be sent to the hospital, he said his name was Douglas, he was a Scotchman; I asked him if he should know the person that had stabbed him if he saw him. He gave me no account of the person.</p>

               <p>Q. About what time of the night was it when the deceased was brought to the hospital - A. Near twelve o'clock. I observed a wound upon the left hip, there was no hemorrhage at that time, though there appeared to have been some, from the appearance of his shirt. I dressed the wound and ordered him to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300039"></xptr>put to bed; the next day his body was examined; he died between one and two on Monday morning; there was a wound on the hip, it passed from the hip into the cavity of the belly; the wound divided two large arteries, it wounded one intestine, and part of another, the wound was three or four inches or more in depth, it appeared to be a penetrating wound, it appeared to have been done with a stab, it did not appear to have been done with a triangular instrument. There is no doubt the man died with the stab.</p>

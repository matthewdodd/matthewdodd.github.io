On the 29th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop and asked to look at a gold-chain which hung in the window, and was marked ten guineas; I shewed it to him and gave it into his hands; he asked me if I would warrant it being gold, and took the ticket off. I concluded he was going to buy it, and asked him if I should put it in paper, he said no, it was of no consequence. He put his hand into his pocket and took out a piece of paper, and put the chain in it, and put it into his right hand coat pocket. After searching his different pockets he pulled out a small box which contained only sixteen shillings; he hesitated, and said he had forgot his money and must leave it and call again. He put his hand into his pocket and returned me a parcel about the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170010"></xptr>size as that the chain was wrapped, in a piece of paper of the same appearance exactly; he put it on the counter; I took the parcel up, he seeing me going to open it said I have made a mistake-it contained some plated pieces of chain; he then returned me the real one. I told him I must send for an officer. He ran out of the shop, I pursued, took him on Holborn-hill, and gave him in charge. He did not say he had made a mistake until I opened the first parcel.</p>

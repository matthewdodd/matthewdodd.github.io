               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. An inspector of the watch. This was in East-street I believe, I am not sure - I will not swear at all; he took me to a street, I believe it was East-street - I do not know much of him, only by seeing him about for a year and a half; I was within a yard of him when he took them; I rather believe he saw me - he might know I was inspector of the watch, or he might have forgotten it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you not stop him when he was taking them? A. I did not know but he might have bought them - I knew he was a dealer.</p>

            . My mother's name is Mary. This witness came to me on the Saturday, and asked if I had sold a sack of beans, and described the man: I had sold four sacks that morning, but none to him - I looked, and missed a sack: I saw the prisoner afterwards in the watch-house - the sack is Mr. Lambert's; the beans were my mother's - we are salesmen; they were lying opposite my mother's place - I cannot swear that this is the sack, but I missed one like it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mr. Lambert here? A. No; the prisoner has bought things of me - I may have lent him sacks, but it must have been at least a fortnight before; we always send for the sacks the same evening the things are sold, except on Saturdays - we sometimes have wrong directions for them; I cannot say that I had not lent the prisoner half a dozen sacks of Mr. Lambert's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would three prickles fill a sack? A. No<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100018"></xptr>- a sack holds thirteen or fourteen peeks; three prickles are ten pecks and a half.</p>

            . Simmons described the prisoner to me; I found him at the end of Lamb-street - I asked him what be had done with the beans: he said he had not had any - I took him to Simmons, and than he said he had had some beans, but he bought them of a cart in West-street; I had been up from four o'clock, and am certain there had been no such cart - he said he had bought three prickles; I found this sack on a truck, which they said was his-it was full of beans; he assisted in taking the truck to the watch house - there were other things in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What else was in the truck? A. A sack of peas, three half-sieves of currants, onions, and other things; there was no name on the truck, but he said it was his-he showed us where he bought the other things; West-street was in a very crowded state, and that convinced me that the cart he described had not been there; there were three fruit carts which were drawn on the pavement, at half-past three o'clock, and they were there when we went to see it; I am sure that there could not have been the cart he described.</p>

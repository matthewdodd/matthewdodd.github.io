                  </hi>. I keep the Caledonian Arms public-house, New Chalk-road, Holloway. On the 30th of June I met the prisoner, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, in Whitfield-street, in company with-an other female—she asked me to accompany her home, and I went to No. 20, Southampton-street—after stopping there some time, she wished me to go to bed—I was tired, and did—I pulled off my clothes—I had money in all my pockets—I had seven sovereigns and a half, some silver, and some halfpence—I was quite sober—I awoke at six o'clock in the morning, and the prisoner was gone—she had not intimated that she was going—I exa<lb></lb>mined my waistcoat and trowsers pockets, and missed all my money ex<lb></lb>cept some halfpence—my watch was on the table-M'Hale, the officer, came in, and I told him of my loss—I am certain I felt my money safe when I pulled off my clothes—I saw the prisoner in the station-house on Monday, and am certain she is the woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I met him in Seymour-place, Somers-town, stupidly drunk, without any coat on, and all over mud—he said if I would let him go with me he would give me a compliment—I said "No, you are not sober"—he followed me-at last we got home and went to bed, and I asked him to be so kind as to be up to his word—he said, "I have no money about me</p>

               <p>now, but I will see you another time"—I said, "Then you had better go away"—he said "No"—I said, "If you don't I will get an officer, I can't stop longer in your company, as I must get my living"—I went out and came back—he made an uproar that he had lost his money, the policeman came to me, and I said, "If he thinks I have his money, here am I." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I had no conversation with her about paying her any com<lb></lb>pliment—she did not wish me to go away, nor did she say she would go herself—I am married—there was no other young woman in my com<lb></lb>pany—I told the Magistrate I had from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was going up stairs in this house, and saw the prosecutor standing at the door of the room occu<lb></lb>pied by the prisoner—he asked me to come in—I lodged in the same house as the prisoner at that time—I had been out all night, and came in between six and seven o'clock—he made a complaint to me—I called the landlady up, and told her—I saw the prisoner there once afterwards, and told her she was accused of robbery—she denied it—she was searched at the sta<lb></lb>tion-house on Monday morning, the 2nd of July, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found on her—this happened on Saturday morning—the prosecutor was dressed in a short working jacket and trowsers, as a working man would be—the pri<lb></lb>soner had lodged in the house about a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Martin Daley, and rent the house, No. 20, Southampton-street, Euston-square. The prisoner occupied the second floor room for a fortnight, and had a latch-key to let herself in and out—on the morning in question I was called out of my own room, and found the prosecutor up-stairs, and the prisoner was gone—she came in between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and I said, "Go out of my place, you have quite deceived me, you have robbed a man in my place, last night"—she made no reply, but turned, and looked at me—she after<lb></lb>wards called for a few things which I was washing for her, and I accused her again—she said she was innocent—she did not sleep at my house after it happened—she told me she was a married woman—she was quiet and sober while she was with me—I never saw a man with her—I have a married woman a lodger in the house, and three or four single men—they are working-men.</p>

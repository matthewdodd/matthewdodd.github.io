            . Q. Do you recollect the time you lost a bandbox. - A. Yes; I came from Oakenham in Berkshire on the 22nd of January, in Mr. Straker's waggon. I had my bandbox with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you missed the box. - A. About half past seven; I went to the <placeName id="t18080217-70-crimeloc410">Bell at Bedfont</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on any part of your journey. - A. The waggoner took the prisoner up at Staines, before we came to Bedfont. At Bedfont we got out of the waggon and went to a private house; he took his bundle and went to the Bell, and I walked with him: I left my band box in the waggon; I staid at the Bell till the waggon called for me; he told me that he should wait till the waggon came; he went out with a lighted pipe in his mouth and left his bundle at the Bell; I had a suspicion that he was gone for my bundle; he came in again a little before eight o'clock, he brought in nothing with him; offered to lend me a coat to wrap up myself in the waggon; he took his bundle and went off; the waggon called at nine o'clock; they went after him and took him on suspicion of stealing my box.</p>
               <p>TAOMAS ATKINS. I am the waggoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect stopping at a private house at Bedfont. - A. Yes; the prisoner and the woman got out of the waggon at Bedfont at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards follow the prisoner and take him. - A. Yes; we took him about a hundred yards from the Bell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see him do. - A. He stopped; we went to him and asked him about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the box any where did you. - A. No. He said he had not seen the box; I took him back to the public house; Taylor went back and found the box just by where the man stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the box in the waggon when the woman got out. - A. Yes; I covered it with a bit of straw.</p>

            . Q. Do you live at Bedfont. - A. I live at a private house, where the waggon stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear any alarm about the box being lost. - A. I was going to the Bell to get a pint of beer for my supper; I met the prisoner coming from the Bell towards the waggon; I said, good night, sir; the Bell is nearer London than where the waggon stopped, at out three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go to the waggon. - A. No; I went to the public house, and stopping there a little bit, I heard that this box was lost out of the waggon; I set off after the man, towards Hounslow expecting this was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark. - A. Dark, he kept right on the road for Hounslow till we stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he got before you stopped him. A About a hundred yards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any box. - A. No; I went up to him, I asked him whether he had not seen any box that had been taken out of the waggon; he said no; I told him we suspected he had, he must go along with us back to the public house; we took him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the box any where. - A. Yes; we found the box fifteen or twenty yards from the place we took the man from; close to the road upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason for charging the prison with taking the box. - A. I know nothing no farther than all suspicion; he owned nothing, nor nothing we could swear to, in regard of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here who saw him with the box. - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. - It is unnecessary to go farther there was a ground for suspicion; nobody saw him near the waggon nor with the box; it is a case of suspicion, but the people were too hasty in taking him up; they should have waited till he took the box up.</p>

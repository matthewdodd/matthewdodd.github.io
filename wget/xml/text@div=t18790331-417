There they stood me beside four mem I was the only man who had a hard felt hat on and a long coat, so the policeman had nothing to do but say 'That's him.' As for the woman saying I gave her the boots to pawn, I was sitting in the kitchen on Tuesday when a man came in and wanted to sell these boots. 1 asked him what he wanted; he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I tried them on to see if they'd fit me, and said, 'Go and pawn them for that money.' I then went into the kitchen to this woman, and said, 'Will you pawn these boots for this man?'

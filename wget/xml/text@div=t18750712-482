                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Thomas William Cook, of 8, Clifford Street, a tailor—I have been in his service nine and a half years—the prisoner was a fellow servant, he had been there about seven years—it has recently been my duty to pay the wages on Saturday to the persons working in the shop—it was the prisoner's duty to pay the outdoors wages—I was supplied with the coins necessary to pay both classes of wages—each outdoor worker has a small book in which is entered all the work done and delivered—the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of such books—the book is initialled by the cutter to show that the actual garment has been brought in made up—it was then the prisoner's duty to enter it in this wages book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is all the handwriting of the prisoner—this is the wages book for the outdoor people only—after the initial of the cutter was put to the workmen's book it would be delivered to the prisoner for him to copy into the wages book—it was his duty to bring the book to me and call out correctly from that, the amount to be paid to each person—on the 29th of, May he called out seventeen names and amounts to each one—as each, name was sailed I counted out the amount of money which he called in separate sums and handed them to him—I afterwards received a memorandum from him of the amount that he had expended, the supposed so-called outdoors wages—I have not got the memorandum for the 29th of May, it was torn in pieces and thrown into the waste-paper basket—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my. wages book;—that is Mr. Steven's handwriting—I go through it with him after he baa taken, the wages—the prisoner has nothing whatever to do with this book; it is. made up from 1 to 1.30 on the Saturday, the same day—I look at it between the time it comes up into the shop and the time it is made up, from 1 to 1.30—the foreman likewise goes through with me at the same time to see that everything is correct—that is not Stevens, but what we term the cutter—I can tell by reference to the cash-book what was paid for outdoor wages in that week—the cash-book is in my own handwriting—that is an entry made on the Saturday before we-leave; the entry is 114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that means both is and outdoor wages—the total paid for indoor is 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was given to the prisoner—I swear it—in his own book the total of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. appears made up of 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid outdoors and 571.8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid indoors—he enters mine correctly—amongst the names of the workpeople called to me on the 29th of May there were Kearney, Cham<lb></lb>bers, Wheeler, Dart, Murphy, and Beveridge—in Kearney's detail in the prisoner's handwriting I find the accountant has put a mark; I find an item there of 65. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the entry is "Schofield, W. F." (<hi rend="italic">the name of the customer</hi>), "Waistcoat, basted and bound, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—in the detail of Chambers in the prisoner's handwriting I find'" Swabey, F., trowsers, side pockets, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—in Wheeler's account the item marked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is for a footman's waistcoat—Dart, a dress waistcoat, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Murphy, a waistcoat, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Beveridge a pair of trowsers, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—passing to June 5th I find there the writing of the prisoner in his wages book—sixteen persons were paid out door work that week—the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on this ticket are the prisoner's figures—after he</p>

               <p>has called out all the separate sums that have been handed to him he gives that to me as the total—looking at my figures I am able to say I paid 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making a total of 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there may have been odd pence, but the fragment of paper does not show them—the amount altogether entered in my book is 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that would be in accordance with the ticket—in the prisoner's book the amount for outdoor for the 5th of June stands at 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is the amount according to him due at that time—I find in his book names and figures written over erasures in that week—he enters the amount I pay—he puts in 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as my amount—I have not referred to see if that is correct—looking at the details of the items for June 5th I see there is an item marked by the accountant "Wheeler, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "for a waistcoat—Kearney, waistcoat, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—George,—waistcoat, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Murphy, waistcoat, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Chambers, trowsers, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the person whose name is entered as "George," is a person of the name of Cook, but he takes the name of an old porter who was with us for many years—he always went by the name of George, and his daughter makes waistcoasts and she took the name of George—where ever the word George appears it means the daughter of our old porter George whose name is Cook—I say I gave to the prisoner 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and whatever the pence was, and not 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I knew on Saturday, the 12th of June, Mr. Stevens was pre<lb></lb>sent to listen to what was called out—the prisoner: was arrested on the Monday following—he was not taken into custody till the 14th—I remember the prisoner calling out "Morris, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; "-her wages appear as 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his book; I did not look at the time to see" what was the figure there—there is a leaf torn out on the Monday following—I will swear it was not missing on the Saturday and I swear that he called' out 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Morris—I paid the money—seventeen persons are entered for outdoor pay on that day, the 12th of June—after the calling had been gone through and the coins put down to correspond he gave me the ticket—that is his ticket and the amount he so received from. me—that is my writing, the date 12th June underneath—the amount is 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he has entered in his book 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as paid outdoor—the total amount of both classes of wages is 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I swear I gave him 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and not the lesser sum of 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I receive from my employers a cheque for the purpose of paying wages—the wages must be made up first; taken out in the rough—the indoor and outdoor wages books were in my possession for that purpose—the indoor wages book would be in the handwriting of Stevens, and the outdoor wages book in the handwriting of the prisoner—the paper on which the rough calculation of the wages is made is thrown on one side—the outdoor wages book is left with the prisoner, it is not taken from him—it is kept in the office where the prisoner is supposed to be—when' he calls out, say, Huuter 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I hand it to him—I should think it is not my duty to look over him to see if he calls cut correctly—the amount was supposed to correspond with the small book—I place drimplicit confidence in the prisoner—it was my duty to pay the money, without taking any account at the time of the names or the item or the total—the prisoner brought me his list of what it amounted to) I should—say from a quarter to half an hour afterwards—I did not compare the list with the amounts in the book—my check is the balance of my cash in the was after paying the wages—the total is not drawn down in the book when the rough approximation is made of the wages—the totals are there of each man's work, but not the total</p>

               <p>amount of the whole—I received the prisoner's statement of what I had paid him without any further would have nothing whatever to do with the payment of the indoor workmen—I have no personal memory of what I paid, but refreshing my memory from the book I can state it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My memory is clear with regard to the calling out of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Morris—there was no list made by the prisoner of the amount he received from me—after he got the money he gave me a little memo randum paper of the amount he so got—by that means I could balance my cash—I had no detailed list from him—I never used to draw for the eiact amount; it might be 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over—I only got a rough estimate of what I would require beforehand.</p>

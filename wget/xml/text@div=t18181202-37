On the 8th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I discharged him for getting drunk with my other men. I had no words with him. My men usually leave work at six o'clock in the evening. About an hour after the prisoner was discharged I saw my trees all standing and safe. I have three or four thousand fruit trees growing there for profit.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover anything wrong - A. Between eight and nine the next morning I went into the ground and found about fifty apple and pear trees cut down in one place; they were cut within a foot of the ground, apparently with a billhook.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any opinion whether they had been recently cut - A. They appeared to have been cut six or seven hours. Next day I found seventy more in another part of the garden, cut down in the same way. They all laid on the ground as they had fell, and were quite destroyed - they would not grow again. The trees were my own - I had planted most of them myself. I gave information, and had another man apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you plant any of those trees that were cut down - A. No, my brother did. I took the ground and bought the stock of him. All the property was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ARABIN. Q. The prisoner worked for you and your brother upwards of forty years - A. No. I believe he has been in the family twenty-five years. I turned him off for getting drunk two days before - he was not drunk at the time I turned him off.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not let a malicious and ill-disposed person be in his situation - A. Not if I had known it. He bore the character of a quiet man. My brother has no interest in the ground; I grow the trees to produce fruit, I do not sell the young trees.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they cut above the graft - A. Most of them were cut below the graft. They were from four to six feet high in the stem.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you particularly examine them, so as to able to swear whether they were cut above or below the graft - A. I will swear that forty of the apple trees were cut below the graft - I buy them ready grafted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the trees to see where they were grafted - A. These particular apple trees I had examined in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020024"></xptr>Q. If they were cut above the graft, would they not, in the course of time, break out and bear fruit - A. I cannot say; I doubt whether they would, as I have cut them above the graft, and they did not bear. If the trees bear fruit again, they will not be quite destroyed, certainly, but they will be destroyed for many years. Some trees will break out again and bear fruit, and some may not.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose they are cut below the graft, will not the plumb stalk, or whatever they are grafted in, break out - A. If they do not get the canker they would be more likely to break out than before. If they were grafted on wild stocks they will break out again and flourish.</p>
               <p>Q. These wild stocks growing up and flourishing, can be again grafted - A. Yes, if they shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. You can use those trees again which were cut down, as grafts - A. If they live I can.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is it your opinion that they will or will not shoot - A. I have no doubt but some of them will shoot, but I have great doubts whether they will all shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing they can be made productive, what time will it be before they can return you any profit - A. Five or six years - they produced profit before they were cut down. Some were cut below and some above the graft - part of them were the choicest apples; these were cut below the graft, as they were double grafted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you consider a fruit tree cut off below the graft, destroyed - A. The upper graft is quite destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of these cut below the first graft - A. I do not know, I am not confident; some of them have the stem of the graft, and some are wild.</p>
               <p>Q. If a tree is double grafted, and you cut the second graft and leave part of the first on the wild stock, will it not produce apples - A. Yes, if it should break out - some will break out, and some will not.</p>

Some were cut two feet from the ground, and some not above one. There were footmarks, as if somebody had got over the ditch - I do not know whether they were the marks of one or more persons.</p>

I went to his house, and found an old billhook there; I searched further, and found another, concealed behind some firewood, by the side of the fireplace. I found another very good one, concealed under the staircase, among some more firewood. That found by the fire-place, appeared as if it had been cutting green wood - it was soiled with the sap of wood; the other two were very good and sharp. I was going to get a conveyance to take him to town, he asked me where I was going to take him? I said, to Clerkenwell. He said it was a bad job. I said it was. He said I acknowledge I was in the grounds that night, and took some greens, but I did not know what I did.</p>

I found two billhooks, one was very good, it was concealed in the chimney corner, with a sack, and a great deal of wood, over it - it appeared as if it had some sap or moisture on it. I produce it. I went on the Monday following, and found another. Just before I left the prisoner at the watch-house in town, I said to him,</p>
               <p>"Why you have admitted taking the greens out of the garden?" as I had been informed, he had - I asked him if he knew anything about the trees, and said it was a sad thing. I said nothing more - I neither threatened or promised him, he said No. I said</p>

               <p>"You got out of such a gap into such a lane." He said Yes, he did. I asked him if he remembered his foot slipping? he, said No. I asked him if he had not spilt some greens in getting over? He said he had. He then said he was not distressed, that he had got a good bit of money at home, and if I would make it right with Mr. Knevett, I should have the money. I told him if he would give me 100 l. I would not take it. Next morning he repeated what he had said about the money, but denied having taken the greens out of the ground.</p>

            . I am a labourer. In October, last I was out of employ - I met the prisoner on the 8th, near the Star and Garter, at Brentford, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon. I knew he worked for the prosecutor - I asked if he could tell me of any work. He said he could not, for he was after a job himself, that he and his partner were both discharged from Mr. Knevett's, for getting drunk, and he would be d - d if he would not be revenged, for he did not mind cutting every bl - dy tree about the place - I made him no answer - this was in the street.</p>

               <p>MR. ARABIN contended on the prisoner's behalf, that there was not that actual destruction of the trees, as came within the meaning of the Act; for an actual destruction of root and branch was necessary. That the words</p>
               <p>"Shall cut down, or otherwise destroy;" meant that there must be an actual destruction of the thing itself.</p>

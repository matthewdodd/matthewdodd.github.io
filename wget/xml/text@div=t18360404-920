                  </hi>. I am a shopman to Thomas Benjamin Hassall, a comb and brush maker, of St. Paul's Church yard. On the 10th of March, I saw the prisoner in the shop about eight o'clock in the evening—he had a nest to chip boxes—he said he had got a very much set of chip-boxes, and told me to ask my master if he would have them—my master had a had foot at the time—he said he did not want to him—the prisoner opened the boxes and came to to the end of the counter when this dressing-case laid—there were a great many brusher on the counter—I felt rather confused—the prisoner laid the brown paper which his boxes were in, over the dressing case a the end of the counter—he wen out and I missed the dressing case before he passed the window—I called to my father and told him that he had stolen the dressing-case—I followed him, and took it out of his hand in the King's Head public house in Cannon alley—I followed him in there—he came back with me to the shop, and my master gave him into custody. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner been in the habit of calling at your master' s? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and sold him boxes occasionally—I know him well—he appeared to have some drinking, but he knew what he was about—when I brought him back, he said he took it by mistake and that he had left a parcel of his own at Mrs. Smith's, about the size of a dress<lb></lb>ing case—my master sent me there—the prisoner had been there, but had not left a parcel—my master did not say he did not wish to give him in charge, as it might have been a mistake—the policeman did not say he must give him in charge—his boxes were wrapped up in the same kind of paper; that his boxes were in was much larger than the case.</p>

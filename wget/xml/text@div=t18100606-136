            , I live at the sign of the French Horn, Beech-street. On the evening of the 4th of February the prisoner and another person came to my house together, I served them with six glasses of port wine, it came to three shillings; the prisoner put down a seven shilling piece and told me to take the reckoning; I rung the seven shilling piece and weighed it, it was a good one, I put it back in my till and was going to give change, the other person put down a five shilling piece and said he would pay for it; Dalton said, give me back my seven shilling piece again; I returned him the same seven shilling piece, I had no other in the house. The crown piece laid on the counter, he took it off and said he would not pay for it; then Dalton gave me a seven shilling piece back again; I thought it was the same, I throwed it back in the till, I did not ring or weigh it. I had no other seven shilling piece in the house. I gave them their change and they went away. In less than two minutes after they went out I suspected them; I weighted the seven shilling piece. I found it was not the same, it was a bad one; I called my servant Rachel, I told her I took a bad seven shilling piece of the men that were drinking at the bar; I put the seven shilling piece in a bit of paper, delivered it to her, and directed her to go out of the house; she came back in two or three minutes; in the course of two or three days Dalton came to my house again, he had a glass of part wine: I took this seven shilling piece out of the till. I asked him if he knew it, he gave it me on the Sunday night, it was a bad one; he said he did not knew where he took it, and if I would let have it he would give me another for it; he had not one about him then; I would not let him have it. In a few weeks after Mr. Pugh came to me, and I found the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you give the seven shilling piece that you received of the prisoner - A. To no one; it had not been out of my possession, only to my servant two or three minutes, except when the prisoner was in custody, I gave it to Mr. Pugh.</p>

            , she keeps a porkshop in Grub-street. On the 12th of February, between seven and eight in the evening the prisoner came in and asked for a German sausage, it came to seventeen pence; he gave me a seven shilling piece: I weighted it, it was a good one; I had not silver enough, I called to my mother to give me some; she came into the shop; he then said, you need not trouble yourself, I can pay you without; he gave me a shilling and three pennyworth of halfpence, he said that would not pay seventeen pence, he must still have change; I returned him the shilling; he threw another seven shilling piece on the counter, towards my mother; I had been served so before; I pushed the weights towards my mother; she took the seven shilling piece and the weight into the kitchen to weigh it; she said this is not a good one; he then said, Ma'am, I'll give you another; mother said, no, he should not give her another; he said she had no right to detain his money; she said she would detain the money and him too; he went into the kitchen and endeavoured to wrest it out of her hand; he did not succeed. My mother delivered the seven shilling piece to Mr. Hedger.</p>

            . Q. You are the mother of the last witness - A. Yes. I took the seven shilling piece off the counter and took it into the kitchen to weigh it; I weighed it and found it not worth a farthing; I holloaed out, now you have given me a had one; he said. I will change it; I said you shall not change it; he ran into the kitchen and used great violence to get the seven shilling piece from me; I told him it was of no use, he should not have it.

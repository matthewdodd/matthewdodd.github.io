               <p>Q.Had he ever worked with you? - No, I have let him do a job or two at the vice.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you lose your vice, and when? - I lost it out of my shop, between the 7th and 8th of April, it was locked up in my shop, and the padlock was taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your vice that night? - Yes, I had worked on it till seven o'clock; I don't know as to the square, I am sure as to the vice and burnisher.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner with it - News was brought me that he was taken, and I was told there was a vice found much like mine, and I went to the place with the constable; that was three weeks after I had been robbed; I said when I was before the justice that it was much about a fortnight, but it was three weeks.</p>

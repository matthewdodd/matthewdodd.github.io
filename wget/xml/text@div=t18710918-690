                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K R</hi> 22). About 12.40, pa the morning of 23rd August, I was on duty in the North Woolwich Road, and saw the prisoners there—I saw a telegraph pole which had been sawn down by the side of the railway wall—I saw the prisoners take hold of that pole, and pull it across the North Woolwich Road—the pole was about 25 or 30 feet long—they walked down the road, and I removed the pole back to where it was lying first—I then saw police constable Scott, and made a communi<lb></lb>cation to him—the prisoners came back again, and put the pole on the top of the wall—a man and woman came across the railway bridge, and the prisoners moved the pole back again—they placed the pole on the top of the wall again—Sampson jumped over the wall, and took hold of the this end of it, and Swanson shoved it further over the wall—Swanson was in the road—Sampson got over the wall again, and they ran into Swanson's house, which is almost opposite—I went with Scott to where the pole was—it was straight over the platform and across the line—it was on the plat<lb></lb>form, and about 3ft. above the line; it extended about 7ft. over the line—subsequently I went to Swanson's house—both the prisoners came to the door—I charged them with placing the pole across the road, and took Swanson into custody—Sampson ran through the back of the house, and male his escape—Swanson was sober—he said they only did it for a lark.</p>

About 12.45, on the morning of 23rd August, I was on duty in the North Woolwich Road—I saw a pole lying by the side of the railway wall—I saw the two prisoners take up the pole, and place it across the road—they went down the road—I went after them, and met the last witness, who had just removed the pole to the side of the wall again—we came back to the top of the road, and watched them—they came up the road again to where the pole was lying—they got it near the top of the wall, some persons were coming, and they put it down again, and sat on it—when the persons had passed they took the pole up again, and put it on the top of the wall—Sampson jumped other the wall, and took hold of the end, and Swanson had hold of the other end; and in that way they carried it forward, and left it in the position We found it—Sampson came over the wall again, and they went into the house—we went up, and found the pole was lying at right angles with the line, extending over it 7 ft.—the height of the platform is about 2ft. 6 in.—an engine coming past would hit it—it extended over one rail, and was about 6 in. short of the other—we went to Swanson's house—they both came to the door—Sampson ran out at the back—I took him the next day, near the Stratford Police Court—Swanson said he only did it for a lark; he did not think it would be so serious.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hampshire. I was in London on 23rd Dec.—I had in my possession a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I went into a pastry cook's shop in St. Martin's Court on that day, and had some trifling article—I had my 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and some silver in a little bag in my trousers' pocket—the prisoner was in the shop I went into—I had some article and paid for it—I took the money out of my bag—I had not to receive any change—I should think I was in the shop ten minutes—I stood to eat what I bought at the end of the counter—there were two gentlemen in front of the counter—I believe I was standing the whole time—I was standing when I paid for what I had—I did not pull my bag out—I passed my hand inside and got a sixpence out to pay for the refreshment I had, and in drawing my hand out, I presume I drew out the note—I did not miss it till the following day—I went to the shop immediately on discovering my loss—the prisoner was not in when I entered, but she came into the shop and was moving away from the establishment—I told her I had lost a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and my impression was that I must have dropped it there—she told me she knew nothing of the note, but she thought it probably was dropped on the wrong side of the counter, and somebody might have picked it up and taken it away, and she was very sorry for me—I followed her down to the cab that was waiting for her, and she gave me to understand she was going either to Lambeth or Westminster—I did not see her afterwards till she was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dakin and Co., tea dealers, St. Paul's Churchyard. I remember the prisoner coming to the shop on 28th Dec., she made some purchase which I think amounted to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she paid with a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this is the note she gave—it was about half past 6 o'clock in the evening—I wrote on the note "28, 12, 57"—she did not give any name—I had the address on it, but the address is torn off now—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person—I saw her afterwards when I was taken to Hampstead Road.</p>

I am a City officer—I had a communication about this note, and I endeavoured to trace it—in consequence of what I discovered, I went to the shop in St. Martin's Court—the prisoner had left—I found she was lodging in Frederick Street, Hampstead Road—I went there and took Marshall with me—the prisoner occupied the first floor—she came down, and I said, "Mrs. Pepino, I believe you remember a gentleman calling on you in St. Martin's Court, respecting a Bank of England note"—she said "Yes, I do; I have never seen that note; I gave directions to the servant to look sharp after the note when she swept the shop, but they have seen nothing of</p>

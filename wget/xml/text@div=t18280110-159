On Monday, the 7th of January, I had a bay gelding in my stable - I saw it safe between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and about half-past eleven that night I was informed it was missing; the prisoner is a labourer, and lives near me, in the same village; I have only been there three quarters of a year - he worked about there - the last work he did was for a neighbour, close by my premises. I saw my gelding again, and am certain of it - the prisoner was not in my employ.</p>

I am a plough-boy, and had the care of this bay gelding; I racked him up at seven o'clock in the evening of the 7th of January - I tied him to the manger with a halter, and shut the door - it shuts with a latch; the horse could not open it; the stable opens into a farm-yard, and the yard gate was shut that evening; I did not miss the gelding till six o'clock the next morning - I saw it again afterwards, and knew it to be the same; the halter was also taken - the prisoner lived near my master.</p>

            . I am a veterinary surgeon, and live at Uxbridge. On the morning of the 8th of January, at three o'clock, I was near the village of Cowley, with a friend; I had been to attend a sick horse. Cowley, I believe, is about nine mile from Hanworth, but I was never there - it is between Hanworth and Uxbridge. I saw the prisoner walking in the road - he passed by me; there was a gelding about forty yards from him - it was following him - he could see us before he came up to us, for twenty yards or more - the horse was following him; I took hold of the horse, overtook the prisoner, and asked if he knew any thing of the horse; he declared he had never seen it - there was no person whatever there but him. I asked where he was going: he said he was going home to Feltham (that is about a mile from Hanworth); he was going as if to Hanworth; I shewed the same horse to Twyford and his servants - they claimed it.</p>
               <p>MR. TWYFORD. The horse the witness showed me was mine, and the halter likewise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was never in the road - I was walking on the footpath.</p>

            .

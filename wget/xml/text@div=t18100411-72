            . Q. You are a Police officer of Worship-street office. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st of March did you go with Mr. Linschoten and a search warran to the house of the prisoner - A. I did, I found the prisoner near his master's manufactory. I read the warrant to him in the presence of Mr. Linschoten and Joshua Armstrong. I then said, have you any oil or colour at your house. He answered, he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110046"></xptr>not. I told him I must search his house. We went with him to his house in Wilmott-street, Bethnal-green, and searching under the cellar stairs under some old wood we found a hamper containing fifty or sixty pounds of white lead, and in a corner cupboard of that cellar we found white lead, vedigrease and other colours that I do not know the name of; they were in paper tied up, and some of them clean, having the appearance of recently been put there. I asked him how he came by these things. He said, some of them were given him by his master, and some of them he had ten or twelve years; he had once kept a shop, and that was part of the stock. In the same cellar we found some rape oil. We then took him and the goods to the public office. The place under the stairs was damp, the bottom of the hamper was rotted out.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you lately from your manufactory lost colours of this description - A. Great quantities.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand that you accompanied the officers on their search - A. I did; and these things were found</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things such colours as you manufacture - A. Some of them, and all the articles found I deal in: the patent verdigrease I believe it to be of my manufacturing; there is 9 lb. of it, we sell it for 3 s. 6 d. a pound, and the 7 lb. of verdigrease ground in oil I believe it to be of my manufacturing. There is 60 lb. weight of White lead I deal in that, and from the appearance of it I do not think it could have been there ten or twelve years. I am the only manufacturer of patent verdigrease.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked my master for a bit of colour; he said, what colour would you wish to have; I said, beggars are not to be choosers. He then said to the foreman, suppose we give him some green; no, I said, green is too dear if you will be kind enough to give me this yellow; he gave orders to the foreman to give me as much as I wanted; the foreman acted according to his orders; he gave it me.</p>

I do about thirteen years ago; he lived in Church-street, he moved to 39 in the same street. In that house the business carried on was a colour shop, oil shop and chandlery, that is thirty years ago; there was a large basket with some white lead, black lead and rosin.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

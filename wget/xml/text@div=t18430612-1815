On the 26th of May, I was at the Anchor, at Whetstone, about ten o'clock in the morning—I had been travelling all night—I laid my head on the table, and went to sleep for about an hour and a half—the prisoner was sitting there drinking beer when I awoke—he pre<lb></lb>sented me with my box—I asked where he got it—he said he picked it up—I then missed my handkerchief from my neck, five shillings from my trowsers, sixpence from my waistcoat pocket, and a small wrapper, and a comb—I accused the prisoner of taking it—there were other persons there when I went to sleep, and when I awoke, but at a different side of the room—this handkerchief is mine—it was round my neck when I went to sleep and these other things are mine.</p>

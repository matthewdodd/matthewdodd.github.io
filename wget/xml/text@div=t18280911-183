On the 5th of September, at nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners standing by the lamp-post near my master's window - I observed them for about a quarter of an hour; they were walking about - I went up stairs to breakfast a little afterwards, leaving no one in the shop; I had seen the prisoners just as I went up stairs, which was about a quarter past nine o'clock - I locked the street door when I went up; about ten minutes after I had been up stairs I heard the cry of Stop thief! - I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoners pursued by the witness Scholey; I ran down stairs, and missed two diamond rings from the window - Scholey told me the direction they had taken- I followed them, and overtook them in Brunswick-square; Austin assisted me to take Cox - I then pursued Hilder; he had been stopped by a person, who immediately let him go, and he ran away - I told the person who had hold of Cox, to hold him fast, and I pursued Hilder; when I came up to him, he struck me two blows, but Prestage and I took him - I said he had broken our window and stolen some rings - he said, "Don't lay hold of my collar, take hold of my arm;" we then took them both to the watch-house in the square. Bird brought me five rings on a card, which I knew to be Mr. Newcomb's; and afterwards, when I got back, I received two cards of rings, which had been thrown into a shop - I knew them to be Mr. Newcomb's property; I had seen these rings safe in the morning before I went up to my breakfast; they were in the window - when I came down and missed them, the window was broken, but it was not broken when I went up stairs; I did not miss any more - the glass appeared to me to have been cut, and I found a piece of glass; some of the rings were near where the glass was cut, and some about a foot from it - the glass was not cut large enough for a hand to have been put in; I suppose the rings were got out with a wire - they were worth about 40l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you partner with your uncle, Mr. Newcomb? A. No: I had never seen the prisoner till that morning; the lamp-post is about four yards from the window - I did not see the prisoners searched; there were not many people running - there were not more than six running at the time these men were taken, and not more than a dozen about- I kept hold of Hilder, and went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHAMBERS. Q. How many people were standing at the lamp-post? A. Three; but one I could not swear to - ours is a common bowwindow; there is an immense number of people passing there - the shop is not separate from the house; the dwelling-house is over the shop; my uncle does not live there constantly, but he does live there.</p>

            . I am a fireman. I saw three persons running in Brunswick-square on the 5th of September, and Baker was pursuing them - he was quite exhausted; he did not call to me, but I pursued them about twenty yards, and when they got to the back of the Foundling I stopped Cox: I did not see Hilder stopped - when I took Cox he said he knew nothing of that person (meaning Hilder); I asked him what made him run- he said he heard the alarm, and he was running too; he said, "Don't go to hold me, I will go any where with you - I saw a card thrown over the rails of the Foundling by one of those who were running - I rather think it was Cox; I asked him what made him run, and throw the card over the railings - he said he knew nothing about it; I saw Bird pick it up - there were five rings on it; I rather expect it was Cox threw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you stop him immediately after it was thrown? A. No - I followed him just round the corner; I lost sight of the card for that time, but it was not picked up till I returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHAMBERS. Q. You were walking along the square and saw some persons running? A. Not more than three I believe; I ran, and Cox said he ran because he saw others run.</p>

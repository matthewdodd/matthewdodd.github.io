I went out in the evening at about seven, and got a draft for 25l. When I came back at about ten the prisoner was gone. When I went to put my draft into my little box, I missed my 50l. note.

She said she had not got it; she wished she had. I told the man I was sure his wife had it, and if she had she must be a base woman. We found nothing, and went away. I never saw the note again until the 11th of this month. I saw it at the Bank of England. I was present when the man prisoner was apprehended, and he denied a'l knowledge of the transaction. The woman was taken the same night. The note was taken from the room in which we slept. I had the number of it.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 16th of November last, the female prisoner came to our premises between seven and eight o'clock in the morning to wash for me. When she first came, my husband, my daughter, and my son were at home. My son is a boy between thirteen and fourteen years old. I staid at home all day, and they were all out part of the day. The female prisone had frequently to go to the room in which the note was to fetch the water for washing, which was heating on the fire in that room. She would have occasion to do that frequently in the course of the day. I went down stairs at about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and left nobody there but her. I think I staid down stairs about ten minutes, leaving nobody there but her. During the time I was below, nobody at all came in or went up stairs. I had not seen the note myself for some time previous. She did not go away in the course of the day, but went home between seven and eight o'clock at night. There were two persons up stairs with me in the course of the day, but neither of them stopped a moment. On our missing the note, I went the next morning to the female prisoner, and accused her of having the note. She denied knowing any thing of it, and seemed confused. I never saw the man prisoner near our premises in the course of the day on which the note was lost. I saw the female prisoner again a fortnight afterwards, and accused her of it then again, and she said she knew nothing about it. I told her I was sure she did, and had given it to Burn, her husband, and she denied it. I have known her some time, and she can read writing.</p>

            . I am a taylor, (a 50l. note put into the hand of witness). There is my name on this note. I had it from the male prisoner at the bar. I received it on Saturday the 3d of this month. About three or four weeks previous to this, he asked me to go with him to buy some cloth. He called on the Friday following, but I was not at home. He had said that he expected some money from several families, who owed him a good deal. I understood he was a lamp-lighter by trade. He had several contracts to light at the illumination; and on the 3d of this month I saw him again. He came to me at about eleven o'clock in the morning, and asked me if I could go with him to purchase the cloth. I told him I was busy just then, but if he would call at about three o'clock I should be at leisure; and he said he would wait at his lodgings, where I afterwards called on him. His lodgings were at the Horse-pond public-house, in George-yard, Grosvenor-square. From that we went out to purchase the cloth; and going along we went up Oxford-street, and up Shepherd-street. I asked him if he wished it to be bought at any particular place, and he said he had not, and he would leave it to me. We went down-Shepherd-street, and as we passed the Junction Canal Company's office, he said he had between thirty and forty pounds to pay into them in a short time. I proposed to purchase the cloth at Mr. Fox's, to which he had no objection, and when we came to Mr. Fox's, then he told me he had net less than a 50l. note. I told him it was a large note, and I did not think he could get change for it. He then said, that the only place he thought best to get change was at a Lottery office, and he wanted me to go. I went with him to Cha<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140048"></xptr>ring Cross, as he said he wanted to buy a sixteenth. He put his hand in his pocket and took out a piece of paper, on which he wrote two numbers, and as we were going along he gave me the fifty pound note into my hand. I looked at it and observed there was no name on the back of it, and I remarked that it was strange. He said that the person he had it from would not give him a bad one, he was sure. I asked him from whom he got it, and he said from a man named John Brown, No. 8, Brown-street, Edgeware-road. He asked me if I had any objection to present it, and I said no. He alledged as a reason for not presenting it himself, that he had his wife and three children on the parish of St. George, and if they discovered that he had so much money, their five shillings a week would be stopped. I then went and presented the note to the person in the lottery office for two sixteenths which he chose. He went in with me; the man could not give change. It was then too late to go to the bank with it. The note had a hole in the middle, just under the number. The prisoner then asked me if I would ask my landlord to lend ten pound upon it, and we agreed to go to the bank on Monday. My wife went with it to my landlord and brought back three ten pound notes, a cheque for eight pounds eight shillings, and twelve shillings in silver, and the rest one pound notes. I left four pound twelve shillings at home, and took the rest to Mr. Burn, and gave it to him.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at 17, King's-place, Commercial-road. I have known Johns three or four years; he was employed occasion<lb></lb>ally in my service—in Oct. last, I missed a silver snuff-box from a drawer without a lock, on the ground-floor—I had seen it at the end of Sept., or early in Oct.—this is it—the lid has been scratched, and the inscription, "Presented to John William Tripe, Esq., for his services in Plymouth during the Cholera epidemic," has been erased—I know it by the maker's name—it weighs between five and six ounces, and is worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but much more to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I am a painter, of 68, Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, in my father's employ. I was painting and glazing for Dr. Tripe, and took this snuff-box from a drawer there—I toot it to; the prisoner Farmer's, is King-street—I had become aequainted with her by meeting her in the street some months previous—she asked me what business I was, and where I was at work, and I told her; and sometimes she would ask me for money—I might sometimes have a few shillings, and sometimes not; and she would say, "You can always have plenty, if you like," and such conversation as that—I asked her. how she meant—she said, "When you are at work there are plenty of things lying about, are there not?"—I said, "No"—she said, "If there is nothing lying about, there are things you can have, if you like to take them"—I said, "No, I have not seen anything there"—she said, "You can soon get something, if you please"—I said, "I might do so, certainly;" and left—she repeated the same words on different occasions, and said, what a fool I was, I might have money if J liked; but I had no heart to—she asked me what there was; I said I did not know—she said, "You look next time you go; if you can get them, I will sell them for you, whatever you get"—when I went to Dr. Tripe's, I saw a drawer half open—I opened it, and saw this box, with an inscription on it—I put it in my pocket, and took it home—I took a case and an opera-glass the same day, this was in Oct.—I kept it a day or two, and thinking it was of no use with the inscription, I filed it off, and then took it to Farmer—she said I had not erased the inscription properly, for she could see marks, and asked me what it had been—I said it was a testimonial to a surgeon, Dr. Tripe, for his services during the Cholera—she said she would go and see how much money she could get for it—I waited about half an hour, when she came back, and said, "I have got rid of it, but I bad a great deal of trouble to, and the pawn<lb></lb>broker looked at the snuff-box, and was very suspicious, and wanted to know what had been on it"—I asked her what she told him—she said she told a story about it having belonged to a relation of hers, and there was an inscrip<lb></lb>tion on it which she did not wish to be seen, and it was erased—she said she got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and gave me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>Using foul language to her in the street, and I took her part, and said he ought to know better than to speak to a woman like that—after that I saw her perhaps twice a week, and used to have something to drink with her—the snuff-box was taken three weeks or a month after the first conversation—other persons lived in her house, but there was nobody present—I heard the pawnbroker state before the Magistrate that she had told him a story to induce him to take it—I did not take notice of what he said the story was, I was thinking how badly I had acted—I have not seen Dr. Tripe to speak to him since I have been in prison—I have seen him in Court—I have received no communication from him—there is no attorney who has instructed Mr. Payne to defend me—I have not seen one—I was told I had better confess what I knew, as that might be an incentive to Dr. Tripe to recommend me to mercy, but not if I held out and opposed it—I am sorry to say I have taken a very large quantity of things from Dr. Tripe—I took a japan-box at the instiga<lb></lb>tion of the female prisoner—I took it to her, and she said I had better not take it into her house, as anybody might see it there, but I bad better take it home and open it, and see what things were in it—I did so, and brought the things to her, and she pawned them—she told me I bad better hide the box—I did not know what to do with it, and I threw it into the canal—I did not steal an ivory box, or break it up, and throw it into the water-closet—every<lb></lb>thing I took from Dr. Tripe's was at the prisoner's instigation—I never got rid of anything myself but a pencil-case, and she took that first and brought it back again.</p>

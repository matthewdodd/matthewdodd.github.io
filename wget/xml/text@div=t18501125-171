                  </hi>. I am a printer, of Angler's-terrace, Peckham. On Sunday morning, 10th Nov., between one and two o'clock, I was in the Kent-road, near the corner of Trafalgar-road—I had a purse in my right pocket with ten half-crowns in one end, and six in the other—I had some halfpence in my pocket distinct from the purse—I saw the prisoner loiter<lb></lb>ing about the corner—just as I was about to enter the road she came up and took hold of my right arm—my right hand was in my trowsers pocket, and my left hand holding an umbrella—she persisted in accompanying me—I was going homewards—I turned up the Trafalgar-road—she made some remarks which I can scarcely charge my memory with—after I had crossed the canal bridge she asked me for money—as far as the bridge there is a carriage road, some houses on the right hand, and a great many on the left, and lamps; after that, it is a bye-road, and a footpath, there are no houses for a considerable distance—I made no request to her whatever—I did not acquiesce in her company, on the contrary, I wished to get away from her—Iwarned her that I was going home—I asked her to leave me in the first instance—I warned her that I was getting nearer and nearer home—I am a married man, and I thought it would be discreditable to be with her—she said she would not leave me without I gave her some money—that was a considerable distance after I had passed the bridge—I gave her some halfpence, all I had in my pocket, except what was in the purse—I thought it was only halfpence, but on making a calculation I found I had 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave her a sixpence amongst the halfpence—at the moment I gave them to her, a policeman showed his light across the field—I said to her, "There is a policeman, now you had better go"—she did not go immediately, she continued where she was—I stood just for one minute, pointing to the policeman—she left me a minute afterwards, and within two minutes after, I discovered the loss of my money—I recollect having seen it about an hour before, and I had felt it not two minutes before—on finding that my money was gone I turned round immediately to the prisoner, and said, "You have taken my purse"—she had got but very few yards from me—she said, "I hope God may strike me blind and dead, if I have"—I told her she must give me my purse, it contained my children's victuals—I begged her to give it me—she seemed to pay no attention to anything I said, except repeating that she had not got it—I persisted that she had, for I knew a very short time before, it was safe in my pocket—at length when the policeman was approaching, she thrust the purse into my right hand—I immediately perceived that the money had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250186"></xptr>
               <p>been taken from one end of it, but was left in the other—I found the six half-crowns had been taken from one end, the ten were left in the other— I found a hole about the centre of the purse, where there had been a slight hole previously, but it was increased—the ring had passed beyond the hole, so that there would be no rent where the money was—I said to her, "You have not given me all the money"—I told her she had got 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my money, that I had had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and now I had only got 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Give it me"—she persisted that she had not got it—the policeman came up, and I gave her in charge—I had not had any service whatever from her from which she might have supposed she was entitled to any money.</p>

               <p>between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor in the Peckliam footpath—the prosecutor said, "You have robbed me"—the prisoner said she had not robbed him—I asked him; he said she had—I asked her, and she said she had not—he gave her in charge—she said she was innocent, and he ought to be ashamed to lock her up—he told me she took a purse, containing sixteen half-crowns, from him, and she gave him back the purse, containing ten half-crowns, and six were missing—she was searched by a female, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver was found on her, and 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I searched the spot where the money was lost; I found nothing—there is water there—I said to the prisoner, "Has there been any connexion taking place between you and the gentleman?"—she said, "None whatever."</p>

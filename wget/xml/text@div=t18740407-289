I live at 50, Desborough Street, Pimlico—on the night of 6th October, I went to bed about 11 o'clock—I was the last person up; the house was locked up and secured—about 7 o'clock next morning I found the house in confusion—the drawers were broken open, in the dining-room especially, and papers strewed about in all directions—I missed a great coat, a walking stick, a scarf, a cigar case, two purses which contained a small amount of silver, and a watch was taken from my daughter's room—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my articles—I found this watch at the pawn shop—the house had been entered from the balcony by breaking a pane of glass in the drawing-room window, and I found the doors open, and the broken glass on the carpet—there were marks along the balcony.</p>

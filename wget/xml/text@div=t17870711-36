               <p>This robbery could not be above two or three minutes? - I have not the least doubt of the men, I was not so much alarmed as I am now; for I did not think them in earnest when they came up, for I was never stopped before, nor did I know what it meant; he was taken on the Wednesday following; I saw him in Litchfield-street on the Thursday; and lodged an information; the room was full of people; I have no reason to doubt with respect to Hanlan, that he is the same man; he has the same coat on now, I speak from his coat and person; I believe that is the coat he had on when he robbed my fellow servant; I looked at his face, and I do not entertain a doubt about him.</p>

               <p>I am a pawn broker in Denmark-street, on the 23d of June, at half past ten at night, the prisoner Hanlan brought this watch to pledge, nobody was with him, he wanted two guineas upon it, I offered him a guinea and a half, which he refused, and took the watch away; about ten minutes after he brought it back again, and told me he would take the guinea and a half; he took it, he told me his name was Hanlan, and he lived in Compton-street; I gave him a duplicate, and on the Monday evening I sent for the Daily Advertiser, and there I saw a robbery had been done near Caen-Wood, of a silver watch, maker's name Anderson, No. 6323. On Tuesday morning as soon as the magistrates were sitting, I took the paper with the watch, and described the person that pawned the watch; and on the Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110055"></xptr>following, the prisoner Hanlan with another man, came to fetch the watch out; the other was a man which I find since, keeps the Seven Stars in Eagle-street, a publican; I went backwards with a pretence to look for it, and sent some of our lads out at the back door to fetch an officer; and kept him there under pretence of looking at the watch; Hanlan was stopped, the other man was known to the officer, and he was let go, it seems he came to buy the watch. I am sure Hanlan was the man that pledged it, and it is the same watch, I have had it ever since.</p>

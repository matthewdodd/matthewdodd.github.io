               <p>The witness says you were brought on his horse to his door the day he lost it, would you wish to ask him any question about that? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutor. Did you order any body to enquire for the horse? - When I missed him, I judged he was gone to his stable, and that somebody had let him loose by way of a joke; not finding him there, I went to the field; and not finding him there, I went to the Green-yard; and while I was gone to the Green-yard, this person brought him to me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was coming through St. Margaret's church-yard, Westminster, on Tuesday, the 28th of August; I saw the prisoner at the bar on the horse; I had a suspicion it belonged to somebody, as he was at Bow-street the day before, for stealing a horse of the same kind.</p>
               <p>Court. We must not hear that; did you stop him? - Yes, and I asked him who the horse belonged to, and he said he had borrowed it of a man on the other side of Westminster-bridge, of the name of Williams; I accordingly took him to Bow-street, and said I would go, and enquire for this Mr. Williams; I went and enquired, and could find no such person; I came back again, and told the Magistrate of it, and he ordered me to take the boy before me upon the horse, and let him shew me where he took the horse from; I did so, my Lord, and he went with me to the Borough, and shewed me a butcher's shop, and said that the horse belonged to that shop.</p>
               <p>Whose shop was that? - It was a butcher's shop right opposite to the King's-bench.</p>
               <p>Whose shop was it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire at the shop? - Yes, and the people said they did not know who the horse belonged to, nor did they know any thing of the prisoner; I then made him go back again the same way he came, and in going along, I heard a man say, there goes Jackson's old horse; I turned back again, and asked the man where Jackson lived, and he told me; I then went to Jackson's house, he was not at home; I saw his wife, and she said her husband was looking out for his horse all the day long; I then left orders for Mr. Jackson to attend at Bow-street next morning, which he did. I am servant to Mr. Fenwick, the keeper of Tothill-fields Bridewell; I found the boy with the horse, about a quarter after three.</p>
               <p>Court to the prisoner. Have you any questions to ask this witness? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you hear what the witness says against you? - No.</p>
               <p>He says he saw you riding this horse in St. Margaret's church-yard, and that you told him that it belonged to a person of the name of Williams, on the other side of Westminster-bridge; will you ask the witness any question upon what he says? - No.</p>
               <p>Now what have you to say in your defence? - Nothing, Sir. (Crying.)</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. Could any body ask what he meant to do with the horse.</p>
               <p>Court. The misfortune is, that question cannot be asked, because it tends to criminate him.</p>

               <p>Now if he should be acquitted, will you take care that he shall not run about the streets? - I will; he always behaved as a good boy hitberto, and always bore an honest good character; his mother goes out a washing, and I go out a day labouring.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bathall. I will take care of the boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury; to convict this boy, he must have taken this horse with an intent to convert it to his own use; it is one thing, to take property for the purpose of selling it, and converting it to the use of the person who takes it; and another thing to take a horse in a boyish way for the purpose of riding.</p>

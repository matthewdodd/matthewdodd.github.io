                  </hi>. I reside in Heathfield Street, Notting Dale, Kensington. On 1st June I went out of my house—I double locked the door, and every door and window was fast—I went to the King's Arms—I returned about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock—I heard a noise in my house—I went to the King's Arms, got a young man, and I went back with him—I unlocked the door, got in, and found the two prisoners in the bed room—I asked them how they came there—they said they had been asked in—I said, "Who by?"—they said, "By a friend"—this handkerchief is mine, I had left it on the bed—this chisel was not there when I left the house; it was there when I came back.</p>

I was called on—I found the two prisoners in the bed room; I searched them, and on Clayton I found this pocket handkerchief, which the prosecutor claims—I took the prisoners into custody; they were very violent—on the floor of the room I found this chisel—I compared it with the marks on the door post—the bolt of the lock had been forced back, and the door opened.</p>

On the 19th of February, about dusk in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came into Mr. Crawley's, I recollect him perfectly well, and asked me for one or two pennyworth of liquorice; I am not certain which, I served him, he gave me a half crown piece, not having sufficient change in the till I took the half crown into the counting house to Mr. Crawley; I observed it at the time and I doubted it was not good; he said, it is a good one for we are very careful in what we take; I am perfectly correct in that expression; this was before I took it to my master; I then took it into the counting house and gave it to Mr. Crawley, he having a gentleman with him in the counting house not noticing it immediately he held it in his hand, or at least laid it down on the desk, Mr. Crawley gave me the change, and I delivered the proper change to the prisoner, and Mr. Crawley kept the half crown, this was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to recollect satisfactory whether that was the half crown that you gave to Mr. Crawley or not, and the same you received of the prisoner? - It was. The prisoner went away when I gave him his change; I saw him again in the shop on Friday the 22d about dusk, and I saw him again on Saturday the 23d, I cannot certainly say, but I think somewhere about seven o'clock, candles where then light; I believe he wanted then two pennyworth of tamarinds; Mr. Belcher served him in my presence, he tendered half a crown, then he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he came with half a crown each time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got these pieces of money? - I have got the first and have kept it in my possession ever since; I received it of Mr. Crawley.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you receive it? - Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the man that was there on the 19th? - I am perfectly sure.</p>

               <p>Court. Though there had been no other half crown in the till at the morning, might there be not another in the evening after put in or some one taken out? - Not to my knowledge, and I was there all the evening after. I saw the prisoner come on Saturday about the same time, he came for two pennyworth of tamarinds, I served him with them and he pulled out a half crown and tendered to me, which I accused him of being a bad one; the constable has got that; I then accused him of giving me a bad half crown and of taking two before of him of the same stamp; he seemed very agitated in his appearance, and Mr. Crawley was near, and I gave the half crown into his hand and then Mr. Crawley sent for a constable; the constable has got that half crown, Mr. Crawley gave that half crown to the constable as soon as he came; when the constable came he was searched and there was found on him two good shillings and four pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had two pennyworth of bad halfpence, and that the constable said before my Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>I am a chymist and druggist in Bishopsgate-street. On Tuesday, the 19th of February my shopman, Mr. Hopwood, brought an half crown in to me, and I had a person with me, I clapped it down on the desk, I gave him two shillings and six-pence without looking at it, I concluded he knew what money he had taken; about five minutes after when the gentleman was gone I saw it was a bad one; I then went out to him and asked him if he knew he had taken a bad half crown? he said, no; I asked him if the person was gone? he said, yes; I told him to be careful for he would certainly be there again as he had put it off so easy; I gave it to Mr. Hopwood on Saturday, I made a small mark on it before I gave it him; on the Friday morning following which, I believe, was the 22d, my apprentice brought the money out of the till into the counting house, his name is

On Saturday night I was going to my aunt's to inform her that I had a child that was dead, and another ill; going past I was going into this shop for two pennyworth of tamarinds, and got this half crown to pay for the tamarinds; they said I had offered two bad half crowns there before; I told them I never offered a bad half crown to my knowledge; they said I was there yesterday; I said, I am sure I was not here yesterday, because I can prove I was at home all day yesterday, I was not out; the gentleman said I was there in the evening; and I supoenaed the man that works for me to prove that I was not out of my own shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Belcher. Are you sure that man was there with the second half crown as to his person? - I am confident of it; I saw him on Tuesday.</p>

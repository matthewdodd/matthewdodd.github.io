I was the last person up in my house on the 15th of April; it was fastened up securely when I went to bed - at seven o'clock the next morning I came down stairs, and found the door at the bottom of the stair-case bolted on the outside, so as to prevent my getting down; I then went down the other stair-case, and found the door at the bottom of that fastened with a gimblet; I pushed it open and went into the shop, and found the cannister lids lying about - I missed all these articles from the shop and the house; the value of the whole was 10l. or 11l; I went to Mr. Cockburn on the 17th - he produced to me three spoons with my initials filed out in a rough way; I saw the two prisoners in about a week in custody.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live at Richmond. King brought these three spoons to me between eleven and twelve o'clock on the morning of the 27th of April, and a thimble, which Mr. Mellett did not claim; the marks on the spoons had been rubbed out; I mentioned that to her - she said she was not aware of any marks ever being on them; she had had them in her possession for twenty years; I said,"That is nonsense" - I did not suppose they had been rubbed out many hours; she said, "You need not be afraid, you know me;" I said, "I know you by sight, and that is all" - I at last gave her 5s. for them; I am confident the erasures could not have been made many hours; Mr. Mellett picked them out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Then you had known her before? A. I had seen her, but did not know her name.</p>

I took King about a week after the robbery, at her own house at Hammersmith; Grimshaw lodged there, but he was not at home - he afterwards came and surrendered himself to me; when I took King, she said Grimshaw gave her the spoons; that he was going to work, and saw them laying in the road.</p>

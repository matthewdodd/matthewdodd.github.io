                  </hi>. I am an officer, employed in the Birmingham and London Railway police. On the 1st of October I was desired to watch a work-shop of theirs at Camden-town, in Chalk-farm-lane—I stationed myself there about twelve o'clock in the day, which is the time the people leave for their dinner—I saw Street in an enclosed place, which is no thoroughfare, and where no person has any right to be, except they go</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183910210068"></xptr>
               <p>expressly for any thing—there is a window which opens from the back of the work-shop into that place, about four feet from the ground—I saw Street in that place, making towards the window—I saw him go up to it—I was directly opposite the window in Chalk-farm-lane, looking down upon him—when he got to the window I saw the prisoner Crumble (whom I had never seen before) come and talk to him for about five minutes—while they were talking Street turned round and looked at me—I was then satisfied that I was observed—I went back to where I could see them, and they not see me—while I had been looking at them Street's hack was towards me, and Crumble's face—when I went back I saw Street take; handkerchief out of his pocket, put it in at the window, and bring it out with something in it—he then came back to the rails and saw me—I got through the rails, and he ran down to the window and I after him-just as I got to the window he had got a stone bottle out of the handkerchief, and put it in the window—he put the handkerchief into his pocket again—I then told Street he was my prisoner—he begged of me to let him go, and said it was the first time—he wanted to go on his knees, and put up his hands, and said he had a wife and six children—he said, "There is only us two, let me go"—I stood at the window, and saw the bottle inside—I called, but no one answered—I took Street round to the shop, and took possession of the bottle—this is it—there was no one in the shop-time is the front-way out of the shop, through which any one could have gone and left it—I then called Jackson, another constable, and asked him where the painter was—he said he dared to say he was at Chalk-farm at dinner—I said, "Go and fetch him"—he went and brought the prisoner Crumble—I said, "That is the man I want, take him into custody"—I have since examined, near that window, and find there is a little bench, just inside the window—from the means I had of observing Crumble I hare not the slightest doubt of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Birmingham railroad policeman. At a little after twelve o'clock, on the 1st of October, I saw Street in custody of Bates—I went to the Chalk-farm tavern, and found Crumble at his dinner—I brought him back to where Bates and Street were—the men leave at twelve o'clock, to go to dinner—the carpenter and the smith usually worked in the shop where Crumble did, and, usually, all went to dinner together, but on that day I saw the smith and the carpenter go together, but I did not see Crumble go at all—they went, and left Crumble alone in the shop—he worked in that shop as a painter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Chingford-green, and am a farmer. I lost the skin of a colt in May from the shed in the farm-yard—I went away on the Sunday morning from home, and when I came back it was gone—I saw it at Waltham Abbey, at Mr. Clark's a tanner's I think, on the 21st—I had seen it safe at home on the 17th, in a cow-shed, in the farm-yard—the prisoners have both worked for me—Sage had worked for me about six days before.</p>

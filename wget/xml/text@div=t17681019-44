            . I live at Redburn in Hertfordshire; I came to town the 8th of August, 1767, on purpose to take a draft of 30 l. of Mr. Green of Thames street; I went there, and was told he would not be at home within two hours; I went on London bridge to pass some time away, while I was standing there the prisoner came to me, I never saw him in my life before; he said, how do you do brother farmer; I said, I was very well; he asked me if the water-works were not some mill, and said he was a stranger in London, that he kept<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190030"></xptr> a farm at Bristol of 80 or 90 l. a year of his own, and that he was come to London to take about 70 or 80 l. and was disappointed, and had not taken it at present; I told him I came to receive a bill of 30 l. but the gentleman was not at home; after some time I wished him a good night, saying, I must go home; he said, we being brother farmers must drink together; we went into an alehouse just going up the hill, and had sixpennyworth of rum and water; I said I must go, I went out; he said he was going my way; I walked to the Change, still he followed me; I had told him I was to go to the gentleman in two hours time for the money; he told me he would take me to where was a pot of good porter, then we went to the Coach and Horses in Bishopsgate-street; I went to sit down in a box, he said, no, we had better go into another room; we went into a private room, in about two or three minutes in came two men, one of them shammed very fuddled, and said, d - n it, I have been tossing up with some butchers boys, and lost 5 l. and said, d - n it, he ha not cared if it had been an hundred; they did not seem to be acquainted at first with the prisoner, but they soon got to be acquainted; the prisoner asked him how he lost it; he said in toffing, and that he could guess three times out of four; said the prisoner, d - n it, I will lay you a shilling you do not; he and the darken man pretended to toss for a shilling, the prisoner tossed up, and the other was to guess; the prisoner won; then the other said he would give him a toss for 40 or 50 l. the prisoner asked me if I had any money about me; I said, no, nothing but that note I was to get change for; come, said he, I will go with you to the gentleman; he went down with me, the gentleman was not at home that time; we came back again, and staid some time; then I and one of the other men went down, and then the gentleman paid me, I think nine guineas and a half, and six pence, and two 10 l. bank notes; we came up to them again, then there happened to be two strange gentlemen come into the room; then the prisoner said, it will not do here, there was a bustle among them; they paid the reckoning, and went out and I with them; when in the street the prisoner said to me, come along farmer, we must drink together; they went to <placeName id="t17681019-44-crimeloc257">the Nag's Head Tavern in Leadenhall-street</placeName>

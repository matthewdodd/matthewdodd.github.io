I had the care of a house there for Mr. Robins, and on the 16th of December, I was preparing for a sale; I had the care of the property. The goods were on view - the prisoner came and asked for a catalogue; I said we should have some in ten minutes. He went up into the drawing-room; I had put the timepiece on the mantle shelf five minutes before. I looked out of the second floor window, and saw him going down the court with something under his coat. I followed, and overtook him, and said,</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, I think you have a time-piece which don't belong to you;" he said he had not - I looked, and saw it under his coat, and said he must go back. He begged for mercy, said he did it from want, and had had no victuals for two days.</p>

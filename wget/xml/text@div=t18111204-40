               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COLE. On the 11th of May last, about half past ten or eleven in the morning. I was proceeding to the <placeName id="t18111204-40-crimeloc224">Custom-house</placeName>

               <p>Q. To what amount. - A. I could not tell, they then went away and left me, and I proceeded on my business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. This was on the 11th of May last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the tower wharf. - A. At the further end of the new buildings of the left hand side from the entrance at the iron gate.</p>

               <p>Court. Near the iron gate side. - A. Beyond the first draw-bridge, near the gun wharf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. That is a considerable thoroughfare. - A. It is a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a great many workmen there in the foundery, and there is a centinel between the drawbridge and gun wharf. - A. There is a centinel box on the left hand side of the wharf, but none between the bridge and this place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not there upon your oath between the gate of the tower next Wapping and the draw bridge two centinal boxes. - A. There is one between the gate and the draw bridge, and one between the draw bridge and gun wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing more past between these boys than what you have stated. - A. No. I went to the Custom-house about my business.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

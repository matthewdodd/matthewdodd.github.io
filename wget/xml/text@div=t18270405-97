The prisoner came to lodge in my room on the 13th of February - we slept in the same room, but not in the same bed. On the night of the 24th, when I went to bed, I put my watch under my pillow; I saw the prisoner then in bed - he got up the next morning before I did. I awoke about half-past ten o'clock, and missed my watch; I did not see him again till the 6th of March, when he was at the Coach and Horses, public-house, Carnaby-street; I then gave him in charge. He had not returned to the room again.</p>

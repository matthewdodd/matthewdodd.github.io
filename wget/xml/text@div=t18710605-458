                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Whiteman, of Woodchester Street, Paddington—the prisoners lodged in our house; they occupied two parlours—on Wednesday morning, a fortnight ago to-day, I woke up with my baby, and heard the prisoners talking rather loudly—the day was then breaking; it was about 3.30, and I went to sleep again—I afterwards heard a noise like somebody running about the passage—I dressed myself quickly, and went down—the house was full of smoke, and the witness Smith was putting out the fire—I saw coals and wood about 2ft. from the hearth—I cannot say whether they were piled up, because the fire was out—there was no fender on the hearth—my husband had distrained on the prisoners on the Saturday before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 96, Woodchester Street, and am a potman—on the morning of 24th May, about 4.15, I heard cries of "Fire!" in the street, from a man who was passing—I ran down, and found Whiteman's door, No. 87, on the latch, not fastened, and as I ran in at the parlour-door where the fire was, the male prisoner stooped to throw a jug of water to put the fire out—I said "Have you set the place on fire? and I took the jug out of his hand, and well <hi rend="italic">slothed</hi> the two fires—the parlour is on the ground floor—there was no fire in the fire-place, but there was a fire, about 11/4ft. high, of flame, above 3ft. from the hearth, and another distinct fire 5ft. off, in the middle of the bed, which had been left for the children to sleep in—the children were not there, they were in the back room; the prisoners only were in the room when I went in, and both were fully dressed—they did not say a word, bat as I went in the male prisoner stooped, and made one <hi rend="italic">douse</hi> with the jug, and I took it out of his hand, and partly put it on the one fire, and partly put the water on to the bed—I said "Go and get some more water, and I will try and put it out"—I took the clothing off the bed, and soaked it well in water, and threw it into the bed—eventually I put it out, and the coal and wood I took out into the street—the coal was on the wood floor, 3ft. from the fire-place, and the wood was in the middle of the coal—the wood was burning, and the coal crackling, not quite alight—some rags were also burning, I should think it was a quilt—the middle of the bed was burning, and the top quilt, and the window-work was burning through the heat of the fire which I put out—there was about 5ft. between the fire on the floor and the bed, half a foot from that fire to the window—there were two distinct fires; the window sashes were connected with both, and the cupboard-door, which had caught, was connected with the one nearest to the hearth—neither of the prisoners said anything till the constable came, and then the female prisoner said that Mrs. Whiteman and I must have set it on fire while she was out—she also said that if it caught fire, she bought a penny candle on Tuesday eight, and put it in a bundle of wood, and put it on a bushel basket, and that was how it must have caught fire—that was at the same tune that she said that Mrs. Wightman and I must have set fire to it—the said that she stuck the candle in the bundle of wood, and put it in the basket, and went out at 10 o'clock, and me and Mrs. Whiteman must have set it on fire, and that was all she knew about it—there were two baskets in the room, and a new coat, which was being made—I have seen the floor since the fire was cleared away; there is a new flooring there now—they have had to have a new cupboard-door, but if the window-sashes are stopped, and painted over, I think they will do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The jug which the man had would hold two gallons—when I went in he picked it up from the corner of the fire-place, 5 or 6 ft. from the first fire—it was not in his hand when I went in—I saw a bundle</p>

               <p>of wood in the room, but no candle—if there had been a candle it must have burnt down to the edge of the wood, but there were no signs of any grease—the basket might have been burnt—I saw fragments of a basket—the rags were not a woman's underclothing; there were towels among them—there was some underclothing; it is no interest to me to tell a lie—I saw a new pair of her boots burnt, but no children's boots—I saw no under-clothing burnt, or the remnants of it—the fire was 5ft. on the other side of the bed; it could not have set fire to the coverlet—the quilt could not have been set on fire by the heat, because the window and door were shut—the male prisoner did not take the coverlet off the bed when I went in—he seemed to have had his clothes on all night—the half-made coat was in a box, or part of a box, close to the door, untouched—I think if I had not gone in, the whole would have been set on fire, because no one would have known of it, and the inhabitants as well—it is no interest to me to come up here—I am a friend of Mr. Whiteman's, a very particular friend—I went into the next room to where the fire was—there were no possible means for them to sleep in that room unless they slept on the floor—the children came into the room where I was, in their night clothes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 358). On the morning of 24th May I was called to 87, Woodchester Street, and saw the prisoners in the room where the fire was—I asked the male prisoner how he accounted for the fire—he said that he could not account for it at all—the woman said that she went out at 10 on the evening previous, and bought a penny candle and a bundle of wood, that she went out at 10 o'clock and returned at 11, and she supposed Smith and the landlady had set the room on fire during the time she was away—she afterwards said that she placed the bundle of wood at the top of a hamper, and stuck the candle in the bundle of wood, and she supposed the candle burnt down and set the wood on fire—the fires were out then, but the room was very hot—that was all she said—the floor was burnt in two places—one was about a foot from the corner of the cupboard, and the other the other side of the window—one place was where the bed had stood.</p>

On 25th May I went to 87, Wood<lb></lb>chester Street, and saw the remains of two distinct fires—the two prisoners were in the front parlour, and I said to the female "How do you account for this?"—she said "I know nothing about it"—on the way to the station I said "It is likely to be a very serious matter, you must know something about it"—she said "All that I can account for is, that I put a candle in a bundle of wood, and it must have burnt down and set the wood on fire; it serves her right for forcing us into one room"—I suppose she meant into the front parlour.</p>

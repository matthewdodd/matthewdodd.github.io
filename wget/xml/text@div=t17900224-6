I was then several times in the shop where the prisoner was employed; and before I went to breakfast, I noticed that very piece of lead was in its proper place; and between the time of my being in the shop, and his leaving the shop to go to breakfast, he was there alone; and I saw that no one could go where I breakfasted. When I had finished my breakfast, I seated myself in the yard; soon after the clock struck, he came down the stairs of the shop next the yard, and went along the passage towards the street-door; the yard is between the back part of the shop door, and the front of the house. I then ran up into the shop, and missed a piece of lead from the work-shop where he had been; I then desired Mr. Nicholls to follow him, which he did; soon after, he returned, and went along the passage; and I followed him close: he then attempted to go up the stairs into the upper shop; I laid hold of the skirt of his coat, and pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240014"></xptr>him back; and I saw a piece of lead fall, I suppose from under his waistcoat, which piece of lead was marked with my instrument. I afterwards had him conveyed before a magistrate, from whence he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Was that piece of lead the only piece you missed? - Yes, at that time; I gave this piece of lead to Mr. Nicholls.</p>

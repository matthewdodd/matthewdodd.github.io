            . I am watchman of St. Ann's. This house is in my beat. On the night of the 26th of October, as I was calling half-past one o'clock, I observed three men standing still outside Mr. Bell's house. When they saw me coming up to them, one man in a white coat went off, and the other two went different ways. I followed the man in the white coat a little way. I walked round the square, and on coming to Mr. Bell's house again, I saw the same man there; he stood in the front of the area, walked away, and I followed him to the corner of Frith-street and down the left side as far as No. 3; he stopped there about a minute, and turned back towards Greek-street. I turned back to the corner of Carlisle-street, and then went back to Mr. Bell's area, stood there about a minute, and heard some person at work down the area, apparently cutting wood - the moon shone very bright. I drew alongside the area, and saw a man there at work, and on getting my rattle from under my coat; the man in the white coat (who was outside) came up, and asked me what it was o'clock? I said it was almost two; he instantly seized my rattle and broke the large part off, which prevented my springing it. I said there was somebody down the area; he said</p>
               <p>"D - n your b - dy eyes, I'll area you." Another man stepped up instantly, and broke this broomstick over my head. When they saw that the blow made me stagger off the footpath, they called to the man in the area</p>

               <p>"Come up." He came up through the area gate, which was open, went along the top of Frith-street, and down the left hand side; the other two went different ways. I followed the man towards Frith-street, calling Stop thief! Thorn, the watchman, attempted to stop him. I was about twenty yards off at the time, and never lost sight of him at all - it was the prisoner. When I came up, Leager had got him - he had passed the place where Thorn attempted to stop him. As he ran down Frith-street, I heard him throw something down, which sounded like keys. I went to the watch-house with him, and in the way he dropped a small chisel; I picked it up and gave it to Healing. I went back to Frith-street with Ivory and Mason; we found a bunch of keys exactly in the same spot where I heard him throw them - Ivory picked them up. I tried them to Mr. Bell's area gate, one of them locked and unlocked it. I afterwards saw the door, if the pannel had been cut out, there would have been room enough to let a man's body through. Thorne went to the watch-house all over blood - he was cut along his forehead. I never lost sight of the prisoner till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you observe what was done to the door - A. There were four gimlet holes in it, and where the pannel is let in, was cut all down and nearly cut away.</p>

On the night of the 26th of October, I heard the cry of Stop thief! and immediately crossed the way, hearing the footsteps of a man running towards me as hard as he could; it was the prisoner. I lifted up my stick, and called to him to stop, he was close to me, he said nothing, but lifted up his hand and made a blow at me, which nearly staggered me. I felt that it was the blow of an instrument, and the blood gushed from me in a torrent immediately. He then ran off as fast as he could, I followed him, springing my rattle, as hard as I could, and crying Stop thief! I did not lose sight of him, and saw Leager stop him. When I came up he had got him by the collar. I immediately took him by the other side, he was taken to the watch-house. My head was dressed - I received a cut across the temple. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you your hat on when you received the blow - A. Yes; my cap was under my hat, the blow was below where the hat came, my cap was not down, it prevented my hat coming on my head. He struck me with a sweeping cut so - (describing it.)</p>

            . I am a beadle. I was on duty at the watch-house; the prisoner was brought in. I picked up the keys in Frith-street, within a few yards of the spot Morton described. I found some pieces of wood in Mr. Bell's area, which I compared with the pannel of the door, they fitted it, and evidently came from it. If the pannel had been moved I could have got through myself.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at Middlesex Hospital. Thorn was sent to me by Mr. Bell. I saw him at six o'clock in the evening, he had a wound about an inch and a half long, extending across the forehead, it appears to have been made with a knife, the one produced, it strikes me, was very probably the instrument. It was all the same depth, and began about three inches from the eye-brow on the left temple.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it any depth to make it dangerous - A. The skull was not exposed, it was a little less than a quarter of an inch deep. It must have been done by a cutting instrument. I have not a doubt of its being a cut, and not a contusion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Frith-street, and that man stopped me. I made no resistance. I live in Crown-street, and was not above twenty yards from home. I did not come down Soho-square. There was not a person in the street. When Thorn came to the watch-house his head appeared swollen.</p>

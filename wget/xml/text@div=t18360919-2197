                  </hi>. I live with my father, who keeps the Burlington Arms. in Old Burlington-street. On the 6th of September, the prisoner came to with a female and child, and called for a pint of porter, which I served him with—he threw down a shilling, I told him it was bad—he said he did not think it was—I took up a knife and cut it in two—he</p>

               <p>he then said he took it at Bartholomew-fair, and said a good deal about it—the female then paid me in copper for the beer—I followed them to Bond-street, at the corner of Conduit-street, and there saw him leave the woman, and go to another woman, who gave him something—he went up to a shop window, rubbed his thumb on the pavement, and then rubbed what she gave him with his hand—I gave him in charge of a policeman, with the woman who had come with him to our house, not the one who gave him something—I saw Fox the policeman take something from his hand.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner with a female—I searched him, and asked him to open his hand, and asked him what was in it—he said, "Nothing"—he would not open it, and I forced it open, and found a shilling—I searched him at the station-house, and found two more shillings in his waistcoat pocket—he had a good sixpence in another pocket, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

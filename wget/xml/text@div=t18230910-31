            . I am a sack-maker, and live in Aldermanbury. Last Saturday, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I had a pint of beer at the <placeName id="t18230910-31-crimeloc172">Fortune of War, public-house, Giltspur-street</placeName>

I am sure of her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BERNARD. Q. This was the fair time - A. Yes; there might be fifteen people in the tap-room. I am sure five shillings and two sixpences were taken; I said at the time I could not tell how much she took.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had seen the prisoner come out of the public-house, and run down Cock-lane, calling murder; she came up Giltspur-street, in about five minutes, went by the door, turned back, and went into the tap-room. The prosecutor gave her in charge. I found five shillings, two sixpences and a half crown, down her bosom, and 8 d. in her pockets. I think she was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prosecutor drunk - A. He might be a little in liquor. Women often keep money in their bosoms.</p>

He was very much in liquor, and made me have some oysters, and handed his beer about; he followed me out, and asked me to go into a show with him; we returned to the house; he took liberties with me; I hit his hand and ran out; he gave me a kick, and I called murder.</p>

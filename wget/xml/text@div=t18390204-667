                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 113.) I was on my rounds on the evening of the 23rd of January, at half-past six o'clock, near the Mermaid tavern, at Hackney—I went into a privy, from information, and found the prisoner there and Joseph Massey—I asked them what they were doing there, and they gave me a reason coupled with the place, but I heard some<lb></lb>thing drop down which sounded to me like glass or a chain—I took them both to the station-house—I returned directly, and found five glass bottles thrown down the privy—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am just turned eleven years of age—I know the necessity of speaking the truth—my father is a soap-boiler—the officer found me and the prisoner in the privy—I had been with the prisoner that afternoon, and he asked me to go with him to the Mermaid—I went with him—he coaxed me to go down to the bottom of the garden, and there we got five bottles from a rack where they were placed topsyturvy—the prisoner gave me two, and had three himself—he then looked, and saw somebody coming, we ran into the privy, and put the bottles down—they were the same bottles that came from the yard of the Mermaid—we were then taken to the station-house.</p>

             sworn. - I am foreman in my mother's shop: On the 26th of June, about eleven in the morning, I counted twenty-five shillings in penny-pieces, and some hallpence: they were my mother's; I put them in parcels, five shillings in a paper, on a stand, in the market-place, Spital fields, the outside of a warehouse; as I was counting them, I was called away to attend a customer; on turning round, I missed a paper of pennypieces; the two prisoners were close by, whom I knew before, they were porters in the market; I charged them with it; they denied it, and said, I might search them, but I did not; James Penny feather said, I have got some penny-pieces, but they are not your's.</p>
               <p>HUMPHRY LEVI sworn. - I am a Jew: I have known the prisoners by sight: On Saturday fortnight I saw Constable, the prisoner, take five shillings-worth of penny-pieces, tied in a paper; he ran under the court, and Pennyfeather too; Pennyfeather had them under his apron; soon afterwards they went up to the church, a little way off, and divided them amongst them all, for there were five who shared them; I then went to Mr. Judd's mother, and told her, and then the two boys were taken up. I dared not go before, for they would have beat me, as they were bigger than I.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Constable, called one, and Pennyfeather two witnesses, who gave them good characters. Both <rs id="t18020714-59-verdict316" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a livery-stable keeper, in Brook-street, Piccadilly. A saddle of Mr. Francis Henry Dykes, and a bridle of Mr. Alexander Gordon's, were left in my charge—about the 18th of February I missed the saddle, and on the 22nd I was told there was a saddle and two bridles at a certain place—I went home, and missed my own bridle, but I did not miss Mr. Gordon's bridle till I saw it—these are the articles—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—I can identify them all—I know the prisoner—he was coachman to Sir Frederick French, who kept his horses with me at livery.</p>

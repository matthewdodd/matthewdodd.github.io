                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 643). About a month ago I received a communication from Mr. James Forster, of the Railway Tavern, London-street—the prisoner was at that time his barman—on Tuesday, 3d Novem<lb></lb>ber, some shillings, florins, and half-crowns were marked by Mr. Forster and myself, and on that evening I went to the house in plain clothes, as an ordi<lb></lb>nary customer, and gave the prisoner, who was serving, some of the marked shillings and florins, and received my change—on the following evening I also gave several florins and some shillings to the prisoner personally, received my change, and went away—on the next morning, Thursday, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I and another officer were watching Mr. Forster's house—I saw the prisoner come out and go towards Northumberland-alley, Leadenhall-street—a woman joined him about thirty or forty yards from Mr. Footer's, in Fenchurch-street—she was waiting for him—they went to the Saracen's Head, in Northumberland-alley—I did not go there; I knew that Mrs. Boyer was in there—I saw them come out and go into Gracechurch-street, where they separated—I followed the woman and asked her for a parcel—she refused to give me any answer at first—I took her up the station, and she then handed me this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contained five florins, four shil<lb></lb>lings,</p>

I am a detective police-officer—on this Tursday morn<lb></lb>ing morning I was with Tilley in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner and the woman go into the Saracen's Head—when they came out they separated at the top of Northumberland-alley, and the prisoner went into a barber's shop—I saw him an hour afterwards in London-street, after the female was charged—he was outside his master's house—I told him I wished to examine his boxes—he said, "Very well," and went back with me—he said, "Here are the keys"—I then asked him if he had been out—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had met any person—he at first declined to answer, saying he would tell the Magistrate—as we were going to the police-court I told him he need not answer my questions unless he liked—I then asked him if he had met a female—he said he had met his wife—I asked whether he had given her a parcel—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How much?"—he said, "Eighteen shillings"—I asked where he got it from—he said, "It was paid to me last night by a party who owed it me"—I asked him who that was—he said he should tell the Magistrate—I searched his boxes, but found nothing—on the way to the station he said that eight shillings of the money had been paid to him on the previous night, and ten shillings that morning—I asked him then by whom, and lie declined to tell me—I was present when Mr. Forster marked the money—I can identify three florins and two shillings.</p>

I keep the railway tavern, 2, London-street, Fenchurch-street—the prisoner was in my service from 10th October till 5th November—when he applied for the situation I asked him if he was married—he said he was unmarried—for some reason I communicated with the police, and acting under their advice I marked some money on Tuesday and Wednesday,</p>

               <p>and gave it to them to pass—I always examine my tills the last thing at-night—I don't recollect whether there were any marked shillings in them on that night, but I found six marked half-crowns in the half-crown till—they are kept separately—on Wednesday-night I examined the tills, and left 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of money in each, two marked shillings in each of the three tills—on Thursday morning, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner came to me for the keys of the tills—I gave them to him—I went to the bar about half-past 9, examined the tills, and found that three of the marked shillings were gone—I only found three there—the officers afterwards came to me, and showed me some of the marked money in this packet—I identify three florins and two shillings in this packet, which I marked—I had given that money to the officers for the purpose of passing at my place—I have two barmaids and a boy in my service.</p>

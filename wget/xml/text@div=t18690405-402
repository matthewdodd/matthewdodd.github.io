                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and was solicitor to the assignees of this bankruptcy—the original documents are all here—the first is an affidavit by the bankrupt, that he had not the means of paying the fees and expenses usually payable in the ease of a petition—it was sworn on 23rd January, 1868, and signed by him—the next is sworn on the same day—it is an affidavit accompanying the petition and verifying its truth—it states that he believes the debts provable against his estate do not exceed 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—each sheet of the examination is signed by the prisoner—he states that his business is that of a dealer in grease; that he had carried it on for thirty years, and that he resided at 13, Burnes Street, Edgware Road; that his debts were 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that the consideration for the debt is law costs in an action brought against him for goods supplied, and that judgment was recovered against him in the Exchequer; and that the total amount of his debts and liabilities was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was asked, "What is the total amount of your assets, and of what do they, consist?"—and his answer was "None"—"Have you given any bill of sale, and if so state the particulars and to whom it was granted?"No"—"Have you had any dealings or transactions other than in the regular course of business?" "No"—"Accommodation bills?"No"—"Have you any books of account?" "No"—he states that he attributes his insolvency to the loss of the action against his detaining creditor, and being detained for costs—he was asked, "What money have you had since your arrest?"and his answer was, "None"—he was arrested a few days before the petition was filed—he was committed to prison on the 18th, and he has been brought here by <hi rend="italic">habeas</hi>—on 22nd February I examined the bankrupt and his mother—I examined the bankrupt first—this is his examination. (<hi rend="italic">This being read, stated that whilst he was in prison, and before he filed his petition, he handed over to his mother a diamond ring worth</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">a gold watch worth</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two <hi rend="italic">gold chains, a silver snuff-box worth</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and nearly</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, as security for rent, together with a lease of some property, for which <hi rend="italic">he had given</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that he was insolent in</hi> 1861, <hi rend="italic">and suffered eighteen months' imprisonment for concealing property in respect of that lease</hi>)—On that same day his mother, Mary Reed, was examined before the Registrar—the bankrupt was present during the whole of her examination.</p>

JUSTICE HANNEN</hi>. considered it was not admissible upon that pound; the rule did not apply to proceedings occurring in a Court of Justice, because a person had no right to interfere and protest against statements made in the course of a judicial investigation, and had no opportunity therefore of denial.</hi>)—After the examination on 22nd February, I obtained a warrant and accompanied the messenger to 13, Burnes Street—we took Mary Reed with us from the Bankruptcy Court, in a cab—she had a room in that house and lodged there—she then handed to us 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, a diamond ring, a gold watch, two gold chains, and a lease of the house, dated 9th May, 1838, from a Mr. Waybourt to Mr. James, for ninety years, at a ground-rent of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—there is no assignment of it to the bankrupt, or any endorsement referring to him; I have had an offer of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but I should think it may be put down as worth 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also obtained from the mother another lease of some premises at Limehouse, for fifty-five years, I believe it has expired within a few months; I have also some other documents, but I don't think they are worth anything—here is a promissory note of Mr. Prance and Mr. Garrett for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated February, 1867, payable two months after date—I have not received anything in respect of that at present; also a promissory same of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated June 1st, 1867, made by Mr. Prance, and a cheque of the same gentleman's, dated June, 1867, it is uncancelled—it had three month to run from June, 1867—also a promissory note for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 1st March, 1867, of Shaft's, endorsed by Mr. Prance, payable at three months—I also found a silver snuff box in the house—I am not sure whether the mother gave it me, or whether I found it in a room up stairs, where the prisoner slept; also a vinaigrette, and an opera-glass—on 21st May I examined the bankrupt again—(<hi rend="italic">In this the bankrupt stated that the property in question was handed to his mother as security for money he owed her</hi>)—None of the property given up to me by the mother is accounted for by him in the forms prescribed by the statute, or in the schedule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If I had been able to pay the fees, bow much were they? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> I think upon debts under 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that would not have been all the costa—I levied an execution at 13, Burnes Street two years ago, in respect of some costs which were awarded against you in two actions against a client of mine—the goods were claimed by your mother, and I withdrew the execution—I arrested you upon a <hi rend="italic">ca. ea.</hi>, and then you paid the coats—I did not take away your clothes when I went to the house on this occasion, nor did I insult your mother—in the two actions you brought against my client the records were withdrawn in one, and in the other they elected to be non<lb></lb>suited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in a long written defence, complained bitterly of the expense he had been put to by law cost in the actions. As to the property guise up by his mother, part of it was really her own, which had been lent to him, and the remainder he handed to her as security for rent that he owed her.</hi>

            . I am a waiter at Mr. Beale's hotel. On the 11th of March the prisoner came into Mr. Beale's hotel, and asked if that was the Union hotel; I informed him the Union hotel was in St. James's-square; I had suspicion he had took some part of the plate from the side-board; he was standing by the side-board in the passage. I asked him what he had got in his pocket, he said he had got nothing belonging to me; I asked him to draw his hand out of his pocket, and after he took his hand out of his pocket, I took the fork from between his fingers; I asked him what he meant by taking it. He said take what, I said this fork that you have got between your fingers; he said if I have got it you put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I shall not intrude upon your time long. The situation of my three motherless children can be better concieved than described. I only was in the passage, I was not in any room nor did I open any door. I am forty-eight years of age; you must be aware the stigma this must cast on my character. I rely upon you to restore me to my family - and, gentlemen, if you are not guided by mercy, I must be for ever an outcast upon the earth.</p>

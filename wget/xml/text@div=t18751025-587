I cannot say that it was myself that did it, and therefore I shall have to say that it was you"—I said "Harry, I feel as if I am dying, will you sit me down on a chair?"—he tore about the room as if he was mad—I don't know whether he fetched my mother or not, but she came and asked me what he had done; she lives next door—we were in the dark all this time—she fetched the landlady—a policeman came and asked me who had done it—I said "My husband"—he took me to the hospital—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife, I saw it in his hand, it is the only one I had, except one without a handle.</p>

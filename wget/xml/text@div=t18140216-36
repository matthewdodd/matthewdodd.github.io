I stood by the side of the coach while the coachman took the things out. I saw the goods put in the coach, and I saw two boxes and two bundles taken out. These two boxes, two bundles, and a tea-chest, were put in the coach; I saw two boxes and two bundles taken out. I asked the coachman if all were taken out; he said, yes, every thing was out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see these two boxes and two bundles put in the coach - A. Yes, and I saw a tea-chest put in also, and I saw the tea-chest on the front seat at the end of one of the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive sure that upon your arriving in Tudor-street that this tea-chest was never taken out by the prisoner - A. Yes, I am. The coachman was paid his fare, two shillings, and then he drove away. The coachman got on the steps of the coach, felt about, and then he said, every thing was out. In about three minutes after the coach went away, my mother missed her tea-chest; my mother went after the coach, she could not find it. I took no notice of the number at that time; I have since learned the number of the coach was 955. I observed the countenance of the prisoner at Tudor-street when I was talking to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have never recovered any of the property - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after your mother lost the tea-chest was it you saw the prisoner again - A. On last Thursday; I saw him at the public-house by the office; I knew him again as soon as I saw him.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember on the 15th of January last, a coach being brought for you at Nelson-square - A. Yes, I was only there five days. I was with the Rev. Mr. Jenkins five days. I put two boxes in the coach, two bundles, and a tea-chest, which I carried myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that tea-chest contain - A. A two-pound note, seven one-pound notes, and three pounds in silver money; the tea-chest was locked. I was taken in this coach to Tudor-street; I did not take the number of the coach. I took particular notice of the lining of the coach, there were three stars on each side of the door of the coach, and a ragged hammercloth. On my arriving at Tudor-street I got out of the coach; I went to my friend in Crown-court, and asked to leave my boxes there, and then I observed the coachman's face; I paid him his fare, two shillings, close to the candles. On my missing my tea-chest I went after the prisoner; I went to the first stand in Bridge-street, I could not find the man or the coach.

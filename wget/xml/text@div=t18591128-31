I am manager at Salter's Hotel—about five o'clock on Monday, 21st November, the prisoner Russell, and Clarkson, who is now undergoing punishment, came into the hotel—one of them ordered chops and potatoes; I do not know which—they were sent to them in the coffee-room—while they were in there Wood came in and asked for a glass of stout at the bar-window—he went into the smoking-room—the smoking-room and the coffee-room are very different—I saw him pass the bar-window and go into the coffee-room where the other two were—I did not see them leave—I saw Clarkson leave, and I saw him take a cloak off a peg in the hall—it is for that he is now suffering—I recognised him at the police-court—I am quite sure that this gentleman's coat was hanging on the peg while the three prisoners were in the coffee-room—it was missed about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards—I am quite sure that these are the two men that I saw.</p>

We adjourned to Salter's Hotel During that time Wood came and spoke to Clarkson with his load on his shoulder, in a newspaper; and after he left, the coat was missing; the officer found the ticket of it and the tobacco pouch on him; there cannot be, therefore, a doubt that that man took the coat off the rack. I had to make enquiries with reference to goods for them next day; I went next day, enquired for Mr. Wood, and left this letter for him, though at that time he was in custody on this charge; so innocent was I of what was going on between them.</p>

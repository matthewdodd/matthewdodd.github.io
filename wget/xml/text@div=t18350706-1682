                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines, I was going into the barracks about one o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of June—there was a row at Deptford Dock-yard gate—the deceased, Howarth Tomason, who was a marine, was in the row—I Saw the prisoner, Carter, strike him with his fist—Tomason was taking his own part as well as he could—they were fighting—I went to take his part, and they struck me—I do not know who struck me—I was knocked down three or four times—I saw Howarth Tomason knocked down once—I made my escape, to get to the gate, to call the sentry—there were seven or eight persons there—I called the sentry and he called the corporal's guard to open the gate—they let me in, and would not let me out again—the corporal's guard went out—Howarth Tomason was fighting; Carter struck him once—there was some woman there, but I do not know who it was—I was not <hi rend="italic">handy</hi> to her—I asked what was the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—they said what was it to me—I do not know who said so—I was sober; I had had a little to drink—I had leave of absence form the barracks that night—Howarth Tomason was brought in about five minutes after I got in—he was just alive, but he died as soon as they got him into the guard-room—that is all I have to tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Wellington-place, Deptford, I passed the Navy Arms at form twenty minutes to a quarter to one o'clock that morning—I did not go in—there were two men and a woman at the door—Fern hailed me, and the other man and woman came down off steps—a soldier was there, who attempted to take liberties with the woman—she said, "I do not want any thing to do with you, I have got my man, and am going home with him"—another soldier then came down King-street, and passed me, and, as far as I could recognise his features, that was the deceased—but before he came up this man, and woman and the soldier were engaged in some way, but I cannot say how, not being at that moment paying attention—the second soldier that came up said, "Do not knock my comrade about, he is drunk, and I am sober; I am a Lanca<lb></lb>shire man, and will fight his battles"—then there was a general row—some party, I do not know who, made use of indecent expressions, and I retreated, not expecting to see any more—several persons then came out of the Dock-yard—I cannot say that I saw any more, but I heard some falls, and I think blows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said the soldier attempted to take liberties with the woman, explain that more fully? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was pulling her about, and taking hold of her gown, and then the row began—I did not see any body knocked down, but I heard three distinct falls—I could not see it, there was an im<lb></lb>perfect</p>

               <p>light. I should think I was twenty yards off—I heard a man sing out "They have got hold of * * *"—the soldiers were close about him at the time—I then saw a soldier get up, or assisted up, and be reeled across the road towards the Griffin, (I believe it is)—It was shut up—he made a circle round and it I had not got out of his way he would have knocked me down—he fell against the curb—he had appeared sober when he passed me in the first place—there was a woman there, but I do not know who she was—I saw her kick the man who fell at my feet—she kicked him in his right side, I believe—he was on his face or nearly so—he might be a little on his left side—I saw blood on the deceased before he fell and before she kicked him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand you rightly through the whole transaction there were only two marines engaged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw only two—the night was dark but I could see soldiers—I did not recognise the wit<lb></lb>ness, Wilton—I cannot say whether the woman was trying to get the man to come home—I do not know Carter, but by the manner of the man com<lb></lb>ing down the step, I should say he was drunk—It was not the soldier nor Fern—I should say that the man was not in a condition to have in<lb></lb>flicted a severe injury on any one—I saw the soldier who had been taking liberties with the woman follow her from the public-house and she remon<lb></lb>strated with him—I do not know whether she gave him a slap on the face—the deceased then came up—my eyes were then turned off, and when I turned again I saw the man reeling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the deceased came up to the place where the man and woman were did the deceased endeavour to get at that man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the woman was between them I saw the man's arm strike and the soldier's arm strike, each arm met—the man had not given the soldier any offence that I saw—the first soldier who was there was drunk—the woman had not done anything to the deceased—after that I saw the man and the deceased struggle together—the deceased then reeled towards the post—he then reeled a considerable distance and fell on his head the woman then kicked him—he never got up till he was carried into the bar<lb></lb>racks—his head fell towards my feet—It was in the middle of the road; there were stones there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the victualling-yard. I saw the de<lb></lb>ceased in the barrack-room; my opinion was that he might die from concussion of the brain, or infusion of blood within the skull or from both these causes conjoined; and the post mortem examination confirmed my opinion—the body was generally healthy and the viscera of the abdomen was healthy; there were two bruises on the legs, but no other external marks—those bruises would not have caused death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think if he had died from a kick on the side, there must have been some marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not say that; a kick might have oc<lb></lb>casioned could not see it—I think it probable that he died from the effusion of blood within the skull but how that was occasioned I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The effusion of blood was quite distinct and apart from any external injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a severe fall, with his head on the stones, would most certainly have produced such an effusion of blood within the skull—I saw nothing in his appearance or on the post mortem examination, from the appearance of the viscera of the abdomen, which could lead me to the conclusion that the effusion of blood proceeded from a kick.</p>

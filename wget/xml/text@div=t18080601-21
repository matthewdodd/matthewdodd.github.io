On the 12th of April last, I was going out of the parlour into the passage; I saw the prisoner open the street door, I went up to her and said; who are you, have you been up to Mr. Cooper; she said, yes, Mr. Cooper is a lodger of mine; I thought she was wrong, I called at the bottom of the stairs to know if he was at home; and found him not at home; I ran three doors off to where he was; I understood from him he did not know her; we pursued her; I lost sight of her while she turned the corner; she was taken at the City Arms, she was sitting drinking beer; when I went to her I saw her with a bundle in her apron; when I let her out of the house and when I saw her at the City Arms she had this same bundle in her apron; I asked her what business had she in my passage; I told her she was the person that was in my passage; she said she had no business there, she had done wrong and she would have given me the things again. We sent for an officer; he searched her, she had a skillet, a pair of shoes, and a candlestick, I knew them to be mine; I had seen the skillet and the candlestick about an hour before.</p>

On the 12th of April Mrs. Winch came to me at the house where I was pointing out a woman then going up the row; we both pursued the prisoner; I lost sight of her as she turned the corner; I saw her afterwards; she had a brass skillet, a candlestick, and a pair of shoes in her apron she owned; that she had taken the property; she said she was very sorry for it, and hoped they would forgive her.</p>

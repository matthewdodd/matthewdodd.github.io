I told him I could get one for nine pence; he said he could get one and a cutlass. Accordingly he came to me the next day, (I lived in Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row) he came to me, and we discoursed on matters, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110027"></xptr>we agreed to go together; we went several nights on Craydon-road, and met with no success. There was a hole in my room that looked in these peoples room, and we saw some boxes in it, and we thought there was some property in them that we could make money of, (I live over their heads, and there was a crack in my room that I could see into their room) with that we agreed to break it open, and we had nothing but the chissel and the poker, which I used to stir the fire with, and we broke it open, and we broke open three boxes in the room; and we took the articles to Mr. Davis, the man that used to buy the property of us, we took them to him, in King's headcourt, Petticoat-lane; we asked four guineas and a half; he would not give that; we agreed to let him have them for forty-five shillings; that is the money he gave for them; and then we came away and divided the money between us. That is the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>

               <p>Q. Are any of those things here? - Yes, some of them; I took some of them and pawned them; there is a cloak and muslin handkerchief, as I pawned them in the Minories for eleven shillings.</p>

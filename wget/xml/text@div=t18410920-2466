                  </hi>. I live in Great York-mews, and am a stable<lb></lb>man. Early in the morning of the 21st of September, I was in the tap-room of the Mint public-house, at Paddington, and I saw the prisoners in there—there were three other persons there asleep—two of them had their hats off—there was a handkerchief on the table, with something tied up in it—I saw Chapel take a pair of stockings first out of a hat—he returned to where Jones was sitting—Chapel then got up again, and took a blue hand<lb></lb>kerchief out of a man's hat, and said to Jones, "They are all asleep, we will have the other bundle"—Jones said, "We may as well have it"—Chapel then went, and took the red handkerchief and the bundle off the table—he said, "Come on now, we wont wait here any longer"—they left the house—I told Mr. Smith, the landlord, of it—I followed them down the railroad—James Batchelor asked them where the bundle was that they took</p>

               <p>out of the tap-room—Jones said, "We have got no bundle"—a railroad policeman came up, Jones took a handkerchief out of his pocket, and threw it away—Chapel was the worse for liquor, but he knew what he was about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Chapel.</hi> I was very tipsy, and did not know what I was doing. When the owner came I took them out of my pocket; as to intending to keep them, I did not.

I am porter to the Great Western railway—Barrett informed Mr. Smith what had happened, and Mr. Smith asked me to go after the prisoners—I found them just inside the gate of the railway—I said, "Which of you have got the bundle you took out of the tap-room?"—Jones said, "Neither of us have"—he then took this blue hand-kerchief out of his pocket and threw it down—I asked them to go back and see if they could find the others—Chapel then took the red handker<lb></lb>chief out of one of his pockets, and the pair of stockings out of the other—he said if they were theirs, there they were, that he never robbed any one in his life—he was the worse for liquor—Jones was sober.</p>

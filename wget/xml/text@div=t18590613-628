                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Beckenham—on Sunday morning, 29th May, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in a coffee-shop in the market-place, Woolwich, asleep—my purse was safe in my pocket before I went to sleep—it contained 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and these three duplicates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know what coins I had—the woman of the coffee-shop awoke me, and asked me if I had lost anything—I put my hand in my pocket, and said, "I have lost my purse and money"—I went out to see if I could find a policeman, and saw the three prisoners—I asked them to give me my purse, but no one answered—I went back to the coffee-shop, and the constable took them—the witness Matzelina told me something, after which I went out in the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a recruit in the Tower Hamlets Militia—on this Sunday morning, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in this coffee-shop, and saw Parker asleep with his head on the table—I saw the three prisoners there—Mahoney put his right hand in the baker's left breeches pocket, took a purse out, and passed it to Donovan, who put it into his right pocket, and afterwards changed it to his left—this is it—McCarthy was only sitting on the other side of the table—I said nothing, or I might have got a crack—the coffee-shop woman awoke Parker, and called him into the parlour so as not to let them hear—the came out and said to the prisoners, "Give the baker the purse"—they said that they had never seen it—Donovan jumped up, and wanted to fight everybody there, and McCarthy said, "Search me"—</p>

               <p>Donovan went out of the shop, came in again, and said, "Come out of this place, do not stop there"—I did not see the prisoners talking together before I saw Donovan put his hand in Parker's pocket.</p>

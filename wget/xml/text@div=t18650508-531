I am a carman, of 4, Heneage-street, Spitalfields—I know all the prisoner by sight—I do not know Green by name—I have known Pope three or four years by his calling at warehouses which I cart for in the City to collect bags and empty hogsheads—he used to call at Hazeldine's—in 1862, he told me that a party he was in the habit of buying hogsheads and packages of at King's-cross or Pentonville, had been in the habit of having suger from Brewer's Quay, and a party named Boreham had been in the habit of carting it for them, but had disappointed them two or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186505080030"></xptr>
               <p>three times, and a party asked him if he knew any one who could cart some, and he thought of me—he asked me if I could do so—I said, "Yes,"and asked where the things were going to—he said "To Pentonville, what time will you have a cart ready to go?"—I said, "In about an hour or an hour and a half"—I asked for the delivery-order—he said that if I would have cart then, he would send a party to go with me to the wharf—I do not know whether he took the note with him, or whether it had been lodged previously—this was at about 9.30 in the morning—Maile, who was a perfect stranger to me, afterwards came—he said that he came from Pope about the cart to go to Brewers' Quay—nothing was said about a delivery-order—I went with the cart and Maile—I have been in the habit of fetching goods from these quays—it is usual to take a delivery-order from the owner of the sugar, and to get it marked in the office, and take it up to the foreman, and then a cart-note issues—we get a weight-note at the place where they are consigned to—we leave the order with the man who delivers the goods—I take the cart note to my employer—here is an entry in my book, "April 22d, 1862, thirty loaves from Brewers' Quay to Pentonville, three shillings cartage"—that was to a person named Child—Maile went down on the wharf and soon afterwards they shouted out, "Bowen, Bowen, what do you want?"—I said, "I believe there are some sugars"—they said, "It is under here"—I drew my cart under the loop-hole, and thirty loaves of sugar were lowered into it—I got this cart note (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it is so long ago I cannot say who gave it to mo, but I know it is the note, because the name is on it—I know the faces of all the pri<lb></lb>soners, but I cannot recognise either of them as having seen him at the warehouse, as I cart for so many people—I had to take the note into Phillips' warehouse, and give it to him, and he gives it to the other foreman to deliver—the cart-notes are always delivered after the goods are delivered into the cart by the foreman—Moule went home after the sugar was in the cart—he told me to take them to York-road, eight doors round by King's-cross, leading up to Battle-bridge, and Pope told me so also—I had a little bit of a note to take them to Mr. Child, at a confectioner's shop—I carted the thirty loaves of sugar there, delivered them to Mr. Child, and received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cartage from him—I put this note on my file, and afterwards found it there—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Brewers' Quay, Mr. Child, received 30 <hi rend="italic">los.</hi> sugar, <hi rend="italic">ex.</hi> Diana, 4c. 3q. 20 lbs. cart Bowen.—Joseph Barber &amp; Co.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert Carew Hunt, and Thomas Turn<lb></lb>bull, the prosecutors—they trade under the name of Joseph Barber and Co., as wharfingers, at Brewers'-quay, and among other things store refined sugars—Phillips was in their employ up to about November last as warehouse-foreman—his duties were the general supervision of the warehouse—it was called Phillips' warehouse—Green was under foreman, assistant foreman, and was employed in the same warehouse—Pope and Maile are not con<lb></lb>nected with our place—if a merchant requires 50 loaves of sugar, he sends a delivery-order for them the form of which varies—if anybody applies for blank orders we supply them; if not, they write on blank paper—it is first taken by the carman, or the person applying for the delivery of the goods to the counting-house at Brewer's-quay—I know the routine, but the head clerk can give it to you as well or better than I can—the clerk signs or initials the delivery-order—he already has an entry of it—he has 1000 loaves of sugar on one side, and on the other he shows how it is dis<lb></lb>posed of—he takes that from the delivery—order after the goods are delivered—no entry is taken of it till it passes to the carman—it is given up in ex<lb></lb>change for the goods by the foreman—supposing the delivery to have taken place at Phillips' warehouse, the order would be returned to the counting-house by the foreman next morning, and written off—the order is copied by the foreman into this book at the time of the delivery of the sugar into the warehouse—the book is kept in the warehouse—Green's writing appears in the books at that time, as keeping them under Phillips' superintendence—I have here the original book, into which the order was copied, and sent into the counting-house with the delivery-orders—the order would then be marked off—we credit the prosecutors, and debit the customers—when the order is marked in the counting-house, the foreman takes it to the person who deli<lb></lb>vered the goods, and a cart-note would be given—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the counterfoils—the foreman would give the delivery-order to another foreman, or to anybody who was disengaged—Green appears to have written most of the counterfoils; he was the delivery foreman—in the ordinary course the counterfoil would show what was the substance of the cart-note—it would be very irregular to give a cart-note without entering the particulars on the counterfoil—this which has been produced by Bowen, bears Green's signature, and I believe the whole of it is his—I can find no record in the delivery-book of any order of 22d April, 1862, to Child or Pope, of 30 loaves of sugar, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Diana, to Bowen's cart, but this is the cart-note; it is in Green's writing, on one of our forms—this is not the first occasion I have looked for it—you will see at the end of this book that some counterfoils are blank, though the cart-notes are gone—we do not number them—I have looked in the place where the delivery-orders of that date are kept, but cannot find one applicable to this transaction—I have looked at 9th September, 1862, and the same answer applies—there is no trace of the transaction, nor of 4 barrels on 2d October—a very considerable quantity, 24 tons, of loaves of sugar has been missed from the warehouse.</p>

COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have the prosecutors been in business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Our late principal was in the business from seventy years ago—stock was last taken in October or November, I believe—stock is taken every five years, of all goods in bond—if goods came in in 1859, stock would be taken of them in 1864; it is taken every five years back, but last year we had a general stock-taking, on account of these deficiencies—all sugar is in bond—it is not our place to take stock like a merchant—I cannot tell you when there was a general stock-taking before; we have never been plun<lb></lb>dered to this extent—goods are taken from the ship into a barge, and sometimes to the quay, and then to the first floor of the warehouse—there are four or five floors—sugar-loaves are generally placed on the first or second floor; they might be placed on the fifth floor on a press—the waste in getting them to the top floor depends on the quality of the sugar—there is some<lb></lb>times considerable waste—I have never sworn that there was half per cent. of waste; I said that if the loss did not exceed a quarter per cent. the mer<lb></lb>chant did not complain—his Lordship made a calculation, but that was upon this fabulous quantity—a quarter per cent. is 5 lbs in the ton—1,262 tons pass through Phillips' warehouse in the year—if it is handled roughly there is more waste, and the waste also depends on the quality, to a certain extent—Phillips Was the head of the warehouse, and had two under foremen, Green and Holman—he had also a great many men under him, thirty men a day on an average, and sixty or eighty if it was a very busy time—these counterfoils in the delivery-order book should be filled up first as if you were writing a cheque—this "J. F." is James Foley's writing; he is a sort of assistant man—"W. F. C." is another assistant on a press; his name is Cave—other people besides Phillips, Green, and Holman wrote counterfoils of cart-notes—this book has the appearance of having bad some counterfoils torn out on 22d April, 1862, and the back is broken or torn—the counterfoil of this cart-note might be torn out on 22d April—the counterfoils both before and after this are dated 22d April—the number of leaves in the books is very irregular—Green had charge of the sugar-floor under Phillips; he was justified in obeying Phillips if he had the delivery-order, and if he saw the goods laden himself—not without, and if he saw the goods delivered he would naturally do it without being told—he has been in the service, I think, seven or eight years—I have been there twelve or thirteen years—there are fifteen or twenty clerks in the counting-house, but it is divided into departments—one clerk principally takes the sugar-books; he is assisted sometimes, if we are pressed—I attended the whole of the re<lb></lb>mands at the Mansion-house—Pope was first given in custody, and was put into the witness-box—the men were acquitted, but not on the whole of the charges, and then Pope was given in custody again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a charge of having appropriated sweepings in the warehouse and sweepings only? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and they were acquitted—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186505080034"></xptr>
               <p>your learned friend suggested that it was the privilege of the workmen to take them, but that is matter of opinion—it was Phillips' duty as superin<lb></lb>endent to see that no loaves went out without a delivery-order, and if he found it was being done to stop it, and call the attention of his principals to the fact—Phillips and Green have been there some time; they bore high characters, and my employers had great confidence in them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">R. SAYRE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a delivery-order be signed by or on behalf of the person who had goods at the wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it would be, "Deliver to So-and-So's cart"—if the goods stood in the name of John Smith, then John Smith would order us to deliver to a certain person's cart so many <hi rend="italic">Cwt.</hi>; if it was to Bowen's cart the order would say so, or we should not deliver it, we should know nothing of the person to whom he was to take it—the man who delivered them at our wharf would not ask the carman to whom they were going, it would be specified on the delivery-order—this delivery-order ought to be signed by Child—the cart-note would be in the same name as the signer of the delivery-order—if Mr. Smith has one hundred loaves of sugar, and sells fifty to Brown, the delivery-order would be, "Deliver fifty loaves to Mr. Brown, who would endorse on the back of the order, "Deliver to So-and-So's cart"—supposing Brown endorsed the delivery-order, the cart-note would be made out in his name.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 18th of February I went to the Horse Guards, and went to the Canteen public-house, and had something to drink—some time after, I met the prisoner, who asked me to treat her—I, being tipsy, treated her with some wine—she seemed to know a good many soldiers whom I treated—when I was leaving she asked me to allow her to get into my chaise as far as she was going—I said she might, and we stopped at various public-houses on the way—I had some money, I think about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had one sovereign, one half-crown, and some shillings—I do not know that I had any other money—it was in a brown purse, which I should know again—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">examining one</hi>)—I saw it safe at the Horse Guards, where I paid for what 1 had, and put it into my pocket—I took it out, and paid at several other public-houses, and then we came to an eating-house by the side of Temple-bar—we stopped, but not long—when I got out of the house I found I bad lost my purse—I thought the prisoner must have it—I rode just through Temple-bar, saw a policeman, and told him of it, and the prisoner was taken to the station-house—my purse contained one sovereign, one half-crown, and one sixpence.</p>

I was on duty In Fleet-street, about one o'clock on Saturday morning last, and saw a one-horse chaise come driving down with three people in it, the prisoner, and a man named Clarke, and the prosecutor—as soon as I got opposite the chaise the prosecutor called out to me—I crossed, and he told me to take Clarke and the prisoner into custody, for he had lost his purse containing 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him to lead his horse down to the station-house—I walked along side the chaise till we got to the Black Horse public-house—I then told the pri<lb></lb>soner and Clarke to get out, and took them to the station-house, and de<lb></lb>sired the prosecutor to go back to the chaise—we did, and searched and found nothing—we returned to the station-house, and the charge was taken—I searched the prisoner, and found this purse, containing one sovereign, one half-crown, and one sixpence in the stocking of her right leg—previous to her being searched she said she had not a farthing about her—after it was found, she said it was hers, that her mother knew it, and knew it well—after that she said she had it given to her at the Horse Guards by a soldier that night—the inspector went up next day, and made inquiries, and found a soldier who she described was on duty—Clarke was discharged, not having any thing.</p>

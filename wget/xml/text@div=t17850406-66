               <p>Court. When did you see him again? - I suppose I might see him two or three times in the course of a month; it certainly was within the week, for he frequently used to come to my house almost every day when he was in the country.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him for your horse? - I did, and he said he had not done with him, he would send him home; I said, very well, only take care of him; some time after that he absconded from the place, and there was a settlement of some money between us, he owed me some.</p>
               <p>What did he abscond for? - I do not know, I suppose it was for debt; but just before he went away, I met a gentleman upon the horse, a person I had not lent the horse to by any means; I asked him how he came by the horse? his name is

               <p>Court. Did the Magistrate commit him? - No he did not inded; he was then in custody; I told the Magistrates, and they laid a detainer; I went to the Grand Jury, and told them the case, and one of the Magistrates drew up a bill, and I carried it in; and I told the Grand Jury, I hoped they would not do him any hurt; I only ay this, I never sold the horse to any man whatever.</p>
               <p>Court. He certainly ought to answer for the horse, you doubt.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have the horse now, I never par with it.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if Mr. Tie had brought an action of trov against Mr. Sambridge, and this evidence had had been given, it would have been very good evidence for him to have recovered the horse.</p>

I saw the prisoner looking in the shop—I went into the parlour and watched, and in a minute or two I saw a person's arm draw the saw from underneath the window—I ran out, and saw the prisoner running up Granby-street—he returned into Stanhope-street—this is the saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. I was in the parlour, and my brother pointed out the prisoner, who was running—he turned the corner to Stanhope-street with his hands before him—there was nobody else there—I was one door from him when he turned—there were some large stones round the corner—he went behind them, then turned, met me, and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "Where is the saw?"—he said, "How should I know?"—there was no one else running that way—he said he had met somebody running down Rutland-street, and I bad better make haste after him, but I had not seen anybody running—he pulled open his coat, and said, "You see I have not got it about me"—he said he lived at Mr. Pea<lb></lb>cock's at the Rutland Arms—I went and found he had lived there two years ago—he was let go that night because we had not found the saw—after nine o'clock that night I went to Stanhope-street to look for the saw, and it was picked up between the shafts of a cart, just opposite the corner the prisoner turned.</p>

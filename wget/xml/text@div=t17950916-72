               <p>Q. What day was this? - Saturday, the 25th of July, and I understand that she went to my box, and took the watch; I was at home working all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your miss your watch? - Between three and four o'clock, out of a little box that stood on the table, in the lower room first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen it since? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your wife return? - About half after three, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe there are a great number of these girls liable to be taken up, as disorderly in your house? - No, there is but one woman in my house, a man and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. This girl had lodged in your house about nine months? - Yes, she lodged up stairs, and came down to attend my wife while she was bad, I thought it was the wife of the man that she lived with.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house is in Salt Peter Bank? - Yes, it is at the top of it. The last time I had seen the watch was about ten o'clock in the day, I had not seen it since that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the watch at all on the table? - I had it in my hand, and was going to put it into my pocket; it was in a box about a quarter of a yard in depth, it went down with a spring.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a silver watch? - A silver watch; I put it in the box myself, and told her not to shake the box, for fear of breaking the glass; I gave her the box to put down, it was not locked, it went down with a spring, I shut it to and gave it her, then I went out along with my sister, about a little business.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return? - Between three and four; as soon as ever I came in I asked where she was? and they told me she was gone out; and I took the box off the table and looked into the box, and see the watch was gone, I went to put my apron in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found the watch since? - No. I never have; I went to a pawnbroker's where it was offered, he is not here.</p>

             put on her hat and cloak and went out, and I see the watch in her hand; she came there Saturday about five o'clock, she went out and never returned till eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Round give her the watch? - No, her back was towards me; I cannot tell what they said together, because they went on the stairs, and whispered to each other; when she came home she said she could not sell the watch; then she went out a little after that, and she came back again and said how that she got two shillings for it; she gave Round a shilling, I see her.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was it? - Silver, a one case watch.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160205"></xptr>Jury. How did you know it was a one case watch? - I see them pull the inside out of the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You examined it then very accurately? - I see them when they laid on the bed, open it.</p>

               <p>Q. I hope you had not eyes behind you; I thought you told us that your back was towards them? - My back was towards them, and then I turned my face to hang up some stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were the works of the watch? - I believe they were yellow, a kind of brass, like another watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Mrs. Round bere? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Never any quarrel between you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now stop a little, take care of yourself; never any quarrel between you? - No, there was no quarrel between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she never struck you? - Yes, she struck me once.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that happen without a quarrel? - We had one or two words, and then she struck me; I do not call that a quarrel, such a few words as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that she had struck you a blow, and that you would never forgive her, and would do for her? - On upon my life I never did say such a yord. I never said them words if I was to be struck a corps this moment, I said she struck me in the time of my sickness, and God Almighty forgive her, for I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how long was it before you told these people of it? - It was two or three days after this was done, when I went to Mrs. Brown's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever use these expressions to Mrs. Brown? - Yes, I did mention it once to Mrs. Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had you to tell Mrs. Brown? - I was saving what a sad thing to strike me in the time of illness; it was hard to strike me at the time that I could not help myself, and she was stronger than I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you see this pretty watch? - About a month before.</p>

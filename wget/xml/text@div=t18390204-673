                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Walter, a pawnbroker, in High-street, St. Marylebone. On the 17th of January, the prisoner offered a gold watch in pledge for three guineas—I asked who it was for, she said for her mistress, Mrs. Weare, at 51, Wimpole-street—I said if she would fetch the owner, I would advance the money—she went out, and I sent a policeman after her—he brought her back—this is the watch.</p>

This is my witch, I have had it thirty-five years—I never sent the prisoner to pawn it—I did not miss it until Mrs. Barton told me of it, about five of six o'clock—I had locked it up in my trinket box the day before—it was my husband's—no one knew where the box was but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 17th of January, at about twenty minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner coming out of the pawnbroker's side door—she walked a short distance, and then commenced running. I followed her to 51, Weymouth-street—she went down the area steps, and into the kitchen—I then knocked at the front door, and asked for the lady of the house—she came—I desired her to have the area gate locked—I then told her the circumstance—I took the prisoner in that house, and asked her if she had been out—she said no, she had not been out—I took her to the pawnbroker,-who identified her.</p>

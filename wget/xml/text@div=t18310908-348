On the evening of the 24th of August, in consequence of a communication from Kirby, I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and caught him in Whitechapel-road; a 5s. paper of copper was found on him, which I can speak to - it was tied in part of a newspaper, and I had the other parts of the same paper, which exactly corresponded, and which likewise contained penny-pieces; it was part of the Morning Advertiser, of the 4th of August.</p>

            . I am the niece of the prosecutor, and live in his house. On the evening of the 24th of August, we had seven 5s. papers of copper in his bed-room, tied up in newspapers - I went into the room, and saw them all safe at nine o'clock; my uncle was then at home - he went out just afterwards, and the prisoner left about half-past eleven; he had no business in that room, but could get there- as soon as he was gone I went into the room, and missed one paper; my uncle came home soon afterwards, and I informed him - he went after the prisoner; I have since seen the paper of copper found on him - it is in the same paper, tied in the same way, and to the best of my belief, is the paper which was missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you placed it in the bedroom? A. No.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went in pursuit of the prisoner with the prosecutor, we overtook him in Whitechapel-road, and found on him a 5s. paper of copper, tied up in this newspaper - the paper broke, but I have preserved it, and produce it; I went to the prisoner's lodging, No. 20, Alfred-street, White Horse-lane, Stepney, and found there, a bottle of wine, a bottle of brandy, and some other bottles, with Mr. Brett's seal on them - before we went befor the Magistrate, I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Brett has lost several papers of coppers;" he said he had never meddled with any before, and he did not know what induced him to do it then, except that he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. BRETT. Q. Had you not given or sold spirits and wine to the prisoner? A. I certainly had both given and sold him some about Christmas, in consequence of his wife being confined, but I am quite confident I never gave him this brandy.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been with you? A.About two years; I always considered him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

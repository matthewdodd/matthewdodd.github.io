                  </hi>. I live at 4, Clarendon-villas, Stoke Newington—about a quarter to 6 on the morning of 1st August, I was called up by the police, came downstairs, and found the front-door open, and the police in the hall—they called out, "You have thieves in the house"—I found the drawing-room clock, which was on the mantel-piece the night previous, on the hall table—the doors were safe when I went to bed about 11 o'clock—the servant forgot to shut the shutters, and they came in through the window—the window was closed but not fastened.</p>

About a quarter after 5 on the morning of 1st August, I was on duty in Mildmay-park—I passed 4, Clarendon-villas, and saw the two prisoners coming out of the door—Smith had got something under his arm—I could not see what it was—I followed them, and as soon as they saw I was coming after them, they began to run—I pursued them, and caught Carey by a large stone near the flue of a greenhouse—I told him I should take him to the station, for being in a house in Mildmay-park—I saw the prisoner's faces as they came out of the house—I only lost sight of Carey for about a minute, when I was talking to a sergeant I met in my pursuit—I saw Smith throw an empty bag over a wall at the back of an empty house—I picked it up—I pointed the prisoners out to the sergeant as having been into the house, and said I wanted them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith's Defence.</hi> I went out on this morning to cut turf on Hackney<lb></lb>downs, for my birds. I knew it was wrong to do so; I had been told about it before. While there a bricklayer came up and said, "Here is the constable coming after you." I thought it was for cutting the turf and ran away into this man's arms.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Carey's Defence.</hi> I went to sleep on Hackney-downs on this night. When I woke I was very wet, and went and laid under a stone. The constable came up and said he would knock my brains out for making him run so far. I said, "What do you want me for?" He said, "For breaking into some house. I said, "I know nothing about it."</p>

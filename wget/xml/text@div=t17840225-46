               <p>On Saturday night the 7th of February, I was sitting in my parlour, about seven o'clock, and I heard a smash of my windows, in the parlour adjoining to my shop, and I jumped up, and leaped over the table, I knew the door was tied, and by main strength I broke the cords which tied it, one was tied round the door, and one was tied round the iron rails; as I have been at sea myself, I knew it must be a sailor that tied it; I flew out into the street, and run up the street; there were numbers of people that cried, there he is; I heard his footsteps, but there were several people between him and me; when I came to the corner, the back of Burlington Gardens, it being then quite open and light from the snow underneath, I saw the prisoner at the bar running, at the corner of Lady Grosvenor's house, turning from Bond-street towards Saville-row.</p>
               <p>Court. How far had you gone from your own door when you saw him? - I suppose it is one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>The man you saw running you pursued? - Yes, one of the witnesses, a little boy, endeavoured to throw him down, instead of falling down, he threw the stockings down under his knees; he turned clear of him, and run into my arms; I saw him throw something down, a chairman that was coming by caught hold of him; at the same time a pair of stockings were picked up by the boy, and two pair more were picked up by other people.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He used very abusive language.</p>
               <p>Was any body running by him? - No.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Payne Street, Barnsbury—the deceased was my sister; her name was Clara Quaife; she lived with the prisoner for a number of years—on Easter Tuesday she came to me between 1 and 2 o'clock, and asked me to go and have a cup of tea, but I did not—she had no wound then—I saw her again at a little after 4, when she came from the hospital with her head dressed, and in the evening I saw her again—she was very poorly from that time, and said that she felt very ill and complained of pains in her head—I saw her on Saturday, 3rd May, on the bed very ill, and complaining of pains in her head—she died on the Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner had lived with her sixteen years, but she worked for herself—she went to the Kensal Green Cemetery on Easter Monday—I saw her every day in Easter week.</p>

I am the wife of Alfred Evans, of 5, Albert Terrace—on the Tuesday in Easter week the deceased came to me between 3 and 4 p.m. with a towel round her forehead, and a wound as long as my finger, it was bleeding; I put a cloth on it, and went with her to the Great Northern Hospital, where the wound was dressed—I saw her once after that on the same day, but not afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Denmark Grove, Barnsbury—the prisoner and the deceased lived in my house for about 4 1/2 years—on Easter Tuesday afternoon Brock came home intoxicated—the deceased was out, but she came home afterwards; I heard something fall, and immediately afterwards she called out "Oh, you have cut my head open"—she came down imme<lb></lb>diately and showed me the cut—Brock was upstairs at the top of the house and she at the bottom—it was across her forehead about two inches long, and was bleeding very much—the fall was a loud crack; it sounded some<lb></lb>thing like a chair—it was something coming in contact with the floor—I had seen her the day before I think—there was no cut on her forehead then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. She went to the cemetery on the Monday—I believe he found the door locked when he came home—I don't know whether he laid down on the floor and went to sleep—I am in the house every day—the deceased went out as usual I believe after 15th April—I saw her go out sometimes—I was told that she had an apoplectic fit—that was on the Saturday before she died—she was sober I believe when she came home.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187905260074"></xptr>
               <p>—she complained of her head, and when I came back I saw her at the King of Denmark sitting on a form—I asked her where she lived—she said she could not tell mo—I got assistance, and she was taken home, and I put her on a sofa—I have known her a year and a half, and never saw her the worse for liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I saw her well at a little after 10 o'clock going down Chapel Street—she was taken ill at the top of Chapel Street—I saw her again in the public-house at 10.45; she was then apparently in a fit, and the governor was giving her a glass of cold water—she was unconscious—I carried her home and left her in the care of the people of the house, and told them to send for a doctor.</p>

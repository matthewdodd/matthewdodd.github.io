I am the wife of George Bell, bricklayer, of 8, Union Street, Greenwich—I saw the prisoner, prosecutor, and another man come up the court—and saw Cooper go to sleep on a door-step, and the prisoner by him—they were both very tipsy—they sat there for some time, and went partly to sleep, and I saw the prisoner put his band in Cooper's pocket, and take something out—then he took Lin arm and dropped it down, and pulled his coat from under his arm, and took something out of Cooper's breast-pocket and then got up and went away—I communicated with two men, and gave a description of the prisoner.</p>

I live at 3, Busby Court, Greenwich—on 13th July I was working at a blacksmith's shop, and saw Cooper and the prisoner sitting on a door-step—Cooper was asleep, with his hand on his pocket—the prisoner took it off, and he roused; the prisoner then pretended to be asleep, and I was called away.</p>

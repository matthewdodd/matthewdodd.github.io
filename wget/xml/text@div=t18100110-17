The prisoner came to me, and hired the horse on Monday, the 13th of November last, about nine o'clock in the morning.

               <p>Q. What space of time was the horse hired for. - A. For a few hours; to go to Hampstead, he said. I believe he was going to see his brother-in-law, and he wanted the horse for a ride.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you apprehended him. - A. I and another man, a hackney coachman. When I apprehended him, he said, how do you do, I am glad to see you; I said, how do you do, walk over the bridge and we will have something to drink; he said, I would as soon drink with you as any man. We walked over the bridge, I had hold of one arm, and the hackney coachman the other, and when we got over the bridge, he refused going any further; he said, what business had we to lead him that way. The coachman said, I am an officer, I will take you for horse stealing; I said, do not make words here; the prisoner said, show your authority. He could not show any authority; a mob gathered round, I had hold of him; I said, it is of no use your refusing going with me, for go you shall; I insist upon knowing where my horse is.

               <p>Q. What was to be the hire of it for the day - A. I never told him, nor he did not ask the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. It might be a week. He came into the yard, and put his horse up to bait; he paid for the corn, and asked me to direct him to Mr. Mitchell, a linen-draper, in Leadenhall-street; he said his brother-in-law lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the horse after you had brought him back - A. I sent him off a journey about three or four hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring him home to your master's stables - A. I brought him home to my master's stables.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he is the same horse - A. I am sure he is the same horse; he was a chesnut gelding, with a bald face and four white legs; we had him about four or five months.</p>

               <p>Q. It does sometimes happen - A. It never happened with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took hold of him, he went very quietly with you till you pinched his arm holding him fast, then he wanted to see your authority - A. No man behaved more like a gentleman than he did: he is a gentleman all over him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BORADIL. I live at a livery-stable, Grosvenor-place, near Hyde-park-corner. The prisoner came to me on the 13th of November, about twelve o'clock; he asked me to take care of his horse; he brought him to bait at our stables; he went out of the yard, and returned in five minutes, and said, he wished the horse to be cleaned, as he had got two or three gentlemen coming from Tattersall's to look at the horse; he wished me to make haste. I asked him, if he was going to sell the horse? he said, he was. I asked him, where he brought the horse from? he said, Bourn, in Lincolnshire. He said, he rode him all the way up from Bourn, in Lincolnshire; he had no further use for the horse, and he wished to sell him. I asked him, what the horse was used to do, whether it would draw; he said, it had been generally used in the country to carry double. I asked him, if he warranted the horse sound? he said, no, he did not; he did not want to have further trouble with him. I had the horse turned up and down the yard, to see if he was sound. I bought the horse for fourteen guineas. I asked him for his address; he gave me his address,

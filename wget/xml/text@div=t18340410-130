            . I was standing inside my shop in Houndsditch, and saw this truck going down - the prisoner and another were going along the pavement; they looked very hard at the truck - I opened the door and saw the prisoner step off the pavement, and go to the back of the truck - he seemed to do something to it - he then came on the pavement again, then went to the truck, then came on the pavement again, and so he kept on for some distance - he then went to the truck, took out this paper parcel, and came back as far as Church-row - the patrol was there - I stepped to the patrol, and told him to take him - the prisoner then turned up Church-row, and ran as fast as he could - when he got near the end, he threw this parcel over the church wall; he was then taken.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ABRAHAM. I am a policeman - I only know the prisoner by having apprehended him on this charge - I did not say it would be better or worse for him to say anything - I went to his house and requested to see him - I said I had something particular to communicate to him, and wished him to accompany me to a public-house at the top of the court; and when I got to the top of the court I said it was no use to deceive him, that I was a constable, and had a charge of felony against him - I told him the nature of the charge; that I wanted him on a charge of having taken 35l. from his employers, and my only object in requesting him to come there was for the purpose of getting him identified by Fisher, jun. who was close by - he then said, "It is no use to give yourself that trouble; I am the person, I acknowledge having taken the money, and I do not wish to see Mr. Fisher" - he said it was the most unfortunate circumstance of his life, and he supposed he must stand the consequence of it - he was sorry to say his case could not be more deplorable than it was - he said he had unfortunately taken the money for the purpose fo going to a gambling house - that he went to Rowbottom's at the Finish, in James Street, Covent Garden, where he had lost the whole, and he thought he should be able to replace it the next morning - I was before the magistrate when he made a statement(looking at the deposition) - this is the signature of Mr. Dyer - it was correctly taken down from his mouth - nothing was said to induce him to make the statement - he stated this after he heard my evidence and the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>The deposition being read, stated the evidence of Abraham, as detailed above, and stated that the prisoner in reply said, "I admit it to be true."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Abraham has sworn I told him I took the money from Mr. Fisher for the purpose of going to a gambling house, which I deny; I never told him any such thing - I must leave my case to the merciful consideration of the Judge and jury.</p>
               <p>MR. FISHER, JUN. He could not have had a better character that he bore up to the time in question - he was trusted with money to a great amount to take to the bankers - he has a wife and two children.</p>

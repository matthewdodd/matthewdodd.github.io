On Tuesday, the 1st of August, at night, we missed all the property stated in the indictment - I had seen it safe in the afternoon. The watch was in my bed-room. The prisoner was the first person who gave the alarm. I had sent her up stairs to see if the child was asleep, she came down, and said my room-door was open. I immediately went up, found the door and window open, and a lamp, which I always leave when the child is abed, put out, and put under the bed - the door was on the latch before - it was always kept locked till the child was put to bed. This property was gone. I immediately called my husband up - he came, saw the state of the room, and concluded some one had got in unperceived, and put the things out of window. On the Saturday following the prisoner wanted to go away; I consented to her going on Sunday - she said she was going to her friends in Herefordshire, and on Sunday morning, when she left, I had her apprehended by two constables. My property was all produced on the Thursday following by Coates - it was worth above 10 l. She told me she was first going to Kensington Gravel-pits.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marylebone. On Sunday, the 6th of August, I was sent for to the prosecutor's, and watched the prisoner out of the house, thinking she was going to Kensington Gravel-pits, instead of which she went into a house in Oxford-buildings. She had a box with her - she came out without it. I apprehended her in a few minutes, took her back to the house, and told her I took her on suspicion of being concerned in robbing Mr. Shain, she declared her innocence. I then searched her box, and found two wine-glasses and some papers of tobacco. I took her to the watch-house, and on Monday morning she said to me,</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose Mrs. Shain will forgive me, if I inform her where her things are?" I said she might do as she pleased, I could not tell what Mrs. Shain might do. She then said if I would let her go close to Charing-cross she would fetch the box. I went with her and another constable to a house in a court in Villers-street. She took me up stairs to a room, unlocked the door with a key which she took from behind a partition; we found no box there - she appeared alarmed about what had become of it. The woman of the house came in, she asked her where the box was? she said,</p>
               <p>"I have sent it, according to your direction, to your mother's in Herefordshire - I have taken it to the Green Man and Still to go there." I took the prisoner to the Green Man and Still, and found a box had been sent on the day before, which was Sunday. I took the prisoner to Marlborough-street, and set off for Hereford. She gave me a direction; I wrote it down as I stood by her - I have lost it. She told me it was directed to

            , to be left at Mr. Davis's, shoemaker, Hereford. I went to Davis's, and found the box had not been delivered, but I found it at the coach-office - I produce it - it contains the articles stated in the indictment. Before I sat off she informed me where the key was in the prosecutor's house, and I found it there.</p>

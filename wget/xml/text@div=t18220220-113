On the 11th of February, I found six pair of soles hid in a box in the cellar, covered with something; I told Russell of it, and he saw them, and just after that as the prisoner was going to dinner, we were in the cellar; he put his coat on, and came up; and after he was gone, I went down and found three pair gone - about five o'clock he went out of the cellar, the three pair remained then - he was alone for a few minutes. I went down and missed two pair more - he was then gone to tea. Russell marked the remaining pair, and at eight I left him in the cellar for a few minutes. I then went down, sent him up, and saw the other pair was gone. He was stopped, and the leather found on him in the counting-house, in his bosom; he denied having it, but when it was found, he said it was the first time. Mr. Jackson said it was not, and he then said he had sold a good many pieces to a man named Wright.</p>

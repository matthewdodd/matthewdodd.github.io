                  </hi>. On Sunday, the 10th of April, I went with two other persons to the Crown and Sceptre, in Wilmer-street, Poplar. I had some ale there—I took a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of my pocket to get change of the</p>

               <p>landlord, but he could not give it me—I put the note into my pocket again, as I thought, but I cannot say whether I did or not—I afterwards missed the note—the prisoner was potman at the public-house—I asked him in the morning if he knew any thing about the note—he said he did not—I missed this piece of cloth now produced, which was in the same pocket with the note—I asked the prisoner if he knew anything about the cloth—he said he did, and he took it from behind the box—I knew the number of the note, and stopped it at the Bank of England—this now produced is it—it was endorsed at the Joint Stock Bank.</p>

On the Tuesday afternoon, about a quarter-past three o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for Mrs. Parker, who is his niece—I said she was not at home—he came again about four o'clock—I then asked him to walk in and sit down—he said he was very thirsty, and asked me to get him some beer—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to get change, and pay for the beer—I got the change and brought it, and gave it him.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ on the 2d of January; these two hats are mine - they had been given him to finish; I do not know of their being delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it your custom to take account of the articles delivered to the men? A. Yes, and they are responsible for them at the end of the week - if any are deficient they are not to be paid for by them; if a man was to say, "Here are two hats short, which have been stolen," I should make him pay for them - such instances have occurred.</p>
               <p>HENRY JONES. I am in Mr. Moore's employ. On the 2d of January I found these hats concealed behind the steam-boiler, in the shop where the prisoner was at work- they were unfinished: I took them out, and asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of them - he denied it, but afterwards said they were his: he took them, and went to open them - I went to a distance, saw him crush one up and put it into his hat; in a few minutes he did so with the other, and put a piece of slate over them - I went and told the young man in the shop below; he came up and said, "Whose are these?" the prisoner said, "They are mine" - he then went and got the watchman.</p>




               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a person named Holmes in the employ of Mr. Moore? A. Yes - he was examined before the Magistrate; he is not here - he did not say that he hand put one of the hats into the prisoner's hat; it was about twenty minutes to nine o'clock when I saw the hats - Holmes and Almond were working in the shop at the other end; I asked the prisoner who put them there - it was the prisoner's duty to work on hats in the warehouse; these hats were crushed up, and put behind the steam-boiler - a person might go to the boiler without seeing them, as there was no light near there, I went to the boiler, and put my hand accidentally on them- there were five or six lights in the room; it is about ten yards long - the boiler is there for the men to put their hats on; I saw the prisoner put them into his hat - I do not think he knew I saw him; I said I thought it was not a fit place for them to be in - after that he put them into his hat, and a piece of slate on, which he had his work down on; he did say he thought it was a silk handkerchief - I have seen him wear a handkerchief; when he came in the morning he used to take off his handkerchief and put it into his hat - he was at work that night without a handkerchief; Holmes was discharged by Mr. Moore because he worked in the same shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Holmes have any thing to do with the hats? A. No - I spoke to the prisoner and Holmes about them; they both denied knowing any thing about them - I did not leave the shop; I saw him put them into his hat in about a quarter of an hour - the prisoner said, "They are my property" - the young man said, "Are they not Mr. Moore's?" he said No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ALMOND. I received information from Jones - I took a light, and went up stairs to the steam-copper; my brother was working at the other end - I looked into the copper; the prisoner then had his back towards it -I saw his hat on a shelf near the boiler; I took it and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "They are my property;" I said, "Are you sure they are not Mr. Moore's" - he said, "No, they are my property;" I thought it very odd - I locked the two men in the room, and went down to Mr. Moore - he said they were his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150013"></xptr>hats; I went and got the watchman, and took him up stairs - the prisoner had then got his clothes on; I went and said to the prisoner, "Where is the other hat?" which I had left in his hat - he said, "What hat? I have seen no hat;" I went round to the steam-copper, and this hat was put into a small hole where the steam came out - he was then taken to the watch-house, and there he said they were Mr. Moore's hats, which he had to finish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Holmes was then in the service of the prosecutor? A. Yes, but has been dismissed; Holmes had been there three or four months - he was accounted a good steady man; the prisoner generally wore a white handkerchief, but I cannot say what he wore that day - he said before the Magistrate that he thought it was his black silk handkerchief, but I had taken one hat out and shewn it him; he could not think it was a handkerchief - if these hats had been delivered to him to finish he must have returned them, or given some account of them; I do not know whether he would have had to pay for any that he did not return.</p>

            . I am night-constable. The prisoner was brought to me with the hats; I asked if they were his - he said, "No, Mr. Moore's."</p>
               <p>MR. MOORE re-examined. Q. Why did you dismiss Holmes? A. They were taken before the Magistrate together, and I have no doubt but he knew the prisoner stole the hats; it is most painful to me to bring the man here - he is married, and has a family; he has behaved well till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Two men called at the shop and I went to give them some refreshment - I came back in about three hours; Jones brought the hats, and put them on my board - I know nothing about them; I asked Holmes how they came there in that state - he said he put one there; I took one and steamed it, and then I certainly did put them into my hat - I told Almond they were mine, being my work.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in the Borough. On the 3d of July I was in Holland-street, Blackfriar's-road, and saw the prisoner with a basket of bread on his shoulder - I followed him to the top of Holland-street, and on to Blackfriar's-bridge; the master of the bread came up, and asked me if I had seen a man with a basket of bread - I said, Yes; and we went on to the bridge - he came up to the prisoner first, and took the basket from him - the prisoner struggled to get away - he said he did it for want.</p>

            . I am the officer, and took charge of the prisoner on the 3d of July - I took the bread and the basket - here is the basket.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. WITTY. Q. Did you see the officer receive the same basket that Kinsey took from the prisoner? A. Yes; I lived with Josiah Kinsey's master, and had carried this basket, which I had made for myself - it holds just twenty four loaves; I left four months ago - I know the basket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Why is not Kinsey here? A. I do not know why; I do not know whether he has any other name.</p>

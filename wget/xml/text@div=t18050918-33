            , of Birchin-lane. This is the paper that was presented to me for payment on the 9th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was that presented? - A. I cannot say by whom; the shop was full of people at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say the prisoner was the person that presented the draft to you; but that person, whoever he was that presented that draft to you, did he remain some time in the shop? - A. Near a quarter of an hour, to the best of my recollection.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180025"></xptr>Q. When that was presented to you what did you first do? - A. I suspected it not to be Mr. Blake's writing, I requested Mr. Carter to go to Mr. Blake, in Change-alley, for the purpose of enquiring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Blake keep cash in your house? - A. Yes; he had cash in our house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Carter went what became of the draft you have now in your hands? - A. I do not recollect positively about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the hand writing of Mr. Blake? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper whether any on the whole of it is his hand-writing? - A. I do not think any part of it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You are familiar with his hand-writing? - A. Yes, being a customer to our house some years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What did you do with the cheque? - A. I put my initials and the day of the month that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put it when Mr. Carter went to Mr. Blake? - A. If I did not give it to Mr. Carter, I kept it in my own possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Or perhaps you laid it down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether you gave it to him or no? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being applied to by the last witness on the 9th of July, in the afternoon of that day? - A. I recollect it very well: Mr. Halifax gave me the draft, which I took in my hand: I went to Mr. Blake; I found him in his shop; he returned with me to the banking-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that paper writing, and tell me whether that is the same that he delivered over to you? - Q. This is the same piece of paper that Mr. Halifax delivered over to me: when I got back to the banking-house with Mr. Blake, after I turned round the end of the counter, Mr. Blake asked me, who was the man? He immediately went towards the door to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at that time in the shop? - A. The man whom Mr. Halifax pointed out to me as the man that presented the draft was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether that was the prisoner at the bar? - A. I cannot positively swear, I only took a superficial look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man do that Mr. Halifax pointed out to you? - A. As Mr. Blake spoke, he turned round and made towards the door and went out; he seemed to brush out very briskly: I did not see the person again till I was summoned before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mr. Blake after that? - A. He went after the person that I pointed out, who presented the draft, immediately, crying out stop thief! I remained in the banking-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the person you took the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have not seen him since I took him; I brought him into Birchin-lane, and delivered him to Mr. Blake.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MELLISH, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I was going from Cornhill up Birchin-lane, and when I had got about half way from Cornhill, I heard a cry of stop thief behind, and a man came running the same side of the way I was, and ran up an alley which leads into George-yard; at that time another man was running after him, and he got into the alley rather before me; I got time enough into George-yard to observe both the men running, and to see the last man take the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the last witness? - A. I cannot say it is the last witness, I have not seen him since; I am positive it was the same man that was taken in George-yard that was running in Birchin-lane; the person that was taken in George-yard is the prisoner at the bar, I saw him taken, and I saw him running in Birchin-lane; I only lost sight of him just turning the corner.</p>

Seeing a mob at Mr. Blake's door, I went to see what was the matter, and an officer being wanted, I went and fetched one, who took charge of the prisoner, and took him to the Compter; I accompanied them both, and after the last examination I had a conversation with the prisoner; he said, if I am hanged, it is all through Hobler, the Lord-Mayor's clerk, for having committed him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. On the 9th of July I was fetched to Mr. Blake's house, I took the prisoner into custody to the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. (To Halifax.) Q. You are familiar with the hand-writing of Mr. Blake? - A. Yes; that is not the hand-writing of Mr. Blake. (Looking at the draft.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Carter.) Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr. Blake? - A. I am; that is not the hand-writing of Mr. Blake, no part of it, to the best of my belief. (The note was read in Court.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner. Did you see me put the purse on the ledge? - Yes, I did see her put the purse upon the ledge. The aunt was walking off and Mrs. West was following her; I pulled my glove off, put my hand in my pocket and found my purse was gone.</p>
               <p>What passed in the lobby? - Mr. Lucas drove her down to the lobby; after Mr. Lucas had secured the prisoner, he went to see for the person she called her aunt: the prisoner was taken to Sir

               <p>Court. What led you to distinguish at the time, whether it was her hand or her aunt's? - She was close to my right side; her aunt was before me; I felt her hand in my pocket; I could have taken her hand in my pocket, but I pulled my glove off, and then when I put my hand in my pocket my purse was gone.</p>
               <p>[The purse and its contents were produced by Mr. Lucas.]</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Is that your property? - I can swear to this crown; it has a particular cut in it; it has been in my pocket a number of years; one is a King William's, the other a Queen Anne's.</p>

               <p>This purse and the pieces of money I saw the prisoner lay on a corner of a kind of ledge, at a door-way that enters into the Board of Works; I immediately laid hold of her; I had before seen her in the painted chamber where Lord Chatham lay in state; I told her she had no business there, and desired the officer to turn her out, and said, if she came there any more I should order the officer to take her into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lucas was not in the place at the time the lady said she lost her purse; another woman and me were together.</p>
               <p>Lucas. As I came down stairs, the prosecutrix and the prisoner were by the door of the Board of Works. Upon hearing a contest between them, I took Mrs. West up into a corner that she might not get near any body till the officer came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I saw Mrs. Bastin, he was not near the place; I was not near the ledge; I never had the purse in my hand. I have a material witness that is not come to town.</p>

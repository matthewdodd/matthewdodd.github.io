               <p>I live in Green-street, Leicester-fields; I had a few friends in town the day before this happened, we got rather forward in liquor; about twelve in the evening I parted with my friends, and I took a walk up Leicester-fields and met the prisoners, and they asked me to give them a glass of wine; I denied them, and crossed <placeName id="t17870912-95-crimeloc450">Prince's-street</placeName>

               <p>Was you in liquor so much as to be able to know you had it in your pocket? - I saw it to a certainty; I had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120139"></xptr>You are perfectly satisfied you did not give it to either of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. You had been making merry with your friends? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was pretty far gone in liquor? - I was merry; I am not obliged to tell how many bottles of wine I drank.</p>
               <p>You was intoxicated? - I was not considerably.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you looked at your watch? - I suppose about half an hour.</p>
               <p>You did not call for any assistance? - I had no occasion to call for assistance before I was robbed.</p>
               <p>The first notice you had of your watch being missing, was it being in the watchman's hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it possible that the watch might drop from your pocket? - It never did drop out from my pocket, it did drop from one or the other, but I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Do you take upon yourself to declare upon your oath, that it was impossible, in the situation you was in, that the watch did not drop out of your pocket? - I should think so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where may you live, Sir? - In Green-street.</p>
               <p>Are you master of a house? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Are you a servant? - Neither, Sir, I lodge there.</p>
               <p>A single man I hope? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had been enjoying the whole day with your friends, and enjoyed the evening afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left your house at twelve? - Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What hour was it this affair happened? - I believe it was a quarter before one.</p>
               <p>What journey did you take for three quarters of an hour? - I turned up St. Martin's-lane, up Leicester-street, and into Princes-street.</p>
               <p>You ventured all along the Strand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many common women did you speak to there? - I never spoke to any.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - For a certainty.</p>
               <p>Have you never said otherwise? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Where was it you spoke to these people? - They spoke to me, I am sure I did not speak to one woman on my journey; when they stopped me I went upon the step of a door, and they asked if I would go home with them; I told them, I would not; they were close on each side of me; they pressed me to go on the step, I could not very well go from them; they got upon the step as well as me; when I missed the watch, I was more sober than I was before.</p>
               <p>The air sometimes has an effect upon people when they have been drinking? - That's not always the case with me.</p>
               <p>Suppose the watch had fallen on any part of the woman's gown, then it might not have been broken; your only reason for supposing that the watch did not drop out of your pocket, was its not being injured in any part? - My reason is, the watch not being injured.</p>
               <p>Might not the watch have fallen on one of the women's gowns so as not to be injured? - It was impossible for the watch to have fallen out of my pocket without being taken out.</p>
               <p>Tell me your reason for saying so? - I have no other reason but that it is impossible that my watch should go out of my pocket without somebody taking it out.</p>
               <p>Court. In a word, the gentleman means to ask you whether any part of your clothes were in such a situation that the watch might drop out? - No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Had you occasion to pull out your watch in the course of your walk? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did you look at your watch just before you left your house? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Might not you have fixed your watch loosely in your pocket? - My watch could not drop out without taking out; I fixed it as secure as if I was sober, I did not see it laying upon the ground, but I saw the watchman take it up.</p>
               <p>Behind which of the women was the watch taken? - He said behind the black woman.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - I sometimes do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120140"></xptr>business at the stock-exchange, I have a small income of my own.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you a hook to the watch? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose you could by any accident have dropped your watch out of your pocket, could it possibly have dropped where it was found by the watchman? - It could not.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; on the 30th of August as I had just done calling the hour of one, I saw the prosecutor and those two prisoners standing at a door, No. 23, Gerrard street; I thought they had been the family belonging to the house; when I came within a few yards, the gentleman said, watchman, I am robbed of my watch! I asked the gentleman who had robbed him? he said it was one of these women, but which he could not tell; the black woman,

               <p>Where did the watch lay when you picked it up? - Very near the left hand side of the door.</p>
               <p>Did it lay near the prosecutor or near the women? - Near the black woman.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you, from the place in which it lay, that it could or did drop out of the gentleman's pocket? - The watch was about three yards from the gentleman; the two women were between the gentleman and the watch; I took the prisoners to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. What distance was you from them when you first saw them? - Not the length of this Court, only four doors.</p>
               <p>They were very quiet, were they? - I did not hear a word till I came within three yards of them, they stood entirely still, they did not change their position.</p>
               <p>Do you say the watch was near the black woman? - The white woman was standing next the gentleman, and the black was next to her; the gentleman told me he was robbed by one of the women, he could not tell which; he was not very sober, but he was capable of going to the watch-house with me.</p>

               <p>Had the gentleman at that time complained of having lost his watch? - He had; the black woman rose again, and turned round to the parties; when the watchman came up, I told him I had seen the black woman stoop down, but what she laid out of her hand I did not know; I saw the watchman pick up the watch.</p>

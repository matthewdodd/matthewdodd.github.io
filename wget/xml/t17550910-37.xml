             and company; but at the time that this man said he had six quarters of oats out of my lighter, and that my lighter was taken, and carried up to Black-friars, it was not so; it is intirely false; I never miss'd my oats; neither was I ever charged with bringing oats short to the wharf ; neither do I know that my lighter was ever taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember how many oats you had in your lighter, at the time he mentions?</p>
               <p>Davis . I had about fourscore quarters, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did it belong to?</p>
               <p>Davis . To Messrs. Ratcliff and Topham.</p>
               <p>Q. Was none of that missing?</p>
               <p>Davis. There were none miss'd, neither was I charged with any. When we take corn in we have a meeter's bill, and I always deliver that bill up at the compting-house, when my craft is empty; and if there had been any lost, when I deliver'd up that bill, I should have heard it; but I never did, till I heard Hicks and the prisoner confess it; but I never miss'd any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear any complaint of bringing short measure?</p>
               <p>Davis. I never heard any complaint; but that my bill and my leading agreed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you land that fourscore quarters?</p>
               <p>Davis. At Trig-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loose in the lighter, or in sacks?</p>
               <p>Davis. There was some loose, and some in sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there quite fourscore quarters?</p>
               <p>Davis. I have accounted with my principals for fourscore quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Davis. I am a corn lighterman, and do that business for Messrs. Ratcliff and Topham.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you the person that took up the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Davis. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did you take him up?</p>
               <p>Davis. I sent the prisoner to watch my lighter; and on a Saturday-evening I desired him to make haste home in the morning; and I was uneasy he did not come till eleven. I sent my other apprentice to see if my craft was safe; and he returned, and said there were five sacks of malt put into her. I said, that is something strange. I said to the prisoner, do you go, and take care of the goods; but he neglected, and did not go up; but my other servant went again, and returned, and told me, he had convoy'd the craft, and put them five sacks into the barge's cabin. After that I heard there were three quarters of malt lost, from

            . I told Nedriff he must take the prisoner up and bring him to justice, and if he would not, I would never deliver him up his goods. I took the prisoner before a constable; then he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100031"></xptr> told me, he had robb'd my lighter of six quarters of oats. I told him then, I did not know that I had lost any, nor do I know it this hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether in the month of January, there was any oats consign'd to you from the country or not?</p>
               <p>Davis. To be sure there was a great deal of corn in my craft, in the month of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name a particular time in the month?</p>
               <p>Davis. I cannot say what time.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell by your books?</p>
               <p>Davis. I have not got my books about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell what quantity was brought by your lighter, about the 26th of January last?</p>
               <p>Davis. I believe there might be about ninety quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never miss any oats at that time?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; I never did. I have been paid for the lighteridge of all that corn, I never was bated or tax'd a farthing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear any complaint; did they never say, Mr. Davis, my corn does not make out according to the bill?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you measure the corn?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; it is measured to me, and I bring it up, and deliver it with the meeter's bill, to the compting-house. Then he is to take care, and see whether there is so much as the bill mentions.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it might be in sacks, about the twenty-sixth of January?</p>
               <p>Davis. I believe there might be forty-five quarters in sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible for your servants to take some out of one sack, and some out of another, and make up the quantity of six quarters, and yet deliver in the same number of sacks?</p>
               <p>Davis. I do not know whether it is possible to be done or not; and I know the trade very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you, upon your oath to say, it is impossible to lose six quarters, and your gentlemen know nothing of the matter?</p>
               <p>Davis. I believe it impossible out of so small a quantity, but it must be missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you charg'd with the sacks being missing?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; I am not. But if the right number of sacks had not been delivered, I must have had a complaint about them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner to serve of his apprenticeship?</p>
               <p>Davis. He has no longer to serve than February next.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you lose twelve sacks, and yet not miss them?</p>
               <p>Davis. That is not in my province, that belongs the grainery-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the grainery-keepers measure the oats when they receive them of you?</p>
               <p>Davis. That, that is in sacks, they never measure, that, that is loose, they measure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the loose corn delivered into the grainery?</p>
               <p>Davis. That I cannot say; sometimes they let it lie in the lighter, and load it away in carts, without putting it in the grainery.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hicks. What time in January did you and the prisoner take these oats out of Davis's lighter?</p>
               <p>Hicks. It was the latter end of January; I cannot say the day of the month, but I am sure, it was in January; it was the first day that the press broke out in the night, for the prisoner was pressed out of a boat, after we had done the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this six quarters you mention, all done up in sacks?</p>
               <p>Hicks. They were; and there were a great deal of loose oats in the lighter, and these sacks were put so as to keep the loose oats from falling over-board.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day, did you sell Lambeth the oats?</p>
               <p>Hicks. I believe it was about nine or ten in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with it?</p>
               <p>Hicks. His servants shot the corn into his own sacks, and the sacks when emptied, were delivered to the prisoner again; and we flung them over-board, at the Old-barge-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might there be in Davis's lighter, all in sacks?</p>
               <p>Hicks. I believe there might be a matter of twenty quarters, all in ack.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any corn belonging to Davis's lighter consigned to them?</p>
               <p>Peather. At the time this corn was stole, I was ill; there were thirteen quarters missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it missing ?</p>
               <p>Peather. I believe it was the latter end of January last, or the beginning of February; but I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100032"></xptr> cannot be punctual of my own knowledge as to the time being ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Davis work all your corn?</p>
               <p>Peather . He does; and according to the meeter's bill that comes up every time, and our book of delivery out again; we found we had so much short of what we should have had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know what became of that thirteen quarters?</p>
               <p>Peather . No; we never did. When the prisoner was taken up, we heard he had made a confession; that he had taken the craft up to Black-friars-road, with all the corn in her, which might be about eighty or ninety quarters, and that he and the evidence, took six quarters out, which was in sacks. The prisoner confessed to me in Bridewell, Surry . that he took six quarters of oats out of our lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your missing the oats, did you ever acquaint Davis with it?</p>
               <p>Peather . Yes; he knows we lost the corn.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he know that?</p>
               <p>Peather . Because I saw both my master in the compting-house, examining him about it; telling him, there were thirteen quarters short.</p>
               <p>Q. What said Davis to that?</p>
               <p>Peather . He said he could not tell any thing abo ut it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Davis . When they told you there were thirteen quarters short, what did you say to that?</p>
               <p>Davis. Do you think in my bringing ten thousand quarters in a year, there cannot be thirteen quarters short ? I do not know he ever told me there were thirteen quarters missing, till about three months ago. Then he said our master says, there are thirteen quarters of corn missing in the grainery.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he did not in a reasonable time after the corn was measured, inform you there were thirteen quarters missing?</p>
               <p>Davis . What may you call a reasonable time?</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did this grainery-keeper inform you, this thirteen quarters were missing?</p>
               <p>Davis. Is that what you ask me?</p>
               <p>Court. It is.</p>
               <p>Davis. He informed me, there is thirteen quarters of corn short.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you that?</p>
               <p>Davis. Never till such time the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell the court what time he told you.</p>
               <p>Davis. I cannot say what month, neither will I say it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Peather. When did your masters inform Davis, of what was missing?</p>
               <p>Peather. It was in the month of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Might these thirteen quarters be lost out of the grainery?</p>

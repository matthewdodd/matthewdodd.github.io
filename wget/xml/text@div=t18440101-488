                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer. The prisoner was employed by me as a coffee-roaster—he was to see that it was properly roasted, keep an account of it, and receive the money for the coffee that was roasted—he used to fetch the coffee from the different grocers, and to return it—some of the customers paid when it was taken home—he used to make up his accounts once a week—the last he made up was to the 2nd of September—I could not get him to enter into the account, or to give me any explanation whatever after then—I applied to him various times—he did not continue in my service—he made an objection to serve me, but he did not leave the premises—he kept carrying on the business, and led me to suppose that in a few days he should be able to purchase the business back again from me—he never paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for anybody—he never paid me any money at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are an auctioneer and broker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have carried on business at No. 72, Whitechapel-road—I was before a cabinet-maker and upholsterer—I am not carrying on any roasting now—I think the prisoner came into my service about the 24th of August—he was to have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a week—he was to roast coffee in Flower and Dean-street, which was his house, before the Marshalsea officer took his goods—I believe he was not carrying on the business of a coffee-roaster then, it was at a stand-still—he did not say he wanted 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to get the Sheriffs out—he said his goods were valued at 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he did not come to me, as a friend and neighbour, to advance him money, to get out of that difficulty—I advanced him some money; but not till a few days before he came out of prison—I advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 23rd of August—he sent a message to me for it—he was in the Queen's Bench prison—I advanced it to a person representing herself to be his wife, but I believe she is not—that was the only money I advanced him—the message that was delivered to me was that he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to get to this coffee-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I purchased it, not the business, but the goods, chattels, and fixtures of the Marshalsea officers, when they were loaded in the van, and were going away, if I had not had the charity and good feeling to prevent it—I paid the Marshalsea officers 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; for them—before I purchased the goods, the prisoner entered into an arrangement with me, that be would give me up the premises—I did not buy it—I had his consent for possession of the house—I have not two indictments pending over me for breaking into that house—there is an indictment by a false accusation—it is done with a view to get money from my pocket—there is only one indictment against me—it ought to have come on last October, but it did not come on—a legal proper notice of trial was given to the prosecutor—I did not serve it myself, I sent a person—I got into the house before the prisoner was taken into custody—he gave me the possession on the 28th of July—I did not go with a gang of men to take possession—only one went with me, whom I took to leave there—the house was empty when I bought the goods—I kept my servant there till about the 7th of August, and then the prisoner transferred his services over to me—he never tendered me payment of the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, or a single halfpenny, neither did I ever see a penny of his money—I have been in possession of this place, and carrying on the business of a coffee<lb></lb>roaster, by my servants.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you call the prisoner your servant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly I do, when a man agrees to work for me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a week—I have no witness or document that I took him as a servant—I never took a written agreement with a servant in my life—what business is done by my servants, I presume, in the eye of the law, is done by myself—I call him my servant—he went round to the customers and got the coffee, and kept an account in this book of what he did get—I think he gave me this about the 3rd or 4th of September—the last two pages of the book are his writing—I did not seize this book amongst the goods—if I found the book on the premises it was delivered to me some time prior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The goods were going to be taken for his debts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet—I bought them, and put them into the house till I could dispose of them—I had an understanding with the prisoner, that I should have a public sale then, but he might use the goods—I had no objection to that—he was taken to prison the next day—I roasted coffee by means of servants while he was away—the first engagement I had with him was when he spoke about the sacrifice of the goods; that if I would consent to take to the business, he would be my servant as soon as he came out of prison, and the business should be carried on in my name till he could find a person to purchase the goods again.</p>

I lost two silver tankards from out of the kitchen; he was gone to go to bed about three quarters of an hour before they were missed; he goes through the kitchen to go to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Marshall. About nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were in the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Marshall. My house-keeper told me she had carried them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is she?</p>
               <p>Marshall. She is not here. When I missed them, we went up to his room, and he was not in bed, and the back-door was left open; then we suspected he had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your tankards again?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes, I did; they were found where he was taken, at the Crispin, a publick-house in Grub street. I was sent for, he was taken before the justice; and there he said, he was very much in liquor when he took them. I know that to be true; he owned he took them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Irons. I am a constable, the man at the Crispin alehouse sent for me from the watch-house, to let me know a person was come there with two silver tankards. I went, there was the prisoner, he appeared to me to be very much in liquor, and hardly capable of giving a rational answer. These are the tankards. [Producing two tankards.]</p>
               <p>Marshall. These are my property, and what I lost that night.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176104010010"></xptr>Irons. I knew the prisoner from a child. I carried him that night to Clerkenwell-bridewell. The prisoner told me, he would tell me in the morning whose tankards they were. I asked him, as I suspected them to be Mr. Marshall's tankards at the Ship, knowing the prisoner lodged there; he said they were.</p>
               <p>Q. to Marshall. Did the prisoner own where he took them from?</p>
               <p>Marshall. He said he took them from off the dresser in the kitchen, and went out at the back door.</p>
               <p>Irons. I went to Mr. Marshall's house, and told him the affair; he came with me, and owned them.</p>
               <p>Marshall. When I missed them, I went away to justice Fielding, and was describing the prisoner to one of the clerks, and the keeper of Clerkenwell came in; and said, I suppose this is something about the man that was taken up in Grub-street last night, with two tankards. The justice sent for the prisoner, and asked him how he came to take the tankards; he said, they were out at the door when he took them, and that he was very much in liquor. He owned they were my tankards; he had an extreme good character before this thing happened.</p>

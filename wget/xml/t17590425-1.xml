            . I met the prisoner with two bushels of coals in a sack, upon his back, in Thames-street, on the 3d of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going?</p>
               <p>Hivenson. Towards Queenhithe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before?</p>
               <p>Hivenson. He worked at Mrs Louch's at that time: his business was to <rs id="t17590425-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">load coals for her at the wharf</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you know where he took them from?</p>
               <p>Hivenson. We suppose from out of a lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know, but that he had an order to carry them for his mistress?</p>
               <p>Hivenson. No, he had no order.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them?</p>
               <p>Hivenson. They are valued at half a crown: he said he had never been guilty of such a thing before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose coals were they?</p>
               <p>Hivenson. The sack was Mrs. Louch's, but the coals were not: she only had the carriage of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him forgiveness at the time he confessed this?</p>
               <p>Hivenson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Hivenson. I am servant to Mrs. Louch</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>They were sweepings of a lighter, about a bushel or a little more, and I was going to carry them to a poor family.</p>

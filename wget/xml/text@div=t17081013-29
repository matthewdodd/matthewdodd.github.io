The Evidence for the Queen depos'd, that after the Statute of Bankrupt was taken out against the Prisoner, the Commissioners heard he was gone to Harwich, in order to imbark with his Effects for Holland; that they sent their Warrant to seize him there, and upon his being apprehended, it appear'd that he was ignorant of the Exibition of the Statute; and his design in going to Holland was to buy Dutch Checks, and make a quick return; that he very readily delivered to Mr. Beacher, one of the principal Creditors, 20 Guineas and the Bill of Exchange. That Mr. Beacher left him in the Hands of a Messenger to bring to London; but upon the Road he told him he would be in danger of his Life for what he had done, if his Creditors were severe against him; which Words frighted him, so that he made his Escape from the Messenger, but sent a Letter immediately to the said Mr. Beacher, to satisfie him that what he had done was not with any design to defraud his Creditors, for he was ready to surrender himself up and all that he had, if he might be favourably received; upon which an Advertisement was published in the Gazette, to satisfy, that if he surrendred himself, he should be kindly dealt with; accordingly he gave himself up to his Creditors, which were almost all satisfied with his Conduct, In the whole, it not appearing that he had any design to defraud his Creditors, the Jury <rs id="t17081013-29-verdict140" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I live in Thames-street; the prisoner is my nephew; he has professed of late to deal in horses. On the 31st of May he came to me about some horses, and I gave him some money to buy a hone for my son-in-law—he came on the 4th of June, and said he had bought a horse, and he had left 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as deposit for it, that the difference was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he wanted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more to make up the price for it—in con<lb></lb>sequence of that I let him have three sovereigns and one half-sovereign—he gave it to a person whom he brought with him to receive the difference, because the proprietor would not let the horse go without it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son-in-law. The horse was to be bought for me, but it never came to me—I went to the prisoner's house, and saw him, after waiting half an hour, at the Ship public-house—he came to me there—I told him I came for the horse—he said the horse did not turn out to his expectation, and he had given him a ball and turned bio out to grass; if I would meet him at seven o'clock the next morning, at Whitechapel, he would bring me a horse—I went five minutes before seven, and waited till half-past eight—I never saw him, nor the horse—he had promised to meet me to go to Rom ford to buy a horse.</p>

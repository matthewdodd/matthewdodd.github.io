                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in Great Windmill-street. The prisoner was in my service—I have missed money, and marked two shillings, which I put into the till—on the 24th of Jan. I looked, and the marked money was gone—I was present when my wife searched the pri<lb></lb>soner's box in the kitchen, and found this marked money in it—she said she had no money—this is the money I marked—these are the marks on the shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I was in the yard, and saw the prisoner in the parlour—she looked at my husband, and I saw her put her hand down—I went to he till, and missed the marked money—I said to her, "Will you buy a frock of me?"—she said "I havn't any money"—she lifted up her box—there was no money there—she said, "I have not a halfpenny in my box"—I went to it, and found in one corner seven shillings and three sixpences—I looked for these marked shillings, and found them—I said, "Where had you this money?"—she said, "I brought it from Ireland," and before the Magistrate she said she had it from her last place.</p>

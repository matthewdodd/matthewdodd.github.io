                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of 49, Jermyn Street, St. James's—the prisoner entered my service in January last—I believe he is an Irishman and a Roman Catholic—he had access to the room where I kept my envelopes and paper—all the servants in the house had—I had two female servants, Mrs. Gray, the cook, and Alice Hall, the housemaid—I believe they are Englishwomen—I buy my paper from Webster and Larkin, stationers, of 56, Piccadilly—I had three or four kinds of envelopes, one a thin sort, and some thick; some blue paper, and some white—I had two kinds of note paper, one kind with a plain stamp die, and the other stamped in black, "49, Jermyn Street, S.W."—I gave the police-officer specimens of my paper, and also of some paper in which bottles were wrapped—that was not kept in my consulting room, but in my dis<lb></lb>pensary where my medicines are, not on a shelf, I think it was in a drawer—Inspector Butcher called upon me on 21at August, and had some conver<lb></lb>sation with me—he showed me these anonymous letters—I did not examine them—they are not written by me—I know nothing of the writing—I have none of the prisoner's writing—I think when he first came to be engaged he wrote his address on a bit of paper, but I have not got it—there was some of his writing on a slate—I showed that to Butcher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been in my service since January—I believe he is abut 19 years of age—his character was very good as far as I knew—I recollect when I came home one night in June I was told that a man was waiting in my consulting room to see me—I went and found that he seemed to be merely wishing to beg, and I sent him away—that was the room in which my paper was kept—it was in an open drawer, and in a case on the writing table—my patients are as. a rule shown into that room—I sometimes see them in another room—I see a good many people—they would usually be placed in the dining-room, next to my consulting-room—they would occasionally be left alone in my consulting-room—I think the man I saw gave the name of Cook—I have never seen him since to my knowledge—on 8th September, after the prisoner's arrest, I received this anonymous letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Soho Branch, Tuesday. Sir,—Only a few words, about your late boy, to show that he has nothing to do with the letters of June 13th and 14th. I read the letter in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and came down Duke Street, and saw you go in the carriage. I rang the bell. your boy answered it. I asked to see the doctor; he said 'He is just gone out.' I said 'What time will he be back.' He said 'I will see,' and went into the room. I followed him in and said 'I will leave a note.' I then took from the shelf two sheets of rough paper, one quire of paper out of a drawer on the left-hand side, and four envelopes, and then two sheets of blue paper. Six weeks previous to that I called, about 7 o'clock, but you ordered me out. I gave the name of Cook. Please show this to Inspector Butcher, of Scotland Yard, and tell him to go to the prison and ask if he remembers the man what refused his name. He has nothing to do with it. Please show this at once, as it will set him free. Show it to the expert. It was my doing.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am governor of Her Majesty's prison of New-gate, and have held that post for some years—I was previously deputy<lb></lb>governor under the late Mr. Jonas—all authorised letters are inspected before leaving the prison—we exercise all possible care to prevent un<lb></lb>authorised letters being sent—the letters which are sent out are written on special paper marked "Her Majesty's Prison, Newgate"—when prisoners see their friends a warder is specially appointed to prevent anything being taken in or out—it would be impossible for anything to be passed in or out during a visit by a friend of a prisoner—there is a visiting-place, with two iron gratings, about three feet apart—the prisoner stands on the outer side of the outer grating, and the friends on the inner side of the inner grating, and the warder stands with the friends, or sometimes between the two gratings—I could not tell which warder was told off to watch the prisoner; they vary, they all take their turn—the prisoner's solicitor is the only person who is allowed to see him alone, in a special room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The solicitor or his clerk would see him every afternoon, not in the presence of a warder—if the warder did his duty a prisoner could not pass a letter out—many attempts have been made to send letters ont without my knowledge, and there have been instances in which those attempts have been successful—if a warder chose, out of kindness, to take a letter and post it of course I could not prevent it—I have known instances in which prisoners have sent out letters by means of other prisoners, and otherwise;. a man who is shortly to be discharged may take out letters for another—there are many ways in which it can be done—I have the visiting-book here—I see on 8th September the prisoner was visited by a friend named Dennis Creedon; on the 7th by Elizabeth Hazell; on the 6th by his sister, Bridget Donovan; on the 4th by his brother John, and on the 3rd by Mary Donovan, his aunt, and on the 1st and 2nd by his sister Bridget—he has also been visited both by his solicitor and his clerk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 8, Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, and am acting for the prisoner's defence—I think I visited him three or four times in Newgate—I never received any letter from him, or ever saw him write—my clerk never went with me—I served a notice on the solicitor for the Treasury yesterday morning in Court to produce the anonymous letter (<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>)—I got the information from Dr. Teggart, which led me to give that notice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Dr. Teggart—I remember a man calling at Dr. Teggart's, but I don't know in what month it was; it was in the summer, to the best of my knowledge about three or four months ago; he gave the name of Cook, but not to me, he gave it to the prisoner—I heard the name, but I did not see the man, I was in the dining-room; he was shown into the consulting-room—I don't know how long he remained there—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—he was waiting for Dr. Teggart—the doctor dines about half-past 7 o'clock—he was not a patient, he wanted some relief—I did not hear what he said—he was in the con<lb></lb>sulting-room it might be a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes before the doctor came in—I did not see him, only the side of him, I only saw him pass by the door—there was a letter came to Dr. Teggart—during the time the prisoner was my fellow-servant his character was very good—I never heard him speak in favour of Fenianism, or speak about politics—I never heard Lord Oranmore's name till Inspector Butcher came—the prisoner never appeared to take any interest in politics; he only used to see the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never discussed the Irish Land Bill with the prisoner—I am an Englishwoman—I only heard the name of Cook from the prisoner—nothing was missed from the room that I know of.</p>

I heard him in there, and I heard Dr. Teggart order him out—I never heard him give his name—I asked the prisoner who the man was, and he said some man named Cook—on the day the officer came the prisoner went out after the officer left—he did not say anything till dinner time, he then said "I am off"—he took some of his things with him—that was something after 2 o'clock—he came back about half-past 10.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a lithographic writer—I have given my attention to handwriting for upwards of 20 years—I have had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of examining the letters in question, both the anonymous letters and the admitted letter of the prisoner—I am an expert, an examiner, a studier of writing—I am a lithographic writer, the same as Mr. Chabot—I hare given my attention to comparing handwriting, to detect forgery and to pass an opinion on writing—I have compared the threatening letters with the letter written by the prisoner, and in my opinion they are not the same—I have looked at the letter to Dr. Teggart purporting to come from the man Cook—in my opinion it is the same as the threatening letters—the writing of illiterate people is very much alike; they form their letters very much in the same way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been examined before in a Court of Justice on the question of handwriting several times, more than three or four times—I went to the office of the Solicitor to the Treasury last Saturday to see these letters—I believe the whole of them were shown to me—I was there two hours—I compared them—I only saw them once—I did not think it neces<lb></lb>sary to go again—it is my opinion that none of the threatening letters are in the same writing a the other document—I notice a very large number</p>

               <p>of similarities between the two—I heard Mr. Chabot's evidence as to the similarities—they struck me, but I don't agree with him on certain points—the similarities are very faint, very slight.</p>

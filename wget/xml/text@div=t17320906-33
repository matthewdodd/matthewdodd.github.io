            . At 9 in the Morning, I left my Son about 6 Years old in the House, and lock'd the Doors, and went out, and when I returned, I found all my Doors open, and the Prisoners eating my Meat, and drinking my Brandy. I desired them to go out by fair Means, but they would not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Goosetry. There was a Commission of Bankruptcy against Mr. Ward. The Assignees seiz'd several of these Houses which had been part of Ward's Estate, and I having a Letter of Attorney from them, sent these 2 Men to take Possession, and to move the Goods, which they did, but they were turned out again by a Warrant from Justice Robinson (the Prosecutor calls him Cousin.) I would have given 10,000 l. Bail for the 2 Men, but tho' I went after the Justice several times, he would not see me. The Jury <rs id="t17320906-33-verdict172" type="verdictDescription">

            </rs> the Prisoners, and the Court granted them a Copy of their Indictment.</p>

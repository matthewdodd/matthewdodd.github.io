            . I am in Mr. Hutchous' employ. I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock; the house was then quite safe - the shutters were fastened with an iron bar; I got up a few minutes before six, as usual - it was not light then; I suspected nothing - I got down stairs a few minutes after six, with the plate, which is kept in my own room at night; when I got towards the kitchen stairs I saw a glare of light, and as I entered the back kitchen I found the window wide open, and the shutters also - the bar laid on the dresser under the window; it was bent, and so became shorter, and came out - great force had been used; I went and opened the front kitchen window, and found every thing strewed about; the house had been rifled - I rang all the bells to alarm the family, but could make nobody hear for some time; I did not like to leave the back kitchen, and rang the bells again, hallooed up stairs, and presently I heard my fellow-servant calling out that the bottom of the house was broken open, and in two minutes all the persons in the house came down to my assistance - I sleep in the back garret; I went into the parlour, and almost every lock there was broken open; I went up to the garret, as I had heard footsteps going up stairs - I called out, but received no answer; I was certain somebody was in the house, but nobody would believe me - I went up to the bed-room, and saw a man's leg under my bed; I closed the door, and kept him in till master's nephew came to my assistance; I then opened the door, and said, "Here you are, come out;" the prisoner was under the bed I had slept in - he could not have been there when I left my room; he must have come from another room - he was loaded with master's property; all the articles stated in the indictment were about him; I got a constable, and he was secured - it was day-light out of doors when I came down, but not sufficient for me to do my work without a candle; it would take a considerable time to ransack the house-I heard him say in the parlour, in the presence of us all, that he had been three hours in the house; nothing was said to induce him to state that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I throw myself on the mercy of my God and the Court; I have suffered severely through poverty prior to the time the crime of which I am accused of was committed - I was religiously and morally brought up, and at one time possessed property, but through unforeseen circumstances was deprived of it, since which I have held three respectable situations; I have brothers and sisters respectable in society, whom I am anxious to screen from the infamy attached to me - prior to the present charge my only crime was poverty; not expecting or seeking mercy from my prosecutor, I now only seek of my God and the Court for that mercy which it may consider me entitled, for which, as in duty bound, I ever shall pray.</p>

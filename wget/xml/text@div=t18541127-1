                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the employment of Richard Griffiths, a silk and trimming manufacturer, of No. 52, Cheapside. Alfred Tilley was an errand boy in his service, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—he had been there, I think, about ten weeks when he was taken into custody—he was employed in the braid machine room, on the ground floor—the silk is kept in the ware-house, on the first floor—about a fortnight before Tilley was apprehended a person in the warehouse called my attention to some bundles of silk; they were loose—four hanks had been taken from them—nothing more occurred to excite my attention till the morning the boy was taken, Friday, 20th Oct.—Samuels and I counted some hanks that morning in the first floor warehouse, where I am always selling goods—Tilley was away at that time—after the boy Tilley returned from his breakfast he made an excuse to go upstairs into the warehouse to fetch a knife, and he must have come down with some silk in his pocket; for I went upstairs, and found that four hanks of silk were missing—I then searched the boy, and found on him only 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—young Mr. Samuels then went down into the vault, and found four hanks of silk behind some moulds—I had noticed Tilley go to that part of the house several times that morning—at 7 o'clock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270006"></xptr>
               <p>in the evening, just as Tilley was going from work, I went into the vault, and found that the silk was gone—I then searched him, and found on him the four hanks of silk that were missing—they were new and were worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. trade price—18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is a very inadequate price for them—Tilley made a state<lb></lb>ment to me, and I took him to Mr. Griffiths, his master's house, in Down<lb></lb>ham-road, Kingsland, who was unwell, and had not been in business that day; I afterwards took Tilley back, sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—the constable made an arrangement with Tilley, in my presence, to go to Harrisson's house, and give him three of the hanks of silk, worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I and the constable followed Tilley, about half past 9 o'clock to Har<lb></lb>risson's house, No. 19, Hope-street, Spitalfields; it is a little shop, there were scales and weights there—the shop was not closed; it has a large win<lb></lb>dow; it had the blinds down, and a few of these <hi rend="italic">thrums</hi> in it—I saw Tilley go in; I stood on the same side of the way, six or seven yards off, and could only see the side of the window; I could not see figures inside—the policeman was on the opposite side of the way—Tilley came out, and offered to give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I told him to keep it, I would have nothing to do with it—I had searched him in the morning, and only found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

               <p>"You will find it <hi rend="italic">whisked</hi> under the counter"—I picked it up from under<lb></lb>neath the counter, which is open to the room where they all live together, and a little counter goes along by the door; the end of the counter is closed towards the door—Harrisson was sitting in just such a position as he could have thrown the silk there without my seeing him—I do not think the boy could have thrown it there, because there were some scales hanging on the counter—I told him I should take him into custody for buying the silk, knowing it to be stolen—he said he never saw the boy before, and he had not bought it of him—I took him into custody, took him outside, and asked Tilley in his presence what he had received for the silk; he said, "18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—Harrisson made no reply—I have often seen him passing along Watling-street and Thames-street, with a bag.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

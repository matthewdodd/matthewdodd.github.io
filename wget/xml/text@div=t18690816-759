I am a tailor, and have two shops, one in Fenchurch Street and one in Gracechurch Street—on 3rd Jury, about 2 p.m., I saw the prisoner on the basement at 87, Grace-church Street, where some buildings were going on—I asked him what he was doing there; he said that he came for his money—I said, "It is a strange time to come for your money, the workmen are all gone"—I ran up stairs, spoke to the foreman, and then found that the prisoner had gone—I ran to Leadenhall Street, found him, and brought him back to the porter, telling him to take him to the yard, and see if what he said was correct; and if not, to look him up—prisoner had a spirit level and other tools—I asked aim what he was doing with tools in his pocket—he said they were his—they had K. S. on them, and I said, "It is very strange you have tools with another man's name on them"—he said, "That is the name of the maker of the tool"—I said, "No, for it is burnt in or cut roughly"—I said, "What do labourers do with a spirit level?"—he said, "We are obliged to have spirit levels, to see that our work is right."</p>

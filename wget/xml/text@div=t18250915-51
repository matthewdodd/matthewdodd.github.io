               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you go to the pay table a little later than usual? A. Yes; I had been drinking a little more than usual, and had gone to bed to make me better. I had had four glasses of sherry, and my beer, that was all. I asked the prisoner next day how much I had paid him, but it was merely to find out where I had lost the money - he had not been many weeks with me.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was at the pay table, and sat on the left hand of Jordan. I saw him lay down two sovereigns, the prisoner took them up in five or six minutes, and put them into his pocket; he then came and sat down on the left hand of me at the lower end of the room. Mr. Jordan afterwards said to me, "Have I done paying;" I said, "I don't know indeed;" he then looked round, and said "O there is Adcock, I have not paid him;" he then paid him 1 l. 5 s.; the prisoner then got up and said "Who is clerk?" I said "There is no clerk;" he then laid down 6 d. and went away. I did not know but what the sovereigns had been his own, as he was task master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Jordan appear to be sober? A. I cannot upon my oath say he was sober. I never had any difference with the prisoner about a plumb-bob. I said it was in the building. I never said I would be up with him. I was present when he was asked to compromise this business the next morning, but he said No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JORDAN re-examined. Q. Did you offer to compromise the matter with him the next morning? A. Yes; I said if he would return them, or confess that he took them, I would compromise the matter, but he said he knew nothing about them. I told him that Simpson and Inwood saw him take them; he said "I believe Simpson and Inwood had the money;" and Simpson said "If you don't prosecute him I will."</p>

            . I am a carter. I was at the pay-table, and received my money that night. I saw the prisoner take up the two sovereigns into his hand - I did not see what he did with them. I staid there some time, and saw him afterwards receive his wages. I did not say anything about what I had seen, because I did not know whether they were his right or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Jordan pay all that was paid at that table? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not appear very odd that Adcock should take the money from off the table? A. I did not know anything about the business. I told Mr. Jordan after he had done paying the men, that I had noticed three payments; he had paid three sovereigns to a carpenter, and two sovereigns to a plasterer; that I saw Adcock take the two sovereigns from the table, and that after that he had paid him 1 l. 5 s. I did not hear him say "O there is Adcock, I have not paid him." I was present on the Monday morning, but I did not hear the prisoner say "I am innocent, if any one took the money, it was you or Simpson." I did not hear Simpson say "If Mr. Jordon does not prosecute you, I will, for saying that," - it was not said in my presence. I heard Mr. Jordan say, that if he confessed he had taken the money, he would take it any way, and let him go free; they were together after I was there, and I dare say Adcock was at large all that day.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where did the prosecutor sit, at the table? A. About the middle. Adcock was not sitting at all when he took the two sovereigns - he was standing opposite to Mr. Jordan. I was next but one to Mr. Jordan on his right hand, and Simpson was next to him on his left - it was a long table about ten feet long.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell Mr. Jordan that Adcock had taken the two sovereigns? A. Because I did not know but it was his right.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JORDAN re-examined. Q. Where did you sit at the table? A. On one side of it, and the men were in different directions about me. Adcock stood before me, and I said "There's the man I like, because he has been at work this week." I had taken four sovereigns out of my pocket, and had to pay a plasterer 3 l., and I said "Perhaps a pound's worth of silver would be of use to you?" I gave him two sovereigns and a pound in silver, and laid down the other two sovereigns on the table close by my right hand. I cannot recollect who sat next to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was the compromise offered to him? A. On the Monday morning about six or seven o'clock - it might be later - I cannot tell exactly; he went to work on the following morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SIMPSON re-examined. Q. What sort of a table was it you were at? A. It was a long table - Mr. Jordan sat on one side of it. I was next to him on his left hand, and the prisoner stood opposite him when he took the sovereigns, and then he went and sat at the end. I saw Jordan put down the sovereigns nearer to the prisoner than to himself. At the time he laid down the money, he said, "That is the man I like;" the prisoner took up the money.</p>

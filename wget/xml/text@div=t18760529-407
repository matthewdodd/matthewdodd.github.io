I am one of the Brethren of the Charter House, and reside there—between 8 and 9 o'clock' on Monday evening, 8th May, I was in Aldersgate Street, I saw a crowd, I went to see what it was; I saw a man in a fit or pretending to be—the prisoner got his arm round my neck, and his hand near my pocket, and—I was anxious about my watch and I put my hand so and he ran up an alley—a little girl spoke to me and I missed my watch—it was safe not a minute before—I had this coat buttoned up this way when he caught hold of me; my chain was hanging down loose—it was a family watch and I valued it at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I followed the prisoner and saw him taken; I never lost sight of him—I am a pretty good runner—he ran up some yard.</p>

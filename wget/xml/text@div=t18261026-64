On the 27th of September, about a quarter to one o'clock, I found a door shut, which I had left open, and upon opening it I found the house door, which I had left shut, was open; I was certain somebody had been there. I saw a man running hastily out of the gate, with a basket on his back; I thought it looked suspicious; I went to the plate-cupboard, and missed this plate: I then went to the coach-gate - I saw nobody but a man in a cart, drawn by a grey horse; he was about thirty yards from the coach-gate; I think there were two men in the cart, but am satisfied the one I observed was the man I had seen running away; I gave an alarm to Cooke, the constable; the prisoner is one of the men I saw in the cart; and one of the men in the cart I believe to be the man I had seen running. I found the plate before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You believe the man in the cart is the same you saw running? A. Yes; I only saw his back, and cannot swear positively to him - my mistress and another servant were in the house; the other servant was up stairs, and could not have opened the door; I had not been out, but went from one kitchen to another - the door was shut a minute before, and must have been opened by the person who took the property.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in Teddington-street, two or three hundred yards from the prosecutrix's. On the 27th of September, about one o'clock in the day, I saw two men in a cart, drawn by a grey horse, galloping very fast by my house, towards Richmond; Williams came to me directly; I pursued, and came up with the prisoner at Richmond - Green was up before me; I saw the same horse and cart which had passed my house, in custody of Shadwell. I produce the spoons.</p>

            . I heard an alarm, and went in pursuit - I saw the cart stopped - there two men in it; one jumped out, and escaped - the prisoner was taken in the cart; the next morning I found two spoons in a garden right opposite to where the cart had stopped; a person in the cart could easily have thrown them there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he drive the cart? A. He had the reins in his hand, and sat on the driving side; they both appeared to be at the horse to make it go fast.</p>

            . I was going to work, and in Hill-street, Richmond, I saw this cart galloping; I got up after it was stopped - the prisoner was the only man in it then; I cannot say who drove. I saw my son find a tea-spoon under the cart, just at the horse's heels; I think the man must have dropped it as he jumped out: the prisoner said he would get out without our pulling him out. I found another tea-spoon under a cart which had stopped the prisoner's cart, to prevent its going by.</p>

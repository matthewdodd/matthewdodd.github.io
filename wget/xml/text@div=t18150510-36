             felt for her money; she said, she had none; she took her ring off her finger, and gave it me, told me not to part with it to any body, until she fetched the money. The ribbon was sixpence a yard. She told me it was her wedding ring, and not to give it to any one else but to her; she went away then. Merritt was with Mrs. Duddle, and staid in the shop bargaining for a bonnet; Mrs. Duddle could not agree with her, she did not go, before I examined the ring, and found it was not a gold ring; I said, I thought I was deceived. Merritt seemed embarrassed, and confused, and soon after left the shop, without buying any thing. I desired the little boy, that was in the next room, to follow her, to see where she went; he followed her to the George public-house; after he was gone, Mrs. Duddle examined the ribbon drawer; she missed half a piece of white ribbon, seventeen yards, or seventeen yards and a half. Merritt had never been near the drawer where the ribbon was, so that she could not have taken it; they never spoke to one another in the shop at all. The boy returned, and told me that Merritt had gone to the public-house. I immediately went to Hatton Garden office, and got two officers; I went with the two officers in search of Merritt; we went to the George, in Little Saffron-hill; there we found the two prisoners, they were both sitting together; they were taken into custody; the officers searched them, and found the ribbon on

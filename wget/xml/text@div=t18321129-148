             (Police-constable N 221). On the evening of the 30th of October, I stopped the prisoner in a field behind the Caledonian-school, at Holloway - he had a female with him; he had a truck, in which were two deals, and two were on his shoulder - I asked what he was going to do with them - he said to take them to the owner, but he did not know his name, nor where he lived; I took him to the station, and then he said he brought them from his own home; on the following morning, I traced the mark of the truck-wheels from the place where I stopped him, to Mr. Haswell's premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he not tell you where he worked; and ask you to accompany him to the place where the man who had brought them to him to cut, was? A. No, he said he had cut twenty-one flats for the man before, and had a farthing a foot for them, but he did not know his name; and about an hour after he was locked up, the woman brought a man with her to own the deals - I asked him what he was; he said a carpenter, and he was building a small hut at the back of the Caledonian school, that he gave the prisoner the deals to cut, and he bought them in Little Coram-place; he said the prisoner had never cut any deals for him before - I did not detain him, as he promised to attend in the morning, but he did not come; I went to Coram-place, but could find no timber yard there - I afterwards found the residence of the man who came to own the deals, and found he was a sawyer out of work; I took him, and he was reprimnnded - when I took him he said, "My God! I know nothing about the deals - the woman who was represented as the prisoner's wife came and begged me to own them."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About four months; I had permitted him to use our saw-pit - he had done so on one or two occasions cut for other persons - these timbers have the mark of Mr. Loraine on them, of whom we bought it; I had put no marks on them - I have a neighbour named Shelley; he had some timber on his premises which he bought of Loraine, and that would, no doubt, have Mr. Loraine's mark on it; Johnson is in our employ.</p>

            . I am a mason, and live at the corner of Park-lane. I was employed at the stable where the prosecutor's timber stood - I went to the prosecutor for the key of it; I fastened the door and put the key in the place where we usually put it - the next morning I found the stable locked, and the key gone; I climbed up, and got a sight of the place - the position of the deals was altered, and there appeared to be some gone.</p>

I recollect his being taken; a few days before that, a man came to the pit, and asked him to cut some deals for him into planks, and the prisoner said Yes he would; the next day the prisoner showed me four of these pine planks near the pit; this is one of them - they were there two days, and he asked me to help him cut them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you see these? A. In Mr. Haswell's stable - there were some deals there; I did not assist the prisoner, because it was dark - I am not the man who went to the station-house.</p>

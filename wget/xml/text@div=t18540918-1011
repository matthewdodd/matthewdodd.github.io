                  </hi>. I am the mother of the deceased, who was the prisoner's husband; his name was William Colbert—I believe they had been together about sixteen years; they had been married about nine years—he was thirty—four years of age—on Saturday night, 2nd Sept. he came home, washed himself and went out, and did not come in till 1 o'clock in the morning—he had had a little drop to drink, but was not out of the way—he was not in the habit of drinking; when he had done his work of a Saturday evening he used to be among his shopmates and take a drop—he and his wife had two or three words about his being out so late; she called him a blackguard for being out, and he struck her two or three times on the side of the face with his open hand—a knife lay on the table that she had been cutting some wood with, for lucifer matches, and she took it up and <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> it at him—she <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> it with her strength, I suppose—she was about a yard from him at the time—it struck him in his side—he died last Saturday week; that was about a week after the blow was inflicted; the prisoner is a steady hard working woman—I took him to a doctor, and then in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. The deceased was admitted there on Sunday, 3rd Sept., about 4 o'clock in the morning—I found a wound in his side; it had penetrated the chest between the eighth and ninth ribs—it was such a wound as would be caused by this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) being thrown violently at him—the wound was about two and a half inches deep—it penetrated the pericardium, the diaphragm, and the spleen—I attended him for a week—he died on the following Sunday, at 10 o'clock in the morning—the injuries were the cause of death.</p>

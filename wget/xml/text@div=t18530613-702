                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Snell, a surgeon in the City-road. On 12th May I was serving on his premises—the prisoner came about 2 o'clock—he asked for two ounces of salts—I served him—it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a shilling—I gave him 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he left the shop, and when he was gone I perceived the shilling was bad—I bent it, and put it in the till away from other money—there were other shillings there, but very few—I did not put that with the other money—on the same afternoon, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was serving in the shop—the prisoner came again,' and asked for a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of lint, and he put down another shilling—I knew him again, and when he put down the shilling I examined it, and tried it with the detector, and found it was bad—it cracked—I gave it to Mr. Snell—I got the other shilling out of the till—I gave them both to Mr. Snell, and told him that was the second bad shilling the prisoner had brought that afternoon—the prisoner was then in the shop—he was going out, but I called him back, and Mr. Snell told me to look out for a policeman—I went to the door, and the prisoner ran out—I followed him, brought him back to the shop, and he was given in custody—after the first shilling was passed I was in the shop till the second was passed—no one else had been in the shop but Mr. Snell.</p>

The last witness attends in my shop—I recollect seeing the prisoner on 12th May—I was coming out of the surgery into my shop—my assistant was there—he told me that the prisoner had presented a bad shilling before, and he had come again to present another, and he had detained him—I told the prisoner to wait, and I told the witness to look out for a constable—the prisoner waited a little time, and then he bolted out of the door—I called "Stop thief," and he was brought back—immediately afterwards a policeman came in, and I gave him the two shillings—my assistant gave them to me—the prisoner said, "Don't be hard with me," and I believe he said so in the presence of the policeman—I believe I had not been to the till at all that day.</p>

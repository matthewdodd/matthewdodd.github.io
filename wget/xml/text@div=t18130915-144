               <p>Q. How was your child dress - A. On the 2nd of August she had nothing on but a frock and a pinafore; the weather was very warm; I put nothing else on her; she went to play on the green. I saw her about half past nine at my door; I went out; about eleven I returned, the child was missing then; her sister was looking for her. Her sister's name is

            . About one o'clock I found her; she had nothing on then but her shift; she had been stripped of her frock and pinafore. About half past six in the evening I saw the prisoner I stopped her myself. I told her she had stripped my child; she said, me, woman, I have plenty of clothes for my child; the prisoner went into a public-house; I saw my child's frock at the public-house; from there I followed her to her home, No. 24, Mitcham-street, Lisson-green. She threw my child's pinafore down the stairs, over the people's heads. She was afterwards taken in custody. The frock was worth two shillings, and the pinafore one shilling.</p>

            . Q. This little child that had been stripped was your sister, was she - A. Yes; I saw her about ten; she had her clothes on; she went to play on the green; I missed her about eleven o'clock; I looked on the green; I could not see her there. My mother saw her before me. About half past six, I saw the prisoner; I stopped her by the account of the children. I told her she was the person that had stripped this child. She said, me, woman, my child has plenty of clothes. I stopped her until Mrs. Marlow came up. The prisoner went into the public-house, and there I saw my sister's frock. I saw the prisoner take it from under her petticoats. I asked her for the pinafore; she said she had lost it. I went with her to her home; she chucked the pinafore over the stairs to me. This is the frock and pinafore. I am sure it is my sister's.</p>

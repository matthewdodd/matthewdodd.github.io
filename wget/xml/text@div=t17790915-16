On the 25th of August one Dyall, who had nursed the prisoner's child, gave my brother an inscrmation of some carpeting being in the prisoner's room; and by a key she had she let him into the room, where he saw several pieces he knew to be my property; he informed me of it, and in the morning I went to the prisoner's lodging. Dyall told me he took it to Rosemary-lane to sell. Mrs. Cole, the prisoner's landlady, said, if you look sharply after him you will catch him out, for this is his market day. I do not doubt but he is making up a bundle to go to Ragfair, and will come out presently; accordingly I waited at the door till the prisoner came out of his lodging with a basket on his head; I asked him what he had got there, he said nothing but his apron. I desired to see it; he refused to let me see it; I insisted upon it, and laid hold of it and turned his apron aside, and saw it was carpeting; the woman was then at work in my warehouse; she was intrusted to work where the carpeting is, and I thought she was a woman I could have safely trusted. They both confessed before the justice that they had carried on this practice from last Christmas. He went down upon his knees and prayed me to forgive him. He used to come backwards and forwards to bring the key of their lodging to his wife, and fetch it from her, and bring her tea, and such things. The husband accused the wife, and the wife took it upon herself; she said she had taken that piece in the morning and had carried it to her husband.</p>

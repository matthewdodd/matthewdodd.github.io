               <p>On Sunday morning, 24th March, when I came down I found the green-house door open—some calico was kept in the room there, and some knives and forks, and a book—these are them—they are my master's—I had seen them about a week before—I missed them on the Monday morning—this book belongs to one of the school children.</p>

I live at Kenton—the prisoner lodged with me some few weeks—he brought the things to my house about half-past seven o'clock on Sunday morning, 24th March—he said to my wife, "What do you think of my find?"—she said, "Where did you find these?"—he said, "Up in the road"—(I live forty or fifty yards from the road)—he said he supposed some one had been <hi rend="italic">moon-shining</hi> it in the night, and the bundle had dropped off some cart or wagon—he said, "If any one calls and should own it, let them have it," and if they did not, he should consider it as his own—he took it in the back room and laid it on the flue—on the Wednesday two policemen came to my house, and I gave them what the prisoner left. <hi rend="smallCaps">

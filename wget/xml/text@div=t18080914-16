            , pawnbroker. On the 1st of July the prisoner brought a table spoon to pledge; it had a nobleman's arms on it; I asked her whose property it was, she said it was her own, she had a number of others; it appeared to me to be a new spoon; I thought she came dishonestly by it; I asked her if she had any thing else to pledge; she said no. I told her I thought she had some more spoons. I took her into custody and sent for an officer; the officer examined her, and found nothing upon her of any value. The officer has the spoon and the watch.</p>

I went up stairs into the rooms to see that every thing was done right; when I came down to my room I missed the watch; I asked the boy if he had taken my watch; he said no. He immediately came into my room, and said somebody has taken the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person come into that room from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140012"></xptr>street - A. Yes, any person coming down the area might come into the room.</p>

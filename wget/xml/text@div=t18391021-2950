                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 90.) On the morning of last Saturday week I was on duty in Bermondsey-street, near Tattle-court, about a quarter to two o'clock, and saw three men and five or six prosti<lb></lb>tutes making a disturbance, quarrelling among themselves—I came up to them, and spoke to them to go away and go home—the prisoner said he would not go home, for it was raining—I told him he had not far to go, and he ought to be at home before the rain commenced—I knew where he lived—he had a flannel jacket on—he said he had a flannel jacket on, and he would not go, and another said he would not go—I turned round to speak to him, and the prisoner passed by me, down the court, and came against me to jostle against me—I saw him coming, and moved out of the way, and he fell on his back—(I had not spoken a harsh word to him, nor struck him)—I asked what be meant by that—he made no answer, but got up, and seemed very angry—I said I would have no nonsense, and if he did not go home I should take him to the station-house—one of his party tried to persuade him to go home—he stood very quiet, and then walked deliberately home—I saw him <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to his house, which was about twenty yards from where I was—I am quite sure I saw him go in—while I was en<lb></lb>deavouring to get the others away I saw him come out again, and he said, "I cannot get in yet"—I was endeavouring to arouse a female on the step of a door, and one of those who had been with him said, "Give it to him"—that called my attention to the prisoner, and I saw something in his hand, and apparently concealed up his sleeve—I asked what he had there, or what he meant—he said nothing—I moved back to get my staff out, but could not get it out, and he sprang at me, and struck me on the head with a poker which he had in his hand—he struck at me again, and knocked my hat off—I could not get my staff out—I re<lb></lb>ceived two blows—one was after my hat was off—here is a mark on my hat, and another on my head—it stunned me, and the blood ran down my face—after receiving two blows, I got my rattle out, gave it one spring,</p>

               <p>then closed on him, and struck him with the rattle on the head—he then called to his companions for assistance—they closed round me—one of them struck me—I cannot say whether the third struck me or not—No. 113 came up to my assistance, and then the men were making away—the prisoner was afterwards brought to me by No. 113—I lost a great deal of blood—I went to Guy's Hospital, and got my head dressed—they wanted me to stop there, but I preferred going home, and next morning Dr. Od<lb></lb>ling, of the police force, attended me—I have been very ill since, and unable to do my duty.</p>

Last Saturday week, about twenty minutes after two o'clock in the morning, I was in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of Tattle-court, and picked up this poker, with hair and blood on it, and there was about a table-spoonful of blood by the side of it, on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Borough. I attend the M division of police—I was sent for on Saturday morning to Union Hall, and examined the prosecutor's head—he had two severe wounds, one on the forehead, and one on the upper part of the left side of the head—I did what was necessary for him—the wounds produced a good deal of fever, symptoms of pain all over, and headache—they were serious wounds, but I did not apprehend danger from them—they might be very dangerous from an instrument of that kind—it must have been a heavy iron instrument—I think this poker was very likely to produce such a wound.</p>

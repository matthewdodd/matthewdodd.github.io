            . Going by the end of Temple-lane, I heard the cry, stop thief; I saw the prisoner pursued by many people; I went after him, and in about 150 yards down the lane he was seized; I saw this handkerchief held up, but whether it was taken from the prisoner, or whether he dropt it, I cannot tell; I took and brought it to the prosecutor; the prisoner at first said another boy picked the gentleman's pocket, and gave it him, but before the magistrate he acknowledged he took it himself.</p>

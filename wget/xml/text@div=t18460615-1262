                  </hi>. I am foreman to Daniel Keith and another, silk manu<lb></lb>facturers, of Goldsmith-street, City. On the 19th of Sept., 1844, I delivered the prisoner some silk to be manufactured for my employers—I gave out as much warp as would make 112 yards of silk, and as much shute at various-times as weighed 7 lb. 14ozs.—on the 19th of Oct., 1844, one piece of silk was brought in to me of forty-three yards, and in Dec. he absconded—I had delivered silk to be manufactured into bis bands wbieh he bat not returned*. to the value of about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it ought to have made about forty-four yards more-of this class of goods—it is called taffety in a manufactured state—part of it was found pawned at two different pawnbrokers—it ought to have been returned before the 1st of Nov., 1844—I can identify this silk as that which in shute and warp I gave to the prisoner, front the peculiarity of the manu<lb></lb>facture—there is no other silk of the same sort manufactured in this couritry—the prisoner is the only one who had this particular colour—it was for a shipping order, and only made once in a certain number of years—there is, 3400 threads in the width, and by putting the glass to it, we can ascertain whether the quantity of warp is left in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALDWIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You gave the prisoner on the 19th of Sept. enough warp to make 112 yards in one quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and out of this I received forty-three yards, eleven yards, and twenty-two, which weighed 3 lbs. 12 ozs. of the shute—I weighed them myself, and entered it myself—we do not take from our weavers any acknowledgment of the silk they receive—they see it weighed in all cases—the prisoner saw this weighed—I got these two pieces of silk which are produced from the pawnbroker—I have the pattern of the work which the prisoner gave us, and the duplicates were given to us by the prisoner's wife—they are not here—the Magistrate thought it was not worth while, as the case was so clear—if I had had no such information, I could have sworn these two pieces of silk were the product of the silk I delivered to the prisoner—I could swear to the peculiarity of the make—I had got the pattern of it which the prisoner brought home, and it is a moral impossibility for another manufacturer to make out of another warp the same sort of goods, because the silk varies in size so much—I never saw these two pieces in a manufactured state, till I found them at the pawnbroker's, but I received similar pieces.</p>

I went with Mr. Caldwell to two pawnbrokers, and got the taffety—I went to Mr. Jones, in Brown's-lane, about the 9th of April, 1845, and found one piece—I afterwards went to Mr. Soulby's, and found the other piece—I stopped them for some time to find the prisoner—after a length of time I took the silk out by Mr. Caldwell's order—he gave me the money to do it, the time being nearly expired—I had the pawnbrokers before the Magistrate, but he thought proper not to bind them over—the prisoner was not found for some time—I was eighteen months in pursuit of him.</p>

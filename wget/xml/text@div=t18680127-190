                  </hi>. I live at 64½, Church Lane, Whitechapel, and am manager to Mr. Henry Watts, bookmaker—about a quarter-past five on the morning of the 7th January my attention was attracted by a noise in the shop like a breaking of glass—I got up and went into the shop, and, not seeing anything the matter, I went to bed again—I had not been in bed two or three minutes when I heard the same noise again—I jumped up and put my trousers on, and ran out a back way into Church Lane—I saw three men and a woman run away from the shop shutters in the direction of Union Street—I followed them at the corner of Church Lane until they turned into Union Street, when I lost sight of them for a moment—when I came to the corner I saw two men and a woman on one side of the road and one man on the other—I called, "Police!" as loud as I could, and I heard somebody say, "Split out"—directly I heard that two of the men started one way, and the man and woman the other—I can swear to Kelly as being one of the men—I ran down Union Street, and the two men, Kelly being one of them, turned into Holloway Street, and then into Mulberry Street—I knew that by going back I could get to the end of Mulberry Street before them—when I got to the corner I saw them coming up Mulberry Street—I called "Police!" again, and they went running back—there was a man standing at the corner of Mulberry Street, and I asked him to watch that end of the street while I went round to the other—I ran to the other end and saw Kelly run past me—he was alone then—I ran after him down the Commercial Road, and caught him in Berners Street—I gave him into custody—I am positive he is one of the men—I returned to the shop and found the shutter had been forced and the glass broken, and there was a boot hanging half-way out of the window—I saw the place all safe the night before, and shut it up myself.</p>

Coope and Co., brewers—on the morning of the 7th January I was in Union Street, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I looked round and saw two men, who I believe to be the prisoners, with a female, running, followed by the prosecutor, in the direction of Mulberry Street—Holloway Street is just between Mulberry Street and Union Street—I stayed where I was till the prosecutor came up to me at the top of Mul<lb></lb>berry Street—the prisoners ran nearly up to us—he pointed them out to me, and then ran back to the other end of the street—I stood in the dark, and Spurdan ran up to me; I caught him and gave him into custody—I am sure he was of the men I saw running in Union Street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 43). On Wednesday, May 28th, at a quarter to 2, I was in Langham-street—I heard the sound of the breaking of glass in Great Tichfield-street—I ran towards it, and met the prisoner and another man running very fast—I was about to stop the prisoner, and he ran into 35, Langham-street—as I was in the act of taking him he shot across from me—I chased him up Great Tichfield-street, and sprang my rattle—he was stopped by a civilian at the corner of Wells-street—I chased the other man a little way up Wells-street and lost him—I then turned back to the prisoner—I found him in the custody of another policeman—I told him be must go back with me and see what was the matter—I went and examined the houses in Great Tichfield-street, and found the fanlight of No. 84 broken; I roused the landlord—the prisoner said it was not him; he had done nothing.</p>

I am a tailor, of 84, Great Tichfield-street—on 28th May I was awoke by a loud crash of glass, which appeared to be in the shop—I jumped out of bed, ran into the shop, and unfastened the door—I heard the rattle spring in the distance—I went and put on my clothes, and shortly after the policeman brought the prisoner to my place—this coat is mine—it had been hanging on the shop door, under the fanlight, which was broken; it must have been taken from there—the fanlight was whole when I went to bed.</p>

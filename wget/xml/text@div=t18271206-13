               <p>Q. What led you first to suspect the prisoner? A. She slept in the same bed with me, and on the morning of the 15th I found my pocket, which contained the keys of my trunk, was moved from my pillow, where I had put it the night before; the keys were still in the pocket; I went down stairs to my trunk, counted my money, and missed nine sovereigns; I have found none of them. Ballard, the housemaid, came, and I told her; I then told Mrs. Harrison; when I spoke to the prisoner about it, she said she had not moved my pocket; I know she had no money on the 1st of November, for she borrowed 3s. 6d. of me, and on the 7th she told me she did not know when she could pay me, for she had no money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you had forty sovereigns? A. Thirty-eight.</p>

            . I am the housemaid. On the 15th of November Davis told me she had lost nine sovereigns; the prisoner asked me to cut out a cap on the 10th, and I cut it out; on the 12th she asked me to trim her a bonnet; I never saw any money in her possession; the cap was made of - of a yard of net which she said was 9d. a yard, and there were four yards of lace at 1s. 2d.; she had a new cloak worth 18s., and a new gown worth about 8s.; she said she had paid for them; I know she had borrowed 3s. 6d. of Davis.</p>

            . I am mistress of the house; it is in Kensington parish; the cook told me of this, on the morning of the 15th - I accused the prisoner of stealing the nine sovereigns; she said she knew nothing of them - I sent for Davis, and accused her before her; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060013"></xptr>still denied it - I searched her boxes, in her presence, and found a gauze and two silk handkerchiefs, four yards of ribbon, a cloak, a handsome Leghorn bonnet, handsomely trimmed with ribbon, a handsome lace cap, and a swansdown tipped for the neck; she had gone out under the idea of going after a situation, on the 12th, and then brought home the bonnet - I did not see it then, but I saw it the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. She might have had the other things before? A. They had not been worn.</p>

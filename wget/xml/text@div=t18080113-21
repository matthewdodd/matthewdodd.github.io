            . Q. On the 8th of December last were you going towards Chelsea. - A. I was going to Hans-place, Sloane-street, about half past five.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark then was it not. - A. No, it was moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body following of you as you was going there. - A. Yes, a man with a long rough great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you first observed him. - A. At the top of Sloane-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he follow you. - A. He followed me quite down to Hans-street</p>
               <p>Q. Did he turn into Hans-street. - A. Yes, into Hans street.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened upon your turning into <placeName id="t18080113-21-crimeloc125">Hans-street</placeName>

               <p>Q.Having taken the shawl from out of your hand, what was then done. - A. He ran off with it. I got up and went into a green grocer's shop, and told the man that I had been throwed down; I asked him to go with me to Hans-place. When the boy was going to take me to Hans place, I said the man had taken a crimson shawl from me; a milkman heard me, he pursued him and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the milkman. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were going with the green grocer's lad to Hans-street you met a milkman. - A. Yes, the milkman said he saw the man run round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned it to the milkman and he pursued him. - A. Yes, the milkman pursued him after I left the green grocer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man afterwards that evening that throwed you down. - A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130017"></xptr>Q. Did you see the man's face before he throwed you down. - A. I saw him just before we got out of Sloane-street to go into Hans-street; he turned round and I saw his face, I saw the man turn round.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face. - A. He had his coat buttoned up round his neck, I could not see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of his coat. - A. Rather a dark olive colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice whether he was a short or tall man. - A. He was shorter than me, I observed, when he turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the shawl again. - A. Yes, I saw it that night when the man was confined; the milkman shewed me the shawl again at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man at the watchhouse. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the handkerchief, was it left with the milkman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose shawl was it. - A. Mrs. Thornborough's of Hans-place.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her husband's name. - A. John.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it made of. - A. Silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it only silk, was there no other material in it. - A. I do not think there was any other material in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She says she came to see her shawl at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Court. She says the shawl was shewn to her at the watchhouse by the milkman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said very wrong.</p>
               <p>Witness. I do not know whether it was the watch-house or no; it was the place where he was confined all night till the next morning.</p>
               <p>EDWARD COLTEN. Q. Were you in Hans-street any time on the 8th of December last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time. - A. About half past five; I was coming out of Sloane-street to go into Hans-street; I saw the man run round the corner to go into Sloane-street again, towards Sloane-square; then I went round to go into Hans-place to serve two families; I saw this young lady, she said she had been robbed; I told her I would go after the man and catch him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean by the lady, the last witness. - A. Yes. I went after the man, I caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man you saw run round the corner. - A. Yes; I caught him almost down to Sloane terrace.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from where you met him. - A. Almost a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the shawl. - A. It was stuffed in his coat at his bosom; I took it from him; that was in Sloane-street where I took the shawl from him.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you took the shawl away immediately upon laying hold of him. - A. Yes, I took it immediately away when I took him over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Then where did you carry him to. - A. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar the man whom you saw run round the corner. - A. Yes, he looks like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him and see whether he is the man that you took to the watchhouse. - A. He looks a great deal like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it. - A. I have no doubt at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Then why did not you say so. - A.After I took him to the watchhouse I took the shawl home, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed. - A. In a dark rough coat, apparently a dark brown. I produce the shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the lady it that night at the watch-house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner. - A. The next day he was carried before Mr. Dudley and committed to prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say the lady came to see the shawl at the watchhouse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not see her. - A. No, you was locked up, and she was in the room.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any body follow after you in pursuit of the prisoner. - A. Yes,

               <p>Jury. Did he make any resistance when you first seized him. - A. Very little; there were a great many people came round; then he struggled a little, we had a little bit of a rumble; then we went down to the watchhouse together.</p>

            . My master's name is Walker, he is a green grocer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did miss Little come to your house and complain that she was robbed. - A. Yes; I went with her from my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Going away from your master's house to her house what happened - did you pursue after any person that robbed her. - A. Yes, I followed the milkman; he pursued a man in a rough great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that man in a rough great coat when you pursued him. - A. Almost down to Sloane Terrace. We saw him tumble down by the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him fall down. - A. Mr. Colten did.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, did you see him fall. - A. I did, before I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. What made him fall. - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he fell down. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Colten had got hold of him did you come up to him. - A. He was at the place where Mr. Colten first laid hold of him; I saw Mr. Colten take a shawl out of his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the watchhouse with Colten. - A. No, I went to fetch the lady; I went with him, but I did not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he at the watchhouse when you went to fetch the lady. - A. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his face so as to swear to him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he was a man in a rough great coat. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Colten. I saw him running, he was running when he tumbled down.</p>
               <p>Q. When you run after the prisoner did he seem to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130018"></xptr>stoop down or did he fall down. - A. He fell down; I have asked a man in Sloane-street that knew him; he says he is a hard working man.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at the shawl, is that the shawl. - A. That is the shawl, I know it by the grease that is in it.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN. - A highway robbery consists in taking away goods in a violent manner on the King's highway; and the fact of this young woman being robbed by somebody there is no doubt. She has told you some man caught her by the leg just as she got into Hans-street, threw her down, and took the shawl away from her; that in law is enough to constitute a highway robbery. - The next question is, whether the prisoner is the man; she says it was a man in a dark rough great coat; a man in a dark brown rough great coat is seen turning round the corner of Hans-street into Sloane-street by the milkman. Upon her telling the milkman that she was robbed, he pursued after the man and caught him; that man turned out to be the prisoner; and from under his breast is the shawl found which was taken from her by a man in a rough great coat. Likewise Hicks as he was going home with the lady, upon his meeting the milkman, he likewise pursued after him; - he has told you when he came up to him, from out of the bosom of the prisoner at the bar was taken that shawl. There is no accounting how he got this shawl in any other way than he being the man that laid hold of her leg, throwed her down, and took it from her.</p>

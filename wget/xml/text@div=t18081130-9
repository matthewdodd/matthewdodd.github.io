            . On the 8th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner put a piece of copper into his breeches.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Are you apprentice to your father - A. No, I work for him. He then went out and I called him back; I asked him for the copper he had in his breeches; he said he had none; I asked him to let me look in his hand; he then dropped it; I picked it up and told him that was the piece; I took him into the shop and sent for an officer. The officer and I went to his lodgings and found some other bits of copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You told my lord that you are not an apprentice to your father - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What are you then - A. I work for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and the prisoner together in the shop at the time when you say he took this piece of copper - A. I was in the shop along side of him where I could see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body in the shop with him besides you - A. There were others, but none in the shop but he and I, where he was at work; I was within ten yards of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up to him afterwards and called him back, you asked him for the copper that was in his breeches; he said he had got none - A. He had got it in his breeches when he went out of the shop, and when he went out in the street he had the copper in his breeches; on his coming in I suppose he pulled it out.</p>
               <p>Q.Might not a man working in your shop take up a bit of copper by accident - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called him back he came back - A. Yes: and he had the copper on him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. I was sent for to take the prisoner in custody; afterwards I went to his room; there in the table drawer I found three pieces of bolt copper; one little bit was marked LF, and this is the piece that was found on his person.</p>

            . Look at this piece of copper - A. This is the piece of copper that he had in his breeches when he went out in the street; and this is the other piece that I marked the other day. It was found at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How do you know that is your bit of copper - A. Because I saw him put it in his breeches, and I saw it drop out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you sure that the piece of copper that he dropped from his hand, is the piece that he put in his breeches - A. Because he had no other piece about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he could not have got it from any other person - A. No, he could not, because he had not got above ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing on that bit of copper that marks it to be your father's - A. No; but that I found at his house I had marked the day before.</p>
               <p>COURT. They are both your father's property - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

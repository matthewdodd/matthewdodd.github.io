In the evening a quarter before seven, I had occasion to ask her for change of a ten-pound check; she went up stairs and to her great surprise she found her drawers opened, and all her money was gone, to the amount of seventy-five pounds I am sure of. I went immediately up stairs; I could not find any of the money, not till the officer found some. I lost seventy-five or eighty pounds.</p>

            . Q. You have the care of the cash I find - A. Yes, I have. I kept it in my own bed-room, in a drawer, which I always kept locked. On Saturday, the 12th of this month, Mr. Fincham requested me to give change of a ten-pound note; I immediately went up stairs for the change, and took the ten-pound note up with me, which I placed in the drawer with the other money; there were twenty-two two-pound bank notes, two ten-pound notes, and fifteen one's, making in the whole seventy-five pounds; they were all safe. I then locked my drawer before I came down to dinner; at which time the prisoner acknowledged to his master in the presence of the officer, he took the money.</p>
               <p>Q.You were not present to hear him - A. No; there is a witness that did hear it. About seven o'clock in the evening, I went up stairs for change of a ten-pound check, to my great surprize, I found my drawer unlocked, and the money gone. I immediately came down, and told Mr. Fincham. I was certain it could be no other person than the prisoner, nobody else had been up stairs during that time.</p>

               <p>Q. You could not tell that - A. I could. The bed-room stairs adjoins the bar; nobody could go up stairs, except a little girl that had the care of my child, and the prisoner. The prisoner was not seen after, not till Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. Saturday evening, about ten o'clock. I went to the prisoner's master's house, in Great Coram-street, Brunswick-square. I told him the circumstance, and how my house was situated; he said, he thought I had great grounds of suspicion. His master requested that we should be there on Monday morning with an officer, and take him in custody; which was done.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Sunday, the 13th, Mr. Fincham applied to me to apprehend the prisoner; I went in company with Mr. Fincham to his master's house on Monday morning; I saw the prisoner; I charged him with the robbery; he at first strongly denied it. I searched the prisoner; I found thirty-six shillings in silver upon him. I bid him to lock up his room; I took him to his master. When he was there he acknowledged in the presence of Mr. Fincham, he said, he did do it, he was six days in breaking open the drawer, and getting the money. He said, he had left twenty-five pounds in a young woman's hands in Harford-street, Fitzroy-square. I went with him to the house No. 2, Harford-street, Fitzroy-square; when we went into the house, he said to the young woman, my dear, where is that money; she took this pocket-book which I produce now, out of her ridicule; she gave this book into my hand. He said, take this Mr. Brown, it is part of Mr. Fincham's money. I examined the book, and found ten two-pound notes, and nine one's in it. The five-pound note he said belonged to the young woman; the young woman is in court. He had a great many clothes that he had taken out of pawn, and new ones, which he said, he had bought with the part of the money; ten pounds he said he had paid for taking them out. I brought the pocket-book away with me. I found in a tea-caddy five pounds one shilling in silver; part of that he said belonged to the young woman; he said, the other part was to buy some linen for him. That is all I know. There was a new hat, a brooch, and a ring, that he said were bought with the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I acknowledge in the presence of my master that I had committed the fact - A. Yes; I heard you acknowledge that you had committed the fact to your master. You said ten pounds you gave to a girl, three pounds you paid to a man in Newgate, you paid six pounds for a pocket-compass, five pounds six shillings you gave for a chain, seal, and a ring, and two pounds you gave to a young woman in Hart-street, Covent Garden. That is all I can recollect. There was some more things that amounted to sixty-four pounds in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. When I gave you that money, did I say that was part of Mr. Fincham's money - A. Yes, you did.</p>

Mr. Butcher always represented himself as a gentleman to me, and he always behaved as such to me. He came to me last Saturday night, between seven and eight o'clock, and stopped with me until Monday morning. He asked me on Sunday evening to purchase him some linen; he told me he would leave his pocketbook with me, and the things I bought for him I was to have made for him, and to have the bills in his own name, and he should call on Monday night. The officer came with Mr. Butcher on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered to the officer a pocket-book - A. Yes; that was Mr. Butcher's pocket-book; Mr. Butcher delivered it me; it was the same as he left with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing of his besides - A. There was some of his wearing apparel, which the officer took away; the wearing apparel belonged to him. The officer took likewise a five-pound note of mine, and two one's.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Can you speak to any of the notes - A. I cannot identify the notes. I lost upwards of sixty pounds out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday previous to my being apprehended, I was in and out of the Union, West Indiaman, which lay off Mr. Fincham's house; when I was on board a young man gave me five-and-twenty pounds to purchase six dozen of wine, which I was to send down to Bristol to his father, and part of that money was his money; the notes now in possession of the officer are part of them notes. The time has been so short since I have been in prison, I have not had time to collect my friends to speak in my behalf.</p>

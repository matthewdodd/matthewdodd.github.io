            . I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner about nine o'clock at night, on the 24th of December, in the North-road, with this sash, about four or five hundred yards from the house it was taken from; I asked where he got it - he said he was going to take it to a Mr. Palmer's, I think, but at last he told me he had taken it from a house near the Ivy-house public-house; I took him to the watch-house, and went and found the house - the back parlour sash was gone - it had been nailed in with three nails, two at top, and one at bottom.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Gray; we are tailors and drapers at Nos. 70 and 71, Blackman-street, Borough—Hide was our foreman—it was his duty to keep the stock, and to give out all the goods to the tailors who were at work for us—he was to keep a book in which he was to enter all the goods that he gave out—Gwyther was a tailor who has worked for us out of the house, rather under twelve months—in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation, I applied to Mr. Stevens, and caused this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) to be written—it was sent to Stevens, who lived in the same house with Gwyther, at No. 132, Great Suffolk-street, on Monday the 5th of June—on Tuesday the 6th, I had some black cloth in from the damper's—it was put in a place where the customers do not usually go, to be rolled next morning—I saw them there</p>

               <p>safe till ten o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 7th, when it was taken to be rolled—I saw Gwyther in my shop on that Wednesday morning, about nine o'clock, and I saw him there as late as twelve o'clock, when I saw him go away, he had a bag with him very full indeed—the same afternoon I saw one yard and three-quarters of superfine black cloth, and three yards of ker<lb></lb>seymere, in possession of Stevens, in Great Suffolk-street—they were our pro<lb></lb>perty—the kerseymere had been previously marked in my presence—this is the piece of black cloth, and here is a particular notch on the edge of each of them—the ends of both correspond—the one yard and three-quarters correspond at one end with the bulk, and at the other, with a piece that was torn off—this piece of cloth should have measured eighten yards and a quarter, but it just two yards deficient—I was present the same afternoon when Gwyther's apart<lb></lb>ment was searched, and I found there a quarter of a yard of cloth which, being joined to the one yard and three-quarters, would make the entire of the roll, and account for the whole deficiency—a piece of cloth, measuring two yards, was produced by Mr. Worley, a pawnbroker—it matched in cutting, with a piece of cloth in my stock, and I missed this on Wednesday night—there is no entry in my books of either of these pieces of cloth—I have looked through the books—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) in which it was Hide's duty to have entered them if they had been given to the tailors for work for us—Gwyther was taken into custody—I then went to my shop to Hide, and Mr. Gray, my partner, asked Hide in my presence how that piece of black cloth came to be cut—he said he had given it out to make a coat for an order which stood in the book at a blue coat for a man of the name of M'Carthy—I said, "How is that, when the order stands for a blue coat?"—he said, "The man has altered his mind from a blue to a black"—I said, "How does it hap<lb></lb>pen you have not altered the order-book?"—he said, "I cannot tell, in my hurry I forgot it"—I said, "If this is the case what is become of the piece of blue cloth?"—he said, "I have had it back again"—I said, "Where is it, if you have had it back again; produce it?"—he said, "I do not know where it is; I cannot be answerable for cloth that I have had back some days"—I sent for M'Carthy and gave Hide into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mattressmaker in the prosecutor's service. On the 7th of June, about a quarter to twelve o'clock in the morning, I went into the shop, and saw Gwyther standing there with a small empty bag in his hand—I staid there about five minutes—I did not speak to him—I asked Hide, who was behind the counter, about a mattress which I had to make—I did not see him and Gwyther speak together—Gwyther was on the other side of the counter—when I came away Gwyther followed me out, and asked if I would take a glass of ale—I went with him to a public-house, and had something to drink—in a little time Alexander came in—Hide came in, had a glass of beer, and went out immediately—he was the last that came in, and the first that went out—Gwyther followed him some time after—I believe he still had the bag.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Brides - Mr. Morris directed me to watch his premises. On the morning of the 22d of June, I was there and saw his warehouse apparently safe - Mr. Richardson lives next door; I went to his door and found it opened rather stiffer than usual: I got up to the shutter-hole, looked through and saw the back of a man - I informed Huckel - we both went to Richardson's back door and found it open; we went in and found five black bags there, and saw a large hole in the wall, which goes through to Mr. Morris premises, it was large enough to admit one of the prisoners to get through - Huckel left me there, and Mr. Morris took the property when he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you measure the hole? A. No - it was not large enough for me to get through, but I think the prisoners could; I did say at first that the man I saw seemed a tall man - I had not examined the lock of Richardson's door the day before, but it used to open very easily with a push.</p>

            . I am inspector of the nightly watch. Fishburn came and said he saw a man in Richardson's shop; I went and looked and saw the back door open - I ran round to the door and saw five bags there; I saw the hole in the wall - it was large enough for the prisoners to get through; I went with Skilling down the market to the end of Fleet-lane, and then to the Albion coffee-shop - I had left my hat at Richardson's shop; when we came out of the coffee-shop - Livermore was there and he said to Skilling "What does he do here? what is he looking for?" I said "Go about your business;" Skilling then nodded to me and I seized Livermore - he endeavoured to get away, and used all the violence he could; I was up and down with him repeatedly - he was rescued from me; I was knocked about severely - I had a black eye and my lip was cut; some firemen came up and assisted me - I had repeatedly seen Livermore before, but not Elvery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you spring your rattle? A. I do not carry one; it was just five o'clock - the watchmen were off duty; Livermore appeared to be standing there unconcerned - I had not been drinking anything that could affect me: I might have had a glass or two of ale, and a pint of porter, in the night - I heard Livermore say to Skilling "He is a pretty officer to go to sleep in the market, and lose his hat;" several persons tried to rescue him - no one took my part till the firemen came up; I called on the people to assist me, but they did not - I was with him alone some time, and held him by his neckcloth, till he was black in the face - he held me by the throat; I said I wanted him, but did not say what for, as there were persons round who would have rescued him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's. I was standing at the end of Fleet-lane, leaning against a post, at a few minutes to five o'clock on this morning; I could see Richardson's back-door; I saw two men come out of that door; they ran as hard as they could, and in running, knocked down a large hamper; they ran towards me as far as the first opening, nearly opposite the Fleetprison gates; I noticed their dress particularly - and in about fifteen minutes they came into the market again, and were within eight yards of me; they stopped two or three minutes - one of them said, "Do they call this Fleet-market?" the other said, "Yes, I believe it is;" I have known Livermore these twelve months; I went up to the premises and found Huckel; he came down the market with me; I described their dress to him - he went down the middle of the market, and I down the side, but saw nothing of them; we went into the coffee-shop, and as we came out I saw Livermore, who said, "Skilling, what is the matter?" I said,"Nothing, but that man (Huckel) has lost his hat;" Livermore said, "There is something more than that; there is a screw loose, I am sure;" I nodded to Huckel, who came up and said, "Hold you impudence," and seized him by the handkerchief, and he seized him; they struggled together, I assisted as well as I could, but the mob intefered and secured him; I followed him to Newcastle-street, where he met Elvery, who took hold of him, and hurried him up the street; I saw Elvery take his apron off: they then came down the street again, went to the place, and stood looking at Huckel, who was then being ill-used by the mob; I ran out to the watch-house for assistance, but in that time Huckel was released; I have no doubt whatever of the prisoners being the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance were you from the shop when you first saw them? A. About ninety yards; I knew them by their dress chiefly - nobody was near them; they were out of my sight part of the time; Livermore came up to me voluntarily, and said there was a screw loose, and so on - there were then sixty or eighty persons about; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030076"></xptr>knew it was no use to call for assistance, for I will be bound full forty of them were thieves - I knew them before.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Have you seen them about the market? A. Yes; particularly on Sunday mornings; Huckel was not drunk.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you observe their dresses soiled? A. No; they both had aprons on when they came out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you and Huckel take hold of Livermore together? A. I was some little distance; I did not mention Livermore's name to Huckel, as I did not know he knew him by name; he had a black coat and drab trousers; I had not seen him in that dress before, but I knew his person before.</p>
               <p>- ELMES. I am a night watchman of St. Martin's, Ludgate. The two prisoners had been brought into the watch-house soon after twelve o'clock on this night, for an assault; I let them out shortly after - they then both had white aprons on, twisted round them; they were not searched.</p>

I saw the aperture in the wall, and think it large enough for a person to go through; I found this brick auger, a crow-bar, four centre-bits, a dark lantern, and turnscrew, all in Richardson's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the bags large? A. Yes; most of the goods were laid in the wrappers, as they were in the shop; a few, which were taken from the windows, were rather tumbled - it might take about an hour to do all this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any thing done to the wall which would have made dirt on the persons who did it? A. Yes, unless their coats were off; some of the shawls were soiled by being taken through that hole.</p>

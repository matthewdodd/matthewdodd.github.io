                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, and live in Great New-port-street. On the 23rd of December I had a hogshead of brandy in the St. Katharine's Docks—I saw the prisoner in December—I gave him an order on a blank bit of paper for tasting brandy in the docks—I see my name on this order—it is not my writing—I never authorized, him to sign my name to any document whatever—I met-him in the London Docks after I had heard of this, and I asked him how he dare forge my name—he laughed at me, and said he had a customer for the brandy—I am sure I used the word "forge" to him, and told him to keep away from the st. Katharine's Docks, or he would be taken up—he said he was then going there, and he did business there every day.</p>

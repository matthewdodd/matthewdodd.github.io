The prisoner was in my employ—t live in High-street, Mary-le-bone, and am a cheesemonger and pork-butcher—last Saturday I gave him 12lbs. of meat to make into pork-sausages—he took the meat into the sausage room, returned in about an hour, and hung the sausages up—I noticed there was a small quantity for a dozen pounds of meat—I took them down, weighed them, and found only ten pounds—I made particular enquiries if any had been sold, and was satisfied there was not—I made no mention of it to the prisoner—about two clock he went to</p>

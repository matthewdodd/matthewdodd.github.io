            . I am Mr. Jetler's nephew: when the prisoner was going out of the house, he ordered me to take a pot of porter to 43, Upper Marybone-street; and while I was going there, he asked me if I had brought change for half a guinea; I said, no, I would go and fetch it; he told me to bring two shillings worth of halfpence, they were going to play at cards. I fetched the change, he gave me the medal; I thought it did not feel like a half guinea; there was a light in the window, I looked to see what it was, and the prisoner ran off; I ran after him, calling, stop thief; he turned round, and said he would knock my brains out, if I attempted to run after him; he was stopped by two men, and taken back to my uncle's house.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner, I found five shillings in silver, half a crown, and fifty-two halfpence, and a medal of that kind; the lad knowed one of the halfpenny's to be the same that his aunt gave him in the change.</p>

I lived with the Russian Ambassador; there I knew a young man of the name of Chipperfield, unfortunately, I met him in Marybone-street; he asked me to go to the public-house and get change for half a guinea; when he saw the boy put the change in my hand, he went away; and when the boy said it was not a good half guinea, I went after him, thinking to meet with him.</p>

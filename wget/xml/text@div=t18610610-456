                  </hi>. On Friday afternoon, 3d May, I was on the canal near Staines-moor, Ballasting for mud—James Wicks was with me—whilst there I saw the two prisoners upon the London and South Western Railway—they kept dodging about round the railway-bridge—I thought they were up to no good, and watched them, and as a train was approaching just before 3 o'clock I saw one of them throw a piece of wood on to the rail—this is the piece <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe it was the biggest one (<hi rend="italic">Tilley</hi>) who threw it—I could not get out of my Boat at the moment, or I should have tried to go and take the wood off the rail—the train came on at a great pace—I beckoned to the driver, but he had no time to stop the train, or do anything; he could not have done it—I got out of my Boat, and went after them, and the Boys ran away—I knew it was no use running after them, so t watched them—they went to the next bridge, further down the line, and I went after them again—as soon as they saw me coming they got up, and ran away again—I saw a young man coming along with a horse and cart, and he caught Tilley—I went with him to the station—I am sure the prisoners are the two Boys—I was about a hundred yards from them at the time this was done—I had seen them for about seven or eight minutes before they did it, or it might have been ten.</p>

                  </hi>. On the afternoon of 3d May I was with Wooden—I saw Tilley standing behind the cattle Bridge on Staines-moor—when the train came up I saw him step out and stand by the side of the metals, and when the train came within about two hundred yards of him he stepped back behind the Bridge, and I saw the piece of wood now produced thrown across the metals—Wooden got out of the Boat, and went after him—I saw both the prisoners, but I did not see the little one till they ran away from behind the Bridge—I could not speak to him—I am certain they are the Boys I saw run from the Bridge, but I did not see Peat till they ran away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go after them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I remained in the Boat till Wooden went and caught them—they ran away together—they were not running very fast—I did not see which one it was that threw the wood—it came from behind the Bridge where they stood.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 38). On 3d May, about half-past 4 o'clock, I was on duty at Staines police-station—Tilley was brought there by Wooden—I searched him, and found upon him this knife—it has a saw to it—I have compared it with the stick from which this wood was cut, and in my opinion it was cut by that saw—it forms a paling running along the side of the railway—it appeared to be fresh done—it was quite close to the Bridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I was driver of the <hi rend="italic">Nile</hi> engine on this day, by the 2.45 train—as we came near Staines I saw a man in a Ballast punt Beckon to me—I looked and saw a piece of wood across the line, and I saw a Boy going up the Bank—a thing like this placed across the rail is dangerous—it was caught by the life-guard, and cut in two—the life-guard travels within about an inch or an inch and a quarter of the line, in front of the wheel—it is put there for the purpose of catching anything that may Be placed on the metals.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does not that always prevent an accident from a thing of this kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not always—a piece of wood like this might cause an accident—I have known a piece, not larger, throw the engine off the line—I was travelling at great speed at the time; forty miles an hour—I shut off the steam as soon as I saw the wood.</p>

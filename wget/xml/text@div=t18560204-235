                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Cock and Mortar public house, in Tothill-street. On Monday, 28th Jan., I was there about 5 minutes before 12 o'clock at night; the prisoner came in with another man, they called for half a quartern of rum—I served them—the other man gave me a shilling—I gave them 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the shilling into the till—I had but one sixpence more in the till—the prisoner and the other man drank the rum—the other man said, "Now, you must stand something"—the prisoner called for a pot of ale—I said, "It is too late; I won't serve it, it is just upon 12 o'clock"—the prisoner said, "Then we will have another half quartern of rum, that we shan't be a minute about"—I served him, and he gave me a shilling out of his hand—I tried it, and found it bad—I took the rum back—I said, "You scoundrels, this is a bad one; I have a great mind to lock you both up"—the other man went away—the pri<lb></lb>soner refused to go without his change—I went to the till, and found that shilling was bad—I said, "This is a bad one"—I went to the door and called a policeman—I gave him the, two shillings, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

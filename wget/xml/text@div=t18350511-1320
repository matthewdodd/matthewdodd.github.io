On Tuesday night, the 5th of May, I was at West Ham, in company with Charles Firmin—we were at the Unicorn—we went in there about half-past nine o'clock, and stopped about an hour and a half—I saw all the three prisoners there—I did not know them before—I took out ray watch while they were there—it was in my fob—I had a guard to it—I afterwards went to the Swan public-house, at</p>

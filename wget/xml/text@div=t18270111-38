            . I am servant to Mr. Davy. On Sunday morning, the 7th of January, while I was cleaning the brass-plate, outside the door, my mistress called me away; I went up-stairs, leaving the door ajar; I came down immediately, and saw the prisoner sitting in the parlour; she said she wanted to speak to Mr. Davy; I ran up into the drawing-room to my master, and told him the person, who had broken the windows before, wanted him - she had broken our windows a long time ago - I came down-stairs before my master - the prisoner was then gone, and had left the street-door wide open; I found the book-case door open, which had been shut before, and I missed a cruet-stand and castors out of it - I had seen it there ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is your master here? A. Yes; the prisoner broke the windows three months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she not had a child by your master? A. I do not know that; I have heard so - she told me she had had a child by him, and wanted something from him to maintain it; she said she was but fifteen years of age when it was born; I was rather agitated when I saw her, as I knew her - she caught hold of my hand and said, "I had a child by him when I was sixteen years old;" she said nothing to me about the parish having provided for it till it was seven years old.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What message did she give you for your master? A. All she told me to say to him was that she wished to speak to him; he did not give me any answer to deliver to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had she ever been in that room before? A. Not to my knowledge; she has been at the house twice while I have been there, and used very abusive language; and the second time she broke the parlour-windows - I then heard what had happened between master and her.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Giles. Before this happened I heard Mr. Davy had had a child by the prisoner; he settled with the parish officers about it ten or twelve years ago; I believe it is still provided for - I believe it is with the prisoner's sister. Last Sunday I went in search of the prisoner, for stealing this cruet-stand, and found her at the Black Horse public-house, in George-street, St. Giles, six or seven hundred yards from Mr. Davy's house - it was six or seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110024"></xptr>o'clock in the evening - she was not sober; I told her the charge - she said, "D - n the thing, I know nothing about it," but as we went along I said, "You had better let Mr. Davy have the cruet-stand;" she said, "Yes, I will let him have it, if he will send me back my - ."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know nothing of the provision of the parish officers? A. I know he paid a certain sum of money to the parish; I am sure they would not turn it adrift at seven years old; Mr. Davy was before the Magistrate, but the clerk said there was no occasion to examine him - she had the child eleven years ago; she is now twenty-seven years old, she says; she has been an unfortunate woman for some time; she has been before the Magistrate several times, for breaking windows, and her story has always been that she had a child by him; I cannot find the cruet-stand any where - I certainly did not say she had better tell me where it was - it was a slip of the tongue.</p>

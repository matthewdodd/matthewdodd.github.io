                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to William Norville and Son, No. 40, Cornhil. On the 3rd of April, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was taking the dust from the cellar—he was emptying a basket of dust into his cart, and I saw him pull some whale<lb></lb>bone from under his basket and put it into the cart—I said, "You have taken that bone from down stairs"—he made no reply, but came down the ladder—I spoke to him again, and he said he had only taken a piece or two to make a whip—he followed me down stairs and took another basket of dust—I saw a lot of whalebone in another basket ready to be taken away—I insisted on having it—the other man who was with him gave it to me—I insisted upon having what he had in the cart—the prisoner went up and brought down some—I said that was not all—he went up and brought bone from the cart two or three times—while I went to the back of the cellar they went up and set off with the cart—I informed my master, who sent me after them—I overtook them in Bishopsgate-street—they would not return at first, but did after a good deal of talking—the other absconded at the Flower Pot.</p>

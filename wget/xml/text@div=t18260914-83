               <p>MATTHEW FINCH. I live on my property, in Chapman-street, Cannon-street-road, St. George's East.

I bled most dreadfully on the head - I have the marks now, and shall as long as I live - there was several hands at one time in my pocket; they took out half a sovereign, and 8s. 6d. - I know I had eight or nine shillings in my pocket; I was knocked down with sticks - I received several blows - I think the second blow I had on the back of my head, knocked me down; the blow I have on my forehead, which was cut open, is the last blow that was given, and they left me; directly after the rattles began to spring - several blows were struck after I was knocked down - I lost a stick, and a new hat, that might have fallen off as I fell; the one, who I believe to be the prisoner, was the one down on his knee, and as I laid on my back, I struck him several blows in the face, with the head of my stick - it had a silver head, larger than half a crown - I struck him with all the force I could, and when they wrenched the stick out of my hand, I hit him several times - he was kneeling on one knee in the kennel - there were six or seven round me; I had not so much sight of the prisoner as I had of one who I can positively swear to, and who is here for trial, and it was him who almost caused Mrs. Finch's death - I do not recollect the man, I suppose to be the prisoner having a stick; I went to Spitalfields watch-house, and gave information, and I sent for a doctor, who dressed my wounds; I went to Worship-street on the Wednesday following, and saw the prisoner; he had several cuts in his face, on the side where I thought I struck him with my stick - he wore white stockings when he knelt down; a pair of white stockings were produced before the Magistrate - I have no doubt of his being the person who was on his knee; he knelt towards the curb, and in the kennel, or near it - there was dirt in the kennel, for I was all over dirt, both my trousers and coat; it was a fine light night, and there is a gas-light directly opposite.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You reason about his being the man from circumstances, not from a recollection of his person? A. I have some recollection of his face, but not so as positively to swear to it; I had a sight of him while he was on his knee - if he had no marks on his face, I should say as I do now; I have some slight recollection, but do not positively swear to him; the marks on his face, certainly made a strong impression on my mind - I was most dreadfully ill-used - I received several blows after I was down - and struck the person who I take to be the prisoner, myself - he did not strike me; it might be a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, or half-past eleven o'clock - it struck eleven when I passed Shoreditch-church; the brewhouse may be half a mile from there; it was a clear night - there was a gas-light opposite, and one on each side, right and left, fifteen paces off; they all had their hats on.</p>

In consequence of information, on Monday night, the 26th of June, Barrs and I went up Brick-lane, as far as Hare-street. about twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner sitting on a step at the end of Hare-street, with a young woman; he had been down on both knees, and his stockings were very dirty, and he had a blow or more on his face; the skin appeared grazed but did not bleed - it was red, as if fresh done; a young man, named Beedom, came up to him, and they spoke together; we took them both to the watch-house - Mr. and Mrs. Finch were not there, and not knowing where to find them, we let them go that night, upon their giving their address, and about twelve o'clock next day, Mr. Finch came to the watch-house; I asked him to describe the persons, and from his description we apprehended the prisoner that day; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140067"></xptr>I and Hart took a pair of white stockings out of a pail of water; he owned them to be his; I believe them to be the same as he had on the night before - for one was a good deal more dirty than the other, from the knee downward.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live at No. 45, Brick-lane. On the 26th of June I was at the Three Sugar Loaves public-house, St. John-street, Brick-lane; my two brothers, Stevens, and Fox were also with me; I saw Willett there - I went there about half-past nine o'clock the - prisoner and Fox were then there, and about an hour after Stevens and Fox quarrelled - they continued there till about five minutes beyond half-past eleven o'clock - the landlord then turned us out; Fox had struck the prisoner just before eleven o'clock, as they sat there; the prisoner wanted to fight Fox - the landlord said he would have no fighting there; Fox went out first, and when Stevens, my brothers, and I went out, Fox began wrangling with the prisoner again, and struck him, and they fought for about a quarter of an hour; Fox got the best of it, and both fell down; in one round particularly, Fox threw himself down, and threw Stevens over his head, which occasioned his face to be grazed as it caught the stones; I and my brother persuaded Stevens to leave off, and they put on their coats: we stood talking round the Sugar Loaves for about five minutes; I then told my brothers, as they were not going my way, I should go home; I left Stevens there, and as I passed Truman's brewery, on my way home, I saw a number of watchmen, and some persons round the Black Eagle tap, and saw a great cake of blood on the pavement, nearly as large as the crown of my hat - the prisoner was very ill at this time, and had been bad some time - he is a looking-glass frame-maker.</p>

Last Sunday, the 29th, I was on duty about half-past ten, in the Finsbury Pavement, and took two little girls into custody—I went with Farnish to Golden Lane, and she pointed out a house, I went into the house and found Millard there, on the ground floor—I asked him if he knew the girl—he said "Yes"—I said "What do you know of her"—he said, "She brought two jackets here this evening"—I asked him where they were—he said, "I have taken them away, and sold them at a house in Flowers Yard"—he said, "I don't know the number of the house"—he went with me to Mrs. Atkins's—I asked to see her, but she was in bed—I asked her in the hearing of Farnish if she had any jackets brought to her—she said the prisoner, Millard, had brought two jackets to her house, saying he had had nothing to eat, and begged Mrs. Atkins to buy them—I asked her to get up and go with me to the station, she did so—Millard said the girls brought the jackets to him, and he did not know they were stolen.</p>

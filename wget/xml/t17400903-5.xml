            . Mrs. Hollingsworth sent me, on Whitsunday last, for a Bundle she had left at Mr Wakefield's in Shoreditch. I don't know what was in it, but it was a pretty large bundle. I took it from Mr Wakefield's, and was to call for another, in Little Moorfields, which belonged to another Woman. As I was going over Moorfields, I met the Prisoner in a light cap'd Coat, and another Man in Soldier's Cloaths, and they went with me to the House where I was to call for the other Parcel. The biggest Bundle (which was Mrs Holling sworth's) I put upon my Head; the other I carried under my Arm, in the Lappet of my Coat. The Prisoner would have taken the little one to have carried for me, at the House from whence I took it, but I would not let him have it. However they followed me, and the Prisoner said again - Comrade, you are loaded, I will carry one parcel a little way for you. Well, Comrade, says I, if you will, I will let you; and so he took Mrs Holling sworth's Parcel, which weighed (I believe) about 40 or 50 lb. and came with me from Little Moorfields to Cripplegate Church, where he bid me go along, and then he slipped away from me. I thought he must go up Whitecross Street, so I turn'd up there, and enquired after the Prisoner. A Man told me he had seen such a Person, and if I made haste I should catch him; but I saw nothing of him, 'till he was taken up at Whitehall; which was about a Fortnight after this happened. I have never set my Eyes upon the things since, nor would the Prisoner confess any thing when he was apprehended, but he is the man, - I am positively sure he is the Man.</p>

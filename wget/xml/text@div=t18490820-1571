                  </hi>. I am an iron-turner, of Manchester. On 25th July I was with the prisoner in the tap-room of Mr. Newton, of the Phœnix Tavern, Ratcliff-cross—two men wanted a lodging, the prisoner went out with them to show them where they were to sleep—he came back and went out again—I do not know where he went to—there is a small window between the bar and tap-room—Edward Pope, the waiter, and James Whitehead were there—I went to bed at a little before one o'clock, and got up as the clock was striking six, and came down about five minutes past—I saw the tap-room window open, and a stone bottle with "aniseed" on it on the window—I put it on the form, shut the window, and went into the kitchen to wash myself—Whitehead was there, and said something to me—I went and found the pri<lb></lb>soner in the water-closet, and tried to awake him, but could not—I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Phœnix Tavern. On 28th July I saw the prisoner there about half-past twelve o'clock at night, drinking in the tap-room, talking with Frost, Whitehead, and me—he went out, and I saw no more of him—I went to bed about one—the tap-room window was fastened, and everything appeared safe—the door from the bagatelle-room into the back-yard was shut, but it has no fastening—the window could not be opened from outside without breaking the glass—I rose at a quarter to eight, and found in the bar a jug with a quart of brandy in it, a short pipe, such as I have seen the prisoner use, and a lump of bread—I saw the prisoner in the passage—he appeared quite tipsy—he told me some one let him in at a quarter to seven—my master's brother was down before me—I saw two large jars in the next yard—some one must have taken them from the bar, and got outside and lifted them from the window-sill—there were nine bottles of brandy in the yard, seven in a basket and two behind a partition—there are buildings all round the yard—no one could get in—there are a pair of large gates, which were fastened inside.</p>

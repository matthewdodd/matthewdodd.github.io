               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Anderson's name is David - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 1st of November were you at home - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband possessed of a watch that day - A. I was myself. It was a silver watch, it hanged up in the room on the 1st of November, I had seen it in the room that very morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room was it on the 1st of November - A. In a tea-chest in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part of the day on the 1st of November had you seen the tea-chest - A. I had it in my hand at five in the afternoon, and at that time it contained, a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your room - A. The prisoner came into my room, she altered her voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in the house - A. She had been a few nights in the house. I lodged in the back parlour; the prisoner was an acquaintance of the person that had the back parlour, and I lodged in that room likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she come in the back parlour - A. About five in the afternoon I had the tea-chest in my hand, I was going to unlock it, she brought an apron in her hand, and pressed me very much to pawn some property for her to pay her lodging that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pawn her apron - A. She pressed me very much and I wished her to be gone out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to take her apron to pawn for her - A. Yes, I did, I left the room and left her in it; she said she would not go out of the room for two hours; I said I should not be gone above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live - A. The house is in Coventry-court, in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. What pawnbroker did you go to - A. Mr. Hill in Rathbone-place, I pawned for her two aprons for nine-pence; I was not ten minutes gone. When I returned the prisoner was gone, and my tea-chest was gone; when I looked for it my tea-chest and the watch in it was gone; I never saw the prisoner again until the 14th of January; this was on the 1st of Nover; I was in search of her all the time. When I saw her she had been taken up for something else. I saw her in custody in Bow-street, then I made a charge before the justice. I gave half a guinea for the tea-chest.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for your watch - A. Seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch worth five pounds - A. Yes, I had it above two or three years, and there were ten guineas in gold in the tea-chest and the other articles. I have never seen the tea-chest, the guineas, or the watch since; I lost all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of the woman - A. I am quite sure; I had known her a fortnight.</p>

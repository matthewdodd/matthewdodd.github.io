I first saw them in Corke-street; I followed them into Burlington-street, where I took three of them; I saw only three; I brought them back to the house: I charged them with the theft, they all denied it; but upon separating them Foster confessed that he had then a brilliant hoop-ring and the garnet hoop-ring in his pocket; he delivered them to me; another of them, I believe Ditcher, told me he had dropped ten plain gold rings in Burlington-street; he took me to the spot where they lay, and I recovered them. Upon further examining the window I found there was a greater quantity of plain gold rings and some paste rings lost; Ditcher acknowledged having sold a parcel of them; he said he had sold a ring to Mr. Rapley; then I took them, namely, Ditcher, Foster, and Clark, to Sir John Fielding's office.</p>

[The rings found upon the prisoners were produced in Court, and deposed to by the witness.] The brilliant ring had a private mark on it, the other ring and the ten found in Burlington-street have no particular mark; I believe them to be my master's. Ditcher said that Clark drew them from the window, through this hole, with a small black wire; they were all in the same story; they all acknowledged having part of the articles drawn from the window, and that Clark was the person that drew them thence.

               <p>I live in Little Compton-street, St. Anne's; on Saturday was a week a publican, that lives over-right this prisoner, came to me, and acquainted me that there were some sweeps that had some brilliant rings, which they had stole in Bond-street: I pursued them, and took the prisoner Miles; he called himself then Patrick Malloy; I asked him what he had got of the things he had stole; he had these three diamond rings upon him: he told the magistrates openly, that they were part of what he had stole out of the window, and that he had been at Rochester and Chatham to hide himself; he owned he was along with them, and received them from him that took them.</p>
               <p>[The rings were produced in Court.]</p>
               <p>SKULL. These hoop-rings usually have a private mark on them; two of these rings have the private mark upon them, by which I can swear to them; the mark of the other is scratched out.</p>

               <p>A boy came into my shop in Leicester-fields, and brought a hoop-ring, I believe Ditcher is that person, on Wednesday the first of October, some time in the afternoon, I suppose about three or four o'clock; I find since he had defaced it before he brought it, it is a ring set with pearls; several of the stones are out; my man wiped it, and gave it into my hand; I asked him how he came by it; he said he had found it; I said, Are you sure you have not taken it out of any house where you have been to sweep chimnies? he said, he would assure me he had just taken it out of the kennel: I told him that if I could be assured he was an honest boy, I would buy it of him; I gave two shillings for it, which, I believe, is more than I could make of it if I was to sell it again (it was produced in court).</p>
               <p>SKULL. This is so very much defaced, that I cannot possibly swear to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time did you pursue these boys? - About three in the afternoon, and took them immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then Mr. Fisher you must be mistaken in saying it was between three and four; it must have been before they were taken up? - I cannot be positive to the hour; I think it was just after dinner.</p>
               <p>To PLATT. How many boys were there? - Three; I observed them about five minutes; I was coming cross from Grosvenor-street; it rained very hard; I wondered what they stood there for in the rain; nobody could perceive what they were about, unless they looked over their heads; I stood tiptoe, and looked over their heads; it was about three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Egg called two witnesses, who said he was a chimney-sweeper, and gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>How many of these boys have you? - Seven or eight, or more, I don't know how many; I have been in the country; my daughter has had the conduct of my business: I never knew any thing dishonest of them before this; they work from three, four, or five in the morning, and are generally done about one, then they go out to play in the fields, or about the door; they do what they will after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. You that are trusted with the breeding up seven or eight boys in your business, don't you think it is rather incumbent upon you to take a little care of their morals, to take care they are out of harm's way, that they don't run about the streets and get thieving? - They have always the afternoon to play in.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the reason that nine out of ten of them are thieves; that is a great grievance that has long called for redress; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150040"></xptr> is a shameful thing that these boys at this age are left without the eye of any master to take care of them; and this is the consequence they are now brought here to answer for being thieves; it is a scandalous thing in the master, he is as criminal as the boys, they are generally kept starving, and left at their own will to do whatever they please? - There is no such thing as starving in our business.</p>

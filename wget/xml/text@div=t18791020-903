                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On Friday, 12th Sept, about 4 p.m., I went to Mr. Rooney's warehouse, 27, Bishopsgate Street, and saw Mr. Rooney and Giesecke, and from their information I, with Davis, went at about 4.30 to Victor's shop, in Widegate Street, Middlesex Street, about 200 yards off—it is an open shop, without windows, where old tools and other second-hand goods were sold—I saw no brushes exposed for sale—I saw Victor's son, and then wont up and saw Victor in the second-floor front room—there were in the room a bed, a child's cot, a couch which Victor was sitting on, and a chest of drawers containing wearing apparel—I do not remember seeing any glass cases—there were articles of merchandise, some amber for pipes, some small nail-brushes, and other things—we were in plain clothes, and Victor knew both of us—I said to him, "We are two police-officers, and have come in consequence of Mr. Giesecke calling upon Mr. Rooney, brush manu<lb></lb>facturer, Bishopsgate Street, to-day, and showing him some brushes, which Mr. Rooney has identified as property stolen from his warehouse, and Mr. Giesecke telling him that he had bought 14 brushes of you to-day, and paid you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them; is that true?"—after considering a moment he said, "Yes, I sold Mr. Giesecke 14 brushes to-day, and charged him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them"—I said, "Have you any invoice?"—he said, "No, but I think I shall be able to satisfy you as to where I got them"—after considering two or three minutes, and my reminding him that I was waiting for an answer, he said, "well, I bought those brushes of a Mrs. Overton"—I said, "Where does she live?"—he said, "In Artillery Lane, close by, and keeps a greengrocer's shop"—I said, "When did you buy them?"—he said, "Within two or three days"—I said, "What did you give her for them?"—he said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each"—I directed Davies in his presence to fetch Mrs. Overton—these 13 hair brushes and five clothes brushes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were on a sideboard near Victor, and I said, "Did you buy</p>

               <p>those as well from Mrs. Overton? "pointing to them—he said, "Yes, and paid her the same price, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—Davies shortly afterwards returned with Mrs. Overton, and came into the room where we were—I said, "Mrs. Overton, we are police-officers, as Mr. Davies has told you; Victor says that you sold him some brushes within this last day or so; is that true or false!"—she considered a moment and then said, "Yes, I did sell him some brushes"—I said, "When?"—she said, "Last Monday"—that would be the Monday before the 12th—I said, "How many did you sell him?"—she said, "I do not know"—I said, "What did he pay you for them"—she said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—she said, "Well, I am a dealer in such things; I bought them at the New Cattle Market"—I said, "From whom?"—she said, "From various persons"—I said, "When did you buy them?"—she said, "Oh, from time to time within this last month"—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody; you will be charged with receiving a quantity of brushes, the property of Mr. Rooney, of Bishopsgate Street, knowing them to have been stolen"—I then turned away to speak to Victor, when Davies said, "Sergeant, Mrs. Overton wants to speak to you privately, and I went by the door and said to her, "What is it you want to say to me?"—she said, "Well, I do boy things in the Cattle Market, but I did not buy those brushes there. Will you step a little farther back, as I don't want Victor to hear what I say"—I said, "You had better speak out openly, so that we can all hear"—she said in Victor's hearing, "Well, I know a young man named Henry Bowman, who works for Mr. Rooney, a brush manufacturer, of Bishopsgate Street; I bought those brushes that you have shown me of Bowman from time to time, and paid him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them"—I then said to Victor, "Mr. Victor, you have made two statements with regard to the brushes: first, you told Mr. Giesecke that you had the brushes from the country, and now you say that you bought them of Mrs. Overton; you will be charged with being concerned with Mrs. Overton in receiving a quantity of brushes, the property of Mr. Rooney, knowing them to be stolen. Have you any more brushes which you have bought at Mrs. Overton's on your premises?"—he said, "Yes, you will find some in the top drawer, "pointing to it—his daughter opened it for me, and I found in it 11 horse brushes, two crumb brushes, and two clothes brushes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Where did you get these from, Mr. Victor?"—he said, "I bought them all of Mrs. Overton from time to time this last three months, and have paid her 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them"—before we left the room I found these three broom-heads (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he said were bought of Mrs. Overton—we searched the premises, but these were all the brushes we found—I took them both to the station, and then went to Mr. Rooney's warehouse close by, and took Bowman in custody—the three prisoners were brought together at the station, and formally charged, Bowman with stealing and the other two with receiving 50 brushes—Victor, addressing Mr. Rooney, said, "Do you intend to press the charge against me? If you do I have my remedy"—Mr. Rooney made no reply.</p>

I am a brush manufacturer at 27, Bishops-gate Street—the brushes are made at my factory in Shoreditch, and some of them are finished at Bishopsgate Street—Bowman has been my porter and warehouseman 11 years—here are 14 brushes: one at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., four at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, eight at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. wholesale price—they are new and of my manufacture, and 10 of them have the hair untrimmed—the trimming is always done at Bishopsgate Street—these 13, found on the sideboard, are also of my manufacture, the wholesale prices are 12 at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the other one at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the 12 being unfinished in the same way as the others—these five new clothes brushes are finished—the wholesale prices are: one 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., another 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other three 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—these 11 horse-brushes are new, two of them are unfinished, being without the web strap handles—the prices are 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—these two clothes brushes are finished, prices 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the two crumb brushes are finished, and the wholesale prices are 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the three broomheads are new, finished, value wholesale 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, they are all my manufacture—the total value is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed a large quantity of property from time to time—I never sell unfinished brashes—Bowman had access to my property, and until this matter was discovered I had every confidence in him—he had no authority to take brushes out to sell—Victor when in custody at the station threatened proceedings against me if I pressed the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Victor.</hi> I have seen you before—you did not to my knowledge know my father—he has not taken an active part in the business for 25 years, and has been out of business 15 years, and is seldom in England—I knew you were a neighbour—you may have been in the habit of purchasing articles in the shop—I bought some ink from you once for shipment—that is the only transaction that I recollect—from what I have heard since I should still continue to press the charge—the brushes which you now produce are not marked at a fair market price—I would give an order for 100 gross of them at the price marked—they could not be made for the money—they are marked 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I know the patterns well; they are not my manufacture—Sergeant Mitchell told me a long time ago that Nowland had given him some information—it is three years since I first sought the assistance of the police, and we were baffled then—when this matter cropped up I believe Nowland saw Mitchell, and made a communication to him which resulted in his being called—I have not otherwise spoken to him twice in two years—he was formerly in my employment, and left to better his condition—my feeling is to punish the receivers more than the thief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Victor's son—I was at the door on 12th September when the detectives came to say they wanted him, and I took them upstairs</p>

               <p>on the second floor—he was very ill and asleep on a couch, and I woke him—when Mrs. Overton arrived Sergeant Mitchell asked her one or two questions, and she turned round and distinctly said, "Mr. Victor did not know where the brushes came from"—I was beside my father, and about a yard and a half from Mrs. Overton—I heard that distinctly—he paid Mrs. Overton an increased rate for some goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been present when my father has paid Mrs. Overton money, and have seen him pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for horse brushes, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for broom-heads—he has for many years been in the habit of buying new brushes and unfinished ones also—I do not know Bowman, and have never seen him at my father's shop—Mrs. Overton I have seen many times—I knew they were greengrocers and saddlers—I have not seen her bring the brushes to our shop—they were not always paid for at the time—I have known her seven or eight years—she has brought brushes to my father's place within the last five or six months—I cannot say when before that, but not during the whole of the last twelve months—the first time was since August last—when she brought them she went sometimes in the shop and sometimes on the first floor—I never saw her on the second floor—she brought them openly in her hand in a newspaper parcel—my father some<lb></lb>times keeps entries in books—we have no book that I know of containing entries—they were generally cash transactions with Mrs. Overton—she used to bring four or five brushes at a time; I have seen as many as a dozen—she never gave a receipt for the money that I know of—I did not tell the officer yesterday that I had often cautioned my father against dealing with these brushes—I have cautioned him to be careful, because in a business like ours we can very easily get into trouble—I never cautioned him about these goods—he has bought other goods of Mrs. Overton, saddles, buckles, &amp;c., and she never gave a receipt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Victor's daughter, and am married—I was present on 12th September when the detectives came, and heard Mrs. Overton say "Mr. Victor does not know where these brushes came from"—I have a alight recollection of Mitchell asking him the price he gave for those out of the drawer, and I said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked if he had any more, and he referred him to the contents of a drawer—I do not remember his mentioning the cost of the larger brushes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My father said he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., each for the hair brushes—I do not recollect that he said what he gave for the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Victor's Defence.</hi> I am a dealer in every description of goods, new and secondhand. I have conducted my business with the utmost care and caution, and have occupied one place 22 years. I have assisted the police more than once by detaining goods that I believed to have been stolen, and if I had been permitted to explain this transaction it is a question whether I should have been here. I did not assert positively that these things came</p>

               <p>from the country. A tradesman is scarcely expected to state where he buys his goods, and may therefore make an assertion which is not strictly the fact. They were inferior brushes, and they were in the same unfinished state when I disposed of them. Mrs. Overton, at her own house and in my room, distinctly said that I knew nothing about where they came from, and Mitchell has admitted that she might have said so. I have bought goods for years from Mrs. Overton, and have always looked upon Mrs. Overton as a woman of business, and in buying of her I considered that I bought of him. Our transactions were always open and above-board, and I believed the goods had been honestly come by. I bought them at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., each, and sold them at a profit of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or leas. I was lying prostrate with debility when the detectives came into the room, and naturally hesitated when spoken to under such circumstances. I gave at once the required information from whom I had bought them and what I paid. I never spoke to Bowman in my life or had the slightest communication with him. I was permitted by the Magistrate to go out on my own recognisances.</p>

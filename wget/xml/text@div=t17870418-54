               <p>How lately before this robbery had you seen this trinket? - Not perhaps since February; I believe in the course of that month I think I must have seen it, for I had a mourning-ring there, that I would have wished to have tried on my finger, and it would not enter at all, having had the gout fixed on the joint of it; I can charge my memory with having seen it in February; there were three mourning-rings, and some other articles that have not been traced; I immediately missed three snuff-boxes, one of them a very remarkable fine tortoise-shell, very large, with a picture; I suppose it cost more than ten guineas, a great many years ago; it might not be worth ten shillings now; there was a varnished snuff-box, which I had bought when I was at Spa; I had hardly used it; it was in this leather case, in one of the pidgeon-holes; the case was left empty; I lost a fish-skin case of instruments, that was lying in my ink-standdish, that was on the library table; a silver small pair of scissars, a knife, and other instruments were in that case; in the upper part of that writing-desk there was usually two keys of padlocks; they used to lay in a bit of paper together; one of them I found in the morning, the other was taken away; on the inside of the writing-desk there was a green varnish tooth pick case, with flowers of different colours, but the ground was green, and the pipe was what they call tortoise-shell, that was gone; I lost three shirts; going into my dressing-room, which is within my library, the window was close barred; I opened that window, and found the lower part of an India cabinet was broke open; in the upper part of that cabinet I kept papers; there might be a surplice, I believe; there was a glass door; nothing appeared but papers; I always kept all my linen in that lower part, and any body that lived in my house might know it; the upper part of the cabinet, that contained papers, was locked; I found these three keys laying on the carpet, immediately before that lock; they had been taken out of the desk; there were taken from that three shirts; there were no more there.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, to be sure; he lived with me six months; he entered into my service, by an almanack which I have here, on the 4th of April, 1786, and was discharged the 30th of September, as appears by my memorandum-book; I saw him once since, when he came and begged hard I would give him a character; I think that was the only time I saw him; I went into the water-closet between seven and eight in the morning; it was locked; there were three or four keys to it; the key that lay in the standish had certainly been made use of, and that part of the house had been entered in the night-time, because in the morning, between seven and eight, I found that sash open; there was no shutter or bar, or any thing; I found the floor of the water-closet all wet, and the cistern that conveyed the water into the bason was emptied; on pulling the string, there was no water came; I was satisfied it had been emptied in the night-time, and they let all the water run in till the bason overflowed.</p>
               <p>Where did you find the key of that closet? - I found it laying in the ink-standish, and the door fastened; I found on one side some sheet lead (that was laid across the cistern, and some wire, to protect it from rusting) was all turned up, somebody's hand or foot must have pressed improperly against that lead, and shoved that lead out of its place; there must have been considerable force to change the form of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think it was a little before seven that you was called up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At that time it was perfectly light, and had been so for some time? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe any thing remarkable on any of your tables? - The corner of the library table, which has a deal drawer, I did observe a greasy round circular mark, and it struck me that it had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180052"></xptr>been occasioned by the standing of a dark lanthorn; I had no candlestick in my house that could make so small a mark; the candlestick I used has a large square bottom, that was plated; the buckles I had in my shoes were plated; they were not taken; the most valuable things were taken, and those of little value left; I had written two penny-post letters, and laid two-pence upon them; the pence were taken, and the letters left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Nothing particular had happened to lead your attention to that table the night before? - No; on that table I left my buckles and candlestick, when I went to bed; there was a greasy mark; I had not observed such a mark before.</p>

               <p>Did you go into any other part of the house beside the Doctor's bed-room that night? - No, Sir, only into the kitchen; I did not go into the water-closet.</p>
               <p>In what condition did you leave the kitchen, as to these fastenings, when you went away? - The kitchen door latched, and the door bolted on the inside, in the passage, and the other door locked; I double locked the street door and the outer door; when I came the next morning, I found the door double locked, and the door next to it shut, as I had left them; when I had opened the passage door, I saw the library door open; I shut the parlour door over night; that I found open; the stair-case door, leading to the kitchen, and the back stairs, that I found open; I went into the kitchen first; I found that door wide open; I am sure I left the kitchen door bolted the night before; then I came up into the library, and I saw the door of the press under the book-case, where the Doctor puts his sugar and tea, with the key in it, and the door open; that I was surprised at; at a distance I saw something white, which I took for a shirt, but it was a parcel of papers; I saw the lid of the writing-desk open four or five inches, and the contents all up in heaps; I came to the fire side, and turned round to look at the library, and a drawer of a card-table was taken out; I believe there was no lock to it; the papers were some thrown out on the table, and some in; then I went and called my maid to light the kitchen fire, and called the Doctor, and went into the water-closet; the Doctor called me, and the window was up, and the floor all wet.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular on the library table? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Any mark of any sort? - No, nobody pointed it out to to me.</p>

               <p>I have no doubt of them; this is the fish-skin case; I am certain of them by twenty marks; this trinket I have had in my possession, thirty-five years next December; I have had frequent occasions of looking into the little box where it was; it belonged to a lady that died many years ago; I am thoroughly sure, if it is a thing that is capable of being ascertained; mine was cracked exactly in the same manner; and that bit of wire by which it is suspended, is remarkably slight; I lost such a padlock key as this, that night; I have not seen it tried by the padlock in the cellar, but I had two padlock keys, one was left and the other was lost; I lost such a key as that; I cannot swear to it; the keys do not exactly agree; I suppose both the keys open the same padlock; there was a shirt produced to me at Bow-street; it was compared by other people; I wish to say nothing about the shirt, it will be proved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say you have no doubt about this etwee case, Sir? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>It is very old, and very much out of repair, and I suppose will sell for very little indeed? - I am very unequal to say what it is worth; it cost about 25 s. at first, it is very old and out of order.</p>
               <p>This trinket, you can hardly set any value upon it; is this your house? - As residentiary of Saint Paul's, it is my freehold; I occupy it, and that is enough; I lost things to the value of fifty pounds, and the person who took these took a great many more.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Doctor Douglas; this shirt is his; he had but a very small quantity of linen in town; at this time the mark is picked out; there is an I left.</p>
               <p>Can you trace what the other mark had been? - The round mark of the blue appears to be the shape of a D.</p>
               <p>Is there any number there? - Here is, but it is picked so, it is not perfect; I cannot positively trace it out.</p>
               <p>In what colour had it been originally marked? - With blue Coventry thread; that was the manner in which the Doctor's linen was marked in progressive numbers; the number 5 was lost that night, and I believe the others were old shirts; I cannot be positive whether this is a 5 or not; this shirt is a plain shirt, very much like the Doctor's shirts in the collar, the wristbands, and the make of the shirts wholly; it is not my own making; I really think it is one of his shirts; the I is marked with blue Coventry thread, and the mark that remains is the mark of blue.</p>
               <p>(The shirt handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Jury. We can see No. 5; it is very plain; I. D. No. 5.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mrs. Hatch. Have you any doubt but that is one of the Doctor's shirts? - Not the least; I have seen the other articles many times in the Doctor's places; I know he had such things; the Doctor kept his tea and sugar in a press, at the bottom of the book case; I know the prisoner lived in the Doctor's service some months in that house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Cooper. Was you present when Mr. Jealous tried the key of the padlock to the cellar door? - Yes, I saw him try it twice.</p>
               <p>Did the key open the padlock? - It did, as if it had been bought for it.</p>
               <p>Have you occasionally had the Doctor's linen pass through your hands? - Yes, when the servants are out of town, I have washed the shirts.</p>
               <p>Look at that shirt; do you believe from the appearance of that shirt that it is one of Doctor Douglas's? - I have no doubt of it.</p>

            . I am Arch-deacon of Bucks; I live the next door but one to Doctor Douglas, in the Bishop of London's residentiary-house; I visit him frequently; he went from my house that night; he pulled out his watch and said, it was twenty-three minutes past eleven; this egg I took from Mrs. Humphries, about nine or ten at night; as soon as I took it from my pocket, the doctor was sitting at some distance; it was candle light; says he, that is mine, it belonged to my first wife; he said it was cracked, and the thinness of the wire; before it was put into his hands, he was at a greater distance from me than I am from you; calling at the pawnbrokers, he said, he believed he had this and the toothpick case; I desired him to bring it to my house; he did, upon producing it, the Doctor said, that is mine, for on taking hold of it at top you take off all at once; and there was a little bit of ivory lost, and that there was a silver top, but the pencil had been lost for some time; about nine in the morning after the robbery, the Doctor pointed out to me the grease on the table; I went and examined it, and in my judgement, it had entirely the appearance of a dark lanthorn set down there; that was my conclusion.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not mean that there was any real grease upon it? - It was not grease that you might have taken up with your finger, but there was so much that you might have scratched it up with your nail; the Doctor first pointed out the water-closet to me; there is a cistern on the outside; it supplies two water closets; there are two closets; the one draws up and the other slides half-way back; there appeared no view of any person entering forcibly; but the only place I could discover after examination, that must have been the place of entering as it suggested itself; just beyond the edge of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180055"></xptr>the cistern, seemed either two hands or two feet marks, such as your foot or hand would make an impression when there had been a little rain; they were recent marks so evident, that I went into Doctor

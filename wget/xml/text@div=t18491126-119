                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of the Kent-road. On 15th Oct., about twelve o'clock in the day, the prisoner came with another man to my shop—they did not come in—the prisoner opened the shop-door, and said, "Will you come out, and tell me the price of these things in the window?"—the other man stood just outside the door—I went out, and the prisoner pointed out some gold shirt-studs, which were right at the bottom of the window, and the price of which was marked on them; anybody could see it—I remained with him outside the window about a minute and a half—he did not buy anything—he said he would bring his wife in the evening, and select—I then went into the shop, and he followed me in immediately after—he only remained two or three seconds; he wished me to give him a card—I did not miss the watches while he was in the shop; they were on a little work-bench, right round the counter—they could not possibly be reached by a person standing in front of the counter: only by going round it—the value <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the three I missed was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen them safe about a minute or two before the prisoner called me out; I had just put them there—I did not leave anybody in the shop when I went out to the prisoner—it was impossible that any one could have entered the shop when I went out to the prisoner—when I came out to him the other man stood in my way—he pretended to make way for me to come out, and turned, as I thought, up the road, instead of which he must have turned round me, and into the shop—I did not see</p>

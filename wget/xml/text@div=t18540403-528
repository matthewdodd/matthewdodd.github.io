                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Edmonton and at Enfield. The pri<lb></lb>soner was a carter in my service—there was a corn bin in one stable and a chaff bin in another—on 7th March I looked in the corn bin, and found corn which had no business there—the horses ought to have had it—on 8th March I looked in the bin again, and found a similar quantity left, which</p>

               <p>the horses ought to have had likewise—I went to the police inspector, and was supplied with some pieces of parchment, which I put into the corn bin—the prisoner had to go near London the next day with a load of hay, in a wagon with three horses—he went, and took a nose-bag containing a bushel of corn and chaff for each horse on the journey—that was perfectly sufficient for that short journey—it was eight miles, at most—the inspector afterwards showed me a sack of mine, containing corn and chaff similar to mine, which had pieces of parchment in it such as I had put in the night before—I did not authorize the prisoner to take this other sack.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-serjeant</hi>, 32). On the morning of 8th March, I stopped the prisoner on the high road to Edmonton, about a mile and a half from Mr. Lacey's farm, with a wagon loaded with hay and drawn by three horses—I asked him if he had anything in the wagon except the hay—he said "No;" afterwards he corrected himself; and said he had some corn and chaff in a sack, which was given to him by his young master—a constable named Lawrence was with me—we searched the wagon and found this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the bottom of the wagon, covered over with several trusses of hay, which we had to remove before we found it—there were three nose-bags buckled in front of the wagon, which were filled with corn and chaff, and he had besides a bundle of corn and chaff above the nose-bags.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I was with my father when he put the parchment into the bin—I did not give permission to the prisoner to take this sack of corn and chaff on the morning of 8th March—I sent for Serjeant Har<lb></lb>risson that morning.</p>

               <p>and chaff—I had measured them out for the prisoner the night before, for the three nose-bags—I measured out nine and a half pecks to last him till the next night—that was kept in a bin, and he had kept some back in the bin—I looked into the bin on the Monday, and it was empty—I looked again on the Tuesday, and there were five pecks and a half—the prisoner's duty was to give the horses the nine pecks and a half every day, during the day—what I measured out was added to what was in the bin; I had filled three more bags from it, and then the bin was nearly empty—if he had remained out all day, the horses would have been entitled to have that, but part of it ought to have been given to them the day before—it was not mixed when I measured it; the corn was in one bin and the chaff in the other—there were nine and a half pecks of corn—the prisoner was not by when I looked into the wagon and saw the sack.</p>

I am a butcher, of 50, Barnet Street, Bethnal Green—about 6 o'clock, a.m. or a little later, on 11th May, something aroused my attention—I went down into my shop and saw the prisoner standing there, with a bag of my meat at his side, and this chopper, knife, and saw, which are mine—I said nothing; we stood looking at one another—I sent for a constable—I found one of the shutters forced on one side, which was all right the night before—there was enough space for a man to get through—I went to bed about 12.30—I identify this halfpenny and threepenny—<hi rend="italic">bit</hi> which were found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>

I live at 21, Barnett Street—on 11th May, between 5.30 and 6 o'clock, a. m., I was awoke—I pulled the blind on one side to look at my flowers, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of the street, and another man at the shutters, who put his arm round and took the shutter right down—he then went in head first, and came out, opened the door, put the shutter up and called the prisoner in—the prisoner went in and I put my things on, went down the street and called two butchers—I then came back and followed the man not in custody, who walked out of the shop with a bag on his back—I told a man to keep the prisoner in the shop while I followed the other—I did not stop him because I was afraid to tackle him by myself.</p>

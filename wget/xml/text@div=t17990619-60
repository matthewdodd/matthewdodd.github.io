             sworn. - I am the Custom-house locker of Messrs. Keymer, and Co. The prisoner was working there in the coopering way; I saw him coming down stairs out of the warehouse; he said he was going out, and by that means I touched his hat, and thought there was something in it; he said he had some coffee in it; I desired him to put it out, which he did, and there were four pounds six ounces of raw coffee; after that, I kept hold of his collar till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He admitted he had the coffee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober? - A. I cannot say; but when he was before the Lord-Mayor I rather thought he was in liquor; he was remanded; I think it was two hours before we took him to the Lord-Mayor.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

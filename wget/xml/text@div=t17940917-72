               <p>Q. Is the sugar house adjoining to your dwelling house, or part of your dwelling house? - There is a kind of a shed that goes from the dwelling house to the sugar house, it is all one building. He went over goods that were standing up at the window, and he fastened the window up, which the window lists up, and as such I went up to another building that leads to the first floor in the sugar house, when we happened to meet each other in the first-floor, he having gone up one stair case, and I the other, the prisoner at the bar is the person, I had one of my men along with me, there is a slap to the first floor, which when I came close to him he shut down the slap, so that I could not follow him quick enough to hold him, and as such he went over the goods again the same way as he came in through the window, and I followed him and got hold of his foot, but was not able to hold him, afterwards he went through the window and shut the window down again, I was not quick enough to take him before he got over the sence, there was a pair of shoes found after this, I did not see the shoes but one of my men did.</p>

How soon did you get the prisoner after this? - I went to the night officer, and he came, and we took the wife on suspicion, we took the prisoner the next day about ten o'clock, we got him in Tower-ditch, when he saw me he jumped down the Tower-whars, into the Towerditch, as such he was apprehended and taken to Whitechapel court.</p>

               <p>Q. Could a man without breaking a pane of glass get into this window which was fastened? - The buttons were quite loose, and shaking of the sash they turn round and so the window was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you apprehend the window was opened? - By shaking the windows and forcing it some how or other, which the buttons will fly open, turn round.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any violence done to the window? - Not to my knowledge, there were panes broke, but I cannot pretend to say that he broke them.</p>

This was on the 1st of September, between the hours of one and two in the morning, between Monday and Tuesday. I live in the same dwelling with the prisoner. I gave her the shoes, and I asked her what she wanted with them? She said she wanted them for a minute or two, or three or four. I I immediately let her have my shoes. I came down in a few minutes, hearing of a noise, and I heard Mr. Fisher say, that he found the prisoner's shoes, as he believed it was. It might be then about two o'clock. I followed the prisoner's wife, and asked her for my shoes, which she gave me again, and which are the shoes on my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. To Brown. You said you found a pair of shoes; what did you do with the shoes you found? - I gave them to Johnson, the officer; they are here.</p>

            Was it moon-light? - No; I did not see his face, I was not close enough; but I see his back; he had no coat on, but I believe he had a shirt on. I cannot swear that that is the man; I see a man in the sugar-house, I can swear that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Was there light enough in your sugar-house to know a man? - I knew him by his appearance, by his shirt, face, and every appearance; I can take my oath that that is the person.</p>

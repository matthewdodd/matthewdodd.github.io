I will allow you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week"—I did not agree to take anything, and my brother did not that I am aware of—I have known the prisoner between three or four years by speaking to him—he first made love to me eleven weeks ago—I was in service at the time, and he fetched me away to be married; I stayed with Mrs. Mason in the mean time—I did not ask the prisoner whether he had been married till after his goods were at our house, when I said to my sister, "Look here! what a lot of things there are; this man must have been married before; will you inquire for me?"—they made inquiry, and asked at the place he had lodged at, and they said they could not say he was married the way they had lived together, and therefore I asked him myself, and he said he had been living with a woman but he was not married to her—I inquired of Mrs. Furnoe—she said she could not tell whether he was married—Mrs. Furnoe did not tell me that he had been married and his wife had committed adultery, and that they were living apart—she said they could not have been married, because they never lived long together, but lived together a week and then were away a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cellarman. In Aug. there was a disturbance between the prisoner and my sister—I asked the prisoner what all the <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> was about, and said he had begun very soon after marriage, grumbling and finding fault at my sister being out—he said he was not find<lb></lb>ing fault, he was forced to go out on his own business—I went into the room when he came home; he went out and came in again—I went in, and there were tea-leaves in the cups and saucers—I spoke to my sister when she came in, and said it was beginning very soon after marriage—he said what did he care about my sister, he could go, and I took it from that directly that he was a married man, and I went to his lodgings and inquired, and said to him, "Mr. Conway, you are a married man, I think"—he said, "What if I am?"—I said he ought to be ashamed of himself coming into the bosom of a poor but respectable family.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday, the 24th of No.<lb></lb>vember, I was on duty in Harrow-road, near the Windsor Castle public-house—I heard what appeared to be the report of a gun, and afterwards the prisoner's brother, Edwin Williams, came and fetched me to the house, which is about 200 yards from where I was—I met the prisoner outside the house—Edwin said, "Here he is; now take him into custody for shoot<lb></lb>ing at me"—the prisoner was near enough to hear that—I was going to take him to the station—and told the brother be must come with me—the father and mother then came out and said he should not go and prosecute, and pressed him not to go on with it—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the gun—he said he had thrown it into some ditch—I then let him go into the house, as the parties said they would not prosecute, and I went to search for the gun—I found it in a ditch, and now produce it—about a foot of the muzzle was out of the water—I examined it—it had every ap<lb></lb>pearance of having been recently discharged—Edwin told me how it hap<lb></lb>pened after I came up to the prisoner, and before, too, and also at the station-house—he told me in the prisoner's presence outside the door that</p>

               <p>he was going outside the house, making his escape from the bar-parlour from the prisoner, and when he got about a foot from the door, he heard the report of a gun behind him, and his brother had fired at him—I think that was all that was said then—the prisoner was kicking up a noise, and was intoxicated at the time—I did not pay particular attention to what he said outside the house, but he said it was all a jealousy towards him—the place where the bullet had gone, was pointed out to me—it had gone across the parlour into the wainscot—I then took the prisoner to the station, and found twenty-seven bullets in his pockets, some percussion-caps, and gun<lb></lb>flints—the prosecutor stated the whole particulars at the station—I charged the prisoner with being drunk and disorderly—the brother made no charge—my charge of drunkenness and disorderly conduct was taken down, and the brother was a witness to it—he stated in the prisoner's presence what had transpired—the prisoner said it was something of a jealousy existing between him and his brother—that was all the prisoner said to the best of my knowledge—the brother stated before the prisoner at the station pretty well exactly the same as he stated before the Magistrate—I am the only witness here.</p>

               <p>Mr. Davidson. I left work about six o'clock on Saturday; this is my saw; I had used it four months constantly, and can swear to it; I traced it to the prisoner, and he said he had pawned it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went down a gateway to case myself, and a man run away; I felt something touch my hand, and it was the sleeve of a great coat, with four saws in it.</p>

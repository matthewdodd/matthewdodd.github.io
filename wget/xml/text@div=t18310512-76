            . I am apprentice to Mr. Brown. I saw the prisoner come into the shop with two other women - one of them wished to see some caps; I believe it was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120047"></xptr>prisoner's sister - they were all strangers to me; I showed them twelve, at different prices - they did not suit; I went to the window and got six more, which they did not approve of - I went and fetched two others from the window; my back was turned each time - they chose one of the two almost immediately; it came to 2s. 6d. - they purchased lace and handkerchiefs, which came to 6s. 8d. together; as I went to the window the first or second time. I saw the prisoner have a cap in her hand, which was missed when I had done serving them - I counted the caps and found eighteen instead of nineteen; I gave them to the boy Parrott to count, thinking I might make a mistake - he made but eighteen; I called Mr. Brown, and asked him to count them - I examined them, and found the cap missing, was one I had put a pin through the private-mark; there was no pin in any of the others - I then finished serving them; I made out the bill - they did not pay me, for I immediately missed another cap; I went from behind the counter, and said the caps must be found - I requested them to walk into the passage; Mr. Brown opened the door, and they went into the private passage - the prisoner sat on the stairs; they had not been in the passage ten minutes when the servant came up from the kitchen stairs, and I saw her pick up a cap - those stairs go down quite close to where the prisoner sat; the cap was rolled in a ball, as if squeezed up in the hand - I put it into my pocket; it was one of the caps they had not approved of; I had sent for an officer, who searched them, but we did not find the other cap - the two other women stood by the shutters; if they had thrown the cap down I think I must have seen them - they were about three quarters of a yard from the prisoner; she could have thrown it down without my seeing her - she was nearest to the stairs; they were all taken to the Compter and searched, but the prisoner's sister was discharged at the Compter to appear at Guildhall, which she did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where did you stand when they were in the passage? A.Opposite them and nearer the door than them - the prisoner was nearer the stairs than I; I cannot say I had my eyes on them all the time - the cap could not have fallen where it laid if the others had thrown it down; as the servant stooped down, I went to the stairs and saw the cap laying - I went and told Mr. Brown, leaving them in the passage, but the door was locked; I said to the servant "This is the cap I have lost," - I whispered.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARROTT. I am twelve years old. When Church went to the window I saw the prisoner take the cap off the counter - I was standing close by her; I had not time to mention it - I counted the caps, by his desire, on the counter; there were only eighteen - the prisoner went into the passage with the other women; I did not go with them- I saw the prisoner slide the cap off the counter on the floor, and then stoop down to where it dropped, but am not positive that she took it up; I only judge so by the motion of her arms - I went for an officer, and they were all three taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where were you standing? A. Against the passage door - the counter was between me and them; there is a counter on each side the shop - they were at the counter nearest the passage; I cannot say which cap I saw in her hand, whether it was the one she bought.</p>


               <p>LUCINDA PLACE. I was in the prosecutor's service. -While the prisoner and two others were in the passage I came up from the kitchen, and went into the parlour with the tea things; I saw something on the second stair - I took it up; it was a cap - Church took it out of my hand; the prisoner stood nearer to the stairs than the other women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What did you say to Church when you picked it up? A. I said, "This is not mine" - he said, "That is the cap I lost;" I do not know that he spoke low - I should think every one in the passage must have heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he address himself to you or the prisoners? A. To me.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PARROTT. I am an officer. I took charge of the prisoner and the others - one was allowed to go and appear next day: the other woman was her mother - the cap was delivered to me; there was nothing pinned to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was one pin? A. I did not notice any.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHURCH. This is the cap - here is the paper pinned on it now, in the same state as when shown to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an unexceptionable character.</p>

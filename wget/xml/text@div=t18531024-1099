                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live at Parson's-green, Fulham. I recollect the month of Nov., 1852—I knew the prisoner about six weeks before—he called at my house on the 21st Nov., at 10 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing; it was Sunday—he remained with me until 4 o'clock in the afternoon—he had luncheon, and dined with me—there were two guns in the room where we were sitting; he had them both in his hand, and said how well he could shoot with them if he bad them—he also saw two coats; one was an over coat, and the other an under coat—I lent him the over coat because it rained, but he returned it in about half an hour—I did not lend him the other—we left the house at 4 o'clock, and went to the Duke's Head, half a mile off—the housekeeper, Elizabeth M'Donald, was left in the house; she has left my service, and I do not know where she is—I stayed at the public house until half past 10 o'clock—the prisoner and myself were drinking porter until 8 o'clock—he asked me to pay for a pot of beer for him, and I said that I would—we drank that, and he said, "Pay for another, that will make 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I will pay you on Saturday night"—the second pot was standing on the table when the housekeeper came in—that was at 8 o'clock—he desired her to take a drink of porter, which she did—he then said, "I shall go out for a little while; I shall not be long before I am back"—he went out, and the housekeeper remained along with me till half past 10 o'clock—I expected him back—at half past 10 o'clock I went home; I found the outside door locked; the sash of the bedroom was broken, and the glass out—the bedroom was on the ground floor, and any one could have got in from the street—I missed the guns the same night, and the coats on the Tuesday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sands-end, Fulham, and am a carman. I was in the Rose public house, on a Sunday in Nov. 1852, and saw the prisoner come in there about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening, with two coats and two guns—he asked me to buy the two old coats, saying they were of no use to him, and I bought them for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the policeman came and asked me for them, I think at the latter end of the week, and I gave them to him—I am sure these are the coats, I saw the two guns; the prisoner had them in his possession.</p>

               <p>- COLTSEN. I am a watchman. On the 27th of September, about ten o'clock at night, I espyed a horse and cart at the Queen's Head, Clerkenwell Close, there was no one with the cart, and just before the clock struck eleven it turned round and came up Clerkenwell Close, there were two men with it, one in the cart and the other running after it, I was in my box, I saw the cart come by my box up towards the field, the cart afterwards turned round and went back to the Three Queen's, then it was half past eleven, when I came back to my box at a quarter to twelve, it was standing there then, when I went back at twelve, the cart was gone. I saw no more of the cart till a quarter before one, I heard the rattle spring and a voice halloa out stop thief, the same cart and horse came down the close and went to the Three Queens again. I went to the watch-house to get somebody to come along with me, the officer of the night and I went up to the Three Queens, the cart was not there then. In about a quarter of an hour the cart came again to the Three Queens, there were two men with it, the prisoner was in the cart driving it, they got out of the cart at the Three Queens, and went into the house, there was nothing in the cart. Me and the night officer looked all over the cart, there was neither name nor number to the cart, a short man came out of the Three Queens, I asked him if the horse and cart belonged to him. The prisoner made to the cart as if he was going to get in, I asked him if the horse and cart belonged to him, he said the horse belonged to him, I asked him if it was his property, he said, what was that to me, I told him I would take his horse and cart to the green-yard, and him to the watch-house if he did not give me his address, he said it was a neighbour's, he did know his name, I then took him to the watch-house, I left the man that was in the cart along with a watchman. The man took to his heels, the watchman took the cart and horse to the green-yard.</p>

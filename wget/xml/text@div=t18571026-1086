On 13th Oct., I went to the back of Albert Street, about half past 1 o'clock, in the morning, and found the two prisoners concealed in a washhouse, in Arlington Street, which abuts on Albert Street—I knew there was some one there, and I got some constables and placed them at the places where I thought any one could escape, and three or four went with me to search at the back; we went to No. 19, to search for them, and found the two prisoners concealed in the washhouse, lying down beside the copper—they were not lying down when we went to the door—they did so when we forced the door—we traced their foot marks there—I took them into custody—they resisted—when I took them to the station house, these two coats were on a rail, and on searching both pri<lb></lb>soners, I made them pull their coats off, and threw them on the rail by the side of the other two that were left there, and I gave Allen one of the other coats to put on—he said, "It is not mine"—Smith said, "It is mine"—I said "He owned that coat, you see," and then he noticed it, and said, "No, it is not my coat," and pulled it off again—he heard what I said—there was a necktie taken from Allen, which was on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the coat that Smith put on.</p>

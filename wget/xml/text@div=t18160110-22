I was at home on the evening of the 25th of December, between six and seven o'clock, I heard the fall of a shutter; in consequence of this, I went down, and took a light; I went towards the window of Mrs. Sumson's room, and saw there was one of the pieces of glass broken out; it was a back window on a ground floor; the shutter was quite down upon the ground. I told my brother-in-law to give me the candle, and I undid the window, and I jumped in; when I was in the apartment, I looked round, and on the right hand, I saw something looking very dark by the bed side; I made a blow at it with a stick I had in my hand; up jumped the prisoner at the bar, to beg I would not murder him; I held him until I got assistance. He told me that Mary Lebean had brought him in at the front door; that is the daughter of the landlady.

            . I am an officer. I was sent for on the 25th of December, at about eight o'clock; the prisoner at the bar was then in custody; a pane of glass had been taken out of the leaden casement, and by that means, the window had been opened. The prisoner told me that he had been told that the old lady had a goose, and having gone to dine out, he went for the purpose of getting the goose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Lebeau's daughter came to my house, and asked me to go with her. I went out, and then she asked me to come home with her. When I went home with her, she said, "there is a goose in the kitchen, will you get it for us." Then she got a light, and unbuttoned the shutter, and I got in. I was in when they found me there.</p>

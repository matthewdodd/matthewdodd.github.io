The prisoner came and asked for one Ryland, who occupied the second-floor - he went up stairs, and I supposed he went to the second-floor - but I did not see him come down; I went to the adjoining shop, and left my door shut; on the following morning I missed the coat, and saw it again at Victor Benjamin's door, in Monmouth-street.</p>

            . On the 27th of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked me to buy this coat, which he had on; I said,"I will never buy a coat which a person has on;" he then took it off, and said he had tried to pawn it - he asked 7s. for it - I gave him 4s. for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a shopman, named Ryan, who lodged in the prosecutor's house - he said, "There is no work to day, come and have a walk;" I said, "I have no money;" we went to a public-house, (a frequent resort for tailors) where I found another man named Ryan - we had a pot of porter, and my friend having the money, we waited to borrow a trifle from him; he told us to come in the afternoon, and we should have it; I went to his house with Ryan, and saw the lady at the door, who sent us up stairs, but no one was there - we came down again, and Ryan said, "I want to go and see who is there;" he went up, and brought down this coat; he said, "This is his coat, he told me he would leave an article to pawn, if he was not there to lend me the money;" I put the coat on to exchange with the one I had on, that he might have his coat in the morning.</p>

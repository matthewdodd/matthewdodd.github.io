I was sitting in my bar near upon twelve o'clock at night. My house was shut up, I had a little girl with me at the time; my little girl heard something; she said it was at my bed-room door, and then she heard the prisoner's door go. I thought he was putting his candle out as he used to do. One of the lodgers went up and came down, and said my room-door was half-way open; he had taken this key out and unlocked it; the key was brought down to me. I said this is the key of my bar that I had lost. I went up into my room, opened a box, and found a gold broach taken out. I had seen it there in the morning; the gold broach might be worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was this - A. It was in December; I did not exactly notice the day. There were some halfpence and penny-pieces found in his pocket; they had been standing in a tray upon my drawer in my bed room. I had seen the copper in my bedroom as late as half after six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss a gold ring - A. Yes, that was in the same box with the broach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch taken away on this day - A. About six or seven weeks before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the watch ever been found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of this copper money taken from the prisoner - A. Yes, I saw the whole taken from him by Thomas Hill, the constable, at about half after twelve at night; he took charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have a great many lodgers in your house - A. At that time only three.</p>

            . Q. You lodge in Mrs. Payne's house - A. Yes; on Monday, I think, the 10th of December, or early on Tuesday morning, I was getting my supper with Mrs. Payne, in the bar, her daughter said, there your door goes; I went up, I saw a key in the door, and the door half open. I did not go in the room, I locked the door, and took the key down. I dare say the prisoner had been up in his room an hour. Mrs. Payne desired me to go for a constable. Mr. Hill came; two watchmen, the constable, I and Mrs. Payne, went up into the prisoner's room. Mr. Hill tried to awake him; he could not; he searched his pockets, and took out a pocket-book; he did not awake though all these people were in this room; the constable opened the pocket-book, there was some silver, the ring, and the broach in it; then the constable took him in custody; he had halfpence in every pocket to the best of my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for on this business. I went into Cattermole's room; I endeavoured to awake him; I could not exactly awake him. I took out of his pocket a pocket-book; on opening it I saw a broach and ring; Mrs. Payne said they were her property. I examined every other pocket. I found copper to the amount of eleven shillings and nine-pence, penny-pieces, half-pence, and farthings. When he awoke and dressed himself, he said he knew nothing about the things.</p>

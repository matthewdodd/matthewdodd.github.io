On the 5th of October I met the two prisoners at the corner of Golden-lane and Barbican; they asked me for something to drink as it was cold - I asked what they would take, and I took them to a public-house; they had some porter and gin, and I had half a pint of beer - I had had some beer before that, at the time, I had been paid - I had perhaps drank two or three pots in the course of the day, but I was quite sober; after we had had our gin and beer, I went out with the two prisoners as far as Whitecross-street, where they said they wanted something to eat as they were hungry - I said there were no shops open, but I went into the Cat and gave them a biscuit a-piece, and asked them what they would like to drink - they said they should like a drop of wine; I said I could drink a drop, and we had some, which cost me 9d. - we came out, and they said they were cold, and asked me for a shilling to pay for their lodging - I gave them twelve penny pieces each to pay for their lodging, and I went with them to see the lodging paid - when I got there I took off my hat, and put my bag, containing 10s. in copper, into it; Dixon took up the hat and copper and ran off with it, and Brown ran off directly - I staid in the room till a man and a young lad came in; the man said, "You must quit this room, we want to let it to somebody else" - I said, "I shall not till I get my bag and my hat" - he went to put me out; I resisted, and he struck me - I found my hat in the corner of the stairs; I then went out and saw two policeman; I took them to the house; there was no one there - the officers then said they knew where to find them; they took me to another house, where we found the prisoners and the money.</p>

             (police-constable). I received information; I went to the prisoner's room in Davis-court, Chequer-alley; there was no one there; the house they live in is No. 5, but I had before that, heard some person run across the alley to No. 3; I went and knocked at No. 3, the door was opened by the landlady of the house; I saw the prisoners there - one sitting on a chair, and the other on the bed; I said I should take them all three into custody; the prisoner Brown then said, "Don't take Kelly, (which is the name the landlady goes by); I have the money, he agreed to give us half-a-crown a-piece in coppers, to sleep with us both;" she then gave me 7s. 10d. in copper, and Dixon gave me a penny; and there were five penny pieces on the table; they said they had met a gentleman in Barbican who gave them a shilling a-piece in penny pieces.</p>

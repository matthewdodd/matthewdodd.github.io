            . I live in Peter-street, Soho. On the 11th of November, about three o'clock, the prisoner called at my house with the watch and brooch, and asked if I would buy them - he wanted 2 l. 5 s. for them, together; I offered him 2 l. He went away, and returned in about five minutes, saying, he was going out of town, and I should have them for 2 l. I asked him if they were his own? he said they were. I also bought three live fowls of him - he said he would call for the money for the fowls next day, but he did not. On Friday I pledged the watch at Dobree's, for 30 s. On the 13th he came for the money for the fowls, and was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What do you deal in - A. Clothes, and every thing in an honest way. I never bought watches before. He brought the fowls about an hour before he brought the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been in trouble about it - A. I was taken up for it. The pawnbrokers have known me nineteen years. I told the officer the prisoner was coming, and he took him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long ago is it since you was tried for keeping a bad house - A. About a year.</p>

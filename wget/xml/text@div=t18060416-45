            . - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is an inhabitant of the island of Guernsey. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed there under him for some years. - A. For one year.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Mr. Walker. - A. He had the charge of purchasing coals for his Majesty's barracks; I had the charge of going into the North, and making the purchase and sending of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business besides. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About the month of July, 1804, did you receive that letter from the prisoner Rochester. - A. That is the letter, I think it is his hand writing, I dare say it is; at the time I was taken to the Court House, on the last examination, I had Mr. Walker arrested for forty-six pounds, and from the cruelty I have undergone, I have been in irons, and under great agitations of mind, therefore, I beg I may be understood; I have had time to consider, and have considered every thing that I positively know, and if there should be any part of what I now relate should not exactly correspond with what I have related before, I humbly hope it may be attributed to the agitation of my mind at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of a note from Rochester, did you call upon him at his house in Welclose-square. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, when you so called, give you a note for another person. - A. There was a note inclosed to that which I had, and a message was left, begging I would give the inclosed to Mr. Walker, at No. 22, Brookes'-street.</p>
               <p>(The letters read in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the letter so enclosed to No. 22, Brook-street, Fitzroy-square. - A. I did, I delivered it to a lady who came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that lady in company with Mr. Walker. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live with him as his wife. - A. Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that lady in return give you a letter to give to Rochester. - A. She did, I took it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see Rochester. - A. I did not; I think it was the morning following I saw him, I had a cup of tea with him, and then the conversation began; he said that he had a note from Mr. Walker's that a worthy and particular friend of Mr. Walker's was dead, and left a will (he mentioned the name of major Hockings), but unfortunately, there was only one subscribing witness, of the name of Mrs. Browning, and unfortunately for him, he understood Mrs. Browning had left the country, and was gone to America.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this. - A. July, 1804; I am not certain whether it was July, or the forepart of August; in all probability there would be some altercation in the Commons in proving the will, as she had left the country, and notwithstanding she had left the country, he believed it was a good will, but it would be necessary to have one or more witnesses to it; he said it was a good will, it was sufficient with her alone, if she had not left the country; that he, Mr. Rochester, had known me long, he had no objection of subscribing for one witness, if I would join in with him for the other, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was any appointment then made for you to meet any other person. - A. I think he asked me if I would call there the next morning; going by I called, he was more freer, we had some conversation, he said it was a good will, he did not see that I was under any apprehension of danger to keep me from not signing the will, the conversation was that morning merely the same as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any appointment made by you and him, for you to meet any other person - A. He gave me a note, and desired me that I would meet Mr. Walker, either on the following day, or the day after, at twelve o'clock, at the Circus tavern, St. George's Fields, on the time appointed; I went to the Circus tavern, and found Mr. Gadson and Mr. Walker sitting together; Mr. Gadson had formerly been a clerk to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation with Mr. Walker at that time. - A. None publickly, but by writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Walker his hearing well. - A. No, he is very deaf.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time use any thing to assist his hearing. - A. No, he frequently used a trumpet, but I did not see one that day.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you and he converse. - A. He called for a sheet of paper, he wrote upon slips; and I answered the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the pieces of paper with which you held the conversation burnt. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. What room were you in. - A. The coffee room.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed between you and him. - A. What was I afraid of, he assured me it was a good will; he asked me if I had any objection to join with Mr. Rochester in signing the will, he assured me it was a good will.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think that you conversed together. - A. We occasionally read the newspaper, I suppose we sat for an hour; he told me that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160042"></xptr>was going to dine with Mr. Rochester at Wellclose-square; I cannot positively say whether it was the day after, or two days after, at two o'clock, he invited me to call and dine there also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the day appointed called on Rochester. - A. I called about three o'clock, dinner was done, I was ushered into the dining room, Mr. Walker, Mr. Rochester, and his brother, and another whom I did not know, were there, Mr. Rochester gave me a nudge, and I walked up stairs with him into a lodging room, he there put the question to me, he put into my hand a sheet of paper; on the left hand of it was the signature of Hockings, and the signature of Browning; upon looking at it I smiled, and I said to him that it was newly wrote, it was not dry; the whole of it appeared to be newly written, perhaps not half an hour; I asked him whom the signature of Browning was, he said, laughing, he did not know any other than the woman who lived with Mr. Walker; Mr. Rochester says he has offered me 300 l. and he says he will give you five guineas, and 100 l. when it is finished; at the same time I would beg to be understood when Mr. Rochester mentioned that, he said it in a laughing manner; on which I shall relate something on that subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and him return to the company. - A. I believe I went in and took a glass of grog; on the next morning I saw Mr. Rochester, he began talking on the same subject, I asked him what he meant by asking me to sign that paper, being so newly wrote, he said he hoped that I did not go away with the idea that that was the will, it was only a copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the day after meet Dodds. - A. I did, in Clare market; Mr. Dodds being a countryman of mine, we went into a house and had a pot of porter, in drinking the porter I broke open the subject to Mr. Dodds, says he, sir, if you will introduce me to the parties I shall be able at the first sight to know whether it is a good will or not, he had known many instances of good wills, but he had found great difficulty in having them proved in the Commons, when there were not sufficient subscribing witnesses to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Mr. Rochester again. - A. About a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprise him of what you had said to Dodds. - A. I did, he said he would mention it to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see Dodds again. - A. I did not see Dodds till after I had seen both Rochester and Walker together; the only conversation then was, that Rochester had told Mr. Walker of Dodds, and that they should all dine at the Saracen's head at two o'clock, and they should be glad if I would come and dine with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that. - A. Mr. Walker and Mr. Rochester both together, I saw Mr. Dodds and

               <p>Q. When Walker and Rochester made the appointment for you to meet them at the Saracen's head, were you to appoint Dodds and any other person. - A. Dodds was to bring

               <p>Q. What became of the paper upon which you and he conversed. - A. I think Mr. Walker threw them in the fire place, he tore them to pieces on coming away, I think the first and second piece he wrote to me was, I am sorry to find that you run away with a vague idea that what Mr. Rochester had shewed me I should suppose to be the will, it was no more than a copy; with respect to his having 300 l. that was also vague, it was nothing but his own mode of jesting with me, and as to Mrs. Browning, he knew she was a very respectable woman, he verily believed she had quitted the country and was gone to America, as to his living with Mrs. Browning the subscribing witness, was all false, he knew captain Browning her husband many years before, she was a very respectable woman; then Mr. Walker asked me what was my objection, that I would not join in with Rochester, Mr. Rochester got into violence with me because I would not join in with him, I owned him some money, he said I had deserted him, and he would arrest me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay and dine with them. - A. I did not, I went off instantly, I called at a public house before you come to the Saracen's head upon Dodds and

               <p>Q. When Walker shewed it to Dodds, did Dodds do any thing with it. - A. He did, he took it to the window and held it up to the light and examined it, Mr. Walker asked him what he was looking at there, he said to Mr. Walker few people have had more experience in proving wills than I have, I have seen wills to be proved that the water mark on the paper was a year or two after the date of the will, but in that it is very good.</p>
               <p>Court. The water mark corresponded with the date of the will. - A.

               <p>Q. Was any thing said about money. - A. Upon Mr. Dodds being satisfied with the will, Mr. Walker said I have promised Eddington five guineas, and a hundred pound for him to sign it, Mr. Dodds said he had no objection to make the same bargain; Mr. Dodds was to see Mr.

               <p>Q. Then I am right in my conjecture. - A. I do not know but you are, we had once a concern together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160045"></xptr>Q. Was it a profitable concern, so that you were enabled to retire. - A. It was a loosing concern.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it end in a bankruptcy. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A composition. - A. It did not; Mr. Champney and I parted friendly, in consequence of the money that I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no dispute. - A. Mr. Champney was not with me above two months, he was under the necessity of declining.</p>
               <p>Q. So he retired, and you parted very friendly. - A. I know nothing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. He being not able to stand his ground, you made him a compensation, and you parted very friendly. - A. I know nothing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you still continue to carry on that business. - A. Some while I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards, for your profit, or for your health, get any where towards the West of England. - A. Never to the West of England, I have only been ten years from the North; I have been agent sometimes at Portsmouth, Gosport, and Southampton.</p>
               <p>Q. And sometimes at Plymouth. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing was going on smoothly, and every body with whom you was connected were feeling their obligations to you I take it for granted. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We have now got to Portsmouth; in the course of your travels did you happen to be acquainted with a clergyman of the name of Dr. Scott. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was down collecting of tythes about two years ago, by the order of Mr. Pearson, you had no dispute with Dr. Scott, the rector. - A. Certainly there was, I do not know any person that did business with him, but what had a dispute with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen at any part of your time that you ever had any concern with naval stores - A. I have attended the dock yard since, and purchased quantities since.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not deal in naval stores. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to attend the dock to purchase stores; where did you principally employ your capital, in purchasing naval stores. - A. I do not mean that I never bought any particular for any body, I have bought particularly to fit out one or two vessels.</p>
               <p>Q. That was about nine or ten years ago at Portsmouth. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no interruption to that business, I do not know how to call it a business, as you did not deal in it, were there no interruption to that amusement or way of employing your money. - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever occasion to be a witness in a court of justice on the subject of naval stores. - A. No, I was never a witness in a court before to day.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was a witness upon any subject before to day. - A. I cannot charge my memory with it, I do not remember of being one.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I may take it down that you never was a witness upon any trial till to day - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Try; if any person was to ask me how often I had been witness, I certainly could tell; do not you recollect that you ever was at any place in an aukward situation respecting of naval stores. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After this you went to Harwich, did not you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you at Harwich. - A. About two years; I went there under Mr. Davidson to purchase coals for the various barracks on the coasts.</p>
               <p>Q. He was the contractor for government. - A. He was not the contractor, he found the money to purchase the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. He purchased upon commission to furnish the government with coals in the barrack department; you had a good deal to do in that department. - A. None but what I had to do for him and Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever a dispute with either of them. - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak that rather doubtfully. - A. I had some with Mr. Davidson, and look every day to be admitted an evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some disputes with Mr. Walker upon the same subject. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe you expressed yourself what mankind in general would think in a remarkable way, that you would hang Mr. Davidson, and Mr. Walker, and some other gentlemen. - A. I never made use of such an expression.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are positive sure of it. - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Sinquagh. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never made use of any such expression against Mr. Sinquagh. - A. I am certain I would not to any man.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend deliberately, did you ever make use of this expression, That you could hang Mr. Walker, and Mr. Davidson, and the whole barrack corps, but you would swear for them that would pay you best. - A. No, I solemnly protest against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then to be sure that we make no mistake, you assert that you never made use of any expression, that you would do for, or hang Mr. Walker. - A. I might have been exasperated at Mr. Walker's conduct in owing me the money, and he would not pay me; I certainly was exasperated.</p>
               <p>Q. When one arrests a man for a debt, we suppose the law will make him pay it; did you ever make use of such an expression at any time. - A. I never did make use of such an expression on any day, that I would hang Mr. Walker, I never said nothing of the kind to any person, I might in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Q. But nobody but God and your own conscience were acquainted with that; do you mean to have it distinctly understood that to no man or woman you ever expressed yourself in terms of exasperation against Mr. Walker. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Dua. - A. I know a person of that name at Guernsey.</p>
               <p>Q. You never made use of any such expression to him. - A. By no means, I do not think him an object worth my notice.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever write any letter to any of the officers of the barracks board upon the subject of the accusation that you intended to make against him. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160046"></xptr>A. I believe I did, I think it might be to general - , it is a long while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. To be sure you said truly, it is a long while ago, in the course of a long life a man might forget. A. I think I did write a letter or two, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it. - A. I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago. - A. About three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these letters to general - A. On the subject of repeated frauds.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge against general - was, that he had connived at these frauds, and this you communicated to him for the pious purity of teaching him to be upon his guard. - A. So far from that, I published a book of the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hint that he might redeem himself from these charges. - A. No, but he did me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the public loose such a valuable servant as you, when were you dismissed. - A. Yes, I was discharged by Mr. Davidson, I believe it is now better than three years.</p>
               <p>Q. I think the account that you have given us is, that your first acquaintance of the subject of this will of major Hockings was on your meeting Mr. Rochester - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he represented that that will was the genuine will of the major, but he had left it deficient in point of attestation, and then he and you not agreeing to become the subscribing witnesses, you were so good as to mention it to Mr. Dodds. - A. I have told you already that I did mention it to Mr. Dodds.</p>
               <p>Q. You never told any magistrate until you was taken into custody. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And at this time Mr. Walker, against whom you had a demand, refused to pay you that demand. A. Mr. Walker did not refuse to pay me, if I would have given him a letter under my hand that I had spoke falsely against him.</p>
               <p>Q. He would have paid you your civil debt for work done, if you had done that, how much was this debt you demanded against him. - A. Forty-six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a pauper, he is a man passing in the world as having some substance. - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. He knowing that you had been present at the attestation of that will, refused paying you your debt unless you gave a certificate under your hand. A. He did offer to pay me if I would, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Dodds had the hardiness to arrest you. - A. Yes, for twelve pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other refused to pay you forty-six pounds, unless you certified that you had traduced his character; Mr. Rochester is introduced into this indictment, have you never said that he was an innocent man, and if there was any thing wrong in this transaction, that you did not think he knew any thing of it. - A. No, I never saw Mr. Rochester after what had transpired, he went to the Baltic; he shewed me the copy, I am confident it was no more, I saw him in the month of December, even then he declared he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to the Saracen's head and the Circus to meet Mr. Walker, and the manner of your correspondence was on slips of paper, which were burnt, they were put in the fire. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that they were put into the fire, or was a candle called for. - A. They were thrown into the fire place, I do not know whether there was a fire or no, I said so before.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always said so, do you mean to swear that till I pointed out to you of a candle being called for, you had not represented it so. - A. I do not know but I did, I cannot charge my memory at this moment but they were thrown into the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the magistrate did you not represent that they were immediately burnt. - A. If I did, I must have erred in that, because I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems to me that you have told me that you have been speaking merely from memory and not from minutes. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I was right that you speak merely from memory, not from minutes. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you never did make any minutes of these interviews. - A. No more than when I was doing business for Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. I am speaking of memorandums of those interviews respecting major Hockings' will, respecting that you never made any minutes. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you not only have not any minutes, but you never had any minutes of the transaction of the will. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly not; then if you ever said that you ever had any minutes, that is not true. - A. I tell you when I did business for him I did make minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not talking about that, but concerning major Hockings' will. - A. I did not think it was necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I should think Mr. Eddington that there was some other man of your name examined at the police office, did it not then occur to you that you could not speak from memory, but that you had notes at home, which if you were allowed to consult, you might speak more correct. - A. This was some of the minutes that I had at home about the business of Mr. Walker, it lead to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it cannot be possibly true Mr. Eddington that the magistrate adjourned the examination in order that you might go home and consult them, and still less true that on the adjournment examination you brought them, or that you spoke from them. - A. I did not bring any such minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never stated that you had any. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that. - A. Quite positive of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say in the presence of several persons at that meeting, you could not then speak accurately, you had minutes at home, which if you consulted you might, they adjourned their meeting, and on the next examination you said you had consulted them. - A. With humble submission I would beg leave to state that they gave me leave to go home to search my minutes, that they might lead me more into the business, and I searched every paper that I had; I saw Mr. Humphries a few days afterwards,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160047"></xptr>I told him that I had found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never represented that you had consulted these minutes, and could speak more accurately. - A. If I did, I did wrong, from the agitation of my mind at that time, it was impossible that I could recollect every thing that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you first examined. - A. I think it was two or three days after I was first taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us the day you was taken. - A. The 14th or 15th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your memory so constituted that you forget things that happen three or four months ago, and remember things of much later date, do you mean to swear that you did not say at your first examination that you had memorandums at home on the subject of your then examination, that examination was adjourned, and at the next you did not produce the minutes. - A. No, they gave me leave to go home to see if I could find papers that lead to it, but I could not find any.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not bring any. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, sir, I am to understand you that you did not at the second meeting produce any thing that you represented to be your minutes of the transaction that took place. - A. I do not recollect that I did, I have thought of it very serious since I have been in custody, I find I might have said more than I would be this day able to substantiate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you put pen to paper at all about it since your examination, as you were apprehensive that you had said more than you could substantiate. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give it me. - A. I have it not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been making minutes of all this and left it at home. - A. What was the use of my bringing the minutes when I must not take a book in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have some minutes have you. - A. I do not know that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had been making no minutes before you went to the magistrate, perhaps you have been making a book of minutes afterwards. - A. I recollected every thing as well as my memory would aid me, and I might make a little extract.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did make a little extract upon paper, from what your memory told you. - A. Exactly so, it was a serious point to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I should very much like to see these minutes, could you fetch them. - A. No, I do not know whether I have any.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether you have or have not been making little extracts upon paper, a very singular expression, it is such a one that since the world began was never made use of before, did not you say you had been making little extracts on paper. - A. I certainly have, I drew all the extracts as far as my memory would help me, from what happened at the police office, and from what I thought in my conscience I had said and done, and what perhaps I had said wrong at the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. What extent might this little extract make, half a sheet. - A. Five or six sheets or more.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose. - A. Perhaps I wanted to take a counsel's opinion upon it, as all persons had counsel, but I had none, I had an idea of employing a counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this little extract you made for your counsel, I only want to understand this, nothing is more common; then this is not a matter of conjecture or surmise, but you now remember that you wrote this. - A. To the best of my knowledge I had made some notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no objection to my seeing them. - A. I have it not.</p>
               <p>Q. A man seldom burns any thing that he makes with so much care. - A. I do not know that it is burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago. - A. Why sir, what is this to do in it.</p>
               <p>Q. As your memory is so treacherous, I should have liked to have seen it on paper much better, how long ago is it since you made it. - A. Perhaps a fortnight ago, I sent it by my wife to a certain person to take opinion upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you prepared it as a brief to instruct some person who is a counsel for you to day; did you ever in your travels meet with Mr. Crawford. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any dealings with him. - A. Yes, in a colliery.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago. - A. About thirteen or fourteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the money, or did he find all the money that went into the colliery. - A. It so far ended, that it ended in my ruin, else I had no occasion to be here.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing that you know against his character. - A. I have nothing to say against his character.</p>
               <p>Q. You are still in custody. - A. I was till this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are not discharged. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Potter gave an information against you. - A. Potter was wicked enough to swear it, Potter is the last man that I pay any regard to.</p>
               <p>Q. You was taken into custody before you stated any thing to the magistrate, and still remain in custody now. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. The first time that you had conversation with any person respecting the will, you were conversing of a thing that then existed. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And to that there was one signature. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had afterwards the opportunity of seeing this will. - A. Do you mean at Mr. Rochester's.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes. - A. When Mr. Rochester shewed it me, I did not see it above half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time it was an instrument that was executed, and to which there was a signature of a witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say Dodds was to produce a person, supposing the will to be a good one. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the opportunity of viewing the will before Walker appeared. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Walker appeared, was not the will examined, and the object of the examination, according to the account that you have given of it, was to satisfy

Yes, I do remember now Dick Walker called again, he said then, so help me God, I would not have signed the will for a thousand pounds, but I always thought it was a good will, afterwards he seemed to feel himself uneasy on account of Mr. Eddington spreading it abroad that it was a bad one.</p>

               <p>Q. And then the magistrate was so good as to let him go, and the next meeting he had his minutes with him. - A. He had a vast number of papers with him, but what they were I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him make use of any expression respecting Mr. Walker. - A. I did, in the year 1779, at the latter end of October or November; one evening when I was at tea at his house, he told me that he would hang Mr. Walker if he could, and he said that the gentlemen at the barrack office were all rascals, and a few days afterwards he repeated the expressions to me at the North Pier in Guernsey, he d - d and cursed them all as a set of villains and rascals, including Mr. Walker.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he any part in that. - A. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station master at the Barking-road station, on the North Woolwich branch of the Eastern Counties Railway. The prisoner was also in the service of the Company—clerks are employed at the Barking station to issue the tickets and to receive them—a relieving clerk is employed during the season to relieve the different stations, so as to give each station clerk one day's holiday—the prisoner was the relieving clerk—for one day in each week it would be his duty to relieve the regular acting clerk, and perform all the duties that the clerk had to perform—he had acted in that way for about three months—I was the regular station master there—the prisoner relieved me on Thursday, 19th Oct.—I left by 9.43 train that morning—there is a case, called the ticket case, which is fitted up with tubes—those tubes have tickets inserted in them to issue to the different stations—the tickets, being placed in the tube, are taken from the bottom of the tube in rotation—they are cut after they are issued—the tickets are placed in the tubes in certain quantities, and quite perfect, in the state they are issued—previously to giving them to a passenger, it is the duty of the clerk to stamp them with a stamping machine that we have expressly for that purpose with the date of the day, month, and year.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there also a book kept called the train book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is in that book the first number of the tickets in the tube at the time—this "5547" under the head of "Woolwich," would indicate the commencing number of the tickets, and all the other numbers would follow that—on the morning of 19th Oct. I gave him this train sheet—it would be his duty to put the number of the tickets, if there had been any issued, under the column headed, "Closing numbers"—when the last train has gone up, the tickets are then pulled out, and the number taken into the book—there do not appear to have been any tickets issued that day—I fill the tubes when occasion requires—as we sell out our tickets we have a reserve case expressly for those tickets—when the tubes are low we fill them up again from the reserve—I cannot say when I had filled up the tubes last—there was sufficient for some days—on the morning of the 20th the inspector wished me to open the case in his presence—I did so, and the inspector threw out two tickets—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are stamped with the date of the 19th, and are numbered 5547 and 5548—we take the ticket, when we give it to the passenger, out of the bottom of the tube—the passenger then goes on the platform, and when he gets into the train the ticket is taken away from him by the inspector, or one of the porters, before he starts on his journey—the inspector takes charge of them and clips them—after that, they are put in numbers and sent up to the Audit office, and then we have done with them—Squires drew these two tickets from the tube when I opened it—they were the two first first-class tickets that came in rotation—if they had not been taken out, they would have been issued to passengers on the 20th, if notice was not taken of their being stamped—these two were at the bottom of the tube—they had been replaced at the bottom—tickets that have been once issued would not, under any circumstances, have any right to be put back into the tube—it is possible to put them back in at the bottom without emptying the whole tube, by lifting them up—the prisoner would pay over to me the money for the day's takings—he did not pay over to me a couple of sixpences on account of any first-class passengers.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the prisoner came on the 19th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; by the first train out of London, which is about a quarter past 9 o'clock—I issued tickets that morning until he came; I issued tickets to three trains—when he came, these first class tickets were all ready in the tube—I had placed them there; I cannot say when, accord<lb></lb>ing as the tubes required filling—they might have been there for a week or a fortnight, we have not many first class passengers—I think the pri<lb></lb>soner had been there about three months before, acting as station master—he only acts for the day—it is an arrangement made by the company, to give me a day's holiday now and then—I have been relieved once a week, until the last few months—the prisoner had been there the week before this, he had been relieving once a week for about three months—the tickets come from the printing office when we require a supply, with an invoice of the number of tickets that they send, for which we are accountable—it is an invoice of the number of tickets, and also of the numbers on the tickets in rotation—sometimes 500 tickets come at a time, sometimes 1,000, and sometimes 4,000 or 5,000—I suppose the stamping on these two tickets must have been plainer at one time than now, rubbing would obliterate it to a certain extent, it is printer's ink—these tickets are just as they come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270115"></xptr>
               <p>from the printing office—a portion of this train sheet is in my handwriting, the commencing figures, I believe they are in ink (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—these figures in ink are my handwriting, and the writing as well—they represent the different stations that we book to—we call this a train book, it is a daily account of the traffic which we book for each station—this is the paper that was given to the prisoner, on the morning of 19th Oct.—all the ink writing was upon it when I gave it him—it represents the traffic for the day from the time he took possession, which was about half past 9 o'clock till the following morning, the pencil figures show the traffic—these first columns in ink were written by me, they represent the number of our tickets as they stood in the tubes—the column is headed "Commencing numbers," then under the head of "Closing numbers" the pencil figures represent the traffic, which had occurred up to the time I handed over the paper—"1" and "2" here means first and second class, we have no third class—in making out this list, I do not take out the tickets from the tube and count them; I take the number from the ticket at the bottom of the tube; I draw it partly out to enable me to see the number, and then place the number on the paper; 5547 would be the first number—that was the position of the case when the prisoner took it; I had looked at it that morning and made out this, and it was acknowledged by the prisoner as being correct before it was given to him; we both looked over it together, 5547 was acknowledged by him as correct—the tickets are collected from the passengers before they go off; they are clipped after they are taken from the passengers—you first get your ticket, and go through a door on to the platform—a man stands at that door, who ought to clip the tickets—in the ordinary course of things, the passenger would deliver up his ticket clipped to the party collecting it—the man at the door clips, and collects too—the passenger takes his ticket in the office, and as he goes on to the platform he surrenders it again, after he gets into the carriage—I believe it is not always clipped, before he goes into the carriage; I do not know whether it ought to be—sometimes passengers are to the very minute, and are obliged to jump in, and then they are in a great hurry—it is the usual way to clip them at the door—these pencil figures are the pri<lb></lb>soner's—they are done at the close of the day—the last train up is at a quarter to 11 o'clock—about 11 o'clock would be the close of the day—trains were running at that time every half hour—there would be full twenty-four or twenty-five trains—the first train, which we call a local train, leaves Stratford at half past 7 o'clock—tickets are collected from the the trains that arrive as well as from those that leave, if persons get out—passengers coming from Woolwich, and stopping at Barking-road, would have to present their tickets before they could pass through—it is the duty of the station master, or the inspector, or the porters, to collect those tickets—the station master leaves for an hour, to go to dinner—at that time I was living at Stratford—I frequently had my tea sent to me, invariably I may say—when I am absent the inspector gives out the tickets—there is an inspector and one porter at that station at present, besides the station master—there was also a boy, but he has left—he was a porter—it was the prisoner's duty to give me the money that he took on that day—he sent me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day—it was brought into my bedroom by a little girl that I keep—that was the exact amount, according to the number of tickets on this paper as issued that day—some of these pencil memorandums are mine, those that have crosses to them, the adding up—the others are the prisoner's—this leaf is taken out of the train book—none of the closing figures are</p>

               <p>mine—I had issued tickets that morning—I only issued one first-class ticket—this is the original train book (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is copied from the paper that has been produced, "Ticket 5547, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Woolwich," is the ticket that I issued—"5547" means the ticket in the ease—this is a copy from the closing numbers, but not the commencing numbers—this "5547" is the number I took down at the time—I left the case in charge of the prisoner—this book contains the number "5546"—that is not copied from the list—the commencing numbers are not copied, only the closing numbers, because I had issued tickets previously that morning—this sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. represents the amount taken that day, both by the prisoner and myself—I took away the amount of my takings that morning, leaving sufficient for change for the prisoner to work the day—there was sufficient cash left to issue tickets in case parties had wanted change—the amount received is ascertained from the closing numbers of Wednesday—that appears in the commencing numbers of the next morning—there is no other memorandum but this book—I took money before the prisoner came—I did not make a memorandum of those sums—it is taken from the closing numbers of Wed<lb></lb>nesday night—I did not make any pencil memorandum—it is not required—it was optional with the prisoner to do it—he might have put it in ink if he had liked—he must have made some memorandum to show his work; I did not, but I am accountable if there is any deficiency—the prisoner would be accountable if a deficiency was observed—that occasionally occurs—sometimes I have had to account for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or something like that—sometimes the tickets are not in rotation, which causes a deficiency for the time, but they follow afterwards—I cannot give you any idea of the number of tickets issued at that station in the course of the day; it depends entirely upon the time of year, and the traffic—we are very dull now—the Satur<lb></lb>days, Sundays, and Mondays, are, generally speaking, the busiest days—this was on a Thursday—generally speaking, Thursdays and Fridays are very dull days.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the tickets in some way or other, get displaced in the tubes, and do not come out in rotation, then the station clerk would be answerable upon the day that that matter was discovered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when the ticket was afterwards found the matter would be set to rights—according to the prisoner's representations no first class ticket appears to have been issued on that day—he does not account for any money received on account of first class passengers at the Barking-road station for Woolwich; he accounts for eight first class passengers for London, and four for Stratford, but none for Woolwich—the numbers issued enabled me to say what amount of money I had received that morning, and the number of tickets I had issued—when the prisoner came on duty, he took this paper with me, and examined right through, and found it correct—I have no regular hour allowed me for dinner, I go when I think it most convenient—after the tickets are clipped, they are not re-issued at all—they are not always clipped before they are delivered up by the passengers; sometimes they are, either by the porter or the inspector—the parties who collect them deliver them over to them—they are not clipped when they are issued, not till they are returned—sometimes they are returned on the platform, and sometimes not till after the passenger gets into the train—it is the duty of the person receiving them to hand them over to the inspector for clipping—the first class tickets from Barking to Stratford are 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, from London it is 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>the porters and the inspector to take the tickets from the passengers—the station master has to assist in collecting them as well; if he collects them it is his duty to hand them to the inspector directly—sometimes the station master, after issuing the ticket goes on the platform and receives it back from the passenger—that is part of his duty—there is no fixed rule as to whose duty it is to take the ticket from the passenger, but they are all deli<lb></lb>vered up to the inspector, and he clips them—the closing number is the last number in the case, not the last issued—if the prisoner had issued 5547, it would be his duty to enter in the closing column, 5548.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company; the prisoner was also in the Company's service. On 19th Oct. he was the acting station master at the Barking station—I was there in the afternoon of that day, in company with two porters named Battle and Armstrong; I was on the down platform—I and the porters stood at the door as the passengers came out, after they had taken their tickets in the office—for some reason I had I examined the ticket of each passenger as he came out, and made a memorandum at the time of what the numbers of the tickets were, and of the train—I saw two tickets, Nos. 5547 and 5548, by the seven minutes past 3 o'clock train—I have here a correct copy of the memorandum which I took at the time, the original got so dirty that I lost it somewhere, but I can swear this to be correct—I copied it three weeks or a month ago; I copied it from the original one that I lost, because it had got so dirty, and the figures were not plain—I am able to remember the numbers independent of that memorandum—I can swear that the numbers were 5547 and 5548—they were in the hands of two gentle-men when I examined them—I saw those gentlemen get into a first class car<lb></lb>riage; and when they had got in the prisoner collected the tickets of them; I saw him take them—his duty was to hand them to me to cancel after the train was gone—he collected part of the second class tickets as well—he did not hand over any tickets to me to be cancelled—I saw him put the two first class tickets in his pocket; I expect that he put them in his pocket, I saw him put his hand to his pocket—next morning I found those two tickets in the tube, stamped and dated, Oct 19; they had no right whatever to be there—I was on the spot, so that the tickets might have been handed to me at once, I never left the platform.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you stand on the platform, while the train was going off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About the centre—that is about fifteen yards from the office—persons come into the office and get the tickets, and then come on to the platform towards me—I never was instructed to clip the tickets before the passengers go in, I have done it sometimes—it is our duty to cancel after the collection—I have not received direct instruction to clip the tickets of the passengers before they get into the carriages—that has not been the practice at the Barking-road station—I am not aware whether it has been the practice at any other station—if there was a great number of passengers, I sometimes go round and clip their tickets before they get into the carriages, but that is optional on my part; sometimes I do and some<lb></lb>times I do not, but they are always marked, and I can get them after the train has started—I have not been blamed for not doing it—I have since received instructions to mark them as they arrive on the platform—I have not been told I was wrong in not doing it, nothing of the kind—I always do it now, or the porter—it is my duty to see that they are notched, or notch them myself—Battle, one of the porters, collected tickets besides the prisoner on this occasion, and I collected some—when the tickets have been</p>

PALMER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that at Squires' request you opened the tube on 20th Oct.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Squires took the tickets out in my presence—no one could get to that tube—there was a key to it, but no one could get at it till I came—there is a very good lock to the door of the case—the prisoner handed over the key to me in the evening—he had the key up to that time—nobody could get to the tube without the key, with-out breaking it open—the case stands open while the trains are being booked—other persons besides the station master have issued tickets when they have had charge of the case, but not before the numbers have been taken, to know that the case was right—the case would be open more than twenty or thirty times a day; it is open five or ten minutes before every train; it is closed directly after—the tube is contained in a case, which is opened and shut by the person in charge of it.</p>

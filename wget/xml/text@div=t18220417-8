I am an inmate of his house - he was not at Greenford on the night in question, Tuesday the 18th of February; I was there, and went to bed about half-past ten o'clock. I saw all the windows and doors fast, and secure. I was disturbed a little before two o'clock, by the barking of a little dog, and by a noise of knocking of the inner doors, and hearing footsteps in different parts of the house, I got up and went down stairs undressed, with a double barrelled gun; I opened my door as cautiously as I could, and immediately heard footsteps going down stairs, and when I had got down about six steps, a light went across the hall, and I observed two or three figures pass; I fired one of my barrels, and pursued them into the dining-room - there is a window which opens on to the lawn, and as they went through there I pulled the trigger of the other barrel, but it missed fire. I followed them through the window on the lawn, and pulled the trigger again, and it missed fire again - I then saw two men together, and one seperate; two of the men followed the gravel walk, the other went through a clump; I immediately lost sight of him. I drove the two towards a quickset hedge, which they dashed through, it was six feet high on the inner side, and eight on the other. I heard some one going over the pailing, and as I returned to the house, I stumbled over a pair of shoes and a hat, which I took up, and carried to my bed-room - I then got a light, dressed myself, and sent the servant to alarm

I was called up, and went with King into the Uxbridge-road, and about a mile from my master's house, I took Naylor, he was walking on the foot-path, in company with Adams, whom King secured; the constable searched Naylor in my presence, and found three silver forks and two cruet tops on him. I did not see Adams searched; I saw him strike the constable.</p>

            . I am carter to Mr. Condell. Mr. Platt called me up, I did not go in pursuit. On the morning after the robbery, I searched all round the premises, and traced where they went through the edge, it was broken quite down, and in the same trace down the meadow, nearly two hundred yards from the edge, I found a table cloth spread, and a clock, some silver candlestands, cruet-frames, and between four and five dozen of knives and forks, all covered over with a baize table-cover - I looked round and three or four flint stones laid at the corner, close to the house, and a glass decanter, half full of brandy; and just in the centre of the house, were three or four more flints, a bottle of gin, and the iron bar of the window; it was about twenty yards from the window. I was going to town that morning with a load of hay, and when I came into Kensington, I saw Bowles, (Mr. Epley's carter). I walked with him, and told him of the robbery, and in consequence of what he said, I looked and saw the prisoner Adams in his cart, and noticed some small pips on his hat, as if from a hedge, and his coat was torn on his left shoulder, there was also a green mark on his shoulder; he had neither shoes or stockings on.

            . I live at Greenford. I went with Hughes, and met Adams and Naylor, I believe it to be Adams, but cannot positively swear to his features. Hughes took Naylor, whom I afterwards searched. When I came up, I said,</p>
               <p>"Good morning gentlemen," they said, "Good morning;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Where do you come from," they said,</p>
               <p>"What odds is it to you," I said,</p>
               <p>"A great deal," and by this time, I saw that the man, whom I believe to be Adams, had neither stockings or shoes on - he resisted greatly when I seized him; he thrust his hand into his right hand pocket, I ordered him to take it out, which he did, and I threw him on the path - he begged me not to ill-use him, I said,</p>
               <p>"Then be civil," he said,</p>
               <p>"I will," he resisted again, and put his hand into his left-hand breeches pocket - I felt and found what appeared to me a pistol, I held it fast, he resisted, and we struggled till we got from one side of the road to the other, and then he pulled some weapon from his right hand pocket, and gave me a blow on the head, which caused me to lose my hold of the pistol, and he got away. I staggered but did not fall down - my head had a cut between two and three inches long. I then went to assist Hughes. I observed Adams coat was torn on his left shoulder before I seized him. I searched Naylor at the cage, and found the property mentioned in his pocket. I then went to the Green Man, public-house, Ealing, and saw

I have 3 forks and 2 cruet-tops which I found on Naylor.</p>

             were going towards London, with five hundred bricks, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw four men together on the road, it was the four prisoners; they were going down the road towards Greenford, near the Black Lion, public-house; they were playing with oranges, one of the oranges came against the foot of my horse; I kept it and eat it, and this made me observe them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. In whose employ are you - A. Mr. Hitchcock's. They were on the Bayswater-road. I cannot say whether they were a mile or more from town. I should not particularly have noticed them if the orange had not been thrown at my horse; there was nobody else near - I saw them for four or five minutes. I stopped rather behind my horses - I know them by their features and dress. I told the Magistrate that I knew them most by their dress.</p>
               <p>WILLAM HARRIS. I am carter to Mr. Benson, of Brook Green. On the afternoon of the 18th, I was with Plumridge at Bayswater, and saw four men playing with oranges - Auson is one of them, I am sure; I did not take so much notice of the other three, as they kept on.</p>

            . I am the driver of the Birmingham coach. On the 18th I was between the 4th and 5th mile stone, between eight and nine o'clock, and saw four men together, and two at a distance behind them - two of the four were smoking, they were about two yards from each other; Anson and Ward were smoking. I have not the least doubt of the four prisoners; I was going very slow, as I had a heavy load. I had lights to my coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS. Q. It was a dark night, and you only saw them by your lights - A. I saw them plainly, I met them; I was coming to town, and noticed them particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hesitate about them before the Magistrate - A. I said I would not positively swear to them, but I looked at them, and felt more positive, and had no doubt of them - they had changed their clothes then. I said I would not swear positively, but believed them to be the men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your lamps reflect forward, did they reflect on their countenances - A. Yes. The darker the night is the better my light shews. I looked particularly at them, and cautioned the guard to take care of the hind boot, as we had been repeatedly robbed.</p>

About four o'clock on the morning of this robbery, I met Anson and Ward at the Old Hatts, where I change my horses; they asked their way to London, and said they had come from Twickenham, and lost their way - I told them to go straight on, and went with them, to the Green Man, and got them some hot, and two pipes of tobacco; they went away in Birch's hay cart. I noticed that they had handkerchiefs tied over their mouths, and their hats over their eyes, and they would not walk into the house to warm themselves, but drank the hot at the door.</p>

            . I am an officer. Early on the morning of the 19th Feb. I went down and examined the house. Naylor was delivered into my custody at Hanwell, and at Mr. Condell's house, Mr. Platt gave me a pair of shoes, a hat, a dark lanthorn, a crow bar, and a glove. I examined Naylor's person, and found several scratches on his hands, which appeared recently inflicted, as there was a discharge from them - he would not tell me how they came so. I then asked him how he came by the plated articles found in his pocket? he said he had come from Uxbridge early that morning, and about half a mile of the other side of Hanwell, he came up with a man without shoes, and that man asked him to carry those articles for him, which he did, and shortly after, near a cross road, two men came up, and took them both into custody; that he surrendered, but the other man without shoes knocked down the man who took him, and got off. He was very dirty, his knees were muddy both before and behind. I took him to the office, and soon after Adams was given into my charge; he had no shoes or stockings on, his trowsers were very muddy, and his left-hand trowsers pocket nearly torn off; his coat was torn in the left arm. Upon taking his coat off I found several small holes like shot holes had passed through the tall; the shoes which Mr. Platt delivered me were tried on his feet, they fitted him. I took him to the back of the office where Naylor was confined, and asked Naylor if he knew him, and at the same time told him I should give his answer in evidence; he said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who gave me the plated articles, which were found in my pocket, and the same who struck the person who took him, and made his escape." Adams denied it, and said he did not know him at all, and had never seen him in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170008"></xptr>life. Naylor said he was the man - a pistol was produced before the Magistrate; I found it was loaded with two balls, and primed - I unloaded it. I received Anson and Ward in charge at Mary-le-bone watch-house, and examined their persons; and found their hands scratched in the same way as Naylors, and a little bloody, and their clothes very muddy. I took Adams into their presence; he said he knew neither of them, and they said they had never seen each other in their lives. Ward and Anson said they had been tumbling about, which made them so muddy. I produce Adam's coat, also a dark lanthorn, a crow, and a hat, which was tried on, but fitted neither of them well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Naylor always gave the same account - A. Yes. The place he says he met Adams at, is about a mile from the house. The shoes would have fitted Adams if his stockings were on.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT re-examined. My gun was loaded with small shot. I conceive, from the appearence of the premises, that there were five or six persons - I only saw three, but on the lawn in front, there were foot-marks and flint-stones, and a bottle of spirits, in two different places on the lawn, and the foot-marks were in two or three different places.</p>

Another Witness swore he saw the Boy come down from the Tree, and heard the Gun go off, but did not see the Prisoner fire it, being looking another way. The Prisoner in his Defence said, the deceased being a poor Boy, had most of his Victuals from him, and that he lov'd him very well, and never intended to harm him, but that the Gun went off he knew not how, nor did he know it was charg'd; and the Evidence for the Queen acknowledg'd that he was mightily surpriz'd when he saw the Boy fall, crying out he deserved to be hang'd. He had a Witness also who swore, That he had the Gun into the Field a few Days before, and that he sent it home charg'd by a Boy, but did not tell him it was charg'd, nor could not say the Prisoner knew whether it was or no. It appear'd, That after this Fact was committed, one

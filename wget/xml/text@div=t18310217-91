On the 24th of January I had, I believe, eight or nine persons in my shop; my usual time to shut up is ten o'clock- all the other persons had left at that time, but the prisoner, and a man named Stevens staid - they began to sing and make a noise; I said, "I will thank you to leave, or I shall be obliged to put you out;" I took hold of Stevens and put him out - he kept fighting me all the way, and ripped open my waistcoat; the prisoner then came, and put his arm round me, but I did not feel his hands in my pockets - I believe he and Stevens had come together; they had drank together, and appeared to be friends - I cannot say which of them paid: there were not above two pints of beer had, for which my servant took the money - at the time I put Stevens out I had about 12s. in my breeches pocket, as near as could be - I found my pocket turned out, and the money all gone - some person took up one shilling at the door, at the spot where the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170062"></xptr>had hold of me - I had my money safe about a quarter of an hour before; I had then taken it out, looked at it, and put it into my pocket - all the others had gone out; my servant found 1s. 6d. behind the door, the next morning - the prisoner was taken into custody at the very moment, by the Policeman; I think 5s. 7 1/2d. was 
found on him.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the prisoner his hand in your pockets? A. I did not feel his hand in either of my pockets - there was no disturbance in the house, but with Stevens and the prisoner; Stevens' wife had been there drinking - we had not had a row together, but when they were at the door she put her hand on my shoulder - there had been a row between Stevens and one Taylor half an hour before, and I went to interfere, but I had not put my money into my pocket then; I took it out of the till - I took hold of Stevens in the first row to part them; they had him down, and I took the man off him - there were eight or nine persons in my house at the time of the last squabble, there were from ten to twenty persons about - I knew both Stevens and the prisoner well- they were neighbours; the prisoner was not searched on the spot.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. These parties were in your house, and you found it your duty to turn them out? A. Yes, and after they were gone I felt my money - I held Stevens at a distance; he could not reach me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you knocked down? A. No, I never was knocked down - Stevens' wife, or a woman, put her hand on my shoulder; my waistcoat was torn, and my breeches pocket torn down and turned out.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner and Stevens being there, after the others had gone - my master went to them and said, "Now, gentlemen, I will thank you to go, for my time is up;" they both began to sing - Stevens said, "No, d-n my eyes if I will go;" the prisoner made the same answer - my master said, "Then I will put you out," and he took Stevens and pushed him out, holding him at arms length - the prisoner then came behind him, put his arms round him, and said,"Pray don't, Mr. Flack;" he had his arm round him when the Policeman came up, and my master gave him in charge for the noise first; then he put his hands down, felt his left-hand pocket inside out, and said, "He has picked my pocket, take him in charge;" a person then said,"There is a shilling down," - he picked it up inside the door; and the next morning I found, behind the door 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the principal waiter? A. Yes; it is the sign of William the Fourth - I suppose there might be fifteen persons outside the house; I never saw the prisoner's hand in master's pocket - I suppose master's waistcoat was torn by Stevens' other hand.</p>

            . I was called into this beer-shop to take the prisoner for picking the landlord's pocket - I took him to the watch-house, and found 5s. 6d. and 1 1/2d in his right-hand pocket, which he claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did the landlord say he had lost? A. He told me 11s., 12s., or 13s. - I suppose there were from fifteen to twenty people about - I might have been in another street when there was a row before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Little George-street, Hampstead-road. On the night of the 23rd of August, I was walking along King William-street, and saw the prisoner lift up the dress of my friend, Mary Stewart, with his right hand, and put his left hand into her pocket—she had a shawl on—I said to her, "Your pocket is being picked"—I seized him instantly with his hand in her pocket, and he dropped the money—I said, "You villain, you have picked my friend's pocket"—he said, "I did not, you make a mistake"—I held him, and gave him to a policeman—Mrs. Stewart was walking on my left side—he was close to her, looking over her right shoulder—I am quite sure he dropped the money.</p>

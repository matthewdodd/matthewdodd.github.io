Yes; I communicated to my sister a suspicion of one of these boys, when one of them stopped at my side, under pretence of buckling his shoe; the prisoner at the bar immediately snatched at my bundle, which I had on my arm; I held it tight; he made a second attempt immediately, and got it from me; he ran down Hampshire-hog-yard, with one of the others.</p>

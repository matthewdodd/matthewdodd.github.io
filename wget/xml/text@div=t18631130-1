                  </hi>. I live at Brentford, and am shopman to Mr. Box, a wine and spirit merchant—I have been with him four years, and with his predecessor eleven years—in 1859 I had occasion to invest my savings in a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I had a memorandum of the number in my pocket-book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the note—I received this note alone, and placed it in my pocket-book, and put my pocket-book under lock and key up to the time of going to the prisoner's lodging—at the time I had it I put a memor<lb></lb>andum of the number in one corner—this is the book; the number was 29, 101, but it has been altered to 29, 469—I can decipher several of the original figures—I went to lodge at the prisoner's in April, 1862—after a time I put the pocket-book in my wardrobe—I went to the expense of having a Chubb's lock put on the upper part of the wardrobe; on the folding doors—I left the wardrobe secure—I missed the note on 6th October—I had seen it safe about six weeks or two months before—when I missed the note, the pocket-book was in the same state as I had left it, and I found this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note substituted for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it has an endorsement of the name of "Cole" on it—I believe that name of "Cole" to be the hand-writing of the prisoner—I do not know any person of the name of Cole—I know a person named Coles; he is an acquaintance of mine, and has been for some years past—he was so at the time I lost the note—we were on visiting terms—the last time he visited me was on 26th September—there is an endorsement on this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, "W. Jones, Stains;" that is the prisoner's handwriting—when I missed the note, I examined the wardrobe; the Chubb's lock was still locked—there were two bolts on the left-hand door which kept the doors together—I found that some instrument had been used in order to remove the bolts, top and bottom—there was no other way of getting at the wardrobe—the Chubb's lock would then be useless—after satisfying myself how it was taken, I went in to Mr. Box, my employer—next morning I went to Scotland-yard, and communicated with Mr. William<lb></lb>son, and an officer went with me to the Bank—about March last the prisoner had asked me to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when some alterations were going on at his house—he is a tailor—he said he wanted the amount to invest in</p>

               <p>his business, as he should require a stock—I refused to lend it him—I told him, on other occasions, when I had lent him money, that it was very much against my principle, lending money—he said if I would lend him the amount he would give me 5 per cent, and good security—I had previously lent him small sums; on one occasion I lent him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I never received any interest.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186311300005"></xptr>
               <p>it was about 11 o'clock that I got to the Bank—I had previously been to Scotland-yard—the officer did not go with me to the Bank the first day—after going to the Bank, I went back to Scotland-yard, and communicated with Mr. Williamson—I then went home—I said nothing to the prisoner that night—on the 8th, I went again to the Bank with the officer—I can't say whether or not I then said to the Bank clerk that I knew the hand-writing on the note—Mr. Coles was at my lodging on Saturday, 26th September, about a quarter to 12—he was there for about a quarter of an hour—he came to borrow an umbrella, as it was a stormy, boisterous night—he had not been there during the day—if he or any of my friends called when I was not at home they would not go up stairs; if I am not in my lodgings, I am generally in my business, in the house adjoining—I had no persons to supper the week following the 26th September; I am quite sure of that—it was in March that the prisoner asked me to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had on a previous occasion lent him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and once, 'I think, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he repaid me—it was not the prisoner who recommended me to get the Chubb lock—I have never said so—I am satisfied the handwriting is his; it is exactly like his.</p>

               <p>it in? he said, "A 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a bill or cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the rest in gold"—I asked if he could tell me where he was on 26th September? he con<lb></lb>sidered for a moment, and then said, "Yes, the only place I went to was to Hampton"—I said, "Who did you go to see?" he said, "I went to see a man named Sawyer, a bailiff"—I asked if he saw Sawyer? he said, "No, I saw one of his men who told me that his master was out"—I asked, which way he went to Hampton he said, "I took a ticket from Brent<lb></lb>ford to Waterloo-station, and from Waterloo-station I took a ticket to Hampton"—I asked if that was the proper way to go to Hampton? he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had been to the Bank of England that day? he said, "No, I have not been to the Bank of England for years"—I asked what time he arrived at the Waterloo-station? he said, "Between 11 and 12"—I then asked what time he left the Waterloo-station for Hampton? he said, "Half-past 1"—on the 12th I apprehended the prisoner at his residence—I read the warrant to him, which charged him with stealing this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said, "There is one thing that I omitted to tell you the other day when you were here; in the early part of the summer I put 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into my business."</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the South-western Railway—I attend at the Waterloo-station—on 26th September the-trains from Waterloo to Hampton, were a quarter to 12 and 2 o'clock—a person coming from Brentford would go to the Clapham junction, he would then catch the quarter to 12 down train, that is the most convenient route, it saves expense and time; he might go by omnibus.</p>

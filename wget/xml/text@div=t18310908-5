            . I am a Police-constable. On the 4th of July I saw two persons fighting opposite Milfields-place - the prisoner was one of them; that is about two miles and a half from the prosecutors' - I went up, and parted them; the prisoner was rather drunk - a bundle was given to him by a person, who brought it out of a beer-shop, and he put it on his shoulder - I then suspected all was not right, and took him into custody; I asked him what the bundle contained - he asked what was that to me, and said I could see what he had got; I asked what he was going to do with them - he said he dealt in the trade, and that he bought, sold and exchanged - I said my opinion was that he had stolen them, and asked how he came by them; he used very abusive language, not fit to mention, and in our way to the station-house he offered to treat me with a pot of porter to let him go about his business - as I was taking him from the station-house to Worship-street, Foster passed me in a chaise-cart, and informed me a robbery had been committed at Tottenham: the prisoner then changed countenance very much, and said, "Now I am done!" he said he should like to shoot that bl - y fellow's brains out: he said he hoped I should be as favourable to him as I could, and if I did I should find him an honourable chap.</p>

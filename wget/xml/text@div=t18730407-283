                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 66). About 2.15 on the morning of 1st March I was on duty, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Bracey's Buildings, Blue Anchor Yard; he was leaning on a post, with his arras folded—I said to him "Now my good fellow take and go home, don't stand about here there's a good fellow"—he said "You bleeding <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, if you say anything to me I will knock your bleeding eye out"—I said "Nonsense my good fellow, go home, bed is the beet place"—I was about to leave him and as I passed him he tripped me up from behind, and I fell forward on my hands, and my helmet flew off, and at the same time I felt a blow at the back of my head; I then felt a blow on the ear and on the forehead, and after that I recollect no more; I was left senseless on the ground—there was no one there but the prisoner, that I saw—when I came to myself I sprang my rattle; someone, I can't say who it was, called out from a window and said "It is <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Con</hi> Sullivan," I could not say which—that was after I had recovered myself—constable Cooper came up, and I told him it was Sullivan had done it—I bad never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge—Cooper went to a house that was pointed out; I stayed in the court, and when I saw Cooper again he had the prisoner in custody—I did not notice anything in the prisoner's hand, he put his hands under his coat as I passed him—directly I fell with my hands on the ground, he struck me on the head, behind, and then two blows in succession, as quick as possible, and I could not recollect anything else—I was under the doctor's hands for some time and am now—at the station the prisoner said "I should not have done it to you if you had not spoken to me;" he repeated it over twice.</p>

               <p>Glasshouse Street into Chambers' Square; that is about 100 or 150 yards from Bracey's Buildings—about three or four minutes afterwards I heard a constable's rattle—I went to Bracey's Buildings, and there saw Robins bleeding from a wound at the back of the head and from the mouth and nose—he was leaning against the wall, apparently unconscious; he did not answer me when I spoke to him—he afterwards pointed out a house to me, I saw a woman there and from what I heard from the two I went in search of the prisoner—I did not find him, I came back to Blue Anchor Yard and there saw the prisoner, standing with his back towards me—when he turned round and saw me he ran away; I followed him to 2, Rose Court—I found him there at the top of the staircase—I told him I should take him into custody for assaulting "66"—he said "That be b----d, I am not going along with you"—I took hold of him by the throat, he began to kick and struggle—I told him I should use my truncheon; in getting it out he caught hold of it, and we both fell to the botton of the staircase; another constable came up, and we took him into custody—he was very violent, four constables had to carry him part of the way to the station, face downwards—on the way he asked me to forgive him—I told him I could not forgive him, he must go before the Inspector—he then went quietly the remainder of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on 1st March, Robins was brought to me early in the morning—he was suffering from a starred wound at the back of the head, reaching to the skull, a severe contusion of the temple, and some more contusions about the forehead and cheek, they were very minor—he was in a semi-stunned condition, which was due to concussion of the brain, which developed itself in further symptoms next day—the wounds at the back of the head were of a severe character; they gave rise to a good deal of sloughing, which bared the bone, and it is not entirely healed now; there is an adhesion between the scalp and the skull, which will render him liable for the future of his life to certain exciting causes; I think the injury to his brain he will recover from—the bruises on the face might be caused by a fall, and coming in contact with the ground, or they might be caused by a man's fist, any violent contact with a hard body—the wounds at the back of the head would be caused by contact with some uneven sharpened surface; it is most unlikely that it could have been caused by a fall, there was not contusion enough—it, was a starred clean-cut wound.</p>

I was on duty at the station when the prisoner was brought in—the constable made a similar statement to me that he has made to-day, in the presence and hearing of the prisoner—the prisoner said once or twice "I should not have done it if you had not interfered with me"—I have not the charge-sheet here, I entered it as "Unlawfully assaulting and wounding the constable in the execution of his duty"—I read it over to the prisoner, and he again said "I should not have done it if he had not interfered with me"—Robins' head was bleeding very much at the time, and he was a good deal exhausted—he said, in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, that the prisoner had put out his foot and thrown him down, and then struck him whilst he was on the ground.</p>

On Saturday the 21st of January, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the shop serving a customer; the prisoner came to the window, snatched off a piece of bacon, and ran away with it; I saw it; I ran out and cried stop thief; I saw the prisoner run up the middle of the street, he nearly crossed over the way, turned short back, and went up Moor lane; I pursued him, a gentleman catched hold of him; I lost sight of him during the time I went round the counter; the bacon was found in the middle of the street. When I brought him back he was rather intoxicated; he said it was wrong of us to take him, he was running after our thief.</p>

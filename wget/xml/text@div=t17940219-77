On Friday evening last, about seven o'clock, I was in the house, and I heard the noise of people, I goes to the door, and I saw a man driving the pig along; I said, my friend, what are you going to do with that pig? he told me he found it in Pie Corner, and was taking it to the Green-yard; I told him that was not the way to the Green-yard, and I shall not let you drive it any further. It was my pig, it had this string about its neck; I can swear that it is my pig, there is a mark on it that I know it to be mine, a slit in the ear, I bred her, she is in pig now again, and is in the yard now.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you use to keep her? - In the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that pigs are not to be kept in London? - Upon my word mine is a very large yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she the liberty of the whole yard? - She has.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she may take a walk into Smithfield if she pleases? - She may.</p>
               <p>Q. This was seven o'clock in the evening? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she locked up? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Not was your yard locked? - No. He was driving it down Chick lane, and not to the Green-yard.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>About seven o'clock I went out and heard the pig cry, and I went out thinking it was some of ours; my master keeps some; I ran up to Smithfield, and that man then had the string to the leg of the pig, and Mr. Goodall took it into his hand and took it home; he was going the wrong way to the Green-yard; then Mr. Goodall directly lays hold of him, and sends for an officer and charged him.</p>

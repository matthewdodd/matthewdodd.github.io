               <p>GEORGE KEMP (Police-constable N 82). On Saturday night, the 21st of April, I was in <placeName id="t18320517-160-crimeloc934">Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18320517-160-crimeloc934" type="placeName" value="Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were there any other women about? A. There was one following behind them, on the other side of the way: I had seen the prisoner, but had no conversation with her; I did not tell the Magistrate that I went on a little way, and picked something up; I said I found two sovereigns on the ground, and one was rolling - the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew what he was about, and could walk.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PARKER. I live in Parker-street, Kingsland-road, and am a <rs id="t18320517-160-viclabel935" type="occupation">surveyor</rs>

On the evening of the 21st of April I was in Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road -I had been drinking a little, but was able to walk, and do business; it was between eight and nine o'clock - I saw the prisoner; she followed, and came up to me in York-street; we conversed together for some minutes - the moment she left me I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my money; I saw the Policeman that instant, and whether he spoke to me first or I to him I cannot say - I had had seven sovereigns loose in my right-hand trousers pocket; I had them with my hand in my pocket when she joined me - no other person had been near enough to take it from the time I felt it safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then you think you was very little the worse for liquor? A. Yes; when she met me I had my hand and my money in my pocket - she must have taken it from my pocket; I was aware of it when I had lost it; my hand was not in my pocket all the time -I had counted my sovereigns before she came into my company; I had been at a public-house in the Commercial-road - I was not drunk; I swear no other person had been in my company - I cannot say whether I had buttoned my pocket when I took my hand out; I had made no contract with the prisoner; I first met her in York-street, two streets from Great Cambridge-street, I suppose a quarter of a mile from my house - she had hold of my arm for the purpose of getting my money; I swear I gave her nothing when I took my hand out of my pocket.</p>

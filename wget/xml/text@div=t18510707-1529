I was on duty at the police—station, at Stratford, on Wednesday morning, 11th June, between 8 and 9 o'clock—the prisoner came there in a very flurried state, and said that Stratford Church had been broken into and robbed—I and Benton accompanied him to the Church—it is St. John's Church, Stratford—we got in through the north door—it was not open, it closes by a spring, you can push it open, it was not locked—we went into the vestry—there was a table there with drawers—the place was in a very confused state, the things were lying about the vestry, one drawer was on the ground and another on the table—I ex<lb></lb>amined the drawers and found them cut above the wards of the lock—I asked the prisoner what was gone—he looked about for a short time and then said, two new surplices, an ink-stand, a hat-brush, that poor Mr. Nicholl bought just before he left, and some money, but he did not know how much—I asked him if he was positive it was a new surplice that was stolen—I said, "Might not the dirty ones have been stolen, be certain, because you might lead us astray in making the inquiries"—he said he was positive, for the two dirty ones he took over to his house on the Sunday night—he said the money had been taken from a drawer in the table—he called my attention to a window, where he said they must have got in—I examined it—it was cut—it was about ten feet from the ground on the outside, and about six feet on the inside—it was a lattice—window, with leaden diamond—shaped frames—it wall cut apparently from light to left—I have it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is the frame as I had it cut out—it is exactly in the same state—here is a place where the knife seems to have slipped and caught here—the frame was cut and bent inside in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—I should say the hole was hot large enough for a person to get through—I examined the window—sill, the dust on the outside was very thick and undisturbed—the sill is about five or six inches wide—there were no marks of fingers or feet in the dust—there were three scratches across it, parallel with the sill, which appeared as if they had been done with a bit of glass, or the blade of a knife—they appeared to have been recently done—the window is exactly ten feet from the ground outside—the cutting of the lead was close down upon the sill—it would open imme<lb></lb>diately above the sill—the ground outside was gravel, but from the time it appeared to have been, laying there it was flattened and soft, so that anything placed there would make an impression—there were three or four footmarks three or four feet off, going towards the vestry, from the north door, running parallel with the side of the church, towards the vestry, as if a person had passed by—there were no marks of footsteps pointed towards the window—there were several marks, apparently of trampling, on the top of a seat immediately under the window—there was a quantity of dust on the bench—you could see some faint impressions of footmarks here and there, it appeared to be the middle of the sole where the dirt had been left, as though the dirt had adhered to the foot and some of it had dropped off—the prisoner led me from the window towards the north door, and said that was where the thieves must</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and have been eighteen years in the employment of Mr. Skinner, of Stratford. On Whit-Tuesday evening, 10th June, I was at Jay's beer-house, at Maryland-point, which is about four or five minutes' walk from the Church—the prisoner was there—we left the house together just before 11 o'clock—we went in the direction of his house,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070113"></xptr>
               <p>and passed it—I said to him, "We have passed your house"—he said, "Neve mind; I want to see some one to call me," because he had to get up in the morning to dig a grave—we came up to the policeman Randall; and it was ultimately arranged that he should call him at 4 o'clock—before we parted, I and the prisoner and Randall had a pot of half-and-half together, outside the Angel—I then bid the prisoner good-night, and he went homewards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cousin of the prisoner's wife. She was out of health on Whit-Tuesday—I was staying with her—I recollect the prisoner coming home that evening, about a quarter-past 11 o'clock—he went to bed immediately—I slept in the same room with him and his wife—Mrs. Hatton was very bad in the night with spasms, and I went down-stairs once or twice for her—I did not sleep much—about 4 the prisoner was called by some one at the window—he had not left his room between the time of his going to bed, and 4—when he was called, he got out of bed, went to the win<lb></lb>dow, and said, "All right!" and then went back again and went to bed—he got up about half-past 6—I know this bunch of keys (<hi rend="italic">the keys produced</hi>)—they were kept by the prisoner—there was also a rusty bunch, generally kept at the prisoner's—the boy Wright had them on the Monday, to go to the Church—he took them—they used to hang up in the front-room; he took them from there—I have not seen them since—they hung on the same peg where the keys of the Church were kept—those keys were given to anybody connected with the Church who chose to come and ask for them—there is no closet or cupboard in the attic—the surplices were kept there when they came to Mrs. Hatton's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and undertaker, at West Ham. I have known the prisoner several years—as far as my knowledge goes he has borne the character of an honest man—I have come in contact with him in the way of business many times—I live about half a mile from him—on Wednesday morning, 11th June, he came to me about a grave, and I gave him some directions about it—I noticed nothing extraordinary in his manner at that time—he told me he had been to look after the grave-diggers—that was his duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand you to state upon your oath, that the prisoner bore a good character for honesty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as any dealings I have had with him—I have never heard anything spoken against his honesty, except since this case, nothing that there has been any proof of—I never heard any imputation against him, except the present charge—I have heard that he was behind with his rent, nothing else—I never heard anything about gam<lb></lb>bling—I might have heard perhaps of his gambling, but I do not know that there is any dishonesty in that—I never heard of any charge against him in connection with the former Incumbent—I do not remember that I have heard that he behaved dishonestly to that gentleman—I think since this case has been talked about, I have heard that there were some arrears due to the clergyman—I have no idea what—I suppose in the shape of fees which passed through his hands, but that was merely in the way of talk—I heard no proof.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employment—I recollect this bunch of keys of his belonging to the Church—there was also another, a rusty bunch, kept in his house—I last saw them on Whit Tuesday morning—I got them from the prisoner's house to unlock the closet to take a brush and duster out—when I had done with them I left them on the poor-box, on the free seats—the Church was open for service that day, at 11 o'clock—it was just before a quarter to 11, that I left the keys there—I have not seen them since—it was I who went and told Mr. Trot about the robbery—I found it out in the morning when I went over with the prisoner, about half-past eight—the peo<lb></lb>ple had come at that time to dig the grave—I do not know who had come—I have seen Mr. Plastow there—he comes from West Ham—I first saw the prisoner that morning when he came to knock at his own door about a quar<lb></lb>ter past eight—I went to his house about 8, and when he came he and I went to the Church—as we went towards the Church he showed me the broken window—I went inside the Church with him—we went in at the side-door—I do not know whether that is the north door or not—it was on the same side of the Church as the clergyman stands at the altar—I found at that door a tumbler with a piece of candle in it, and a pair of steps belonging to the Church—they were usually kept under the stone-stairs—the bottom bolt was raised of the door we went in at—it ought to have been fastened—I did not observe anything particular in the prisoner's manner before I saw the broken window—there was nothing different in his manner after we found it out.</p>

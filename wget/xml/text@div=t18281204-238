            . I am a Police-officer of Mary-le-bone. On Saturday, the 22d of November, at a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was standing in Lisson-grove, at the end of Alpha-row, and saw Cox coming towards me - she had got a long grey cloak on; I saw her holding something very heavy under her cloak - I went up and asked what she had got there; she turned back her cloak, I opened a basket which she had got, and in it I found a leg and shoulder of mutton - it did not appear to have been cut by a butcher: I asked how she accounted for having it - she said a man had given it to her up the grove; I asked her if she knew who the man was- she said she never saw him before in her life; this was about a mile and a half, or three quarters from the field at Hampstead, where the sheep were kept. I asked her again if she did not know the man who gave it to her; she said No, she did not - I then asked her how she came there so early; she said she was going to Kilburn to work- I asked if she knew the party's name who she was going to work for; she said she did not - I asked if she had ever been there before - she said No, but a person had recommended her; I then inquired where she was taking the mutton to - she replied "Down this way," (meaning down the grove) I asked where to - she declined saying, and begged she might have her child before she went to prison; I asked where her child was - she said at her father and mother's where she lived: I asked her where it was - she said towards the Edgware-road, and she took me to the Junction-road; I asked her where she lived - she said next door to the baker's; I left her in charge of Wall and others, while I went to inquire, and at last found the child at No. 20. Junction-road, where she lived: I found the room-door locked - I returned back, and asked her for the key of her room-door; she gave it to me and said "I will take you where there is more, if you will go with me;" I went; unlocked the room-door with the key, and the first thing I found was a sheep's heart, a quantity of mutton fat in a dish, and in a handkerchief I found a quantity of mutton tied up, that did not appear to have been cut by a butcher; I also found a quantity of mutton in a brown pan - I left Wall in the house, and returned to Cox; she went with us to No. 2, Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, where Lovell lived - I went into the second-floor front-room; Lovell was there with his wife - he got up and came towards me; I said, "I believe your name is Lovell - he said, "Yes, it is; I know nothing at all of the meat whatever, how it came here" - I then looked round, and on a chest of drawers I found a quantity of mutton that had not been cut by a butcher; there was a loin, breast, and something, it was cut so awkward I could not tell the joints, but there was nearly half a sheep; I found a leg of mutton in a flat rush basket, on the chest of drawers - that did not appear to have been cut by a butcher; he then turned his head towards me and said, in rather a soft voice, "Webster don't make the worst of this," (I suppose he knew me be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040120"></xptr>fore) - he said, "You are not obliged to say you have seen it;" I said, "Yes, I am, as an officer I am bound to say it" - I then said, "Don't say any thing to hurt yourself, for I am bound to report every word you say in evidence;" he said no more - I then found in a chair, under the window, a pair of corded breeches, which were stained with blood; it appeared fresh - I said, "These are bloody, I must take them;" I then looked on the right side of the bed, and found this white navigator's jacket, also smeared with blood about the sleeves - it appeared of the same freshness as that on the breeches; we then tied the meat and clothes up and took them to the office, with Lovell and Cox-Eyres was taken about an hour afterwards, but I was not present; I saw the skin found in the field, and at the office saw the meat tried to the skin - in my judgment it certainly fitted it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was an entire sheep found? A. I think almost the whole of it, but I cannot say, from the way it was cut - the whole sheep was not fitted to the skin, but a joint here and there; it certainly corresponded as I thought; Lovell lives about a mile and three-quarters from the field.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Eyres on the Saturday morning - after Webster and Hewitt were gone, I waited in the front-room secondfloor of the house where Cox lodged in the back-room, and about a quarter-past nine o'clock I saw Eyres go to the door of Cox's room - he tried the door, but could not get in; I had the key in my pocket - I went out, and at the door found a female speaking to Eyres; I said to her, "Is this Cox," (meaning Eyres) - she said, "No, it is not, it is Smith;" Eyres was going away from the house towards Edgware-road; I walked by his side, and saw there was a great deal of wool on his waistcoat, and his shoes were all over fresh clay - I went up to him, and said, "Smith, are you out of work;" he said he was - I then said, "As you have been inquiring after Cox I shall expect you will go back with me to the house;" he said, "I may as well go back and sit with you as any body else" - we went into the front-room; I had some suspicion of him and searched him there, and in his right-hand jacket-pocket I found this knife, all covered with fresh blood, and very greasy, as if it had been cutting fat meat, and in his right-hand waistcoat-pocket I found this cord wet, and covered with wool; there was no blood on it - I then told him I should detain him on suspicion of being concerned with Cox; he made no reply - I did not tell him for what; I waited there about an hour or more, expecting Cox's husband would come in, but he did no:- she is a married woman; I sent to Paddington watch-house for a constable to stop in the room, while I took Eyres to the office - I was present on the Sunday morning, with Webster and another young man, at Hampstead, where the skin was found; I saw the meat applied to the skin and it tallied - there were holes in the skin, which corresponded with the meat.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I saw a skin, which Billen claimed, and saw some meat at the office on the Monday; I saw it applied to the skin - it was not cut as a butcher would cut it; I should think nearly the whole carcass was produced at the office - there were about twenty pieces, but it was not in joints; I saw one piece fitted - the head was taken off at the second joint, and the head left behind in the skin; I applied part of the neck to the head - it corresponded, and other parts, in my judgment, agreed with it; in my opinion, it was the meat that came from that skin; I have been a butcher from a child - my father was one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The necks of sheep are generally about a size? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have fitted hundreds of the same sized sheep? A. That is rather doubtful - it was cut in a particular manner; it appeared to have been killed within a day or two - it could not have been killed four or five days from the appearance of it; it is possible a man might be mistaken, but there are a great many people of the same opinion as myself - there are not many sheep of that size; it is a very large one - I will not swear there are not a thousand; it is possible to be mistaken as to the time it had been killed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you ever see a sheep killed in that way before? A. No.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I saw the sheepskin and the meat at the office on the Saturday; it did not appear to have been cut by a butcher - I saw it applied to the skin; I have been a butcher about three years, and in my judgment the meat fitted the skin; I saw the neck and loin compared - they corresponded with the marks in the skin, and, in my opinion, belonged to the same skin; I never saw a sheep slaughtered in that way before.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Would it have fitted the skin of any sheep slaughtered by a butcher in the regular way? A. NO.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Earl-street, Lisson-grove. The two male prisoners came into my house, with a man named Cox, who has absconded - they were there about two o'clock on the Friday afternoon; I served them with two pots of porter; they staid about half an hour, drank their beer, and said they would pay for it when they got into work, and I was satisfied.</p>

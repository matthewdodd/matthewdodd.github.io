On the 24th of March we had about one hundred and fifty lots on view; persons are allowed to try clothes on. The prisoner was there - I did not see him take this coat down; I saw it on his back, and he was putting his own great coat on over it; he then took off two strings which it hung by, emptied his own coat pocket, and hung it up where the new one had hung - I followed him to the door, and when he got out secured him, and took the coat off him.</p>

            . I was in the auction-room looking at some plate, and saw the prisoner without any coat; he put on a new black one - I told him it was not a good fit; he thanked me, and hung it up; he then took a blue one, and tried on - put his great-coat on over it - emptied the pockets of his own old black coat, and walked out with the new one on; I told the porter of it.</p>

I meant to attend the sale - I asked for a catalogue, but could not get one; as there was one by the door I walked there to look at it, and was not off the step when I was taken. I intended to exchange the coats again - the paper I took out was an order for admission into the hospital.</p>

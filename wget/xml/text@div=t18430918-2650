I have been in the habit of visiting the prisoner's house, in consequence of knowing a person there—I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the prisoner, and left him my watch as security—I got it of him on the 1st of Sept.—he said he was going to Thames-street after a situation—I said, "I will go with you"—when we got there we passed up a lane—we went to the Strand—he took me to a house—there were women there—he left the house, and came into the room while I was sitting in a chair there—I had a half-sovereign and a shilling in my pocket, which I had pawned my watch for in the morning—he stood before me—he pushed his right hand into my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I said, "What do you want?"—he said, "A shilling"—I said, "Stop a minute"—I felt for the shilling, and missed my half-sovereign—I took out the shil<lb></lb>ling, and gave it him—I said, "Give me my half-sovereign"—he said, "I have not got it"—I said, "You have"—we stood parleying for a minute—then he left the room—he came back in five or ten minutes, and I accused him of stealing the half-sovereign—he said I was a liar, for he had nothing of the kind.</p>

E.</p>
               <p>Did you see the piece under her arm before she got out of the shop? - No; as she was going out of the shop, I got over with intent to stop her; I am perfectly sure she took the piece of cloth at that time; I am not perfectly sure how many pieces there were, but there were either four or five; I measured the cloth, it measured seventeen yards and an half; the value is fifteen shillings; it is the property of Mr. Capps.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came into the shop, and was in it about two hours; she asked for some Irish cloth; I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>How happened it that in two hours time she was not served? - We were so busy we could not serve her; she stood near that counter where the things were missing; I shewed her some cloth, she made a great many words before she bought; and I shewed her five or six different pieces of Irish cloth; at last she bought seven yards at fourteen-pence a yard, it came to eight shillings and two-pence, I remember perfectly well; she paid for it in my sight, to my master; I put all off the counter, except two pieces, the one she had the cloth off and another; I went to speak to another customer, and then she was gone out, and the other piece was missing: I know I left two pieces when I went to serve the other customers; I came back in a minute, and one piece was missing; I could not tell the mark then, I knew it afterwards; I told my fellow servant, and some ladies who stood at the counter moved to see if it was dropped down, but we could not find it; then my fellow servant jumped over the counter and went after the prisoner; and I ran out, and saw a piece of cloth taken from under her cloak; it was marked C. E. I can swear to the mark; I had shewn her that piece, with that mark before in the shop, and the piece I cut for her is marked C. M. it makes just two-pence a yard difference; we did not examine her any farther.</p>
               <p>What became of the cloth she bought and paid for? - She took it out with her, and when she was brought back, I saw her lay it on the counter in a paper; I cannot tell the measure of the piece she took, it has been cut; I do not know the value of it.</p>

               <p>I did not know I had any other than what I bought and paid for; I was only one step down at the door, and they laid hold of me, and I told them I did not know I had any more than I bought and paid for.</p>
               <p>Court to Hardy. Which way was she going? - She was turning I believe to the right, that was from the shop.</p>
               <p>Was the cloth loose under her arm? - Yes; I enquired about her neighbourhood, and they gave her an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave her a very good character.</p>

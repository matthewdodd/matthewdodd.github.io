               <p>Was this spot a frequented spot? - Quite so, but nobody came by but a woman, who ran away on hearing me cry out; I met nobody till I got into Mile-end road; it was perfectly light; I saw two of the faces of the men perfectly; he that stopt me, and he that was before me, that pulled my hat over my ears: I had eleven people brought to me from Justice Smith's, when I laid ill in bed, which was from Wednesday to Sunday, and it was with difficulty from the surgeon, that I got out then; I knew none of them; I saw three on the Wednesday at Justice Wilmot's, I perfectly recollected one of them, which is Thrush; I really believe from my soul, that

               <p>Then you are very far from being sure as to him, but you form a belief from the appearance of his person? - Yes; the prisoner Chaffey; was not taken till a few days afterwards; the three I saw at Mr. Wilmot's, were Thrush, and the accomplice, and Merryman; I will not swear to Merryman.</p>
               <p>Was not you a good deal alarmed? - I was not, I could not account for it; I could not see them while they were beating me, it was before, I am perfectly sure; as to Thrush I never saw him before to my knowledge, but he stood directly before me, and I saw him perfectly twice; I had seen the accomplice an hundred times, yet I did not know him; it was Chaffey that stopped me first, and said, give us your money, and we will not hurt you; Chaffey was not taken till a week after the others or more; the others I saw on the Wednesday, so that it was a fortnight after the robbery when I saw him; I am sure of him: I described the people to the Justices men.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this before you went to tell any body? - I did not tell any body; it is amazing to me; I went to a surgeon, and there was a clergyman's servant, that lives in the neighbourhood; and I fancy it must come from his report; for I was so covered with blood, that the surgeon told me on the Sunday, he expected my head was fractured; I had given no information at all then; they did not take the people up from any description of mine; I cannot say how they were taken up, but I perfectly well knew them, when I saw them.</p>

               <p>What business are you? - I deal in yeast and beer a good deal; I did deal in the yeast trade, at the time that the North country business came on; I was going home, I had been in town, as I do every day; I had dined.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100007"></xptr>Did you know him before? - No, Chaffey stopped him and demanded his money, and the man resisted.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to see Chaffey stop him? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him demand his money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what he said? - The man resisted, and Merryman struck at him with his stick, and knocked him down; and when we had taken his money, we all left him; and two took to the right and two to the left; and Merryman and I returned home together, and the other two went somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Do you know which of you it was that put your hands into his pocket? - Chaffey; I offered to put my hand into his pocket, but Chaffey shoved my hand away; it was a darkish night, just at the dusk of the evening.</p>
               <p>Was there any moon light? - No, Sir, there was not.</p>
               <p>How long might you be with the prosecutor? - About the space of eight minutes; nothing else was said to him that I know of, only I bid him stand still, and we would not hurt him.</p>

               <p>Did Merryman knock him down at the place where you first met him, or had he got away from the place? - He had struggled a little way from the place, about a yard.</p>
               <p>What sort of resistance did he make? - He caught hold of Chaffey, and held him; then Merryman struck him with a stick; I do not know where he got that stick, he had it in his hand before; the prosecutor said afterwards that Merryman took the stick out of his hand, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing said about cutlasses and pistols? - No, Sir, nothing at all; I did not hear any thing said by Merryman.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said about covering the face? - No, there was not; but Thrush did cover the man's face with his hat, when he resisted; I told him to stand still and he should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was not moon light? - Yes, I am sure it was not moon light.</p>
               <p>How long had you and the prisoners been out together? - We went out about two o'clock; we had been drinking together at the house where we went from before we set off.</p>
               <p>Were you in liquor, or sober? - Sober; I was not in liquor, nor I did not see that they were.</p>
               <p>Had you any acquaintance with Thrush before that time? - Yes, I knew him about a week; he used to use the house, but he had been away a great while; I had known Merryman to use that house for the space of three weeks; I had known Chaffey a great many years; I worked with him some years back, in the pack-thread spinning way; when I used to work with him, he lived in George-street.</p>

               <p>How came you to go after these men? - My Lord, I had information of Mr. Bevan's robbery; I had not seen Mr. Bevan then; I had seen an officer that belonged to our office, that came from him, and it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100008"></xptr>was from that information we apprehended the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Was there any description given of them? - The description that came afterwards was from people that were in the neighbourhood; but I never received any description from Mr. Bevan.</p>

             to the Justices; I found him in High-street, Mile-end New-town; I do not know the day of the month; I believe it was about a week after the robbery.</p>
               <p>How came you to take him up? - Because I had an information from Mr. Wilmot, that he was wanted for something.</p>
               <p>Was he a man that you knew before? Yes, I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Did you know where to find him? - No, I did not; the next morning he was at my brother's, and my brother was very bad in bed; and I brought him to the Justices; I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>What, did he lodge at your brother's at that time? - No, he did not, but he was there.</p>
               <p>PRISONER THRUSH'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at the George, in George-yard; I went in there by chance to drink a pint of beer as I used, after I had done work; going in I sat down about half an hour, and these three men came in and took me out of the house, and these two prisoners; they took and hand-cuffed us together; I know nothing of the other two prisoners; and Armstrong said, if they did not swear to the robbery that was committed, he would get somebody else that would.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. Is that so? - Upon my oath I never said such a thing to him in my life.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MERRYMAN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into the George to have a pint of beer; in five minutes they took me with the other prisoners, whom I knew nothing of, and Harper took me to his house, and put some pistols on the table, and said, if I did not swear to the robbery, he would get somebody to do so.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CHAFFEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My life is swore away innocent, I know no more of it then the child unborn; the evidence came up to the gate with me; says he, Thomas Chaffey, you had better tell along with me, it will save our lives, and we shall hang the other two; says I, Sam, why should I swear peoples lives away that I know nothing about.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was it a wet night or a fair night? - It was rather hazy, it was not wet, it was perfectly light, because I could see perfectly over the fields, almost as perfectly as I can see now.</p>

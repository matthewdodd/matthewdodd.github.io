Watch! there are thieves in my house!"

             is our gardener; there is a field adjoining the bottom of the garden. On Saturday, the 17th of April, about ten o'clock, Humphries called me; he had Brown went into that field before me - I followed them very soon after, and saw a pepper-box in Humphries' hand; he took it out of the ground in that field, about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards from master's garden wall - there were some other things, but I could not tell what; I was not in the field above a quarter of an hour - I went there again on the Monday morning, and saw two young men there, who I have since seen at Queen-square; the prisoner was one of them I am certain - they were both down on their hands and knees, and appeared to be digging the ground up with a knife, just at the place where the pepper-box and things were found, and the ground was turned up in another place besides: I went within twenty yards of them - the prisoner asked me to let him get a few worms; I told him they might get some; my master rented the field at that time - I left them there, went into Church-lane, stopped there a short time, then turned round, and they had left that spot; I went round into the South-parade, and met them - they turned back, ran, and got over some garden walls; I called Stop thief! to some people who stood in the street - I ran along, but did not go over the walls: I was within twenty yards of the prisoner when he was taken - he said he hoped I was not going to put him into prison for getting a few worms, and said he had a handkerchief full of worms, but had thrown them away; I went with Dawkins, the officer, that day about two o'clock to the gardens where the thieves had gone over, and saw the footmarks of two persons in the gardens of No. 15, 16, 17, and 18; there were some in No. 14, but they were not so plain as the others - I saw Dawkins fit some shoes into the footmarks; they appeared to correspond - I saw the prisoner and the other man taken to the watch house; nothing was found on them but a common knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Such as a man might use to dig for worms? A. It was an eating knife; I did not see them go into the field - it was grass; I could not trace footsteps there - four or five places had been turned up about six yards from where the property was found; I did not examine them - there had been some rain, but I cannot say whether it rained on the following night; there was some little rain on the Monday before we went to examine the footmarks; they went over the fence to where there was no road - the field is private property; persons there would be trespassers - I gave them leave to get worms; I lost sight of the prisoner for a short time.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went with Humphries to the field behind Mr. Antrobus' house; Harris was with us; I saw a part of the field where the grass had been moved - I raked the grass on one side, and found a silver pepper-box and some silver spoons, which I did not count - also a silver butter-slice, a centre-bit gimblet, and a small crow-bar; I delivered them to Humphries, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270050"></xptr>put them into the hole again - I am not certain whether he put the whole back, he put some of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had it been raining that morning? A. I do not recollect; I only found one hole in the field at that time - I saw more places on the Monday following; my business lays on the premises - I think it was the week following.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Prince of Wales, Charles-street, Chelsea. On Friday, the 16th of April, about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and Murless walking up and down Arthur-street, which runs out of the King's-road at the corner of the King's-parade; I watched them there for about a quarter of an hour - I saw them again in Arthur-street about ten o'clock that night, and again at eleven in the King's-parade; I only saw them there once. On the Monday morning I heard somebody cry out Stop thief! I was sweeping the front of our house - I ran, and followed them to the end of Arthur-street; I only saw one of them, that was Murless - I lost sight of him at the corner of Arthur-street(the prisoner had ran down Steward's-grove) - I returned, and on coming into Steward's-grove I saw Murless running again; I did not see Harper till after he was taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live in the same place now? A. Yes; I knew these men by sight and by name - I had seen them three or four years ago, but not since; I should consider myself a trespasser if I went to Mr. Autrobus' field.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 19th of April, after Harper's examination, his shoes were taken off; I took them with Harris to the King's-parade I compared them with the foot-marks at the back of several houses there; I do not know the numbers, but it was four or five gardens - not Dr. Whitsed's, as they had been raked out there; but in the next garden to his there was the exact impression of the shoes which I took off Harper's feet - also in the next garden, and three or four others; the impression was not so perfect as in the garden adjoining the prosecutor's, but there was the exact size to and from; the ground was dry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the ground appear to be newly raked in the prosecutor's garden? A. I cannot tell whether it had been raked since the robbery - I do not know the numbers of the houses; the marks in the gardens next the prosecutor's were more distinct than the rest, with respect to Harper's shoes; I only speak of his shoes - I speak of them from the size, and the patches in the shoe - it is a very particular shoe; there is a patch on one side, and that showed the impression on the ground - the mould would not show the nail marks, the ground was dry; the shoe is an ordinary size - I saw no marks of the patches distinctly except in the next garden; I think it was the right shoe; it had the heel higher on one side than the other, and I think the left shoe had a patch on the upper leather; the mould would fall and fill up the nail marks - it had not fallen into the impressions, they were on a bed in the garden; I suppose it had been raked over at some time or other - the mark was pretty deep, and appeared as if the man had jumped from the wall.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went into Mr. Antrobus' field with the gardener and groom; I first viewed the prosecutor's house, and traced footsteps into this field - I searched the field, and found a muffineer a pepper-box, two salt-spoons, a tea-spoon, a butter-knife, a silver label, two centre-bits, a crow-bar, two screwdrivers, and a gimblet; seeing some fresh mould in the field I got the gardener to rake it up, and found these things in the hole - I put the muffineer into my pocket, and the rest of the things into the hole; I showed the muffineer to the prosecutor, then returned it to the hole, and watched till ten o'clock at night - an alarm was given that somebody had come, but it was so dark I could not see; I took all the things away at half-past ten o'clock, and returned them to the prosecutor - I do not recollect seeing more than one place where the mould was loose.</p>

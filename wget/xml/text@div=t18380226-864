               <p>"Dear Mother—I have instructed Mr. Carter to write to you. I thank you from my heart, for the money you sent me I received at Mr. Carter's just in time to save part of my things; if God spares me I shall be down with you very shortly, as the weather has broke, and will return every farthing with interest. My love to all, and I am glad father is better. Ann tells me my brothers have sent you down a sovereign; I hope they have, they can well afford it. Mr. Carter has been my only friend; he has saved my goods—he has taken a house for me, and all that man can do he has done. Pray, if you can, send up by Sunday a goose, or a brace of birds, as a present for Mr. Carter; you have got hit direction; never mind the expense, I will pay you tenfold shortly; pray do not disappoint him, for he has been so kind, and I cannot pay him at present. God for ever bless you and all my family. Your affectionate daughter, "<hi rend="smallCaps">SARAH HEDGES</hi>"</p>

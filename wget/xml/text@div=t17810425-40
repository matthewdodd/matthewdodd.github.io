I drove my waggon to Bushey; there the waggon stopped; just after that, I found that a truss had been cut open, and several articles were gone out of it, for there was remaining but three pieces of coarse cloth; I had a suspicion of the prisoner, having known something of him before. When I came near Kilburn, I saw the prisoner walking by a hay-cart; I came up to him, and charged him with having taken these goods out of the waggon; at first he denied it; afterwards he said, the goods were in the cart; I then looked in the cart, and found the several articles mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); I then had the prisoner searched, and there was a half-piece of long lawn concealed in his clothes; these goods were brought to town, and carried with the prisoner to the office in Bow-street, where a clerk of Mr.

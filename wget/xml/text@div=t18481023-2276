                  </hi>. I am servant to George Scott, livery-stable keeper, of Cavendish-street, Portland-place. On Sunday, 27th Aug., a little after eight in the evening, the prisoner applied to me for a saddle-horse to go to Barnet, next day—it was to be sent to Neighbour's coffee-house—he gave his name William Nash, and said his office was close by—I went next morning to Mr. Neighbour and asked if he was respectable—I found the real Mr. Nash was perfectly respectable, and took the horse and met the prisoner on the steps waiting for me—I asked him for the money, a guinea; he said he had nothing but notes, but if I would go to his office and ask for his brother Thomas he would pay the money, but he said, "Don't let the clerks know; I don't wish my father to know it"—he told me to go to the Adelaide hotel, London-bridge, and order rump-steaks for his dinner, at seven—I did so—I went to Great Arthur-street, to the firm of Nash and Co., for the guinea—they dis<lb></lb>claimed all knowledge of the prisoner—I did not see him till he was at the station—I found the horse at the Star and Garter, Richmond—it cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for its keep there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am door-porter at the Star and Garter, Richmond. On 28th Aug. the prisoner came there about three in the afternoon—I took a horse of him—he said it was to be fed—he went into the coffee-room, dined, had tea, and then engaged a fly to go to the Old Ship to play at billiards, as there were no amusements at our house—our man took him, came back, bor<lb></lb>rowed a sovereign for him, and took it to him—he was to fetch him at half-past eleven at night—he went, but the prisoner had gone—he bad engaged a bed at our house—the horse was there ten days—Mr. Scott identified it.</p>

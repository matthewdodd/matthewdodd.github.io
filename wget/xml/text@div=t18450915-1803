                  </hi>. I am a saddler's-ironmonger, and live at No. 6, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials. On the 3rd of July last, I left some persons in care of my workshop, which is the front kitchen—I am not aware of the parish—it is close to St. Giles's church—on the morning of the 4th, my boy, Cox, came to me—I went to the workshop as quickly as possible—I noticed that the padlock had been forced off the kitchen door—my young man had left it fastened over night—I kept a good many rabbits in the workshop—I found a valuable buck lying down dashed to pieces, and a fine doe and her young ones torn to pieces—all my work of any value was broken to pieces, and brass terrets, swivels, card plates, knives, leathers, and tools gone—I cannot say their value—there were a great many more than I have any account of, what I have been accumulating for three years—I know the prisoners—I have purchased brass and iron of Butler, very little brass, but iron many times—Sergeant used to come with him, seemingly as a companion—Butler never brought me anything in Sergeant's presence—I have since seen 50lb weight, part of the things I lost, at Mr. Roberts', at Westminster—Sergeant came with a view of looking at my rabbits, and to purchase them—I was not aware they were thieves—I used to breed rabbits—Butler used to bring me pawn tickets, and odds and ends.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Crown-street, Soho. Sergeant came to my shop in the beginning of July to the best of my recollection—he asked me if I would buy a quantity of brass work—he and Butler afterwards came together—Butler gave the name of terrets and other names to the things, but I was not acquainted with them, and told them they were not of any value to me but by the pound—I cannot say whether there was 45lbs. or 55lbs.—they said it was a lot of odds and ends of brass work, clearings up, and asked if I would buy it—I said "It is of no value to me, why not take it to another in the line if you can do better with it?"—they said it was so late in the evening it would be no use—I ultimately bought them—I resold the same things to Emanuel—I sold him the whole I bought, and to the best of my recollection a little more—I have since seen the things they sold me, or things very much like them.</p>

When I went to put my jacket on again I missed my property out of the pocket - I went to the Blue Anchor public-house, and saw the prisoner there - I said "I suppose you know what you have done?" he said"It is all right," and pulled out the pocket-book; I said"If you have taken the money out give me the book;" he would not - the officer then came and took the book, but the money was gone.</p>

The prosecutor came and played in the public-house, and lost two half-pints of gin - he would not pay for one - I said "Why don't you pay for it?" he then struck me, and the landlord turned him out. I afterwards met a young lad who said to me "Do you know the man?" meaning the prosecutor; I said No; and he said he had a pocket-book and 1s. 6d. which belonged to him, and he gave them me, to give to him if I could find him. I met him again, and he took me to the Blue Anchor, and said "You know what you have done?" I said "I don't know what you mean, but I have a pocket-book to give you;" he said "Give it me;" I said "I will, but won't you stand a pot;" and then he sent for the officer.</p>

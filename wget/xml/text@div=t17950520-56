               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a <rs id="t17950520-56-deflabel328" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950520-56-defend672 t17950520-56-deflabel328"></join> at the time? - He was. On Monday the 27th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200164"></xptr>of April, I came home about eight o'clock, which is our usual time of leaving; when I came into the gates I turned my horse about, and this prisoner at the bar came by me; and I said, John, you have got something in your pockets; this was in the yard; and he said, I have got no thing. He goes into the street, I called him back again, and I insisted on his going into the house, to know what he had got in his pockets; when he came into the house, I put my hand into his outer pocket, there was nothing there; when I came to his inner pockets there were the articles that the indictment states. I sent then for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found? - Six pounds weight of tedges, pewter; I have got the patterns belonging to them. They were taken off the work bench. They had been clipped off the bottoms of quart pots in the course of that day. I gave them to the officer. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate You are a pewterer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost a good deal of pewter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any partner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not the refuse what is left in the mould? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your moulds are the same size as other peoples? - I can tell that my moulds are standard measure; but whether they are of the same shape I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. They are cut off after the pot is cast? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in any particular shape after the pot is cast? - These tedges tally with the bottom of what they are cut off from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever go out of you shop? - I certainly do.</p>
               <p>Q.How do you know you have nothing brought into your shop when you are out of it? - I have pewter and things of that kind, but not such tedges as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Them pieces it seems are so extremely peculiar, that when a man is standing at the bar for his liberty, you know that they are cut off your pots? - I know they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us something like a tradesman's reason why you know them; and and not a female woman's reason, that you know them only because you know them? - I could not explain myself further than I know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably your reason is because you found them in the pocket of the man that was going out of the shop? - I found fifteen pounds of them in his pocket one time.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing you had found them at a pewterer's bench in York, should you have been able to swear to them? - I certainly should not.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not know them by the smell, I take it for granted, not the shape. Is not the mixture of metal, which you call pewter, much the same in all pewterers shops? - I cannot give an answer to that question.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you never served your time to a pewterer? - Yes; I have been in business for forty years. We have block in come from Cornwall, and we cannot work it in that state.</p>
               <p>Q.Them articles that you hold there in your bag, are clipped off with shears? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I suppose, the shears of other pewterers are very different from your's? - I don't go to other pewterers shops.</p>
               <p>Q. These things that are cut off, are they sold or melted down again? - Melted down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them pieces of metal before you found them in the man's pocket? - Certainly I did; and three times more than this.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mark them when they are cut off? - I do not; it is not the custom. Our servants are in the shop from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200165"></xptr>morning till night. I see them on the work bench.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you took them out of this man's pocket that you see them? - Three hours before.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how you know they are the same pieces? - Because I missed the quantity, and they were found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man worked with you? - About four months, and prior to that for two years. I looked on him to be an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attend his duty? - Sometimes he did, and sometimes got drunk Prior to this, a fortnight, I had a very great suspicion, or else I should not have stopped him when I did.</p>
               <p>Court. When you took these things, did you go up stairs to see if any were missing? - I did, and I found it missing, by my eye I see there were some gone.</p>
               <p>- HUMPHRIES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these tedges on the prisoner? - Yes. I took them from him. He said if Mr. Perry would forgive him, he was sorry for it, and he would never do so any more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. What did you say to him to induce him to say so? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. To Perry. Do you happen to know this, that this man was in the habit of hanging up his coat any where? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had other men in the shop that afternoon? - There were only him and the apprentice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The day that master took the metal out of my pocket, he happened to be out that day, and he came home on horse back, and he called for a pail of water and brush, to wash his horses legs, and I went to do it, and he told me he had ordered his boy to do it; and I went to turn round to go home, and he took hold of me, and said, what have you got here? and he took these pieces of pewter out of my pocket. I know no more of it than the day I shall die.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

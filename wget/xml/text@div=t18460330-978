                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Bridge-street, Lambeth—on the 6th of Feb., between three and four o'clock in tha morning, I was in a public-house in Westminster, drinking with a female—I saw both the prisoners walking in the Westminster-road—Martin was in my company in the public-house—I came out in her company—I got in company with Leach directly afterwards—I went and gave them a pint of wine—I then went with them to a coffee shop in the Westminster-road, and gave them some breakfast—it</p>

               <p>was then between five and six o'clock in the morning—we sat together in the box—Leach sat next to me, and Martin opposite—I was very much intoxicated, and went to sleep—they roused me up and the landlord asked me to pay for the refreshment—I had a gold lever watch, a gold brequet-chain, a gold neck-chain, about four sovereigns, and some silver—the watch and chain I had for certain when I went into the coffee-shop—I paid for the refreshment and went to sleep again—there was a slide on my guard-chain—the brequet-chain hung loose in my waistcoat-pocket—I was awoke afterwards and asked if I had not been robbed—I looked and found the guard-chain hanging loose round my neck—my watch and brequet-chain were gone—they were worth about fourteen guineas—my guard)-chain had been cut—they had put the ends inside the pocket, but having nothing attached to it it dropped out.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Caledonian coffee-shop in Westminster-bridge-road—I recollect the two prisoners coming there with Mr. Medhurst, about twenty minutes before six o'clock on the morning of the 6th of Feb.—I had opened about a quarter past five o'clock that morning, which is my usual time—they had some refreshments—when I took it to them the prose<lb></lb>cutor was asleep—one of the prisoners roused him, and after some few minutes' hesitation he paid me—I noticed a chain round his neck and a small chain with something hanging to it—I did not notice anything particular about the prisoners at that moment, but shortly afterwards they were whis<lb></lb>pering together some few minutes, and Martin got up and took two papers from the table—each of the prisoners read one—they held them across the table nearly to meet each other so that I almost lost sight of Mr. Medhurst for some minutes—I then missed the chain from his pocket, and sent my boy for a policeman—he could not find one—the prisoners then got up and were going away—they left the prosecutor asleep—I followed them to the door and saw a policeman—there was nobody else there between my seeing the chain safe and finding it gone—there were thirty or forty in the room, but not in the particular box they were in—I awoke the prosecutor, and he missed his watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cumberland-street, Hackney-road, and am luggage book-keeper at the Shoreditch station of the Eastern Counties Railway Com<lb></lb>pany. The prisoners were porters there, in the Company's employ—on the morning of the 2nd of June I left the luggage-office, and went into the pay-office—there is a platform opposite the luggage-office—there was a truck in the dock, before the platform, containing a pipe of wine, which was in the Company's care, to take to Chelmsford—I remained a minute or two in the pay-office, and when I returned I noticed some wine running from the corner of the truck—the truck-door was closed, so as to conceal any one inside—I opened it, and saw Winfield kneeling at the pipe, with a can at his knee, and his thumb over the spile-hole, and Newland leaning over him with his hand on the cask—he must have seen what was going on—the can was three parts full of wine—I told them they had done a pretty thing for themselves—they said nothing—Newland got out, and walked down the yard—I gave Winfleld into custody, and took the wine in the can to the inspector's office.</p>

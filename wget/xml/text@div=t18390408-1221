                  </hi>. On the 24th of March J went to the Burns' Arms,. In Burn-street, between twelve and one o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—I was sober—I had nothing to drink there—I taw it was crowded, and turned out to go home, having been there about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner and another followed me out—there were two more in my com<lb></lb>pany, who went in with me, and came out with me—I had not got above a hundred yards from the Burns' Arms when the prisoner came up to me, <hi rend="italic">shoved.</hi> me against the wall, and began to hustle me about—I got away from him, and walked as fast as I could into Belt-street—he then came be<lb></lb>fore me, got his arm round me, <hi rend="italic">shoved.</hi> his hand into my left-hand trowers, pocket, and tore pocket and all out—I had in that pocket 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I had a scuffle with him till the constable came up—there was another man with him—I made a push to get myself from him, and had a scuffle with him till the man who was by went and called the constable—the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoved away.</hi> from me, but I kept hold of him till the policeman came up—the other man then ran away—my pocket and money were safe when I came out of the public-house—as soon as he was taken, I felt, and my pocket and all was gone—part of the pocket was torn away, and hung out—I did not look on the ground for my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called, and saw the prisoner a few yards from Lynch—the scuffle was over when I came up—there were two more besides the prosecutor and prisoner—the prisoner was standing still when I came up, not attempting to get away at all—the other men were standing still, a little distance from each other—Trussell had called for the police—Lynch gave the prisoner in charge for picking his pocket—the prisoner said, "I know nothing at all about his pocket"—in going along, the other three followed—I kept my eye on the prisoner—he put his hand into his trowsers' pocket and took something out, which he was passing to the other who was behind—I put my hand back, and laid hold of the two hands—both their hands were very close together, but I took the money out of the prisoner's hand, and I said, "You will pass nothing here in my presence"—he said, "It is only a few pence which I owed him, and I was going to pay him"—I searched him at the station-house, and found three-halfpence in his waistcoat pocket—on the Monday morning, as I was conveying him from the station-house to the office, he said he was very hungry—I said, "Do not any of your friends come to see you with any thing to eat?"—he said, "I wish they did, they do not; if they did, I would send them to make it up with Lynch not to come against me."</p>

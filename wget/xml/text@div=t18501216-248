                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Whitford, in Hertford-shire. On 5th Dec. I met with the prisoner in the Cock, at Edmonton, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I went with her to a shed, about a stone's throw from the public-house—I had three sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and sixteen shillings in a purse—the prisoner asked me to give her something, and I gave her a shilling and the price of half a pint of beer—after we got into the shed, I had my money—we laid dots—she put her hand into my pocket and took the purse out of my left-hand smock-frock pocket—I asked her whether she would give me my money—she said she bad not got it—I told her if she liked to deliver it up I would give her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said she had not got it—I gave her in charge, and in going along she said she had laid it under a little bit of straw—besides what was in the purse, I had five shillings loose in my right-hand pocket; that was my own money, I did not lose that—the other money was my master's, James Bennett, junior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You called me out of the public-house; I did not come, and you called me a second time. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, you followed me out—I did not ask you—I gave you a sixpence and a penny—you gave me back the sixpence and I gave you a shilling'—George Cutbush and Philip Bray came into the shed just before the policeman—I did not strike you, nor did any one else—you opened the front of your gown and looked, and said you would swear you had not seen my money—there was no light in the shed—I saw you take my money because it was moonlight—I have not seen my purse and money since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 104). The prisoner was given into my charge by the prosecutor, for stealing his money—he did not say what money—as we were going to the station, the prisoner said she had not got any money—she said she did not take the money, but it fell out of his pocket on her gown, and she placed it under the straw—I know the shed; it is an open one, adjoining the house alongside the road—there was about a couple of handfulls of straw there, but it was very dirty—I searched it about half an hour after taking the prisoner to the station, but found nothing—the prisoner was searched at the station, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on her—when the prosecutor gave her in charge, sergeant Watkins was with him, on horseback.</p>

No, I saw him three weeks after that at Pimlico; I said nothing to him; but went to the Bag of Nails, where he had slept a night or two till Mrs. Evans got the lodging ready: and I told the publican, my husband went and took him at a public-house; he was obliged to take him by the collar, he was unwilling to come.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I asked this lady for a lodging, she said she would get it ready on the Monday following; I had been to get work of Mr. Bramin, and if I could have got work of him, I should have gone to her lodging, but Mr. Clark, whom I was to work for, told me I might sleep with his boy; I never saw the place after the time I went away; I went back to her, and told her I would have come to her lodging but I had this offer; I am as innocent as a child unborn; when the child was examined at the Office, she had not a word to say but what the mother put in her mouth.</p>

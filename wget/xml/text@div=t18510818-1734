                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Argent, and live at Hog-lane, Woolwich. I carry on the business of a dress-maker—I have known the prisoner for years—my mother, who lived with me, had been in the habit of employing her in washing and doing about—on 7th June last, I was a patient in Guy's Hospital—I had employed the prisoner to bring me clean linen backward and forward, and tea and sugar, and what nourishment my mother could send me, and to mind my baby at home—the first week I was there she brought my clean things, and took the dirty ones away; and on Whit—Tuesday she was to bring me them clean, but I never received them—the came once afterwards, on 18th, with some tea and sugar, and I asked why she had not brought my clean things—she said I should have them next week, that they were quite safe in my father's box—one of the patient's sent her oat for some things, and she kept the change and never returued.</p>

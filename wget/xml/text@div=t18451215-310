                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police constable K</hi> 381.) I was on duty at Stratford, and saw the two prisoners with a truck at Mrs. Raynor's door—Fairchild then took some iron off the truck, and took it into the shop—I could not exactly see what iron it was—Powell stood at the side of the truck waiting for Fairchild, I dare say for three or four minutes—I was in plain clothes—I should say Powell saw me the whole time, as I was close by—after Fairchild had been in the shop about three minutes. Powell took two bars off the track, and went into the shop—I saw these bolts and iron put into the scale in fhe shop by Fairchild—I took Fairchild into custody—when Fairchild took the bolts in he was in three minutes, and then Powell took the bars in—he came out and saw me catch hold of Fairchild, and he drove his horses off—I took Powell that evening—I told him I wanted him on suspicion of stealing some iron from the railway—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—he did not say he had been employed by any one to do it.</p>

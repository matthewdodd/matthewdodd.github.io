These goods were brought to our warehouse in London-wall, by our conveyance. I received information and went to the pawnbroker's, where I found two pieces of printed calico. Brand went with me to the prisoner's house in Baltic-street, near Old-street, where I found the male prisoner. Brand told him we were come to search again - We had searched before but found nothing. He said"I will not have it yet." While Brand was searching his wife, he desired to speak to me privately. I went into the passage to him, he said he had taken part of one piece, which was missing; on the 24th, the day on which we had searched before. He begged I would show him mercy. I said I should do no more than I was compelled. We returned to the parlour - I told Brand he had confessed to taking half a piece. Brand asked him when he took it, he said in the morning of the day we searched before; he said he took it from above. Brande asked how he got it, he said by letting down the ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss all the things at the same time. - A. No; at different times. The male prisoner was a watchman, and employed to protect our property inside the warehouse. The prisoner, Eliza, used often to bring his supper.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRAND. I am marshalman of the city of London. On the 12th of August I found the prisoners at home and took them into custody. I found several pawnbroker's duplicates on the woman, and several about the house; the man said he took one piece. The prisoner, Eliza Ellis, came in, I told her her father had acknowledged taking one piece; she said she pledged it after dividing it.</p>

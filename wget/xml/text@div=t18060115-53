On the day of lord Nelson's neral, which was Thursday, I was going through Newport market to Long Acre, I met two women, and one of them had the coat on her back; I recognised the coat in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. Between four and five, near dusk; I thought I knew the coat, and after going some way with her, I spoke to her; she then asked me if I would have the goodness to go home with her, I went, she delivered me the coat; on the day before yesterday the prisoner was taken and lodged in St. Ann's watchhouse.</p>

             sworn. I keep a linen shop in Monmouth-street, I sell second-hand clothes. On the 2d of December the prisoner at the bar came into my shop, and asked me if I would buy a pelisse coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day? - A. Between three and four o'clock; I asked him to let me see it; he took it out of a linen apron which he had before him, I opened the coat and looked at it, I said how came you by this, it is a droll thing for a man to sell; he told me that his wife went out a nursing, and the lady gave it to his wife; I asked him what made him sell it, he said his wife was going out to another lady, she wanted money and bid him sell it; I then asked him his name and place of abode, he told me he lived at No. 16, Stacey-street, and his name was Miller, and said I need not be afraid to buy it; he asked me one pound for it, I told him if I thought he came honestly by it, I would very willingly give him half a guinea for it. The young man that lodges in the house was coming through the shop at the time; I said do you know this man, look at him, he said he did not know him, but he looks like a working man, he says to me you may buy it. I gave him ten shillings (I wanted sixpence), I told him to call and I would pay the sixpence; I never saw him again till he called for the sixpence, I told him I had no money in my pocket, I went up to my husband, and he and the young man in the house came down to my assistance; I told the prosecutor I would stop the man when he come for the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen Mr. Tilbury? - A. I bought the pelisse on the 2nd of December, I saw Mr. Tilbury on the 9th, and on the 15th the prisoner came for the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the man who sold you the pelisse on the 2d of December? - A. I am certain.</p>

             sworn. On the 2nd of December I came through the shop at the time the prisoner offered the pelisse coat for sale, it was near dusk. The landlady asked me if I knew the man or had ever seen him before; I told her I had never seen him before, to the best of my knowledge; she then asked me if I thought it would be right to buy it, I told her he looked like a hard working man; accordingly she bought the pelisse; that was all that passed in my presence at that time. Last Wednesday evening, a little before dark, the landlady came up stairs to her husband, and wished us to come down, as she had got the thief in the shop; we both went down, he was taken into custody, and I went to Mr. Tilbury; he returned with me, and the prisoner was lodged in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man who sold the pelisse? - A. I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I produce the pelisse, this pelisse is my property, it is the very same that I took from Mrs. Musket's.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - A. Eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Musket) The pelisse that Tilbury took from you is the very same that you bought of the prisoner? - A. It is the same pelisse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg leave to inform your lordship, in consequence of my coming for the sixpence, the lady detained me, and when Mr. Tilbury came down he promised to me if I would acknowledge the truth before witness, he would forgive me, and set me about my business; in consequence of that I did; I sent for my brother, as the lady said if I would pay her the ten shillings, she would not appear against me; my brother came, but he being in a passion for what I had done, went away out of the room.</p>

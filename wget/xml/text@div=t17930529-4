               <p>On the 19th of February, on Tuesday, I was going to Oxford with Mr. Blackstone to attend the election, the election of a warden of a college there; we left my chambers about nine o'clock in the evening, we had a post chaise and a pair of post horses of Mr. Stirling, who lives in Cary-street; just as we had past <placeName id="t17930529-4-crimeloc20">Holland-house</placeName>

               <p>Q. He gave the key of his trunk on being asked? - He did. The purse from the appearance I believe to be mine; from the sight of the pistols which I saw in the chaise I should have thought them rather smaller than these appear to be.</p>

               <p>I drove the chaise on the 19th of February, we went down at nine o'clock, we got past Holland-house, a man rode<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290009"></xptr>by and spoke, I did not understand exactly what he said; then he came to the chaise door again and spoke, still I kept driving on, and Mr. Mills told me to stop, and then a man came up to me and said, damn your eyes if you do not stop I will shoot you; or, blow your brains out; one of them; then I stopped, he went to the chaise door, and I took particular notice of the mare, knowing the mare was out at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get off your horse? - No. It was a mare with a white face and cropt ears.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on the side you rode, or on the other side? - On the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observations you made of the man, can you say that is the man now in the court? - I cannot. After he had committed the robbery he told me to drive on; he called to me at a distance from the chaise; from that I drove on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home when the mare went out that day? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time of the robbery think the mare was your's? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mare that morning? - I did. The mare was my master's, it went out about three o'clock in the forenoon; that is the man that took her out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home before the mare was brought back? - No, it was brought back before I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the person who rode the mare again? - On the Monday following, I believe, on the day I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the robbery did you recollect it was the same person that took the mare away? - Yes, I know the man for I had seen him two or three times before at my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what his business was at your master's when you saw him there? - He came for a horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. At the time of the robbery you did not know the man at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man that came for the mare you knew his face perfectly, you had seen him several times before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been frequently in your master's yard for a horse? - He had.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time of the robbery you could plainly see his face? - No, I principally took notice of the mare.</p>

               <p>I live in Cary-street; I keep a livery stable; I know the prisoner by making application for a horse three, four or five times; I was not present on the 19th, he had a horse then from my house; on the same day Mr. Mills ordered a chaise to take him to Hounslow; I sent this boy with the carriage; a little before ten o'clock I heard the cry of hostler, in the street; I ran into the street, and when I came into the street the mare was facing the street door, says I, this is a mare of mine, not pleased that she had been out, I put my hand on her and found she was in a violent heat; the prisoner was the man who came with the mare; I said, you have rode this mare fast; says he, I have not rode her far; then, says I, you have rode her too fast; I made the hostler hear as soon as I could, and he came to the gate and took the mare up to the stable; the prisoner then walked into the house and called for a pint of porter; while he was drinking of it he went into the stable and to the hostler, and returned and went with his porter and drank it in an inner room, and paid for it, and wanted a farthing out of his two-pence; I told him we always charged two-pence a pint in that room; he wished me a good night and went off. When the boy returned he told me the transaction that had happened, and brought me a directions from Mr. Mills for me to give to Mr. Mills's clerk, giving a statement of the robbery, in order that his clerk might give information at Bow-street, as I understand; when I saw Mr. Mills's clerk, I said to him, we had better keep this business a secret, and not expose it, for I dare say he will be coming again for another saddle horse in a few days; we did keep it secret, and on Saturday evening following he came again, about eight o'clock, I immediately knew him, he came and asked for the same mare as he had on Tuesday; that mare was engaged; he walked into the stable and there had agreed with the man for another mare; I went after him and said, pray where do you live? says he, at the Spread Eagle, in Gracechurch-street; I took him then by the arm, and I said to him, you are accused of committing an highway robbery the last time you hired my mare; he says in answer, me accused of an highway robbery? yes, says I, you are, and so strongly that I must detain you till you have cleared the matter; I then took him by the arm, says I, we will go to Mr. Mills to see if he is at home; I desired the hostler to go with me, when we came to Mr. Mills's chambers, Mr. Mills was not at home, his clerk was at the chambers; I said to him, this is the man that hired my mare, that the hostler says the man was on that robbed Mr. Mills; says he, Mr. Mills is not within; he not being within we concluded to take the man to the watch-house, we took him to the watch-house and I fancy some little time after Mr. Mills returned and went to the watch-house to him, about half an hour after he had been in custody, as I should suppose. He did live at the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So that the place where he told you he lived was the true place where he did live? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And he expressed a surprize in saying when you charged him with the robbery, me accused of a highway robbery? in that sort of way? - He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hired a horse on Tuesday the 19th of February to go to Mitcham; I went to Mitcham; I was there on some business; I returned from there about seven o'clock and came to the turnpike at the Obelisk, the other side of Blackfriars Bridge, about nine, and from the turnpike I rode the horse very hard to this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290011"></xptr>man's house. When I was taken to the watch-house on Saturday, I, without any hesitation, told Mr. Mills my lodging; on the day following, which was Sunday, I sent to an acquaintance who lived in Chancery-lane to get me some clean linen, as I had not changed since Friday; I delivered my keys to my acquaintance and desired him to bring my linen to me; he went and brought me word that Mr. Mills arrived there just at the time he arrived, and prevented him executing that order that I gave him; I had told him to leave every thing safe in the trunk, only to bring me some clean linen; I cannot say any more; I was at a great distance from the place where the robbery is said to be committed; I know nothing of it; I am quite a stranger to the business; I cannot prove an alibi, but there are some respectable people to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

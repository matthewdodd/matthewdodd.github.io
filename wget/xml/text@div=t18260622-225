On the 15th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner rang at my house-bell - I was at dinner - I came down and found him in the passage; he asked me to shew him some silk stockings; I let him in, and asked whether he wanted white or black; he said black - I showed him some; he wished to look at some more; we went on, and I opened four or five parcels; he appeared very difficult to please; I said, "If the goods I have shown don't suit, I think I have nothing that will;" he then selected four pairs of hose out of one of the parcels; I turned the paper over, laid the stockings on the top, and put them behind me - he then wished to look at some fine white cotton hose - I left him, and went about eight yards - he selected six pairs of them, and then wished to look at some brown cotton hose; I brought them, and as I came up to the desk where he was standing I discovered that he had drawn a paper of silk hose (which had not been opened) to the edge of the counter, and it struck me there was some thing wrong. I opened the paper of brown hose - he said they were too coarse, and asked for some finer - I went for some others, and as I came back I looked at the same place, and saw the parcel was not there; I opened the paper very quietly, and showed them to him - he said, "I don't much like them - I will be contented with what I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220077"></xptr>have selected - you will make a bill of them, and send them to Broad-street, and the money shall be sent;" I walked with him to the street door, and said, "Are you sure you have selected all you want?" he said, Yes. - When we got near the cuter door I took him by the collar, and said "You have something about you belonging to me;" he seemed surprised - I took off his hat, and in the bottom of it lay a dozen pairs of silk stockings. A gentleman came in, and I sent for a constable. They cost me 5l., and I should have sold them at a profit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any partner? A. No. I have seen the prisoner's mother - I do not know that he was in distress - there were some powders found upon him.</p>

                  </hi> I am in my father's, Charles William', service. The prisoner has been in his employ about two years—on Monday morning, 16th Feb., he went out three times before breakfast—I said, "Tooley, where are you going"—he said, "To breakfast"—I said, "I do not know why you go out so money times before breakfast"—he said he had not been out before that morning—I said he had—Brannan and Harvey were there—I said I had two officers, and should search his house, as I suspected we were being robbed—he said I had no right to do so, and said, "You may search me now"—Brannan said, "This is neither the time or place"—we went to his house, sixteen or eighteen doors off—he unlocked the door—we went in—we searched, and found a bar of brown Windsor soap in a drawer—I said, "That is our property"—the prisoner said, "That was given to me, I can prove"—we went on searching, and found 25lbs. altogether—I swear to it—no other house in the trade has such, and it would not be sold in bars—it would be cut in squares, plated and stamped first—this piece of rose-soap is ours also.</p>

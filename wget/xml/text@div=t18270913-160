There was an agreement, which was signed by both parties, and the prisoner was to have the use of the fixtures - there were stoves fixed in the house at the time he entered, on the 28th of April. He said that he was in the iron way - he occupied the house, but never resided there; his lad and one of his men were there. On the 16th of July I went there, and missed a stove from the room, on the second floor - the prisoner was not there. This is the stove, which I have no doubt was in that room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw the house before it was let, and you saw this particular stove there? A. Yes; he was to be a yearly tenant; I had received the rent for it before then - the stove was fixed.</p>

            . I was in the employ of the prisoner. I cannot say exactly when he went to this house, which is 265, Wapping-street - he did not carry on any business there. On the Saturday before I was taken up, he sent me to a green-grocer's, to say that he had a stove for sale - the green-grocer was not then at home, but he came afterwards and had the stove, which came, I think, from the first floor in that house - I had helped the prisoner to take it down the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was this? A. About seven o'clock one Saturday night, but I cannot tell what month. It was the week before he was taken up - he told me the things were his property, and I was not to take any notice.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner on a charge of taking away fixtures, out of this house at Wapping, and selling them - he said he thought they were his own - he had taken the house, and had a right to the fixtures.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Defence. I took the house and warehouse, to carry on the ship-chandlery business; I undertook to put the house in repair; and this grate I was going to replace with a new one, which would have been three times its value. I had goods ordered, and I expected them in the day after I was taken, but I was obliged to countermand them to save my credit; I had not run away from the house - I was there two or three times a day.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Webber-street, Lambeth. I know the prisoner had taken a house, and there was an agreement between him and me, for me to put it in repair; this was about the 16th or 20th of June; I went there twice to see what repairs would be wanted: he said there were very old stoves on the premises, and I told him that I could recommend him to a person, who would let him have some modern stoves cheap; I had intended to have taken the old stoves myself, and made him an allowance: I have nineteen houses myself, and Lewis, who collects rents, was with me when this agreement was making; he made no secret at all about his taking the house, or of there being old stoves there.</p>

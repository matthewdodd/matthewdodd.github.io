On the 17th of October, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop, several little boys were playing before the door. In consequence of what one of them told me, I missed a bundle of printed cotton. I went out, and saw the prisoner running away with it - I overtook him about three hundred yards off, and stopped him, I asked where he was taking them to, he said, a man gave them to him - one of my young men came after us, and picked them up; the prisoner had dropped them; it was a dirty evening, and they were all dirty - I took him back to the shop, they were taken from within the shop, not outside the door, about half a foot from it; he must have entered the house to have taken them; he might have reached them with his arm.</p>

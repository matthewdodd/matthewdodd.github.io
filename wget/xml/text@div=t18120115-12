            . Q. Did you at any time lose any of your clothes - A. Yes, a coat and a pocket handkerchief; I lost them from No. 4, <placeName id="t18120115-12-crimeloc69">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Is that the woman at the bar - A. Yes, that is the woman. I staid in her room about six or seven minutes: my coat was tied up in my pocket handkerchief, I put it down on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you were carrying your coat in your pocket handkerchief - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a candle in the room - A. Yes. The girl went out of the room to get some sugar; she told me she would give me a cup of tea; I thought I saw the bundle in the prisoner's hand; I looked round and missed it. I followed her down stairs. I saw her go out of the street-door, I caught her in the street, about ten yards from the door, she had not the bundle with her; I asked her for the bundle; she said she did not know any thing of it. Two men took the prisoner from me; I called watch, and the patrol came and took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your coat and handkerchief - A. No, never since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person in the room with you - A. Another woman. I met two women in Drury-lane, I went into this room with both of them. The two women went out of the room almost together.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when they went out almost together where were you in the room, and what were you doing - A. I was sitting down in a chair, and a candle in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you thought you saw the prisoner with the bundle, you are not sure, are you, that that she went out last - A. I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go after the other woman - A. Yes, I saw the other woman in the house afterwards. I lodge in Well-street, Somers Town.</p>

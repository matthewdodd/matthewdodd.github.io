            . I am a patrol in Broker-row, Moorfields. About a quarter after one on the 29th I heard the cry of murder in London Wall. I saw the prisoner running towards me, and as he came near me I drove my elbow into his side and threw him down. The watchman came up and assisted me; the prosecutor then came up; he said the prisoner was the man, he would swear to him. The prisoner was searched at the watchhouse; nothing was found on him but a cork screw and a knife.</p>

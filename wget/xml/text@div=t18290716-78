On the day in question the prisoners came to our shop together; Johnson asked if I had any Oxonions, I said No, but I shewed him some Blucher boots - he said he would sit down and try some on; I showed him several, which would not fit - I then showed him a pair which would fit him, but he said they were too strong; South went towards the window, and having some suspicion I looked in the window, and from a pile of six pairs of gentlemen's pumps I missed two pairs - I accused South of it, he said he had not got them; I said he had - he said "Count them over again;" I said that was of no use, they were gone - he then took one pair from one pocket and one from the other; he said he was very sorry, and hoped I would excuse him - I sent for a gentleman, and when my father came home he sent for an officer; on one of them was found 6d. and a ring, and on the other a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you search Johnson's fob? A. I did not; he was asked whether he had any money to pay for the shoes, and he made no answer - he was about two yards from South; I had perhaps shown him half a dozen pairs - sometimes people buy small shoes to make their feet look smaller; he was not long trying them, for I saw I had not a light pair to fit him - the shoes in the shop are my own property.</p>

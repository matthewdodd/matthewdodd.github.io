                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am in the service of Sarah Miranda, No. 27, Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square, in the parish of St. Pancras. Dr. Lee lodges there—it is Mrs. Miranda's house—there are two kitchen—Dr. Lee has the front kitchen, and Mrs. Miranda the back—my bed-room is between the two kitchens, quite close to the front kitchen—on Friday morning, the 18th of September, I was disturbed about a quarter before three o'clock, by a noise in the front kitchen, as if Dr. Lee's servant had put down a coal-scuttle—I then heard a crackling like lighting a fire or get<lb></lb>ting a light with lucifers—I laid for about a minute—the noise stopped—I thought the servant was ill, and I went to the door to ask her—the door was fast—I thought it was fast inside, instead of which she had locked it her<lb></lb>self before she went to bed—the key was in the door outside, but I did not observe it till afterwards—I thought she was in the room and said, "Susan, open the door"—there was no answer—I again said, "Open the door and let me come to you;" and then somebody said, "Susan is here," twice—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190083"></xptr>
               <p>I then said, "Let her speak, and I shall know her voice"—there was no answer for a minute, and then I said, "My G—here is a thief in the house"—I double-locked the door, and the thief tried it to see if it was fast—I told him I had locked the door that he could not come out—I then went up stairs as fast as I could, and hallooed to Dr. Lee, who called his servant to open her bed-room window to call the police, which she did, and my mistress hear<lb></lb>ing the noise got out of bed, opened her window, and sprang the rattle—I hastened down stairs as fast as I could, and as I got down in the hall I heard the thief go out of the window—the policeman brought the prisoner to the front-door—I unlocked the door, went into the kitchen with the po<lb></lb>liceman, and found 'the window shutter broken and hanging by the bar which fastened it to the other shutter—there was a candle burning—I found some lucifer matches on the floor and one on the table.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Dr. Lee. I sleep in the attic—I fastened the front-kitchen window about seven o'clock in the evening in question, all quite secure—I locked the door once, and left the key on the outside—the door is next to Green's sleeping-room—the win<lb></lb>dow was fastened with an iron bar across two shutters—I went to bed about a quarter or half-past ten o'clock—I was disturbed in the morning by Green—I threw up my bed-room window, and called "Police" several times—I saw the prisoner climb over the area gate, and saw the policeman take him—I went down into the kitchen, and found the candle burning—the drawers were opened, which were shut over night, and things tumbled about—I missed from my work-box a sixpence, a penny, a half-penny, a farthing, and a medal—the shutter was broken from the hinge—the hinge was broken from the wood part, and the window thrown up so that a per<lb></lb>son could get in—I knew the prisoner "before—he was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to Grafton-street to paint and do carpen<lb></lb>ter's work, or any thing there was to do—he was employed by Mrs. Miranda—he had done that for about a year and a half after I was in the house—he once paid his addresses to Mrs. Miranda's niece, who was her servant, but she had left three months, Green succeeded her—the last time I saw him in the house was when he came to put in a pane of glass, about twelve months ago.</p>

The prisoner, and a woman, who he called his wife, came to lodge with me on the 3d of September 1822; they hired my first floor front room; and remained till the 28th of November in the same year, when they absconded, taking the key with them; they owed me 1 l. for rent; as they did not return at night, I opened their door, and missed things not mentioned in this indictment. I missed them all from my bed-room two days after - it is on the same floor as their room; being in mourning, I had not seen the things for some time, but the black handkerchief I had worn on Sunday; my bed-room was frequently unlocked. On the 22d of December last the prisoner was apprehended. I had nobody in the house but my brother and a man who has lodged with me two years. I found some lace in their drawers which was taken off the sleeves of my brown poplin gown, and which had been taken from my drawers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was it his lodging or hers - A. Both lodged there - the street-door is open all day - the bed-room is always locked, except when the children leave it open; my street-door is kept open.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of December, near the King's Bench prison, and told him I had been looking for him along time, for robbing Mrs. Mills; he said he was very sorry for it, and hoped she would not imprison him. I enumerated the articles she had lost - he said if she would not imprison him, he would pay her for them at so much a week, and acknowledged taking them all but the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known him long - A. Yes; I knew him as a tradesman. He is the last man I should suspect.</p>

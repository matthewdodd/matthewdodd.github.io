             - A. Yes; I lived in the same house as she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was her husband - A. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you at the house on the night she came home, when she received her death - A. Yes. She was very much in liquor when the husband came home; I desired him to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any words pass between the prisoner and the deceased - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the son of the deceased come down stairs - A. No. He came down stairs, I did not see him. The prisoner came and knocked at my door, he asked me to go up to his wife he said she was very ill; I went up stairs; I saw the deceased, she was partly on the bed and partly off. He asked me whether any thing could be done for her; I told him he must get a doctor; he went out for a doctor returned back, he said he could not ring the bell; he went back again, and brought the doctor with him. The doctor said, she must be taken in a coach to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>MR. CHOPPING. Q. You are a surgeon; you saw this poor woman - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the disease by which she appear afflicted - A. I saw the injury that she received brought on a wound.</p>
               <p>Q. You were before the Coroner - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before the Coroner. that the injury that she received did not appear alone the ordinary circumstance that occasioned her death - A. I understand she was under the influence of liquor before it happened; it would have materially assisted the hemorrhage.</p>

            . I am the sister of the deceased. She had very large veins about her thighs; she shewed me the hurt, I being her sister. She told me the doctor said if she did not wear a bandage, it would be the death of her. She left the bandage off; I blamed her for leaving off the bandage.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Chopping You have heard the evidence given by the last witness; what is your opinion now - A.

The 15th of this month, Tuesday sevenight, when I came out of my back door, I see a man standing with a bundle under his arm; I says to him, what do you want? he makes answer and says to me, nothing.

               <p>Q. You secured him? - Yes, by myself. The other ran away; there was nobody near at all to assist at that time; there were several handkerchiefs on the ground as he lay, as we were both down.</p>

               <p>I am a shoe-maker, at Tottenham. About eight o'clock in the morning, or a trifle after, Tuesday week, the 15th of this month, I see Smith go by with a bundle under his arm, by my house; I live about six or seven doors from Mrs. Gillam, about seventy yards, not much more. I suspected that he had stole this bundle. As such Miller sent for me to take Tooke in charge, and he informed me that Mrs. Gillam was robbed; and as such I said, I see a man go by with a bundle under his arm, and I did not doubt but he was the person that stole the property; as such I sent a young man, named Wagstaff, after Smith immediately; and he took the man with the property under his arm, against the place which we call the George and Vulture, in Tottenham; as such he brought him back to me immediately, and I searched his pockets, and in his pockets I found five pair of stockings, and three pair of childrens shoes buttoned up in the flap of his breeches. I have got the property now in court.(Produced.)</p>

               <p>I am a gardener at Tottenham. The constable sent me after this man, Smith, to take him, and I took him at the George and Vulture, at Tottenham, and brought him back, and delivered him to the constable, with the goods under his arm, ten pair of shoes and two gown pieces.(Produced.)</p>

               <p>Tanslev. I have had them in my care ever since. I found eleven silk handkerchiefs in the yard between Gillam's house and Miller's.</p>
               <p>Q. To Miller. These are the same handkerchiefs you delivered to the constable? - They are.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gillam being a quaker declined taking an oath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Tooke. On Monday, the 14th of this month, I was on my journey from Hertfordshire to London; being late in the evening I got a list as far as Enfield highway; from there I walked to Edmonton, where the Statute was then holden; I went into a booth, where I staid till quite day light; proceeding on towards London I had occasion to retire up a passage, where I had not been above two minutes before a man came in and called out Mrs. Gillam! and the people went out, and I went out, and this man laid hold of me, and said, that I had been in the house. What I stand charged at the bar with I am entirely innocent of, neither do I know any thing at all of the parties that were there. I was coming up to London in hopes of getting a birth on board a man of war.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. As I was going on Lower Edmonton, to my friends, going along in the morning I see this bundle laying in the middle of the road, and picked it up; I did not know where it came from; about two or three minutes before that I met two men running up the road. I was bringing of it back, and there were two men came and catched hold of me, when I resigned directly, and they brought me back; I never said a word. I have had my friends waiting here several days, but they are not here now.</p>
               <p>Q. To Miller. Is Mrs. Gillam the owner of the house? - She is.</p>

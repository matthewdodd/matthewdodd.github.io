                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Castle-street, Long-acre, and am a porter. On 1st. Feb., about 5 minutes before 9 o'clock, I am not certain as to the exact time, I was going to bed, and heard a strange foot on the landing outside my room door—I took no notice at the time, but shortly after went down stairs with Mrs. Shakel, and found the prisoner in the passage—he was in the act of taking a key out of the lock of the street door—Mrs. Shakel asked what he wanted there—he said he wanted Mr. Williams, and he lived</p>

               <p>on the third floor—Mrs. Shakel said Mr. Williams did not live there; how dare he enter with a key; why not ring or knock—no such person lives there—I stopped with the prisoner, and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and struck me; I cried out for assistance, and Mr. Shakel came, and I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in this house, and am an engraver; George Stevens, my father-in-law, is the master of the house; it is in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. I was going up stairs, at 5 minutes to 9 o'clock, and met the prisoner on the stairs—he looked hard at me, and passed me—I am certain it was 5 minutes to 9 o'clock—I went up stairs, and then heard the parlour and street door opened—I went down, and went out into the street to look for the prisoner, but could not see him—it must have been him at the street door; there was no one else who could have been—I then searched the house, and when I got to the top I was called down by Champion, and found the prisoner on the step of the door, and Mr. Champion said, "Is this the man?"—I said it was, and brought him inside the passage—I asked the prisoner for the key of the door—he said. "I have not got one"—he afterwards showed me one, which I tried, and it opened the door—he afterwards tried to get it away from me again—I called a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

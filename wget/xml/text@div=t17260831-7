The Prisoner having been 2 or 3 times about buying Mr. Streets Bay Gelding, he ask'd if that Gelding was yet Sold, he was answer'd that it was not Sold, but was at <placeName id="t17260831-7-crimeloc35">Finsbury Stables</placeName>

The Prosecutors both got their Horses again.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he bought the Horses, and intended to pay for them, but being short of Money, he was obliged to keep out of the way. He call'd several to his Reputation, who gave him a good Character, and added that about 3 Years ago, his Father left him 600 l. and a Brew-house, which he Sold, not being capable to manage it himself, and that he has since dealt in Tobacco, and Brandy. - The Jury <rs id="t17260831-7-verdict36" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>I am a constable of St. Clement Danes. I have here two bags of halfpence; I found them in the lodging of the prisoners. They all lodge in one room; they were just got out of bed when I took them. I found these things under the bed; they have been in my custody ever since. (The witness produced the several articles mentioned in the indictment.) They were in two boxes, one was locked at the foot of the bed, and the other under the bed; one belonged to Vanderbank and the other to the biggest Prior. There were eighteen shillings and ninepence in Vanderbank's, and in the other one pound, fourteen shillings, and three halfpence; two pounds twelve shillings, and ninepence all together.</p>
               <p>Were they all in the same bed? - I went at four o'clock in the morning on Monday the 12th. I was told of it on Sunday the 11th. I saw Vanderbank come out of the door; he went in again. I saw the boy come out, and then he went towards Brook-street; I went after him; he returned back again. I then got somebody to go in with me. They told me who the boxes belonged to; that they had them from Mr. Langdale's; that they were together when they got them. the two biggest both told me that they saw the little boy was drunk. I had them at Lincoln's Inn, by five o'clock, under the care of the soldiers, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to them that it would be better for them to confess from whence they had got them? - No, nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Is he an apprentice to you? - No; a labouring man; I asked him what he had been doing there? He said he made better there than he did at work. I perceived he had a new pair of shoes and a new pair of stockings on, and a new hat and handkerchief. I asked him how he came by them? He said, he had got that, and had bought himself a new suit of blue clothes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him what fire he had been at? - Yes; he said Mr. Langdale's fire. I asked him how he came by the money? He said he had got a bag at home and

Thomas has lodged with me these twelve months past; he works somewhere in Bishopsgate street; his master has been here twice or thrice but his business calls him off; he is not here now. Thomas bore a very good character; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280204"></xptr> beloved in the neighbourhood; he behaved remarkably well and never was before a justice before; the other is very seldom with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the time when Cook and Helet complained of having lost some of their property - A. That was the 11th of September, in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of September had these three men all lodged in your house - A. Yes, they all went to bed about ten o'clock in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning did you hear any body go out - A. Yes, about five o'clock I was awoke by the moving of the chairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to say it was about five o'clock - A. I heard St. George's bell ring a little time after, it rings a quarter before six. I suppose it was about five.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your window shutters open or shut - A. They were all shut, I cannot say whether it was light or dark at that time; I heard a person coming down stairs, I called, whose there; the prisoner answered that he was going on board the vessel; he asked me if he should open the door and go out, or would I get up and let him out; I told him he might let himself out, upon that he opened the door and went out. I heard him unlock and unbolt the door; I bolted it myself after the lodgers had gone up to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his way to go out of the house lay through your room - A. Yes, the stairs come into my room. He went out, and I went to sleep again. He did not return. He had lodged with me about a month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was only a thin linen screen between the bed and the door, it was impossible for me to pass with a bundle at that time of the morning without being seen.</p>

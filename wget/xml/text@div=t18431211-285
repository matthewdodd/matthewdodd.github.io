                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Battersea, and am in the service of Isaac Isbel, a carrier. Between five and six o'ekiek, on the evening of the 6th of December, I stopped at Mr. Phillips', in Rood-lane, to deliver a box—I had a tilted cart—whilst on the step of Mr. Phillips' door, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner setting the parcel on the foot-board, im front of the cart—I had taken up that parcel at Mr. Ingleworth's, in Princes-street, Leicester-square, about three o'clock, and placed it in the back part of the cart, as far back as I could—I was to deliver it at the steam-wharf, to go to Glasgow—I did not notice the prisoner before I saw him with the parcel—he was in the cart—he jumped down—I made a grasp at him, but lost my hold—I immediately cried "Stop thief "—he ran up Rood-lane, and immediately he saw the constable he truned back—I kept on crying "Stop thief;" and a gentleman stopped him, and brought him back to the cart—I am certain he is the same man—the parcel was opened at the station, and contained snuff boxes and cigar cases—my master would have had to replace them if they had been taken away.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody in Rood-lane, by Mr. Creaton, who is not here—it was in Harvey's presence—I produce the parcel, which I found on the foot-board of the cart—it was opened in my presence at the station, and con<lb></lb>tained 2000 embossed paper cases for cigars, three snuff boxes, 1 cigar-case, and an invoice.</p>

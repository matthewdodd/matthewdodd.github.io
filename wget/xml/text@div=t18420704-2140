                  </hi>. I am a piano-forte-maker, and lire in London-street, Tottenham-court-road. On the 4th of July I was at the Re<lb></lb>galia public-house in Augustus-street, Regent's-park, playing at skittles—I took off my coat, took my handkerchief and put it underneath the back of ray waistcoat—the prisoner was in the skittle-ground—in about two minutes I missed my handkerchief, and inquired for it among some friends who were there—I was searched by one of my friends, and the handkerchief not being found, I went out and brought in a policeman, when there was a general search, and the handkerchief was found inside the waistband of the prisoner's trowsers—he told me he did not know how it came there—he laughed at me—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not feel it taken from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Regalia. On Monday, the 4th of July, there were some people playing at skittles—the prosecutor and prisoner were there—I saw the prosecutor, a few minutes before, with a handkerchief up his waistcoat—soon after that it was missed—we were all searched—I went to the prisoner, searched him once, and did not find it—I searched him again, and found it in the waistband of his trowsers—I asked him how it came there—he said he did not know.</p>

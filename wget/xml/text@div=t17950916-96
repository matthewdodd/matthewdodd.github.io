On Saturday the 5th of September, I was at my tea in the back parlour (it is all in a strait line) this boy came in, and he wanted a pair of shoes; my son came backwards to me and said, here is the <rs id="t17950916-96-deflabel549" type="occupation">muffin boy</rs>

I went forward to the prisoner, and I charged him with it; the prisoner was then in the shop; they were under his coat; he had a great coat on and another coat on; I said, you have stole a pair; says he, stole a pair! yes, says I, there they are under your coat. I took them from under his coat; he begged very hard I would let him go; but I sent for an officer, and gave charge of him. I have kept the shoes till now.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know them to be your shoes? - By my own hand writing, and inside marked D.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the shop when the lad came in? - Yes. On Saturday the 5th of September, the prisoner came into the shop and wanted a pair of shoes; I shewed them to him; while I turned my back to get some more, the prisoner took a pair and put them under his coat; my mother see him. I see my father take them from under the boy's coat. There is his own hand writing on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know your father's hand writing? - Yes. These are our shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into this gentleman's shop, on Saturday afternoon, and asked for a pair of shoes; there was nobody in the shop; I stamoed with my foot, and that young man came, and he asked me what I wanted? I told him a pair of shoes, and he gave me a pair to try on, and in bringing me another pair of shoes to try on, the slap of my coat got over the first pair. His mother came out of the parlour, (she knew me for a long time; I have served the gentlewoman with muffins these three years) and said I had taken a pair of shoes. I had the shoes on me stooping to unbuckle my shoe.</p>

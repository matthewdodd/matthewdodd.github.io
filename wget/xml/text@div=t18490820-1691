                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and have something to do with Ebene-zer Chapel, Bermondsey. In Jan., 1846, I received information, went to the chapel, and found the door partly open, and I missed a clock, two tables, and a table-cloth, which I had seen safe the evening before—the clock was over the mantel-piece in the school, to which there is a communication from the chapel—I have seen the glass; it belongs to the trustees of the chapel, of whom I am one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wife of Thomas Manning, of White Lion-court, Throgmorton-street. In Jan., 1846, the prisoner came to our house, and said he had got a clock and looking-glass to dispose of; owing to being out of work he must break up his house to get some money—my husband was not at home, and he called again in the evening—my husband told him he did not want them, as he had a clock down-stairs, and one in the coffee-room, but he might bring them as he was in distress—he brought the clock next evening, and sold it to my husband—I swear this clock produced is it—we had it two years and ten months—there was no key to it, and my husband asked him for it, and how be came to purchase such a clock in his circum<lb></lb>stances—he</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with the prisoner. In the early part of 1846 I recollect his coming home early in the morning, and bringing a clock and a looking-glass—I asked him where he got them from—he said that was his business—he went out and I saw no more of him till the evening, when he came and took the clock away, and came back without it—this clock is the same one—I asked him where he had been all day—he said what was that to do with me, and I went to bed—he desired me to sell the looking-glass, and I did so, to Mr. Gorbell.</p>

"Maria Gobbett has been living with me several times for two years and ten months; she left me in May, 1848, went to Gravesend, and was committed for a month; her brother gave me this clock to sell, as he had a distress in his house, and I sold it for him to Mrs. Manning; I was taken into custody in May twelvemonth, and had twelve months imprisonment; during my imprisonment, Maria Gobbett got aquainted with a policeman, who made her drunk, and gave her a sum of money to tell what she knew about certain robberies committed by me; so I was taken into custody for this clock; the policeman has been in the habit of sleeping with her at a house of ill-fame; she has done this because I would not live with her any longer."</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at Woodford with my parents—I am the prisoner's wife, we have been married eight years last March—I separated from him in March, 1874, and have lived; separate from him since then—On 25th March this year I was living at 156 Fulham Road, carrying on business in the millnery and drapery line between March, 1874, and 25th March, 1875, I had seen him twice; the last time was about nine months before this happened between 2 and 3 o'clock; on 25th I was in my shop with my child and my sister Maude Bruce; when the prisoner came in—he said "You did not expect to see me"—I said "No, neither did I want to see you" he said "I wanted to see you I want to ask you some questions"—I said-" You have no right to ask me any questions, and 1 don't think proper to answer them; you don't keep me nor your children, and this is my father's house and you had better walk out"-my little girl, who is 3 years old, looked up then and said Papa, my papa, come home"—he said he should have a private interview. with me—I then walked through the work-room into the parlour at the back; he followed me and my sister also, I called my sister—when we got into this, parlour, he pushed my sister back and would have locked the door; he attempted to, but the key happened to be out—he looked at the door; his countenance then changed terribly, and I flew to the private door and screamed murder—the private door opens into a kind of yard leading into the street—the door he attempted to lock was the door leading from the shop—before I could open the door leading into the yard he caught hold of me and said</p>

               <p>"Now I have got you I will cut your throat, you," calling me a bad name—my back was towards the yard door—he put his left arm round my shoulder and drew a ready opened knife out of his breast pocket, out of his pocket on the left side—I don't know whether it was the pocket of his coat or his waistcoat—I am quite sure the knife was open when he drew it from his pocket—he drew it like that (<hi rend="italic">across the throat</hi>)—I put my hands up and my face down and my hands were very badly cut, and it cut my face; I have the scar now—he did not make any observation at the time—he raised his arm again and stabbed me over the right shoulder in the back—he then stabbed me in the left thigh, at the side—he did not say anything at the time he was doing this; I was trying to slip down out of his arms—I can't remember whether he did anything else to me; I heard some one come in then and he let go of me—I was bleeding very much and was faint—I was calling out murder while this was being done—it lasted a very few minutes—when he let go of me I crawled into the shop—several persons came to the door, my sister was one of them—the policeman and the doctor came almost immediately—I did not see what became of the prisoner—I remained at home for a fortnight attended by Dr. Godrich, and then the place on my back became very bad and I was taken to the hospital, where I remained a fortnight and three days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 140, Fulham Road—on Thursday afternoon, 25th March, about 3 o'clock, I was called to 146, Fulham Road and saw Mrs. Owen standing in the parlour behind the shop—blood was pouring from her mouth, from her hands and from underneath her clothes I had her at once laid down on the sofa and asked who had done it—the prisoner was then brought to my side by the constable—I asked if that was her husband—she said "Yes"—the knife was ultimately handed to me by the prisoner and I handed it to the constable—I examined it at the station, it was stained with something, I could not swear that it was blood—after laying Mrs. Owen on the sofa I cut the clothes off to examine the wounds there was a wound about 2 inches long extending from the left angle of the mouth, outwards across the cheek, and about one-eight of an inch deep—between the finger and thumb of the right hand there was an incised wound extending to the bone; there was also a slighter incised wound on the fore<lb></lb>finger of the same hand and also a small incised wound on the little finger of the same hand—on the inner side of the left hand there was a piece sliced off consisting of skin and some flesh, about 2 inches long and merely hang<lb></lb>ing by the skin—beneath the right shoulder blade there was a punctured wound extending to the ribs; that was about three-quarters of an inch deep, it was stopped by the rib no doubt, it was direct in as straight as could be—I should say that was a wound that must have been inflicted with some violence, it had gone through all the clothes in addition to the flesh; it was in a highly dangerous locality; if it had passed between the ribs it would have been a very serious matter indeed, it would have gone near the pleura and the lungs—there was also a punctured wound on the middle of the left thigh; that went very nearly straight in; as far as I could judge that was about 2 inches deep—I had no probe—there was a corresponding cut in the clothes—this knife is just the sort of instrument that would have pro<lb></lb>duced such wounds—she had lost a considerable quantity of blood, there was a considerable quantity of blood about the place and she was very faint—I took immediate steps to stop the blood; she remained under my care about a fortnight—during the latter portion of that time she had excessive pain in the groin—I examined it and found evidence of a bruise; a fall or kick would have done that—she was ultimately taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the stab in the back had not been arrested by the rib it might have penetrated the lung, which would have been very serious—the wounds were not dangerous in themselves, they might have led to danger—I have seen her to-day; she is in a debilitated and very nervous state, she has recovered from the wounds and is able to go about her usual occupation, she is somewhat disfigured in the face.</p>

            . I am a Jew. On the 26th of April, between six and seven in the evening I was standing in Duke's place, the prison walking up and down with an apron on; hed me if I knew where a goldsmith lived; I told him there was one through the arch; then he beckoned me to him, and asked me if I would buy a piece of gold, and pulled out this watch-case; I asked him what he would have for it; he said a guinea; I asked him where he got it; he said he found it between Bow and Stepney; I said, why did you not sell it before you came here, there are many silversmiths between there and Duke's-place; so I stopped him and sent for an officer, ( produced and deposed to by prosecutrix.)</p>

               <p>If they can say I stole it, I'll suffer the law; please to ask Mr. Bennet, my master, my character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bennet. I had a very good opinion of him to the last; I had agreed to advance his wages but a week before I took him up; I never knew any thing amiss of him before this.</p>

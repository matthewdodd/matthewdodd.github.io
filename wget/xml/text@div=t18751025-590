                  </hi>. I am a woollen merchant, in Sise Lane, City—I knew the prisoner previous to October, 1874, and had business dealings with him—on October 3rd a bill of "his fell due for 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods sold and delivered—on the 2nd he called at my office and saw some linen goods called "ducks" lying there, which I agreed to sell to him provided the bill due on the 3rd would be paid—he said "I am prepared to meet the bill, I have funds ready for it in the City and County Bank" and I sup<lb></lb>plied him with the ducks on that assurance, their value being 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 3rd I had prepared some goods for him, but would not deliver them unless I was assured that the bill would be met—he then wished to buy some woollen cloths and I declined to sell them unless the bill would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187510250034"></xptr>
               <p>he met—on his distinct assurance that he had the money in the bank I gave him a delivery order for twelve pieces of woollen cloth of the value of about 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Pewtress, the packers, of Cannon Street, were to deliver them to him—the bill for the 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was dishonoured and I never received the money—the prisoner's offices were 8, Queen Victoria Street, City—I called there but did not find him—the last I saw of him was on Saturday, the 3rd October, until he was in the custody of the police—I applied for a warrant for his arrest and he was arrested about a year afterwards—I believed his statement as to having the money in the bank because I tested him in several ways—I put the question many times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My place of business is at 12, Sise Lane, where I have carried on business many years as a merchant—I had stock of my own—those woollen goods were my own—I have not been able to pay for them, I had known the prisoner four months previous to October—my first transaction with him was about July 30 when I called on him—I called on him many times—he asked me for many months' credit, and on this occasion I said "I will take a third in cash and the remainder in bills," and he paid me, I believe, 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—that was not a transaction con<lb></lb>nected with the 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the amount of the transaction on 30th July was 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he accepted bills—I drew for the goods—I never borrowed a shilling of him—he made me a payment of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on one occasion for goods sold for cash, part payment—he could not pay me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he was to pay in cash—the amount of our transactions altogether would be about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never had one accommodation transaction with him—the bill for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for goods sold in August—he could not pay in cash and I drew on him—the 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for August 4 and July 29—I am looking at my book, where all the entries of goods are in detail, from which I copied the invoices—he took the bill up for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due 10th. September himself, it was for goods sold and delivered—I never had any acceptance, I am quite sure I did not accept the bill for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and ho had to take it up because I did not meet it—I delivered no more goods to Pewtress after I knew Skalski had not the money to meet the bill on the 3rd October—I sent invoices of goods purporting to be delivered, and if he had paid me the money he would have had them—I thought he should see the goods were ready, but I would not deliver them to him—that was the 7th or 8th—I knew by that time the bill had been returned—he mentioned something about going about and getting some money of his friends—I knew he was in partner<lb></lb>ship with a man named Rock, and that he lost money with him; and I told him if he did not part with Rock I would not do business with him, and he parted with Rock—I believe he left bis clerk at his office in Queen Victoria Street and that his wife was there when he went abroad—I took out the warrant on the 15th October and I next saw him in England when he was apprehended—I did not know that he was then carrying on business in London—he had another bill for about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming due on the 8th—he would have gone on step by step as a matter of course if he had met them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He has failed to meet in all, bills to the extent of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards—when I invoiced the other goods to him I was not aware of the state of his banking account.</p>

On the evening of 9th June, a lady made a communica<lb></lb>tion to me, and I saw the prisoner taking my two children away—this is one of them, and is under two years of age, and the other is too ill for me to bring—she was carrying this one, and the other had hold of her dress when I overtook her, but she led him away by the hand—I asked her why she was taking my children away—she said that she meant to be very kind to them, and to give them some cake—she had passed three or four cake shops, and was going down a street where there are no shops.</p>

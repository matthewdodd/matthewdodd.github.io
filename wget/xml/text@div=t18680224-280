                  </hi>. I live at 216, Pentonville Hill, and am a photo<lb></lb>grapher—on 13th February, between eight and nine p.m., I was employed temporarily at Waterloo House, Woolwich—it is a sale room—the prisoner came in and out of the room several times; and when the room was cleared he came up to me, and asked me what made me appear against him at Marlborough police-court—I did not answer him until I saw he was getting very excited; and then I said, "I do not want to have anything to say to you whatever, as I know you are a very dangerous character"—he said, "You have committed perjury," and I said, "Well, you go and prove it"—I was in the act of going out at the door sideways, when I received a stab on my left temple, very near my eye—I saw a knife in his hand; and, to the best of my belief, I heard it fall—I was immediately smothered in blood, and became very faint—I called out "Police," and two officers were on the spot immediately—directly after the stab, I received a fearful blow on my eye; but whether from his foot or his fist I cannot say, as I was blinded with blood—I pointed the prisoner out to the police, they took him in custody, and I was taken to a doctor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was your employment at this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was employed by Mr. Sydney Smith at this place only for a few days, to take stock of the things that were sold—I know a man named Jennings; perhaps I have been in his employment ten, eleven, or twelve months, at various times—he carried on a mock auction—Smith also keeps a mock auction—I am not aware that the prisoner has been employed several months in putting down mock auctions—I was a witness against the prisoner at Marlborough Street, about three months before this—there were three or four other per<lb></lb>sons in the room at the time this occurred—they were strangers to me—directly the blow was struck they ran away—they were standing behind a curtain, at the extreme end of the shop—probably they did not see it—their names are Smith and James Madigan—I am not aware that Martin or Kelly were there—Levine was not in Jennings' employment when I was there—he is a mock auctioneer—I cannot say whether he was present when this took place—I believe none of the persons present saw the transaction—I have not seen them since—I have been past the shop twice since, and found it shut up—I was not acting as <hi rend="italic">crabb</hi> at this mock auction, I do not know what you mean; it is some kind of shell fish—I did not tell customers who came in that had not got any money, to buy—the prisoner did not say to the people, "Be careful, this is a mock auction," but something different to that—he asked the proprietor if any customers came in, whether he would give him a commission, and he said he would, and afterwards a gen<lb></lb>tleman named Bates came in—I believe he is a major, living on Woolwich Common, and the prisoner persuaded him to purchase goods to the amount of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that—I believe he has been annoying and threatening Mr. Jennings, and that was the reason of my having to appear against him—I</p>

               <p>did not rush at him—he stabbed me with a carving knife—no one rushed at him—I had not the knife in my hand—the knives were at the extreme end of the shop—I was not present at an application to postpone this trial, in order to get other witnesses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Denmark Villas, Woolwich—Halfpenny was brought to me about twenty minutes past nine on Thursday, 13th, bleeding profusely from a punctured wound on his left temple, close to the eye—he was in a fainting state, and it was some time before he could be brought round—the wound was half an inch long, and extended to the bone—it corresponded with a knife of this kind (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—next day I noticed a very extensive bruise round his eye, as if a Wow had also been given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the blow inflicted with the point or blade of the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With the point, I should imagine—it had been given with great violence.</p>

On 13th February, I was on duty in High Street, Woolwich—I heard cries of "Murder," and "Police," coming from Waterloo House—I went to the door, and saw the prosecutor with his face covered with blood—the prisoner was standing at the further end of the shop—the prosecutor pointed him out—the prosecutor charged him, and I took him in custody—he said, "Don't handle me, I will go quietly"—while I was searching him, this knife was handed to me by some<lb></lb>one in the shop—at the station, the prisoner said he did not stop the man, but that he struck him with his knuckles—there was blood on the knife, just as it is now.</p>

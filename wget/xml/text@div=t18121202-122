            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was at Palace-yard. I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before - A. I did not. I watched him, and saw him attempt several gentleman's pockets. I saw him take this handkerchief out of Mr. Lyon's pocket. I immediately laid hold of him, and took it out of his hand. I gave the prisoner to my brother officer, and sent him to the Mitre public-house until I went to the gentleman, and told him of it. I found Mr. Lyon in the crowd: I asked him if he had lost any thing. He said, a handkerchief. I said, is this yours. He said, Yes This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear to be in company with any body - A. No, none whatever; he was alone.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief; it is worth more than eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Somebody put the handkerchief on my arm. I was looking at the handkerchief when the officer laid hold of me.</p>

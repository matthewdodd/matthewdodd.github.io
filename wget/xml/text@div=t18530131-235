                  </hi>. I am a printer, at Owthwaite's-buildings, Fenchurch-street. On Thursday morning, 16th Dec., I went to my premises, about 10 o'clock—I found that thirty-two gas burners had been taken from the place, and about six pounds of brass rules—a man and boy had gone there before me to open the place—the gas burners were fixed to the dwelling—the brass rules are small pieces of brass used in the business—the prisoner had been in my employment, but had left between six and seven months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am servant to the housekeeper of the premises where Mr. Dawson carries on business—she is placed there by the owner, to receive the rents and take care of the premises. On the morning of 16th Dec. I went to open the door, about 10 minutes to 8 o'clock—I unfastened the door myself—Thomas Marshall came in about ten minutes, and a boy named Walsh—I gave them the keys of Mr. Dawson's part of the premises, and they went up stairs—after they went up, I saw the prisoner come down; I have known him for years; I knew him when he was an apprentice there—he had a large parcel under his arm—he spoke to me, and wished me good morning, and I returned it; he crossed Fenchurch-street, and went up Rood-lane—I had not seen him go up stairs; he could not have gone through the door which I unlocked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old; I used to work for Mr. Dawson. On this Thursday I went up stairs, with Marshall, into the warehouse; it was about 10 minutes after 8 o'clock—I then went into the pressroom by myself, and there saw the prisoner; he was just on the top of the stairs—he asked me who was down stairs, Mr. Matthews or Mr. Marshall—I told him, Mr. Marshall—he told me to tell him to come up; and while I called him by one pair of stairs, the prisoner was gone by the other pair of stairs—the composing room and the press room open one into the other—the staircase he went down is at the other end of the press room; it was the stairs I had come up—he ran down those stairs while I was hallooing down the other stairs to Marshall—the stairs would take him to the front door—I am sure it was the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Dawson. I left the premises the night before at a few minutes to 8 o'clock; I did not lock them up; I left the workmen on the premises; there were about a dozen workmen there then—they generally leave at 8 o'clock, but I went away a few minutes before 8 that night—I went next morning about 10 minutes past 8 o'clock; I took the keys from the housekeeper's servant, and proceeded to unlock the door of Mr. Dawson's part of the building—Walsh called me, and I went up—as soon as I got up stairs I heard the warehouse door shut—I instantly ran down again to see who was there; I did not see any one—I saw Margaret Sullivan as I was going down the stairs leading into the court—when I left the premises the night before, the gas burners and the brass rules were safe in their usual places—in the morning I observed the window of the press room up stairs was open; the brass rules were not there; they were left in the composing room; they adjoin, one opens into the other—a man could have got through the open window—there was a ladder in the next court, where some men were employed plastering; it reached to the top of the house—any one could get up there—none of the things have been found.</p>

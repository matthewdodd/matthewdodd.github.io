               <p>(The indictment was opened by Mr. Alley.)</p> 
               <p>Mr. Knapp. May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury. It becomes my painful duty to solicit your attention to the facts that will be laid before you in evidence, in order to bring your minds to the conclusion of the guilt or innocence of the unfortunate prisoner at the bar. The crime imputed to him is as high a crime as any almost that is known to the laws of the land; indeed I might have been correct in stating it to be as high a crime as any that is spoken of by any laws human or divine, and it is aggravated in this instance (if the facts are made out), by the person committing the murder charged upon this inquisition, inasmuch as it hath been committed by him upon the person of his wife. Gentlemen, I beg not to be understood in my address to you to be attempting to lead your minds from the fair judgment that you ought to form upon the facts that will be laid before you; it only belongs to my situation to point out the magnitude of the offence, and lay those facts before you, and when that is done, sure I am the public and the prisoner will be equally satisfied with your determination.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, It becomes the more painful to me when I look at the person who is the object of accusation, that he is a person in an advanced period of life, and who has lived in the world in such a manner as never before to have a stain fall upon his character; and still more so when I reflect that a Grand Inquest of the country have passed in judgment upon the circumstances that will be laid before you, and have thought that this was not a charge sit to be submitted to your consideration; but, Gentlemen, it is my duty to inform you, that by the law of this country, wherever a death, accidental or by violence, hath happened, an inquisition is directed to be taken before the Coroner, and in this case the Coroner's Jury having thought fit to find that which is charged upon this inquisition to be "Wilful Murder," the prisoner must be amenable to your enquiry.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Having said so much, I again particularly desire you not to take any of those topics that I have been urging against the prisoner, but judge only by the evidence which will be adduced before you. I shall now state the facts, and I am sure you will draw that conclusion, which, as honest and experienced men, you ought to do.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The prosecutors of this indictment are the parish officers of that parish where the death has happened; and, I think I may state, subject to the correction of the Bench, that they have done no more than their duty (upon a death having happened in their parish), in submitting it to your consideration.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The prisoner is a man of repute and of character, and has lived to an advanced period of life; he is a <rs id="t18010114-25-deflabel141" type="occupation">farmer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18010114-25-defend281 t18010114-25-deflabel141"></join> of opulence and of respectability. On the day laid in the indictment, and previously to it, unfortunately for the prisoner, the woman, charged to have lost her life by his means, had been in the fatal practice of drinking, which had, I believe, considerably embittered the comforts that would otherwise have proceeded from such a commission. On the day laid in the indictment, he had been at some distance from home upon business, and did not return home, I think, till nine o'clock in the evening, and, upon his return home, he found his wife in that situation in which he had repeatedly found her, (I believe almost daily); that prepossession in favour of liquor having encreased upon her, he immediately enquired where she was; he was told what her situation was; she went up stairs, and the servant will tell you, that immediately upon her going up stairs into her room, the prisoner followed her; that a considerable scuffle and violence was heard; I don't know whether I am over-stating the facts, but if I am, you will correct me hereafter by your verdict; I understand violent blows were heard, and a violent resistance of the deceased in going from one bed-room to the other, in which bed-room she had been always placed by her husband when she was in that state. Nothing more passed till about one o'clock in the morning, and at that early hour the prisoner was heard to come down stairs, and was asked why he came down; he said, he came down to drink something; he appeared extremely agitated, and very much unnerved: However, nothing transpired till about five o'clock in the morning, when the prisoner came down and desired the maid to go for a Mrs. Holdship, the sister of the deceased; and upon being asked what was the matter, he said, oh Lord, and expressed himself in excessive agitation; he seemed considerably hurt from some transaction that had taken place; he said, go for her sister; and then said, she is no more. Upon this taking place, the sister came, went up stairs, and found her in the situation I am going to describe;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140032"></xptr>she found her resting upon her arm, quite speechless and motionless; she appeared a little warm under the arm upon which she was resting; she then used all the application which a person so nearly and so dearly connected with the deceased as she was, might be naturally expected to use; she immediately made use of blankets, and all means of recovery that could be applied, but without effect; she then observed bruises upon various parts of the body; but as I wish to state every thing for as well as against the prisoner, I understand the witness will not be able to state whether they were recent bruises or bruises that had been created by former violence. There was the appearance of frothy, bloody water, running out of her mouth, and there was also the same appearance upon the floor by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, These are all the circumstances with which I am furnished, from whence you are to draw the conclusion, whether such a degree of violence has been used,(and that by the prisoner), as to impute the crime of murder to him, as is charged by this inquisition.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will require to be told whether any medical advice was called for, in order to see what was the nature of her complaint, and what was the result of their opinion, whether the immediate cause of her death was attributable to the bruises she had received, or any thing that could have proceeded from the scuffle I have slated. It so happens, that in this case there are three medical gentlemen of integrity and skill, one of whom had been in the habit of attending her before; they opened the body, and they will give their account of the situation in which they found it; their opinion I shall forbear to state to you; it will, perhaps, be stated in that correct and technical manner by them, which cannot fail of being more satisfactory to your minds than by any statement of mine, from whence you will draw your conclusion, whether the prisoner is guilty of the murder imputed to him or not.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, Thus far I ought to state, because I owe it to the prisoner, that from the result of the opinions of these medical gentlemen, it seems to be uncertain whether the death be attributable to those means which the inquisition ascribes, or whether it might not have arisen from intoxication; but it would not be sufficient for parish officers, nor for me, who am conducting the prosecution, under the direction of the learned Judges, nor you, to take it upon what I am told will be their opinion; and I should be wanting in my duty to the public, if I did not call the witnesses to give their evidence, and then it will be for you to draw the conclusion between the public and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hope I have not said any thing that can induce any inflammation in your minds; the issues of life and death are in your hands; you have to discharge an important duty to youselves, to the public, and to the prisoner; and I am sure that duty will be performed by you conscienciously and honourably; I shall call the witnesses, and when I have so done, your verdict, I am sure, will be satisfactory evidence.</p>
               <p>Evidence for the Crown.</p>

               <p>Q. How was she employed in his absence that day? - A. Preparing for Old Christmas Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any drink? - A. During the afternoon she had three quarterns of gin; I did not see her have any other drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she intoxicated? - A. She was far from being intoxicated, she knew what she was about; she was in the kitchen when he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she remain in the kitchen till he came into the house, or did she go up into her own room? - A. She went up into her own room; he came in and very much abused me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nothing pass before he abused you? - A. He said, that he was informed at Sunbury, at three o'clock, that my mistress was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in consequence of that that he abused you? - A. Yes; he then went up stairs to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to your master about it? - A. I said she was not drunk at that time; he then went up stairs, I heard him call her a drunken b-h.</p>
               <p>Q. How high up stairs? - A. One pair; after that I heard a great piece of work, a noise, and lumbering of feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else that could have occasioned the lumbering of seet, except you master and mistress? - A. No; after that I heard my mistress cry out, oh Lord! and desired a little girl, who was up stairs in the room with them, to call Betty to help her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs in consequence of this desire of your mistrss? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not go up stairs? - A. I was afraid, he had abused me so much below; he came down stairs in a few minutes for something to fasten the door; he asked me first, if I knew where the staple was that I had drawn before; she had been fastened into that room before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the room in which your master sleeps? - A. No, the room where she used to sleep by herself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the staple was drawn, what do you mean? - A. I drew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion did it used to be applied? - A. He used to fasten her in when she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the staple? - A. I told him I did not know where it was, and he did not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he look for any thing else? - A. Yes, he looked for a brass screw, and said, he would fix me from going in to her; I was just out at the shop door, and he banged the door to, and told me I might go to h-ll if I liked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get in soon after this? - A. Yes, I believe, in about a quarter of an hour the little girl came crying out.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he his clothes on at that time? - A. He was dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he called to you, what did he say? - A. He desired me to go and call

             up, that was my mistress's sister, he meant Mrs. Holdship; I heard him say that he had been down stairs about one o'clock after drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you usually leave water in your master's bed-room? - A. No; I heard him then go in and say, oh Lord, several times; I went to call Mrs. Holdship; I returned, and asked him what was the matter, and he said, she was no more.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he express himself, like a man very much agitated and in grief? - A. He seemed to be very full of grief; it might be half an hour before she came, and I returned again and told her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by the desire of the prisoner that you went the second time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up into the room where your mistress was, before Mrs. Blowham came? - A. No, I could not go into the room when I heard that she was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go into the room with that lady? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You were the person that used to get the drink which your mistress took? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the habit of drinking gin in quantities? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen her many times extremely drunk, have not you? - A. Yes, I have seen her during the time I have lived with her very drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon these occasions you were the person that generally got the liquor for her? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else might get it? - A. There was a neighbour that sometimes got it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor had you got for her in the morning of that day upon which your master went out to Sunbury? - A. I got none in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You got the liquor at separate times, first one quartern of gin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a second? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then a third? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to dissuade her from taking it? - A. She was not very drunk, she got up stairs without help.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what you call not being completely drunk; she went up stairs upon your informing her that your master was coming home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master told you that he had heard that she was drunk at three o'clock, at Sunbury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And blamed you for getting the liquor with which she had been getting drunk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was extremely angry at that? - A. Yes, and abused me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it you or the little girl that he desired to tell her she should lie in the room where she generally did when she was drunk? - A. No, I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was customary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon those occasions he used to put a hasp upon the door to keep you from getting to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell these gentlemen how came you to take the hasp off that door which your master had so frequently made use of to keep you from getting to her; what did you do with it? - A. I put it away.</p>

               <p>Q. You would not let him have it? - A. I could not be in the kitchen, he was in such a passion, I could not recollect just then where I had put it.</p>
               <p>Q. This room, in which this poor unhappy woman was, she had frequently been put into by her husband when she was drunk? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am sister to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140034"></xptr>deceased, I was called up; I went to my sister's house, I saw Mr. Shore, and said, oh, John, what is the matter; he told me to go up stairs, and he followed me; I went up into the little back room, and saw my sister lying upon the carpet by the bedside; she laid as if somebody had laid her there; she lay with her head upon her arm upon her right side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe about her person? - A. Some bloody froth water like running from her mouth upon the side that she lay on; I helped to undress her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who helped to undress her with you? - A. Her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular about her person? - A. I saw a great many bruises upon all the upper parts of her body, and about her face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her that afternoon before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the appearance of those bruises when you parted with her in the afternoon? - A. Yes, in her face; I cannot say whether the others were or not, because she had got her clothes on; her husband and I laid her upon the bed, I rubbed her body, and wiped her mouth, and warmed her bed; I did every thing that I could do.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner appear at that time? - A. Very much loaded with sorrow and trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he give you every assistance in his power? - A. He did, and helped to undress her.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person appear more sorrowful for what had happened than he appeared to be? - A. No, nobody could be more sorrowful than he was; he sent for Mr. Hardiman, the publican, and told his mind to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You say you observed this poor creature had some bloody froth in her mouth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been nothing discharged from her stomach? - A. Yes, there was some upon the floor and the carpet.</p>

               <p>Q. But that was bloody froth? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. About ten o'clock at night of the 5th of December I was in my own yard, and heard Mr. Shore abusing his maid, I afterwards heard Mrs. Shore say, what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear in the house any noise? - A. Yes, I heard a noise up stairs, like as if one person might be thrown down by another, and I heard a hammering, like fastening the door.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a surgeon, living at Hampton; I was sent to upon this occasion; I went up stairs to the deceased's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any information at all? - A. The only question he put to me was, whether I would like to go up and see the corpse; said, if he pleased; I went up into the room, and saw the corpse.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the observations that you made upon the corpse? - A. There were some external marks and bruises, one upon her thigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a considerable bruise upon her arm, upon her side, and on her face.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those bruises such as would have the effect of producing serious consequences? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other observations at that time? - A. I did not; I afterwards with Mr. Boone and Mr. Jones opened the body, that was the next day; immediately upon dividing what we call the internal integuments of the abdomen, there was a considerable effusion of blood, and conceiving that to be the cause of her death, I thought it proper to find the source of that effusion; after removing the abdomenal viscera, I dissected from the heart downwards, and perceived a rupture of the internal iliac artery; I thought it would be likewise satisfactory to open the head, and found the vessels very turgid, and a disposition to inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had attended the deceased before, were you acquainted with that disposition that she had to drink strong liquors? - A. I have heard it commonly reported.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe it yourself? - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing her to have had this failing, having opened the body and the head, can you tell us, from one cause or the other, to what is to be attributed her death? - A. The death of the deceased is to be attributed to the rupture of the blood vessel certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, attributing the death to the rupture of the blood vessel, venture to state upon your oath, from your skill in your profession, that the death was occasioned by any external violence used to the body, or a suffocation, procured in consequence of liquor? - A. I conceive it to be from external violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the deceased to have been thrown down upon the ground, might a rupture or not have taken place in consequence of a fall of that sort? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in Court during the time the other witnesses have been examined? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard them state their evidence? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether this death might have been occasioned by the means that they have stated? - A. The rupture might be given by external force; how it was given, it is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140035"></xptr>not happen to see this poor creature till she had been laid upon the bed? - A. No; the body was stripped, and lying upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen this poor creature lying upon the floor, in her clothes, near the bed, and you had observed this froth that arose from her mouth, would you not have deemed it extremely probable, that, with some little bruise, the suffocation had increased the liability of breaking the blood vessel? - A. I conceive as to that froth, that she was in the act of dying, in consequence of the rupture: it is not at all improbable that the loss of blood from the ruptured vessel to the abdomen would produce sickness, and that sickness, from a particular position of body, suffocation.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Shore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not a man of a fair reputation? - A. I always heard him spoken of as an industrious, sober man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said that this rupture might be attributed to external violence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that it might have taken place in consequence of being thrown upon the ground? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether the same rupture might not have taken place in consequence of her falling from the bed? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. And might not such a rupture also have taken place in consequence of any struggle that might have been used between her and any other person, in endeavouring to get her into that bed-room? - A. I conceive it possible.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I attended with the last witness at the opening of the body of the deceased; I observed an effusion of blood in the abdomen, which proceeded from a rupture in the internal iliac artery, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to form an opinion, whether the rupture in the internal iliac artery rose from an internal natural cause, or from violence? - A. Certainly it did not appear to arise from any internal cause, but evidently either from a violent effort in the individual herself, or violence from some other person; had it risen from any internal disease, the artery would not have been found, which the coats of the artery were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on examining the body, observe any external marks? - A. Many, but none that could apparently have been the cause of her death; there was a great deal of external bruises or extravasation on the right side between the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose all those marks of violence could be occasioned by a single fall from the bed? - A. No. impossible; and I think it impossible to say exactly whether some part of these might not be simple extravasations, because I mean to say that this poor woman had been dead three or four days previous to our seeing her.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the bed upon which she laid, from the ground? - A. It was but low.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible, that merely from falling off the bed, the strain of the body would occasion a rupture in the iliac artery? - A. It is a very hard question to answer, for the coats of the iliac artery are very strong, and great violence must have been used.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a surgeon, at Hampton; I was present at the inspection of the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you concur in the testimony that these gentlemen have given? - A. Certainly, I do.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe these extravasations? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was some time after the death before you saw the body? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen a few days after death? - A. Yes; but in tracing these bruises inwards, from without, the appearance of violence ceased; within a very small distance from the surface, the artery is guarded by a vast number of very strong muscles and bones.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, it will be for you to say, whether under this evidence, you are perfectly satisfied that the deceased came by her death, by means of the prisoner throwing her down upon the floor; it seems to be left upon this evidence, in an extremely doubtful state, nor is there any person who has seen a single blow given; there has been a noise like forcing her into this room, which really seemed to be the proper place for a woman in her situation, and her resistance, as the surgeon has said, might have caused, by a violent effort or exertion, this rupture of the blood-vessel, it will be for you to say whether you see it necessary to go any further or not.</p>
               <p>The Jury were of opinion it was unneccessary to go on, and found a verdict of <rs id="t18010114-25-verdict143" type="verdictDescription">

On the 24th of August, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner called me up, I found him standing in the street without his coat - He occasionally worked for me; he said he had been robbed of his coat, and treated very bad, at a public-house. I let him in to sleep in my shop, and lent him my coat to cover himself. In the morning, between six and seven o'clock, I heard him unlock the door, and go back again; I heard the parchments rattle; he went down stairs gently and did not return. I got up, and missed sixty skins of parchment, and my coat. About eight o'clock, I saw him playing at skettles at the Coach and Horses; I told him I would take him before a magistrate if he did not say what he had done with the parchment. He said he had left it with a friend in Smithfield; as we were going there, he attempted to escape. He then took me to his mother's, at Stepney, and asked her to lend him 10s. to get it from where he had left it; he tried again to escape. I gave him in charge.</p>

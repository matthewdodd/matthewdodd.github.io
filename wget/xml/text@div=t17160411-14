Mrs. Rhodes swore, That having and extraordinary Opinion of Mrs. Lewis's Honesty, she having an occasion to go out of Town, left a little Trunk with her, in which was the Goods aforesaid, and a hollow Sword-Blade-Company's Bond, believing it to be safest in her Possesion but upon her Return Mrs.Lewis met , her with a Dream she said she had had, in which she perceiv'd that her little Daughters, her Maid, and another Person, had taken out the Bottom of the Trunk, and robb'd her of her Money and Things; upon which she bid her fetch it down as she did, but went away before it was opened. There Mrs. Rhodes search'd and found the Money and not finding the Bond neither, at first, she would have sent away to stop the Payment; but Mrs. Lawin told her, she would find that, may be, and bid her look again for it: which she did and found it there. These were at least strong Presumptions against the Prisoners; who on their Part endeavoured to clear themselves by Insinuating to the Court, That Mrs. Rhodes was much inclined to Gaming and Extravagance and call'd some to prove it in Evidence, which upon, hearing no ways answered their Expection, but rather shwed, the Guilt of the Prisoners, and cleared, the Reputation of the Gentlewoman they accused. Then they proceeded to relate some Circumstances of a Jealousy and Dispute between Mrs. Rhodes and her Husband, to as Little Purpose; and at last submitted it to the Court; whether if they had been Guilty, the Money would not in some measure have shew itself and by some means or other been an Evidence against them; whereas there appears an Alteration in their Condition nor Reputation, which was well maintained by some Persons they called for that Purpose. Upon the whole, it was not prov'd that either Mr.Lewis did take the Money out of the Trunk, or his Wife, who denied she told Mrs. Rhodes of her dreaming of any Money, or that she said any thing of it before Justice and it being only a Posibbility (as the Jury concerv'd) that the Money might by some unknown Circumstance on Accident be either taken out of the Trunk while in the Prisoner's Possession<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171604110003"></xptr> without their Knowledge or by one of them without the Knowledge of the other, or before; they were both <rs id="t17160411-14-verdict67" type="verdictDescription">

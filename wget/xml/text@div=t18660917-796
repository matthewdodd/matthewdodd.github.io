                  </hi> (Policeman H 23). On the afternoon of 30th August I was on Tower Hill in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner, whom I did not know before, with another lad, attempting to pick three gentlemen's pockets who were standing in the crowd—the lad tried to cover him on each occasion—a man was selling some mock jewellery, and the prisoner went in front of a gentleman who was there, and the lad at his side—the prisoner clasped the gentleman's watchguard, and I saw the bow of a watch in his hand—I seized him, but the gentleman walked away—the prisoner was about nine minutes under my observation.</p>

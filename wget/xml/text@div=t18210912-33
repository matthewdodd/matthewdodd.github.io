On the 21st of July, I received information, and called on Mr. Rose, he took me to a house in Bread-street, which was under repair - I had nothing to do with that house; I found two pieces of Portland stone there, which are mine. I gave the prisoners no authority to move them off the premises. Hartley was my foreman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Hartley buy any stone of you - A. Never to my knowledge. My clerk is not here. He did not say so before the Magistrate, on the contrary, he said he bought it, and would prove it.</p>

            . On the morning of the 21st of July, I saw the prisoners coming out of the archway, leading from the bankrupts court, into Cateaton-street, each with one of the stones on his shoulder; they kept one behind the other - I followed them into King-street, Cheapside, down Bread-street, and losing sight of Hartley, I turned back, and saw Crosley coming down and go into a house, where we afterwards found both the stones, and immediately afterwards I saw them both together, within ten yards of the house, they had not got the stones then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you accompany Griffiths to that house - A. Yes. An hour or two after they were both apprehended at work.</p>

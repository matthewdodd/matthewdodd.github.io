I am one of the trustees of the East London District Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows—I live in Stamford Street, Vauxhall Bridge Road—the society holds its meetings at the Monster in St George's Road—it is a benefit society—the prisoner was secretary to the district lodge for many years up to 1ST November, when he absconded—this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. purports to be an order on the treasurer—it is dated 10th October, 1878, signed W. Cannon and T. Smith, for funeral allowance to the late Brother Humphreyson—I believe both the signatures to be the prisoner's writing—I do not know of any member named Humphreyson or Bird—there was a meeting of the funeral committee on 1ST November—the prisoner did not attend—these three cheques were produced on that occasion by the secretary <hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi>.—one of them is made payable to me for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the funeral expenses of Brother Bird—we never had such a brother—Cannon was the grand master, and his signature is supposed to be put to cheques for six months—I do not believe these signatures to be his—I believe it is the prisoner's writing.</p>

I live at 9, Douglas Place, Vauxhall Bridge Road—I am the Grand Master of the district of the Odd Fellows' Society—it was my duty to sign all the cheques for the funeral expenses during the six months of my term of office—I went into office at Midsummer—the signature W.

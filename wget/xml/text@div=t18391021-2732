               <p>the 1st of October, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was work<lb></lb>ing in master's garden, and saw some boys in an adjoining field belonging to my master—I went up to the top of our field, and said, What did you do over in this field?"—they said, We were not over in your field"—I said, "It is false; you pushed the gate open, I saw one of you in the field but I don't know which it was"—one of them was very saucy to me, and I got over the fence, and got hold of him—he threw himself down, and I bent down with him to pull him towards the fence—as soon as I did to, the prisoner, who stood by at the time, said, "If you don't let him go I will do for you"—he then up with the weapon whatever he had, and cut me across the head—I cannot say what instrument it was—my eyesight was taken away—I tried to get at him, but he jumped back—he was going to strike me again, but I held my hands up, and <hi rend="italic">fended</hi> the blow—I di<lb></lb>rectly turned over in a kind of <hi rend="italic">misty</hi> and staggering way, and the blood began to run—I could not work for three days, I was so giddy—my head was cut about two inches—Mr. Rees, a surgeon, saw me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at West Ham. On the morning of the 1st of October I was at work with some others, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Harris's, and saw four young lads come by—the prisoner was one—he had an instrument which appeared like a crow<lb></lb>bar, but whether it was or not I cannot say—about an hour afterwards I saw them come back again, running as hard as they could—the prisoner had the same thing in his hand—I said, "What have you been <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> now?"—he said, "Nothing but <hi rend="italic">skylarking"</hi>—a very few minutes after Gilbert came up, hallooing "Stop them, stop them"—his head was bleeding very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Stratford. I examined Gilbert on the 1st of October—there was a wound in the upper part of the head about two inches in length, which seemed to be inflicted by a blunt instrument—I do not think an iron hoop would be heavy enough to do it—I found him very weak from loss of blood—he was not in a condition to work for three or four days.</p>

I was coming across the fields, and met with these three lads—we went to the corner of the field—Gilbert spoke to one, and he said Eh" once or twice, as he was rather hard of hearing—he instantly caught hold of him—I asked what he was going to do with him, and di<lb></lb>rectly I spoke he swung his arm round, and caught me in the eye, and I then struck him with the hoop.</p>

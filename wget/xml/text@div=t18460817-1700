                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Butcher, of Cheynes-street, Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner was in my employ about two months—the last time was about six weeks ago—I employed her as a char-woman, to light the fire and clean the place—the last time she was there I missed a sovereign—shortly before her leaving I missed two shirts—I dis-charged my other servant because I thought she was dis<lb></lb>honest—the next time I saw the prisoner after she left, I went to ask her to come to cook a supper—she was in liquor, and her husband would not let her come—she ran away from her husband—on the 15th of Aug. I saw her—she said, "Mrs. Butcher, How do you do?"—I said, "Very well, you are the person I want"—she first seized me by the neck, she then let go her hold and ran up stairs—I followed her, and sent for a policeman, and gave her into custody-next day I searched her premises with the policeman—I found a shirt on her husband's back, marked with my husband's name—I found a coat hanging up which I had not missed, and a black scarf in a band-box, a fork, and a blanket on the bed—they are my husband's—I had not given the prisoner any of these things—this is the coat—these are my articlet.</p>

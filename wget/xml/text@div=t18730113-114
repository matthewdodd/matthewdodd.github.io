                  <hi rend="italic">(City Policeman 600)</hi>. About 6 o'clock in the evening of 26th February I saw a cart going away with some corn in it—it was driven by a man named Barker, going away from Trig Wharf, where Rathbone and Webber, and also Messrs. Gold &amp; Co., have premises; they divide the premises between them—I subsequently took Barker into custody, and Aslin, who was the person who had the control of the granary—they were both tried and convicted here—after taking Barker I went to Hyams—I found him in Messrs. Gold's stables; he was doing up the stables—I asked him if there was a man named Barker there—he said "Yes"—I asked him if he had given him any oats this afternoon to take to Messrs. Gold's—he said "No"—I asked was he aware that he took any oats—he said "No"—I told him that Barker was in custody for the unlawful possession of corn, and that Barker had told me he got it from him—he said he knew nothing about it—I never saw him after that—I don't remember saying anything to him about coming to the Mansion House—he did not come to the Mansion House—I was not able to find him afterwards—I went in search of him, but I never saw him again till he was taken into custody recently.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">(City Detective Sergeant)</hi>, On 28th February I went to Trig Wharf in company with the last witness and Mr. Rathbone—I examined the stables there—I went into the coach—house—there had been a padlock on the door, that had been undone before I got there—we entered and found about eighteen bushels of oats, peas, and tares in sacks, and a quantity of empty sacks, which Mr. Rathbone identified as his property they were marked—the key of the coach-house was not there—the door had been forced open—the stable adjoins Messrs. Rathbone's granary—there is a wooden partition between them in the loft, consisting of single boards—on examining them I found that a board had been sawn through, so that it could be removed and replaced, leaving an aperture big enough for a sack of corn or a man to pass through, and when that board was replaced there was some dirt and dust and cobwebs put over the crease, so as to conceal it—the corn was in Messrs. Rathbone's place, directly on the other side of that board—I had a warrant for the prisoner's apprehension, but I was unable to execute it—I could not find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nephew of Mr. Gold, one of the firm of Miles, Gold, Dunce, &amp; Co.—Barker was in the employ of that firm for some time, and the prisoner also—he was employed entirely in the static to cut chaff for the horses—he had the control of the coach-house, and kept the key—we always buy our corn of Messrs. Rathbone in bulk of fifty quarters and draw it weekly—we should only draw three quarters per week—it was kept immediately above our stable, next to Messrs. Rathbone's granary—it would not be put in the coach-house—the three quarters were consumed every week—I did not go to the coach-house myself—MR. Dunce did, and broke it open when Hyams absconded—he left suddenly without warning, and has not been there since.</p>

Gold's—they are part of the same premises—I knew the prisoner as being in Messrs. Miles, Gold, &amp; Co.'s—a boarding partition separates the granary from the loft—I went and examined the boarding and saw the oats, which I identified as our property—they are totally different to any corn which we supplied to Messrs. Miles—we had never supplied them with anything of that sort, or with tares or peas.</p>

It could not find its way there in that manner—I believe a window was broken at one time, and about five quarters ran out into the street, but not into the loft; that is some years ago, and had nothing to do with this. Thomas Franks (Policeman B 304). On 14th December I went to a shop at 3, Deadman's Lane, Plumstead, and saw the prisoner in the shop serving a female—after he had served her he said "I know what you want"—he took his coat off and asked his wife to give him another one—I told him the charge—he denied knowing anything about it—he said he was not present at the time it was transacted, and at Bow Lane Station he again denied the charge.</p>

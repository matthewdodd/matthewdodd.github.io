The prisoner took a furnished lodging of me on the 14th of November, at 7s. per week. He came between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and slept there. I got up between six and seven o'clock the next morning; he was then gone; it was hardly day-light; the articles mentioned in the indictment were gone; they were let to him with the lodging (produced and sworn to); the sheets were not quite finished. I was the last person up at night, and fastened the door. The windows were safe in the morning. I am sure the prisoner is the man; he called four or five times before he took the room. He said he had just come from the country, and referred me to a public-house. They could not say much about him; I took him more from his saying that he was a printer at the Star-office. I have since learned that it is false.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear to the blankets-A. I can; the sheets have my own mark in them. When I awoke it was dark; if he had gone down after I awoke I must have heard him.</p>
               <p>JANE SHIELDS. I lodge at the last witness's house, in the next room to that where the prisoner lodged. I heard him moving about, as though he was getting up, about five o'clock in the morning. I did not go to sleep again; I did not hear him go down stairs. As I was going out of my own room I observed his door open, I looked in and found the things gone, and I told Miss Whales of it. The street door was wide open. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I put the things on the bed the night before. There were two other lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>PATRICK CROWLEY. I am a watchman; I stopped the prisoner at a little after six o'clock in the morning, at the corner of Drake-street, Drury-lane; he was running from High Holborn; he had a bundle under his arm; he got off the pavement to pass me; I asked him what he had got; he said clothes, and that he brought them from Whitechapel Church; he said they belonged to his father. I took him into custody; he offered me half of them to let him go; we searched him at the watch-house, and found the sheets round his body.</p>

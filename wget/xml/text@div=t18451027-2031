                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in Leman-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner has been my shopman for the last ten years and had to carry samples round—he had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, his board, and perqui<lb></lb>sites—he had no authority, either as perquisites or otherwise, to take any cigars—I always thought him trustworthy, but never allowed him behind my counter, or to take anything without my knowledge—he was given into custody on a Tuesday, about three weeks ago—it was his duty to be at my shop every morning at half-past seven o'clock, to open it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am maid of all work to Mr. Raphael. The pri<lb></lb>soner did not sleep in the house—I saw him on his knees by the side of the large chest in which the cigars were kept, by the side of the shop door, one Monday morning, about a month ago—his right arm was in the box—I did not see what he did afterwards, or where he went to—I saw him again on the Tuesday morning, and again on the Wednesday, when my master called me up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 203.) On a Monday, about a month ago, I received information from Mr. Raphael—on the Tuesday I dressed myself in plain clothes, and watched Mr. Raphael's shop—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come there about half-past seven o'clock—I did not see him go away—I went again the following morning—I saw him go to the shop, and he came out again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I followed him—he sometimes walked fast, and sometimes ran, till he got to Jane-street, Stepney—he went to No. 6—the door was opened by a little boy, and the prisoner went inside—I then went to the door and was let in—I was going to the back part of the house—I saw the prisoner open the door and run out—I followed—he saw me following—I did not stop him—he ran very fast—while he was running I saw him put his hand into hit pocket, take his handkerchief out, and I saw him take some cigars out, and throw them down on the ground in the street—I did not pick them up—I continued to follow him, but I could not catch him—I was about thirty yards from him when I saw him throw the cigars down—I passed the place—I am certain what he threw away were cigars—I was acquainted with him before—I called to him and said, "Stop, I want you"—that was all I said.</p>

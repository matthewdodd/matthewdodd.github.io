             brought the paper in her hand, and gave it to Mr. May, in his own house. On Tuesday Mrs. Murt went to the prisoner, and asked her to fetch two in the street, and gave her a three shilling piece. The prisoner went, and I followed, and saw her go into Mrs. Phillip's house again; I saw Mr. Phillips deliver a paper to the prisoner; the prisoner came to Murt, and delivered the paper to her; Murt and I came home to my house; she gave my husband the paper at the White Horse public-house.</p>

On the 5th of September I was informed my house had been entered, but I was not there myself; I went to see how it had been entered - it was about two o'clock in the afternoon; I did not find any breach in the door or window, but the drawing-room window was open, and the dining-room door had been locked, but the key was in the door - I suppose they had opened that door; I missed four tureen covers, and two or three candlesticks and extinguishers - I had seen them safe the evening before; I believe these to be mine, from having had them a number of years, and my father's crest being on them.</p>

            . I am a saddler, and live at Tottenham. On the 5th of September I was in my shop- about one o'clock I saw a young man named Layox pass my door, whom I had taken up two years before; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner join him just opposite the public-house - they passed my house once or twice, and went into a cook's shop and bought something to eat; they then watched about, and went round to the back of the prosecutor's premises; I put on my coat and hat, and followed them - when they got to the bottom of the prosecutor's grounds they parted company; I went into a neighbour's, being certain that they intended something wrong - I should have stated, that when they first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110135"></xptr>joined company the prisoner put two or three pieces of sponge into the other's hand, that he might appear to be selling sponge; the prisoner himself had been offering some at my shop; when I got to my neighbours, I asked them to assist me, and we went up and saw the prisoner near the hedge - I went up to him, and saw his hat looked rather remarkable; I said, "What have you got here?" I took off his hat, and found this large nail in it - I said,"Where is your sponge?" he said, "I have got no sponge;" I said, "You have, here it is" - it was lying under the hedge; I then said, "Where is your companion?" he said, "I have no companion;" I said."Don't you know Layox?" - he said No; I said, "I will tell you how it is, he is at Mr. Powell's premises" - I gave him in charge, and went to the back of Mr. Powell's, and saw Layox come out; as soon as he saw me he put down this plate, and made his escape, as I was two fields off him - the prisoner, I suppose, was about two hundred yards from the premises; the prisoner was then taken and searched - I pursued Layox some distance, but I was not very well; I then went to Mr. Powell's and gave the alarm, and asked if they knew they had been robbed - I went up to the sideboard, and found these three pieces of sponge near it, which convinced me that they had belonged to the prisoner, because one of the pieces I had particularly noticed; I went to the watch-house and saw the prisoner searched, and these two keys were concealed at the bottom of his trousers.</p>

            . I am a constable of Tottenham. A man named Newsom brought the prisoner to me - I took him to the watch-house, and found these two latch-keys concealed at the bottom of his trousers: I asked what he did at the bottom of the field - he said he was picking up caterpillars, and his father was a bird-fancier.</p>
               <p>- STUKELY. Mr. Reynolds came to me, and we went and searched the premises; when I got near the green-house, I found this plate lying down under some scarlet-runners - I did not see the prisoner until he was at the watch-house; the way the person must have got in was - there was a chain and a rope on the gate at the bottom of the garden, the rope was cut and the chain forced, and then they must have come up the green, and got into the drawing-room window; I found this other large nail close by that place.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

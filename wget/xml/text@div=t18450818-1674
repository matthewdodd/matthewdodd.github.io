                  </hi>. I am a wax and tallow-chandler, and live in Craw-ford-street. The prisoner was my porter and carman—it was his duty to receive money on my account—on the 22rd of July I was in my shop—I had my ledger out, and it was headed "Frewin"—I asked the prisoner if lie knew that name—he said, "Yes"—I said I had got evidence that he had received money of Mrs. Frewin's butler—he said, "I have, and I hope you will forgive me"—I said he had been with me so long, and, in consequence of his wife and family, I did not wish to hurt him, bat I would sleep upon it.</p>

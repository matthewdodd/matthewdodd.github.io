                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 137). On 22nd Sept., about a quarter to 11 o'clock, I received from Mr. Huntley a counterfeit sovereign, marked with a cross on the head—I also received another counterfeit sovereign from John Golding, in Miss Warden's presence—I went with Fletcher to look for Welch; he was on the roof of the building, and I did not take him at first—I afterwards went to the King's Arms and made inquiry—I went round the building, and Welch was then on the ground—I asked him what he had had for breakfast; he said, "Some meat and pudding, the same as the other men"—I asked him where he had had breakfast; he said, "At the King's Arms"—I asked him if he had had a mutton chop for breakfast—he said, "No"—when he was at his dinner I took him into custody—I found Seers at the station at Kensington, and brought him from there on an omnibus—I searched him at the station and found on him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I searched Welch and found on him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—when I saw Welch at the building, he had no jacket or waistcoat on; when I saw him at dinner he had a jacket on, but no waist<lb></lb>coat—I gave him into the custody of another constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say that you took him for passing a coun<lb></lb>terfeit sovereign? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said, "It is not me, you are mistaken"—there were four or five workmen at the building; there may have been one near his height, but nothing like him—the witnesses were not quite certain at first, and I would not take him for an hour or an hour and a half.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go with Golding and Smith round the building? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; neither of them picked out any other man—the other men were carpenters and painters, and Welch is a bricklayer's labourer.</p>

                  </hi>. These two coins are bad, and from the, same mould—they are covered with gold, and are considerably less than the proper weight—they ought to have been detected at once.</p>

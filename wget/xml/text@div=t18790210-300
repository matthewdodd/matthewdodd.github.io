                  </hi>. I live at 45, Motley Street, and am an engine fitter—on the 11th January I saw my wife make up a letter contain<lb></lb>ing a piece of wedding-cake and a slip of paper, upon which my little hoy had written something—it was addressed, "Mrs. Shaw, 14, Douglas Street, Ormaston Road, Derby"—I identify that as the envelope, and these frag<lb></lb>ments pasted together on a piece of paper as the little boy's letter—his mother guided his hand—(<hi rend="italic">Reading</hi>: "Please Aunty lizzie send me some crayons")—my wife put one stamp upon it—I took it to Mr. Martin's, the post-office, 432, Wandsworth Road—at about a quarter to 5, I handed it to Mr. Martin, and on being weighed it was found to require another stamp—I bought the stamp of Mr. Martin and put it on and left the letter.</p>

I am assistant overseer at the South Lambeth Sorting Office—the prisoner was an auxiliary letter carrier attached to that office—it was his duty on the 11th January to bring the 4.45 collection from the Wandsworth receiving house—he brought it—after bringing it, it was his duty to face the letters ready for the stamper to obliterate the stamps—the dispatch of the letters was fixed for 5.40 p.m.—that is the stamp of our district—"C.X" indicates the 5.40 p.m. dispatch—that letter should have gone by that bag.</p>

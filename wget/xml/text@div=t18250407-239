            . I live at No. 3, Elder-walk, Islington. I know the prisoner. I met him by appointment on the 4th of March. I had seen Limbrick and Lloyd the preceding evening, after I had made the appointment with the prisoner: I received 15 s. from Limbrick, and had no other money about me: the next morning I saw the prisoner at the Pied Horse public-house, in Chiswell-street; he asked me what I wanted; I said two score - meaning what are called bobs - that is counterfeit shillings; he said if I would give him 12 s. he would go and get them: I gave him two half-crowns, four shillings and six sixpences; he told me to wait till he returned: he returned in about twenty minutes, and I asked if he had got them; he said Yes; and we came out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070088"></xptr>house together, and walked along Chiswell-street; as we went along he said to me</p>
               <p>"Have you got a shilling?" I said</p>
               <p>"All I have got is 3 1/2 d.;" he said he wanted to buy stuff to colour them, as they were too bright to pass; I gave him the 5 1/2 d., and walked with him to the corner of Carthusian-street: he then pulled out one of the counterfeit shillings, and said</p>
               <p>"When you see these again you will see them in a different state:" he then told me to call at the Cross Keys in Belton-street, between one and two o'clock and they should be ready for me; I went to the house about two o'clock, and saw him with some beer before him; I asked him if he had got them; he said Yes, and pulled them from a hat which he had between his legs; he produced two paper parcels which he said contained two score; he said I must give him 2 s. more for colouring them; I gave 1 s. 6 d. and was going to give him the half-penny - he said</p>
               <p>"Never mind the halfpenny;" I then went to see for Limbrick at Hatton-garden office, but I heard he was out of town and I did not see him till Monday, when I gave him the parcel.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. The last witness was employed by me, on behalf of the Mint - I had seen him on the evening before the 4th of March - I had frequently given him money, and I think on that occasion, I gave him 1 l. 5 s.; - I was sent to Bath on the Saturday, and returned on Sunday; I saw Elledge again on the Monday, and he delivered to me two parcels of bad money, which he marked in my presence; in consequence of the information which I got from him, I assisted Lloyd in apprehending the prisoner.</p>

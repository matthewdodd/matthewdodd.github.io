                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the refreshment rooms at Charing Cross Station—I was at the bar taking cash, but not where I could see the prisoner—the last witness handed me a bad crown—I went for a detective, marked it, and gave it to him—he went round to the bar, and I went through the Restaurant to the bar, and asked the prisoner if he had given a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece to pay for what he had had—he said, "Yes"—Toby showed it to him, and said, "Is this the one you gave her"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "It is a bad one"—he said, "Is it? I was not aware of it"—I said, "Have you got any more"—he said, "No"—he took out his purse and gave the barmaid a half-sovereign—I told her to give him change—I said, "From whom did you take it"—he said, "From Mr. Jones, a commercial traveller, who has now gone into the country, and I do not know where to find him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable employed at the Charing Cross Hotel—on 26th October Mr. Pigott sent for me—I went one way to the bar and he went the other—I said to the prisoner, "Do you know you have passed this bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece"—he said, "I did not know it was bad"—he wanted me to give it to him, but I gave it to Mr. Pigott—the barmaid said, "You have not paid for the brandy"—he asked the price—she said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered a half-sovereign and she gave him the change—I was not satisfied that he knew it was bad—I went into Villiers-street, and saw Inspector Brannan, and took him with me—we found the prisoner in a coffee-shop in Duke-street—we fetched him out and took him back again—we searched him, but not very carefully, and, in Villiers-street, I saw that he had something in his mouth; I could see the edge of some coins, and found it was three shillings—I seized him by the throat; but we were obliged to let him go, or he would have been strangled, and he swallowed what he had—MR. Pigott charged him—we went to the station, and I found on him 9<hi rend="italic">a.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I believe a doctor was sent for after I was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not he searched at the Charing Cross establish<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but at the public-house bar we looked into his pockets, though not very carefully—I searched him in Brannan's presence—I joined the police in '57, and am a reserve man—I am employed by the Charing Cross Railway Company—persons were passing by when he put his band to his mouth in Villiers-street—I seized him at once—he went from the Charing Cross bar down Villiers-street, between Brannan and me"; but I was not to take him in charge, if he had not put money into his mouth—he was not in custody then—he was confined in a private cell to see whether he had swallowed coin; but bad money will dissolve—I do not know whether his evacuations were examined—I mentioned the act of swallowing to Sergeant Tompson, who took the charge.</p>

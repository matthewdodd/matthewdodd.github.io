On the 13th of March the prisoner came out of the country, and slept at my house that night - I knew him before. He said he was a stranger in London. I gave him a supper, and leave to sleep with my little boy that night. In the morning when I called him to breakfast, he was either asleep, or pretended to be so. After breakfast I gave my wife a 10l. note, she returned it to me, I then gave her a 1l. note, and put the 10l. note into a box in the room where we were - I did not lock it. I went to work, leaving him in bed in the room, and the next day I missed it. I received information, and found him at Hampstead - I told him he was my prisoner - He said he knew it. He told the constable, before me, that he took the note - We had neither promised or threatened him; I only found 10s. on him. I have never recovered the note.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner. He said he had the note - He was rather intoxicated. About two hours after I went to the watch-house to him, and asked him what he did with the money? he said he had had some bad girls with him, and he believed they had it; he was then sober. He knew what he said when. I first took him.</p>

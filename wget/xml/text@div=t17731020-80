            . I did draw such a bill in favour of Mr. Howell upon Mr. Hill; the bill was not paid, and consequently was returned me by Mr. Howell, with the indorsement upon it. I know Mr. Chilton; I have employed him in other business; I went to Mr. Chilton with it, and asked him to settle a little note for me; I spoke of it to him; I said it would be attended with expence, but I could not put myself to expence; Chilton said if I would deliver it into his hands it should cost me nothing. At the same time gave him the bill; I do not know that I ever gave him any authority; I always understood that Mr. Howell was the person beneficially interested in the note, though I knew Chilton was carrying on the suit; I always thought it was carrying on for me; I enquired about it; Chilton asked me for money, and Chilton got two shirts from me in discharge of this bill. After there had been some conversation between us, I offered to pay Chilton two guineas, and advised him against putting the note in suit against Mr. Howell; I told him Mr. Howell would prosecute him if he did it; I said it was wrong to think of Howell as paymaster, and then made a proposal that the note and judgment should be delivered up, and then the indictment should be set aside; that if he could have an effectual remedy upon Hill, then I undertook that the indictment should be suspended.</p>
               <p>There was a paper shewn the witness, written by the defendant, and signed by the witness, containing an authority from him to the defendant to put the note in suit. The witness acknowledged the signing to be his hand writing, but denied a knowledge of the contents; he said the defendant desired him to sign it, as something necessary by way of form, but that he never read it, and was totally ignorant of the contents.</p>

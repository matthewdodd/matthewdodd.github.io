                  </hi>. I live at 2, Crown Street, Soho, and am the father of Elizabeth Fry—she was born, I believe, on 10th December, and as near as I can recollect, she will be 18 next Christmas—I had a memorandum, but it was destroyed at a fire at my house—she worked at a cigar manufactory, in Oxford Street, at which the prisoner worked—from information I re<lb></lb>ceived I went there, and told the prisoner that I understood he was going after my daughter, and if he did not leave her alone I should take him before a Magistrate, and I removed her from the factory—on 2nd July, she was living at my house, and I was not aware of her intended marriage with the prisoner—I have been to Broomhead Street, Stepney—the highest number there is 41, on one side, and 21 on the other.</p>

I am parish clerk of Stepney—I produce the register-book of marriages for that district—on 2nd July I find a marriage purporting to be solemnized between Samuel Moss and Bloomer Fry—I received from my wife the notice-book for the publication of banns—this writing in the register book is not mine, but the Clergyman's—I saw him write it—he wrote it from the certificate which I made up from the prisoner's instructions—I mean to say that I make up a draft for the Parson to copy.</p>

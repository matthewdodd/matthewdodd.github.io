               <p>On the first of August, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner Vandebus come out of Mr. Seabrook's yard with a bundle in a blue apron, and part of a green skirt hanging out; when he came out, Gregory joined him.</p>
               <p>Which is he? - That young man with the handkerchief round his head; and the two boys followed at a distance.</p>
               <p>Where were they when you saw them first? - Gregory and Everard stood on one side of the house, about five yards distance from each other.</p>
               <p>Where was Bolton? - He came from Mr. Bingham's shop, which is about 20 yards beyond Mr. Seabrook's, they went up Mill Hill?</p>
               <p>Altogether? - No; Gregory and Bond joined together, and the two boys were at a distance behind.</p>
               <p>Did they run? - No, they walked; I informed Mr. Seabrook's daughter of what I had seen, she was at Mr. Franklin's shop, about a quarter of a mile from home, I went home to my mistress, and the girl followed the men.</p>
               <p>Look at those four prisoners; are you sure they are the men you saw there? - Yes.</p>

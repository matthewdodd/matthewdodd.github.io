On the 11th of August I lost the duplicate of a pair of trousers, and a pair of earrings out of this box; the prisoner had been in the habit of coming there, but on that Saturday he came with two other persons to have his bill made out. I had seen the articles on the mantel-piece before he came in, and on the Monday they were gone.</p>

            . I know these trousers; I had taken them from Mrs. Gager, and had lent her 3s. on them- I do not know who it was took them out of pawn, but my young man, who has now left me, swore at the Police-office, in the prisoner's presence, that he was the man - the prisoner denied it.</p>

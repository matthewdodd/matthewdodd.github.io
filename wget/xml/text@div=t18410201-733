                  </hi>. I keep a hair-dresser's shop in St. Cle<lb></lb>ment's Danes, opposite the church. On Sunday night, the 10th of Ja<lb></lb>nuary, I left the shop—I only rent the shop—it is Mr. Wyatt's house—there are several lodgers—I fastened up my shop about half-past six o'clock, and locked the shop-door—next morning, about half-past seven, I went there again—I found the door locked, but on unlocking it I found all the articles stated gone—they had hung on the door—I received information from Mr. Wyatt, and afterwards saw the waistcoat now produced—it is one of those I left in the shop—it was on a rail when I left it, not on the floor—there was another waistcoat on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, who keeps the Sun public-house in Clement's-inn, foregate. On Sunday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, I observed seven or eight persons drinking at the bar—my attention was directed to them particularly—two or three left together, then returned again, and then they went away, leaving one behind—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something I heard, I went out to Mr. Ptarse's after the last one left the bar—I saw the shop-door on the jar—I ran to the door and laid hold of the handle, and as I pulled from the outside, I fancied somebody was pulling from the inside—I kept my hold about five minutes—Slade, a policeman, came—I told him to hold the door while I got assistance—we afterwards went in, and found the prisoner in the shop—he was one of those who had been drinking in my house—next morning I saw a crow-bar produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were the men drinking there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly ten minutes, I think—two went out, and then three, at a time, and returned again—nearly ten minutes elapsed between their coming in and going out together—directly the last one left, I went to Mr. Pearse's—I saw the other parties standing on the opposite side of the way, peeping round at me—they were persons who had been in my house—they stood over there the whole time I had the door in my hand—the prisoner said he had found the door open, and went in to be shaved—he did not say so at first—he did after he was remanded to Bow-street—he said nothing till the policeman spoke to him, and then he said, "I came in to be shaved"—I never said that when he was taken he said be found the door open and went in to be shaved, nor any thing of the sort—there was no light in the shop when I first went in—nothing was found on him to get one with—I got one.</p>

               <p>morning from Wyatt—I compared it with the door of the shop, and it fits exactly the marks on the door-post and the door—it was a very deep impression on the door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was the crow-bar applied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To force the door open—I do not think there would be much trouble to do it—when I first went into the shop I asked the prisoner what brought him there—he said he came in to get shaved—I do not recollect his saying that be saw the door open, and called in to get shaved—I recollect hit saying he came in to get shaved—that was the first answer he gave—he said before the Magistrate that he found the door open, and called in to get shaved, and he said he was drunk, but he was not—he did not say in the shop, that as he was passing by he saw the door open—I swear that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his de<lb></lb>position</hi>)—this is my signature.</p>

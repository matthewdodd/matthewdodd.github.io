                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, and a Director of the Deposit and General Life Assurance Company—that Company was esta<lb></lb>blished in the year 1851, I think, but we did not do business before the summer of 1852—the prisoner was appointed secretary to the Company about Aug., 1852, at a salary of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I frequently attended the meetings of the Board, as frequently as I possibly could—it was the pri<lb></lb>soner's duty always to attend the Board—if he stated that money was required to pay any particular account, the course was for him to prepare a cheque, which was signed by the Board, and given to him to countersign, and give to the party to whom it was to be paid—up to July, 1854, we had no doubt whatever as to the prisoner's honesty—we signed cheques upon his statement that they were required—we did not rely upon his statement; he produced accounts showing that such cheques were required—the course of business is this: there is a committee of Directors, called the General Purposes Committee; that committee met the day before the Board; the secretary laid before the committee any accounts for which he required payments; if they were approved by the committee, the cheques were prepared ready for the Board the following day, and were generally signed by the Board without much discussion at the Board; when signed,</p>

               <p>they were given to the secretary for his counter signature, and to be given to the parties—we had two bankers, Messrs. Hopkinson and the Com<lb></lb>mercial Bank—the prisoner's private banker was the London and County Bank—until the examination before the Alderman, I had no knowledge whatever of the minute about paying money in to his own banker's—that minute was on 15th Sept., 1853, during the long vacation, so that I was pro<lb></lb>bably out of town at the time—on 22nd July, 1854, circumstances had come to my knowledge which led me to believe that certain cheques which he had had, had not gone in the course intended—spoke to the prisoner about those cheques, and one other cheque for 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which should have gone to Birmingham—the result of it was this, that I saw there had been some great irregularity in the matter, and I wrote, or caused to be written, a letter to the Company for whom those cheques were intended, and told him that if the reply to that letter should be of the character I expected, and which would show that the cheques had not been properly appro<lb></lb>priated, I should feel it my duty to propose his dismissal, unless he rendered it unnecessary by resigning—he ultimately threw himself upon our mercy, and resigned—he gave in a written resignation—at that time I was not aware that he had done other than appropriated our money; I knew of nothing wrong but those particular transactions which I alluded to there—I did not in the least suspect him of dishonesty at that time; I thought it was mere irregularity; I thought he had done wrong, but I never suspected his honesty—I thought, in fact, that he had temporarily used our cheque with the intention of repaying it, without retaining it—his wife and family resided in the upper part of the house—he was allowed to remain on the premises for some little time—I have no recollection of a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being given to him—I know nothing personally about the cheques in question, unless it should appear by the minutes that I was present when they were signed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) this is the prisoners handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">this letter was from Bevan to Thomas, dated July</hi> 1, 1854, <hi rend="italic">in which the following passage occurred</hi>:—"Dr. Crocker will have a cheque next week for his fees without fail")</p>

               <p>particular statement of the income of the Company being upwards of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe there has been some such statement (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this is one of our reports—I believed it was true according to the books—Mr. Bevan has been publicly thanked by the Directors for his exertions—it was his duty to make excursions to provincial towns when he was sent, to establish branches—on those journeys considerable expenses were incurred, which were always paid to him by us on his return—I do not believe he used constantly to advance money for those purposes—he had a cheque before he went if he wanted it—I do not believe that in repeated instances he has not been paid amounts of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until he returned—I think we have now eight Directors—I have seen three Directors here to-day besides myself—they all take an active part in the Company—no one always attends, but all attend—Mr. Knox, the accountant, is a cousin of Mr. Knox, the Director—he went into the matter with the prisoner by the direction of the Board; that was in July or Aug., very soon after Mr. Bevan was dismissed—I believe after he left our Company, he became Secretary to another Company; the Universal Provident—I do not think he was Secretary to that Company at the time we got a warrant for his apprehension—I remember observing that his name disappeared from the Company's advertisements, and I attributed it to the fact of his going through the Insolvent Court—he had been Secretary, I think, not for so long as six months—I do not know when he became Secretary; his name first appeared as a Director—we never communicated his defalcations to that Company—they never made any inquiry of us—Mr. Neison, our Actuary, did not give him a character, to my knowledge—I thought it a most remarkable thing that no application was made to us—I did not know that the prisoner was constantly in the habit of paying cheques that were drawn by the Board into his own banker's, and drawing cheques on his own bankers for the purposes of the Company—I had not the slightest suspicion of it, until a bundle of cheques were put into my hands at the examination at Guildhall—Mr. Knox, the accountant, has since investigated the prisoner's banking account, and I have seen the results; I have not a copy of it—those investigations have been rendered necessary in consequence of what occurred at Guildhall; I believe it was in consequence of the cheques you put into my hand—I have on one occasion been paid my fees as a Director by a cheque of the prisoner's—a cheque was drawn for a larger amount—I do not know that he paid that cheque into his banker's; he gave me a cheque of his own for my fees; I took it—I think it is very probable that other Directors did the same—I was a member of the Finance Committee—I did not audit the accounts; they were audited by the Auditors—the accounts were only audited periodically; once a year, I think—I do not think the number of cheques issued was examined with the vouchers—the cash book is here—the banker's pass book was produced at each meeting, for the purpose of seeing what the balance at our bankers was—Mr. Barnes was Chairman of the Finance Committee—I do not think he invariably signed the cash book, "Examined, and found correct"—I did not trouble my head upon that particular point—we had the banker's book before us, to see what he had received and paid during the month—we sat once a month—if a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to pay an individual, at the proper time for auditing the accounts the voucher would be forthcoming, or would be inquired for; we do not want vouchers every week—we did not leave he distribution of all the cheques we gave, entirely to the discretion and judgment of the prisoner—if a cheque was drawn for A, it was given to</p>

               <p>him to pay to A—the expression which the prisoner used at the interview in July was, "I admit there have been great irregularities in that particular transaction, "not" in the accounts"—it referred to the transactions with the Home Counties' Assurance Company—he did not say that he might have been guilty of irregularity in the accounts, but he never had any intention of defrauding the Company—he said there had been irregu<lb></lb>larity in the particular transaction, but he had no intention of defrauding the Company, and I believed him at the time—I was most reluctant to think him dishonest—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is Mr. Poole's writing; he is a Director—I did not see it, or know of its being written, at the time—I never saw it before—I know nothing about it—all letters written by the Company are, or ought to be, copied into a letter book—if Mr. Poole, a Director, had written a letter by the authority of the Company, it would appear in the letter book in the ordinary course—I should presume from this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) that the cheque for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was discovered in Aug.—I know that Mr. Bevan has gone to Birmingham, and limerick, and Dublin, on the business of the Company, but I cannot say at what date—I do not know that on that occasion no money was paid to him for his expenses until he returned—he has never to my knowledge drawn cheques upon his own bankers for his expenses, and been reimbursed by the Company—a good deal of the business was necessarily left in the prisoner's hands—the Board only met once a week, and business must be attended to—I frequently found fault with him for extravagance in his expenses—I remember a dinner being given by the Company; it was very much against my will—I do not think it cost upwards of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it cost a great deal more than it ought, but it is only fair to say that it was done at the prisoner's instigation—I dined there—I think it was a mistake, that is all I say about it—I did not know of any cheque drawn by the prisoner on his own account for expenses at Dublin—I am sure he never drew any by our authority—we opposed Mr. Bevan in the Insolvent Court—I have been told that his petition was defeated on the ground that he had not properly described himself—I was not present—I think we first consulted Mr. Hobler about Aug. or Sept. last year—I have no knowledge of any applica<lb></lb>tion being made by Mr. Knox to the prisoner, that he should put an advertisement in the paper, stating that the sole cause of his resignation was his having obtained a superior appointment—I have heard of it—Mr. Knox had communication with him, to my knowledge, and with the know<lb></lb>ledge of the Board—Mr. Knox knew something of Mr. Bevan's family—I do not think that the furniture which the prisoner left behind was worth much—a cheque was given to him upon his representation that he had not a penny to go away with; and we allowed Mrs. Bevan to take away her piano, and anything that she said was hers—I believe she is a lady of the highest respectability—she has been living with her father; he is a person of respectability and means—the only transaction between Mr. Neison and Mr. Bevan that I knew of, was the one which I told you of on the former occasion, the prisoner stated to us that Mr. Neison owed him money, and he gave us an order upon Mr. Neison for 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he said Mr. Neison owed him—when he left he said he was anxious to make all the reparation in his power, and admitting he owed us a great deal of money, he gave us among other things an order on Mr. Neison to pay us a certain sum of money, which he said he owed him—I know nothing of the prisoner advancing money to Mr. Coode, a Director, except from his own statement—he said so; I have not made inquiries as to the truth of it—I do not</p>

               <p>know whether Mr. Coode is here—he ceased to be a Director long before Mr. Bevan resigned—immediately after the prisoner passed through the Insolvent Court, he brought an action against the Company for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I believe he issued a writ on the very day he was discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bo you know that instructions were given to oppose Mr. Bevan in the Insolvent Court on the ground of fraud? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—at the time the prisoner gave the order on Mr. Neison, he did not say anything about any travelling expenses that we owed him—at the time he threw himself on our mercy, he did not say a single syllable about travelling ex<lb></lb>penses; I believe it was entirely an after thought—I never heard of it until some months afterwards, when he brought in that statement to Mr. Knox—there was only one instance in which my fees were paid by the pri<lb></lb>soner's cheque; one large cheque was drawn for the fees of the Directors in the aggregate—I have reason to believe that the prisoner paid that cheque into his banker's, and subdivided it, and gave his own cheques—I think the cheque given to me was in Nov., 1853—1 know it was given to me when I paid my premium; I gave him my cheque, and took his—I have been told that the larger cheque was drawn in June, 1853; I do not know the—we discovered that the date of the receipt for the 207<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was very consider<lb></lb>ably subsequent to the date of the cheque, and that the cheque itself had gone in a channel in which it ought not to have gone in the ordinary way—I did not know that that cheque had been appropriated towards the prisoner's purposes, and that the subsequent payment was by a cheque of ours; I can<lb></lb>not tell when it was I learnt that; it was afterwards, when the agents account came in; it might have been two or three months afterwards—the other two charges related to the Home Counties—I found there were irre<lb></lb>gularities with regard to them on 22nd July; we found then that they had been misappropriated—the cheques for the Home Counties were drawn to pay money that was due to them, and we found out in July that those cheques had gone away, and we had not the receipts—I found that subsequently money had been paid to the Home Counties, to the amount of those cheques—the accounts were made up from the books, as they were presented by Mr. Bevan—there was no other means of judging of the accuracy of the accounts, except by comparing the books with the vouchers—if an account appeared in the book showing a certain amount due to Dr. Crocker, and a receipt was produced for that precise sum; it would, of course, be taken that they balanced one another—we have no means of testing the truth, except by writing to every individual; the receipt is a sufficient voucher—from the production of the receipt the Auditor would believe that the amount had been paid—we should have no means of discovering any fraud, unless we suspected anything—there was no suspicion at the time these accounts were audited.</p>

               <p>with the Board to prevent any criminal proceedings being taken against him—I told him that I felt certain if we did so, he would go on in the same reckless way he had done since he sent in his resignation, to injure the Com<lb></lb>pany—he assured me that he would not do so, and in order to make that assurance more certain, he signed on the second occasion a document in which he admitted his appropriation of the moneys of the Company; and stated, I think, that he would make good the deficiencies whenever he could, or, so soon as he could—that was on the assurance that all the defalcations were then known, and in fact appeared on the face of the cash book itself, with the exception of a few additional items that were not in the cash book; and upon the assurance that there were no deficiencies connected with our agencies, and further that he would do nothing to injure the Company—I said that if I found there were other defalcations than those that were known, or if he attempted to take our agents, or injure the Company in any way, I should consider my pledge not to use the document free; within a week afterwards an advertisement appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, signed by Mr. Bevan, which evidently was intended to injure the Company in my view of it; the reading of it to me at all events was, that he had left the Company for some reason connected with the Company, not connected with himself—I told his wife that I felt free from the engagement I had given to Mr. Bevan, and that I should certainly now advise the Company to take pro<lb></lb>eeedings against him—in consequence of that he called upon me again, and Assured me that the advertisement was not so intended, and stated that he would put in an advertisement that would remove that effect from the leading of it, and upon that occasion I did sketch out an advertisement for him to insert in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, merely stating that having obtained a superior appointment, he had resigned his situation to the Deposit Com<lb></lb>pany—it did not state that he had left for no other cause—I stated this at the last trial—I have not got the advertisement here.</p>

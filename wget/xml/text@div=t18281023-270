            , ESQ. I am a partner in the house of Sir William Curtis and Co., <rs id="t18281023-270-viclabel1573" type="occupation">bankers</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18281023-270-victim1446 t18281023-270-viclabel1573"></join>, of Lombard-street, City; the firm consists of Sir William Curtis, his son, and myself. In the course of last year and the present, the house of Dickson and Co. were customers of ours- I believe they resided in Ironmonger-lane; the firm consisted of the prisoner and John Dickson - the firm stood in our books in the name of John Dickson and Co.; we were in the habit of frequently receiving bills from them, for the purpose of being discounted; the prisoner exclusively carried on the financial department of the firm, at least as far as we were concerned; he frequently came to our banking-house with bills. On the 1st of September, he brought several bills, and brought this list with them - (looking at it) - there is some cash entered at the bottom of the list, but that did not come into my hands - this is a list of bills which were offered for discount; it is in the prisoner's handwriting - I saw him myself that day; I looked at the total amount at the bottom of the list, and ran over the bills - they corresponded.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a bill of exchange in your hand, was that among the number of bills brought by the prisoner on the 1st of September? A. It was, and it corresponds with the entry on the list - it agrees in the sum, the names of the drawer and acceptor, and where payable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner on that occasion? A. I can only recollect observing to the prisoner on that occasion, as well as on every other, when he brought bills to be discounted; I always expressed my very great objection to discount them - I perfectly recollect objecting to discount them on this particular occasion; he invariably made a reply, and on this occasion he told me, distinctly, that they were all bona fide legitimate commercial transactions, and upon that representation I discounted them; after having received them from him, I wrapped them up in this list, and took them into the discount-office, and put them into a box there - they would then be taken from that box, and entered by Mr. Thomas Brackett, the discount clerk, in a book kept exclusively for that purpose; it was then the practice for Mr. Brackett to put them under a lead on his desk - they would then be taken from there by Mr. Clunie, another clerk, who keeps the bill-book.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time after the 1st of September did you decline to discount any further for the firm of Dickson and Co.? A. Certainly; it was either on the Wednesday or Thursday prior to the date on which I received a letter from him - this is the letter (looking at it); I had told him distinctly I would discount no more for him; this letter is in the prisoner's hand-writing, and bears the Deal post-mark - it is dated the 27th of September, 1828; I received it on the Monday morning - I am certain it was on the Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230111"></xptr>following the day I had declined discounting further for them; it was addressed to A. W. Robarts, Esq., M.P., 15. Lombard-street, London - it is above number, and of course the postage is charged [the letter being read was the same as was given in evidence on the former case, Page 995] - previous to the receipt of this letter I found, on coming to town on that Monday morning, his partner, Mr. Dickson, at our house - I immediately looked out the different bills, that they might be submitted to his inspection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you happen to known in whose handwriting the body of this bill is? A. I do; it is the prisoner's - and the signature, J. Dickson and Co. is his; I have no knowledge whatever of R. Luck.</p>

            . I am clerk to Sir Wm. Curtis and Co. bankers, of Lombard-street. My department is in the discount-office - on the 1st of September I took from the box in the discount-office the bills and papers, and entered the bills in the discount book (producing it) - I found this list of bills in the box; I have written on it "1st Sept. Bills" - that is my hand-writing; I accurately entered all these bills in the discount-book - the entry corresponds with the particulars of the bills in this list - they are placed to the credit of John Dickson and Co. in this book; and at the same time I debited them for the discount - among the bills entered is one corresponding with the one produced(reads) "1st Sept. J. Dickson and Co. 94l. 13. on Luck, due 26th December" - that entry corresponds both with the bill and the list; the discount is charged for the whole amount of bills together - it was Mr. Clunie's business to enter the bills in the bill-book, and for that purpose I place them on the desk under a lead.</p>
               <p>The item from the list being read was as follows: "Dickson and Co. Luck, Spur Inn, 26 Dec. 94l. 13s." the total amount of bills was Â£1636 3s. 2d.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the banking-house of Sir William Curtis and Co. It was my duty in September last to enter in the bill-book bills which had been discounted, and had gone through Mr. Brackett's hands - on the 1st of September I took a number of bills from his desk, in the regular course of business; I have not entered the gross amount of the bills in the name of J. Dickson and Co. - I have an entry on that day, in my own hand-writing, of the bills corresponding with this list; the entry was made at the time, and is headed "J. Dickson and Co., September 1st (reads) "Luck, August 23d, four months, due December 26th, 94l. 13s.," and the letter D is put against it for discount; and on the bill itself I have written D 589," meaning the folio in book D where it is entered; the entry on the bill, and in the book were made on the same day, on the same occasion - I have no recollection of this identical bill, except from this entry; there is no other bill of the same amount, or at all corresponding with this entry - that enables me to say it is one of the bills I entered in the book that day.</p>

On the 1st of September, and previous to that time, I was in partnership with the prisoner - he managed the money concerns of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill, and state in whose hand-writing the body and drawing of it is A. The prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bill-book kept by the prisoner? A. We had a book called a bill-receivable book, into which all regular trade bills were entered - I have examined that book, to ascertain whether this bill is entered; there is no memorandum of it in that book - I have examined it attentively, and think I can swear no such bill is entered; I have not the book here - we had a correspondent named Richard or Robert Luck; he resided at East Peckam, Kent - he was indebted to us, but I think not to the amount of this bill - the list of bills produced is in the prisoner's hand-writing; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. Are you acquainted with Luck's handwriting. A. No; I do not know whose hand-writing the acceptance of the bill is.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LUCK. I live at East Peckham, Kent; I am in the general line, a <rs id="t18281023-270-viclabel1576" type="occupation">grocer</rs>

               <p>COURT Q. What is the name of the parish in which the other Luck lives? A. Yalding, and there is a Luck at Teaton, which is four miles from here; I believe he is in the general line as well - he is father of the Luck of Yalding.</p>

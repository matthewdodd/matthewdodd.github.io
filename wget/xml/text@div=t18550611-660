                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On Monday, 28th May, I was with Hinch<lb></lb>lift, another constable, in plain clothes, and saw a waggon belonging to Smith and Sons in charge of Wisby and Low, coming from Deptford towards London, empty—it came up about 20 minutes past 5 o'clock, and was drawn up between the watering trough and the shed—I saw the horses stop, and Low went to the side of the waggon and unhooked two nosebags, and took them into the shed where Abel was—Low went to the outer shed first, and put down the nosebags, Abel then unlocked the door of the inner shed, and took them in—they were full—Wisby unhooked the other two nosebags, and gave them to Low, who carried them into the inner shed—he went through the doorway, and I lost sight of them—Low came out of the door<lb></lb>way, it may be a minute afterwards, with four nosebags empty—Wisby then watered the horses, and put the nosebags on them—Abel came from the shed towards the waggon, and I saw him put hid hand into his pocket and give something to Wisby; it was impossible to see what, as the one hand went into the other—Low and Wisby then went across the road to the China Hall public house—I afterwards saw the waggon drive away to<lb></lb>wards London—after Verrall's waggon came up, we followed them, but did not take them into custody then, because there was another waggon there—I took them the same evening at Messrs. Smith's.</p>

               <p>unlocked the door, and took the two nosebags into the inner shed—Low returned to Wisby, who unhooked two other nosebags from underneath and gave them to Low, who went with them into the shed—Abel then returned with four empty nosebags, and I saw them put on to the horses—a short time afterwards Abel came out of the shed, put his hand into his pocket, and put it into Wisby's hand—about half an hour after the waggon had driven away; I went to the inner shed, and took charge of some mixture—I searched it, and found one piece of brown paper in it marked—I have not got it.</p>

               <p>between six and seven o'clock on the 28th of July at the waterside, Dept-ford—I saw two boats leave the Kent shore and come over to the Middle<lb></lb>sex shore—Parker and Greaney were in one boat, a man named Robinson and another in the other—when they arrived at the Middlesex shore Parker got out, took a basket with him, and went up the slip at the Millwall Iron Works—he returned with something in the basket and shot it in the boat—he went up the slip again and returned with something in the basket, which he put in the boat, and then jumped in himself—Greaney remained in the boat all the time—they then returned to the Kent side—about five minutes afterwards I saw the prisoners with two others carrying bags up the water-gate—I followed them up Butcher Road, where I tapped Sissons on the shoulder, and said, "Hullo! Jack, what have you got here?" He said, "Some iron that has been dredged up." I said, "Let me look at it"—he then slipped the bag off his shoulder and tried to make his escape—he kicked at me twice in the private parts—we had a scuffle, when assistance came, and he was taken to the station—the others got away—the bag contained plates like these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the following Monday I apprehended Parker—I told him he would be charged as con<lb></lb>cerned with others in stealing a quantity of iron from the Millwall Iron Works on Saturday—he said, "I know nothing about the iron; I was not there"—on Wednesday evening I apprehended Greaney, and told him that he would be charged for being concerned with others in stealing iron from the Millwall Iron Works—he said, "I was in the boat with Parker"—I had known Parker before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what state was the tide? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly low water—I kept the boat containing Parker and Greaney in view the whole time until it returned—when Parker went up the slip he went out of sight—I do not know where he got the iron from—Sissons was at the shore when the boat returned—I am not aware that iron such as I have produced is frequently dredged up out of the river.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Crofield Lane, Deptford, and am a watch<lb></lb>man at the General Steam Navigation Company's premises, Deptford—on the evening of the 28th July I saw two boats leave the water-gate on the Kent shore—they went over to the Millwall Iron Works—Parker and Greaney were in one boat—I had previously seen Sissons with them—when they got to the Middlesex side Parker got out of the boat and went up the slip—he took a basket with him and brought something back in it—they returned to the Kent shore, and Sissons helped to unload the boat—the tide was going down very fast.</p>

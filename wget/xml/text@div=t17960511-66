               <p>I am a trunk and box-maker, foreman to Messrs. Merrimans; the last witness informed me the prisoner had got some nails in his pocket; I went into the yard, and stopped him, and found the nails in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way out of the house? - A. Yes; from the place where he was at work; I desired him to walk up stairs into the workshop, and desired the prisoner to take them out of his pocket on to a bench; I left him with Bennet, and went to my master in the adjoining premisses; I did not see him take them out of his pocket, I saw them in his pocket in the yard; I fetched my master, and he said he hoped he would shew him mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he no occasion for these nails in his business? - A. Not that part of his business, they use wire in boxes; and these were larger nails than he had any occasion for; a constable was sent for, and he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to dinner, and one of the men holloaed to me to bring down some nails for the packing-cases; I don't know which of the men it was.</p>

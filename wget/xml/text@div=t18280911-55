On the 6th of September I was taken very ill with a pain in my side, and went to lay down - my two grandchildren were with me; I had taken a glass of liquor, and ordered a person to lock the room door; I laid down between four and five o'clock, and continued on the bed till dusk, when I was alarmed by a little boy crying - I found my box broken open, and my money all gone; it stood close to my bed-side - I lost 18s. 6d. out of it, and a handkerchief; it was all safe when I went to bed, and the box locked - I saw nobody in the room; I cannot tell how they got into my room - the prisoner has lived with a daughter of mine these four years - she is a very bad girl, and I never suffer her to come to my room; I never suffered the prisoner to come into my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had some chairs in her room, and frequently went up there.</p>

            . I am eight years old - I remember my grandmother going to bed ill in the afternoon; the prisoner came to the door, and opened it with great force; it was fastened before - when he got in, he took a white handkerchief out of my grandmother's box - he broke it open in a moment; I do not know what with - he shut the door after him, and went away; I awoke my grandmother, and told her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. His aunt Ann was in the room; I gave him a halfpenny to buy some bird seed. Witness. My aunt was in the room before he came.</p>
               <p>ANN CURTIS. My money was tied in the corner of the handkerchief - I never told him where I kept it; he often said he should like to see the inside of my box - I did not see my daughter in the room - she had been there in the course of the day, and left me; this boy's mother was the last person in the room - she has lived with me these seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your daughter, who cohabits with the prisoner, in the room that evening? A. She called up that day to see her mother - she went away just before I went to lay down; the boy awoke me quite at dusk - I did not see the prisoner in the room; I was asleep, but not drunk.</p>

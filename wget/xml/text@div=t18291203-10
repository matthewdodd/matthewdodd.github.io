The prisoner sometimes lodged at No. 32, and sometimes at No. 33, the adjoining house; Frances Sparrow keeps the house - she is not here; she is single - we all live together in the house. On the 10th of November I had a gold watch, which I placed on the bed, against the pillow, and saw it there between nine and ten o'clock at night - I closed my room door, but did not lock it; I slept at No.32 that night, leaving the watch in my bed-room, at No.33 - I missed it next morning, at ten o'clock; the prisoner frequently visited me in my room - I have seen my watch since; I gave 12l. for it, about four months ago.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE JOSEPH. I am a widow, and live in Coventry-court, in St. Martin's parish, not a quarter of mile from Exeter-street. The prisoner came backwards and forwards to my house; she came between eleven and twelve o'clock on Tuesday night, the 10th of November, with a gold watch - she said she was in great distress; that she had taken a female with her from Mrs. Conquest's - that female had gone to Paris, and robbed her of every thing; she asked me to lend her some money on the watch, which she said was bought of Mr. Norman, in Princes-street, by Mrs. Conway, who was her landlady, before she went to Sparrow's and lived in Lisle-street - she said she had money to pay Mr. Wright, for a free admission, and wanted 5l. or 6l. on it; I lent her half a sovereign and 10s., and said in the morning I would lend her the rest, as I had nothing but a 10l. note - she left the watch; I gave it to Mary. my servant - she came next morning, and I advanced her 5l. more; she said she would be sure to fetch the watch when her friend came - I sent the watch to Mrs. Conway, in consequence of what I heard.</p>
               <p>SARAH ISRAEL. I am Joseph's niece, and live with her. I took the gold watch to Mrs. Conway, on the Thursday; I was present when the prisoner brought it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030011"></xptr>to my aunt, on the 10th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock; my aunt lent her 1l. - I did not leave the watch at Conway's, but delivered it to Leadbitter the same day.</p>

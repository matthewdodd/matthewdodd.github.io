                  </hi>. I am a smith, in the dock-yard at Woolwich. On the 21st of August I received my pay—I went to the public-house, and was the worse for drink—I was after that in the Globe public-house, and there I forgot myself—I had five sovereigns in my pocket when I went there—I lost them—I had some silver left, that was all—my money was safe when I came out of the Globe—I might have been somewhere else afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner. I was at the Roebuck public-house—I did not see the prosecutor there—I saw five sovereigns on the table—I picked them up, and a man who sat opposite me said there had been some poor man there very much in liquor; he had been telling his money, and had gone away and left it—I laid them on the table, and the man called the prisoner, who was waiter, and said, "This poor man has left his money, take them to the bar"—the prisoner took them to the bar.</p>

I went with the pro<lb></lb>secutor's wife to the Roebuck public-house—the prisoner was not at home, and Mrs. Brown told me to sit down and wait—I did so, and she said to the prisoner, "What have you done with that money you took off the tap-room table, belonging to my husband?"—he said, "I have not taken the money from the table"—I then came out of the parlour and said, "What have you done with that money?"—he said, "I have not taken it"—I said, "You have by all accounts"—he said, "Just come into the parlour, and I will speak to you"—I went, and he said, "I have taken five sove<lb></lb>reigns from the tap-room table; one I gave to Delaney, a stone-mason not to mention the circumstance, the other four I have bought clothes with, and paid some debts."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wood turner, living in Holywell Road; the prisoner was in my employ. On the afternoon of 15th March, I was in a coffee house near my house; the prisoner came to me there, and said some<lb></lb>body body had broken the skylight—I went back with him to the shop and found it broken—from some information I had received, I said I thought he had done it—he asked me who told me—I said the person next door saw him do it—hesaid he would go next door and see all about it—then he said, if I thought he had done it, he would have his money and leave—I paid him his wages for the morning's work—he then demanded three times whether I believed he had broken the skylight, and the third time I replied that I knew he had—he then struck me with his fist at the side of the head—he took up a bit of mahogany to make a second blow at my head—he put it down again, and took the chopper from the chopping block, this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said, "You b—, I will slay you in your own house, "and he made a blow at my head with it, but I bobbed my head on one side and escaped it—the witness Bonella then stepped or ran forward and took the prisoner by the arm and endeavoured to reason with him; I stayed still during that movement—when the prisoner felt Bonella's arm placed on his, be turned round to him and said, "I have more spite against you than him," and directed his attention to Bonella—I walked towards the front door—on the threshold of the door, I turned round, and the prisoner seeing me likely to pass out, left Bonella and made a second blow at my head with the chopper, using the same word, "I will slay you"—I jumped back to avoid the blow with my arm out, and the blow took effect on my wrist; it cut my wrist to the bone—I did not bleed very much—I went to a surgeon and had it dressed—a constable was got and the prisoner was taken into custody—I have not suffered any pain from the wound, but I have been disabled from business by it, and I have been attended by a medical man up to the present time—the prisoner was decidedly not drnuk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tabernacle Row, St. Luke's. I was in Mr. Roffell's shop on 15th March—I saw him pay the prisoner his wages—after he had done so the prisoner turned to him, looked him in the face, and asked him if he believed he had broken the window—he repeated the question more than once, and Mr. Roffell said he believed he had, or words to that effect—the prisoner then struck him with his fist on the side of the head—he then snatched up a piece of mahogany from off the lathe, and essayed to make a blow, but pat it down again and took the chopper and struck at him with the chopper, saying that he would slay him in his own place—to the best of my belief he aimed at his head—Mr. Roffell avoided the blow—I could not exactly see in what manner, but he stepped on one side—when I saw the prisoner take up the chopper it startled me, and I called,"Crawley, Crawley," and stepped forward to interfere—the prisoner turned round on me, and said that he had more against me than he had against him, and made a blow at me with the chopper—I warded it off with my arm, and then the prisoner seeing Mr. Roffell passing out of the door, directly turned from me and made another blow at him—I could not see the effect of the blow on account of the partition—he then turned round and threw the axe down, and went away—I took it up and put it on one side, and then I went and found Mr. Roffell with his arm cut.</p>

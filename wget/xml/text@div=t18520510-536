                  </hi>. I am clerk, at the Clerkenwell police court. The prisoner came to the court to obtain a summons—before a girl is put to that expense, we inquire whether she has any witnesses to confirm her, the Act of Parliament requires it—she first came to the clerk's office for the summons,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100065"></xptr>
               <p>and she was asked what evidence she had; she at first said she had no witness at all, and then, as we generally try to help them, we said she had better try to get some one to go and see the accused person, and she afterwards came and said she had a witness who bad been to the accused, but he denied being the father of the child—she was then told a summons was no use—she sub<lb></lb>sequently came with an attorney, saw the Magistrate, and had a summons—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the information upon which it was granted was not upon oath—the summons came on to be heard on 6th May, when she came attended by an attorney, and Mr. Wakeling was attorney on the other side—Dr. Sil<lb></lb>verman was present—she was sworn, and stated her name was Mary Sullivan, (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>—"I live at 2, Compton-place, Brunswick-square. I am nineteen years old, and am single; I entered the service of defendant the first Satur-day in Feb. 1851; his wife, himself, the captain and his wife, and four chil<lb></lb>dren, and another female servant, lived in the house; she went away about a week after I went; the house is a large house; about ten weeks after I was there defendant began to pull me about, such as kissing me, and pushing, and shoving me (<hi rend="italic">The statement here detailed the particulars of the alleged con<lb></lb>nexions</hi>)—I told his wife every time, the same day it happened—when I told his wife the Saturday after Good Friday, he was up stairs on the landing; that was something after 12 at night; he was going to bed; the day I went away he swore if I told Mrs. Towers he would give me a twelvemonth's imprisonment; I went to Mrs. Towers, and staid there two months—before the child was born I went with Mrs. Crawley, a month before Christmas, to defendant's; she sent in for him and he came out; he said he would have made me happy and do for the child too, only I had exposed him to his wife; he told Mrs. Crawley he would try to trans<lb></lb>port me for exposing him to his wife, and telling falsehoods of him—he went away, and called me a wretch for exposing him to his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Towers—I had a child 20th Jan. 1852; defendant is the father—I never knew any other man but defendant; after I saw defendant with Mrs. Crawley, he came on the following Saturday with the Captain and a police<lb></lb>man, and said he would give me in charge for stealing some cuffs and gloves; the Captain asked me three or four times if I was in the family way by Dr. Silverman, who laughed; I did not say, but said that the defendant knew himself; the policeman went away without me; defendant afterwards said they brought the policeman for protection; defendant said to me, 'Did you not tell Captain Burslem that I only tried?' I said I never took an oath yet, but I soon would against him—Mrs. Silverman took me to her relation, because I would not stay in the house.</p>

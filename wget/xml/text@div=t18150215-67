            . I am an officer. I received information that Mr. Gregg was robbed on different mornings; I went to Mr. Gregg's house on the 16th of January, about a quarter after seven in the morning, I saw the prisoner's wife go into the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150029"></xptr>the prisoner gave her three loaves, she put the loaves under her shawl; I stopped her, and asked her what she had got there: she said it was bread, she had fetched it from the prisoner. I took her back to the shop again. She said it was given to her; I saw it given to her. Mr. Gregg gave charge of the man and the woman. The prisoner confessed it was the first time he had given loaves to the woman. I understood the woman was the prisoner's wife; the bread was taken before the Lord Mayor; it was ordered to be consumed.</p>

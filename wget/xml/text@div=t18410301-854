                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On the 8th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner, and went with her to a brothel in West-street—we then came out, and went to a public-house—we left about nine in the evening, and went back to the house—I had laid out my money in treating her, and bad not money enough to stop with the people all night—I took the handkerchief off my neck, and gave that to the landlord, as a pledge till the morning—I told him I would bring up the money for my bed, and I should expect my goods again, and he said, "By all means"—the prisoner then showed me my bed up stairs—I pulled off my clothes, folded them up very carefully on the table, and went to bed—I covered the clothes over my head, and went to sleep for two hours, or two hours and a half—the prisoner came about half-past twelve, shook me about, and wished me to go somewhere and get another lodging—I put on my clothes, and when I came down I missed my snuff-box from one of my pockets and my handkerchief from another—I asked her for them,</p>

               <p>she said they were all right—I waited a few minutes, and asked her for them the second time—she still told me they were all right—I asked her for them the third time, and she told me she never saw them—this is my handkerchief and box—I gave her in charge—I had not been quarrel<lb></lb>ling and gambling—I did not give them to her instead of money—I was sober—I had not drank above two quarterns of rum—I am sure she told me she had not got them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 197.) I was called to this brothel, about half-past one o'clock, to take the prisoner for stealing this handker<lb></lb>chief and box—I asked her if she had got the property, she said, "No," she knew nothing about it—I said, if she did not produce it I must take her to the station—she still said she had not got it—she attempted to pass it to the brothel-keeper, who was in the room, and I took it from her hand.</p>

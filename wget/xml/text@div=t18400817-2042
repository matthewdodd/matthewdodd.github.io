                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Ann-street, Blackwall; I did live in Well-street, Poplar. On Tuesday, the 21st of July, I was in the yard of the house conveying the water out of the water-tub into the next tub—the prisoner was the landlady of the house—she came out from the kitchen with an earthenware quart jug in her hand—she said nothing to me about the water—she walked round me and dipped her jug into the tub I was taking the water from—she threw the water into my face, and at the same moment caught hold of me by the side of the head with her hand, struck me with the jug, and broke it with the blow—it knocked the bottom off—she then took the broken jug and hit me with the remaining part of it higher up on the head than before—I saw the blood flow to the ground, and put my hand up, screamed louder, and was taken to the doctor's—I fainted from loss of blood—I was confined to my bed from Tuesday till the Monday following—I had not been quarrelling with her before, but an hour before she had been using very ill language to me, but I made her no answer—I had given her no provocation—I believe she was rather in li<lb></lb>quor—she has many times quarrelled with me, and two months before I bound her over to keep the peace towards me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Phillips, a sailor, and live in Well-street. I was in the next yard to the prisoner—the wall being low I looked over, and saw the prisoner come out with a jug in her hand, dip it in the water, and then come on the right-side of Mrs. Line, throw it in her face, and immediately strike her, the bottom of the jug fell, and the second blow cut her—I saw the blood—Line had done nothing to provoke her that I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for on the 21st of July, about half-past four o'clock, and took the prisoner into custody—she made great resistance, and said she would not go with me—her hus<lb></lb>band</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184008170105"></xptr>
               <p>and several in the house wished her not to go with me—she laid down in the room, and he sat on her clothes—after a deal of trouble, I got her out of the room—I asked what she meant by serving the woman as she did—she said she had not hurt her, and the loss of a little blood would do her good—I told her the state the woman was in—the prosecutrix's clothes were soiled with blood—she was struck about the temple.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe she persisted in saying she did not think she had hurt her much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we frequently have a deal of trouble with her—she has not been out of Clerkenwell above three weeks—I have been, about nine months in the police—I did not get up this case—I have witnesses to prove it—I do not conceive I am prejudicing her by saying she has been in prison before—she was in Clerkenwell before, for felony.</p>

I saw the prosecutrix—she had a wound in her forehead—it was a very small one, but it divided a branch of the temple artery, and caused considerable loss of blood—there was also a mere skin wound below that—the wound healed within twenty-four hours, but she continued faint from loss of blood four or five days—it healed by the first intention.</p>

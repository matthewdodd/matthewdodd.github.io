                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Schollar, we did live in Charles-street, Goswell-road. On 7th Oct. we were leaving, and I borrowed a carpet-bag of the prisoner—she brought it in, and I put in it a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note in a small Russian pocket-book, 16 sovereigns, three tea-spoons, and several other articles—the prisoner's husband was present when I placed them in the bag—this was about half-past six o'clock, or near seven in the evening—having placed them in the bag, I kept it in my possession till we left the house, and then I carried it to Frederick-street, Hampstead-road—I am sure that I had the bag under my eye all the time—my husband and his brother accompanied me—the prisoner was riding in the van, and we walked after it—the prisoner's husband and the carman were in the van—when we got there the prisoner was waiting at the bottom of Frederick-street—no one was with her—she told my husband she had been waiting for him, and asked him to treat her with a glass of brandy, which he did—she then went with me and my husband—when we got to the house I gave the carpet-bag to my husband's sister in the passage—she went up-stairs and placed it down by the side of the room, between the windows—the prisoner was there—I said, "It is safe," and the prisoner said, "Quite safe"—I then left the room, and left the prisoner and my sister-in-law in the room—when I returned, I met my sister-in-law within two stairs of the bottom—she had nothing in her hand—</p>

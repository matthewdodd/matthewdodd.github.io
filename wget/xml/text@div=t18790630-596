On 14th January, about 1 p.m., 1 saw the prisoner in Endell Street, and followed him; he joined another man and they went into the Cross Keys together—I went in after them, and saw the prisoner sitting on a seat by himself and the other man 3 or 4 yards from him, smoking—when I went in the prisoner put his hand in his left trousers-pocket, drew it out, raised himself up 2 or 3 inches, and placed both his hands under him—I seized his arms and said "I suspect you have some counterfeit coin on you"—he said "No, I have nothing of the sort"—he attempted to struggle with me; I pulled him up from the seat, and Allison, who was with me, said "Look at those two parcels;" and then said to the landlord in the prisoner's hearing, "I wish to call your attention to those parcels on the seat"—the prisoner must have been sitting on them—there were these two packets, one containing 5 florins, and one 10, all counterfeit, and each wrapped up separately as they are now—no bad coin was found on the other man, and he was liberated at once—on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at Southwark. The pri<lb></lb>soner was my journeyman for about twelve months, and lodged in the house—my workshop is on the second floor—on the 9th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, he asked me to sell him a candle, knowing I was busy, he said he wished to do as much work as possible in that week, and he would work late, or all that night—I allowed Mrs. Berry to let him have a candle—I went to rest—he went up to the work-shop—he slept in the house, and could retire when he thought proper—next morning I found he was gone, with another, who has not been taken since—five pairs of boots were also gone, part his own work, and part another workman's—I have since seen three pairs of the boots, but not the other two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Tot<lb></lb>hill-street, Westminster. On the 10th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock the prisoner came to my shop in company with another—he showed line two pairs of boots, and asked if I would purchase them—I asked where he got them—he said they were his own goods, and he was on the <hi rend="italic">fuddle</hi>—I offered him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, which was the full value—they were not new, and had been repaired—he went away for half an hour, or three quar<lb></lb>ters of an hour, returned, and said he would take the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I produce the boots—he promised to return in an hour or two with some more—I had not bought them above half an hour, when Mr. Berry came and identified them—next morning a man came with these for sale—Mr. Berry said they were his, and if the man came, I was to detain him—he came again—I looked outside, and saw the prisoner down below—I immediately sent for a constable and had him apprehended.</p>

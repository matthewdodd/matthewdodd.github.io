In July last I lost 4 pounds of hogs bristles; the prisoner owned the taking 1 pound three quarters, and 2 pounds and a quarter, and that it was a lewd woman of the town who had seduced him, and bid him rob his master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Courtman . In July last the prisoner brought to me one pound and three quarters of hair, to sell .</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for it?</p>
               <p>Courtman . I gave him the full value, and more. I think it was 5 s. 3 d. and he said he would come again. On the Monday he came again, and I not being at home, my wife bid him come again. He came on the Tuesday, and brought some more; I asked him how he came by them; he said he made up brushes for himself: I told him, if he would bring any body to prove them to be his property, he should have the money for them; and on Wednesday he brought a woman, who said they were his property: I said, these are stolen, and I know them to be so; and then they both fell down on their knees, and he said he had stole them from his master, one Mr. Lyon, in Crooked-lane: but I found that it was not so, but that he stole them from Mr. Pickle.</p>
               <p>William. When I took the prisoner, he told me they were his master Mr. Pickle's hairs, and that he took them out of his shop.</p>

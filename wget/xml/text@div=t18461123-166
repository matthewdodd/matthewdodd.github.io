                  </hi>. I live at George-place, South-street, Peckham, and am a green-grocer. On the morning of the 10th of Nov. I left my cart in Welling<lb></lb>ton-street, Southwark, between eight and nine o'clock, with a sack of potatoes in it, Lewis was in the care of it—I returned in twenty minutes or half-an-hour, and the sack and potatoes were gone—I saw the prisoner in custody with them at the station—there were more than 1 1/2cwt.</p>

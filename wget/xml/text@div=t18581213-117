                  </hi>. I am the assistant Under-Secretary of State for the Colonial Department. On 12th November last, my atten<lb></lb>tion was called to the publication of some despatches in the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> newspaper—I never had the custody of those despatches—a gentleman of the name of Meyer is the principal librarian of the Colonial Office—he was absent until a late day in October, I believe the 24th—during the period of his absence, a gentleman of the name of Miller acted in his capacity; he is sub-librarian—I have now in court twenty-four copies of the despatch in question—in order to be accurate, I should mention, here are twenty-three copies: one copy is in the hands of the Attorney-General, he used it just now.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130032"></xptr>
               <p>Meyer supplied it—I demanded a collection of papers on the Ionian Islands, and this formed one of them—Mr. Meyer is present in court—Lord Car<lb></lb>narvon and Sir Edward Lytton would obtain their copies from the library, by going or sending for them—they would send their private secretary, or some gentleman connected with the office—it is not impossible that a clerk or messenger might be sent, but very improbable—these things are usually procured by the private secretary of the Secretary of State or Under-Secre<lb></lb>tary—it is not any minister that might send—we know nobody in the Colonial Office but our own minister, and if he wishes to send papers to any of his colleagues he so orders it—Lord Carnarvon is Under secretary of State for the Colonies—no paper has been published that has ever been in my custody, or within my knowledge as an Under-Secretary of State—I know of none having been published—I have heard of one single paper, but I was not then in the Colonial Office, or connected with it—in the course of thirty-five years, I have heard of one other paper: that was not a confidential paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the reader and manager of the printing office at the Foreign Office, under Messrs. Harrison, the printers—in Sep<lb></lb>tember last, I received a manuscript from the Colonial Office, to be printed—the proofs were struck off on 16th September—twenty-eight copies were printed—twenty-five were ordered by the Colonial Office—twenty-eight were struck off because we had to do an even number, as two copies are worked on one sheet—we worked twenty-five for the Colonial Office, and besides those, we kept one as a voucher for the Stationery Office, one as a file copy for ourselves, and the third copy was necessarily worked off on account of its being an even number; we work them in pairs—I delivered the twenty-five copies to Mr. Miller, the sub-librarian—I have two of the other three here in court (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—the twenty-eighth copy was given to Norman, the messenger sent by the librarian for a copy for his own use, early in November—by the librarian I mean Mr. Meyer—the two that I now produce I have had in my possession ever since—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the copies already produced</hi>) here are twenty-four out of the twenty-eight copies that I so struck off—my own two make twenty-six—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another produced</hi>) this is a portion of one of those I so printed—the first four pages of this are wanting.</p>

               <p>here and there a paper that I refer to in the course of the day, in discharge of my duty—I placed those papers so that they formed a sort of pile or heap—I put a heavy book on the top of them; in fact, it was the library catalogue, a huge folio, and there they remained—at the time they were delivered to me, Mr. Meyer was some few days absent; I may say a week or two, and he continued so until 25th October—during the whole period of time from the delivery of them to me in September, as far as I observed, they remained as I had placed them, on the table near to where I sit, with the heavy book on them, until Mr. Meyer returned, when I myself left town for a short time.</p>

               <p>before; it was almost the last day of my tenure of Mr. Meyer's position—he returned on Monday, 25th, and this occurred about Saturday, the 23d, or a few days before—on that day Mr. Guernsey called upon me, and we conversed together as usual, in a general way—I left the room for a few minutes, to go to the binder—I believe Mr. Guernsey was near the fire when I left—I was absent about four or five minutes—I believe I left to go to the binder—when I returned, Mr. Guernsey was near the desk where these despatches were lying; he was moving away from the table—as I came into the room he remarked to me, "I am not prying into your secrets"—he said that, as he was moving away from the table—I paid that I did not for a moment suppose that he was—he had been standing near the fire-place when I left the room-after saying this, he moved partly towards the window, and then towards the fire-place again—he remained some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that—we dined together that day, the 23d October, or whatever day it was—I left the office on 30th October—I was absent fifteen days—my leave was for a fortnight, Sunday supervened; I should correct myself, I was at the office again on 15th November—I received a note from Mr. Meyer on Saturday, the 13th, desiring me to come and speak with him about these despatches, and although I did not remain in the office all that day, I was there for a few hours; but I attended regularly on the 15th—I returned permenantly on the 15th—Mr. Guernsey called upon me in the middle part of the day, on the 15to, about 1 or 2 o'clock—I remember his conversation with me had regard to a letter that he had received from the War Department, which was rather of a favourable character, in answer to his application—he then spoke of the hope of his being gazetted as paymaster, and then drew from his pocket some pamphlet on South American matters, and a portrait of General Lopez—after talking on this subject, I changed the conversation to another subject—I was very anxious to do so—I had at that time learnt that these two despatches had been published in the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>—they had been published on the 12th, three days before the day of which I am speaking, and I was in great anxiety about it—it was that which led me to change the conver<lb></lb>sation from the rambling talk about General Lopez and others, to the subject of the despatches—I said to Mr. Guernsey that he must excuse me, that I must leave him; that I was in great trouble and anxiety about the publication of these despatches, and I looked him in the face and said, that the man that could have done such a thing must have been a d—d scoundrel—he said, "He must, indeed, be a dirty blackguard"—and he said to me, "It might cost you your situation"—I had not, down to that moment, said anything whatever to him, or made any communication to him at all, which could have given him to understand that I had had charge of those documents or was any more connected with them than any of the other persons in the Colonial Office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">the paper, but the despatch which was impressed upon the paper; his object merely was to have the matter published; as to what became of the paper itself, he was careless—if a person took a booh from the table of another without the owner's consent, intending to copy a portion, and return the book, that would be no larceny, and the mere omission to return it would not make it a larceny; the animus at the time of the taking was the important matter—see Rex. v. Trump, 1 Car. and Payne</hi>, 658; <hi rend="italic">and he contended that if it was clear that the intention was not to steal the paper, but only the matter impressed upon it, that could not be the subject of larceny, and there would be no case for the Jury.</hi>

             lives at the corner of the court; the window we looked out at commanded Mrs. Shearman's garden, which is the back of her house; I saw the prisoner come out of the wash-house and turn to her left hand, and get in at the lower kitchen window.</p>
               <p>By what means did she get in? - Upon her hands and knees.</p>
               <p>How did she get the window open? - I do not know; I heard the glass fall; she was in the place for a quarter of an hour, as high as I can guess; she returned out with a red cardinal on, which she had on when she went in; she had nothing in her hand. She went into the wash-house and staid some time, then she came out without her cardinal, and went into the kitchen the same way she had before. She staid a short time and then came out with a bag or a bundle, I cannot say which, Mrs. Toy said to me there is a woman with a bundle coming out of Mrs. Shearman's window. I said I would go down and see if any of them were at home. I went down, and when I came to the street door I found it was fast. I put my hand to the latch and lifted it up; I went through the entry and pulled the back door open, and in the wash-house I saw the prisoner; I clapped my hand upon her shoulder, and asked her what she did there? she said nothing. I asked her what she had done with the bundle she had pulled out of the window? Then I turned to the stairfoot and called to know if any body was in the house; Mrs. Shearman's daughter came down. I held the door to keep the prisoner in the wash-house till somebody came in; then I sent for Mr. Matthews.</p>
               <p>Did you see the bundle in the wash-house? - I did.</p>

               <p>I was looking out of the window; I saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Shearman's window, with her hat and cloak on; I saw her come out, and then she went in again. She went in without her cloak, and when she came out again, she pulled a bundle out at the window. Moncaster ran down stairs to stop the prisoner, and I ran as fast as I could after her; when I got to Mr. Sharman's I saw an empty bag, and the things lying upon the dresser in the wash-house? - I got Mr. Blake, a gentleman at the next door to come in and then Margaret Moncaster, went for a constable.</p>

               <p>I am one of the beadles of the parish of St. Mary's, Whitechapel. I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner, about seven o'clock. When I came in, I saw some linen lying in the wash-house; I asked whose they were; Shearman said they were her's; that the woman had got into her room and had taken them out. I asked how she got in; she said she broke a pane of glass, undid the turnbuckle, and took them out.</p>
               <p>This was said in the presence of the prisoner? - Yes. They were put into a bag all together, and the mouth of the bag was tied up. I then said have you searched the prisoner? they said no. I said take her into the room and let her be searched, but take care she does not drop any thing, As they were taking her into the room, she dropped some handkerchiefs, which they took up and delivered to me. I did not see her drop them; I handed them over to Mrs. Shearman, who said they were her's.</p>

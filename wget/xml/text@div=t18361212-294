                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper to Mr. Gearing, of the Bromley-coach. On Tuesday morning, the 22nd of November, about six o'clock, I saw Rosser, who lodges where I do, with a very large dark-looking bag on his back—it would hold a bushel or a bushed and a half—he took it down from his shoulder and put it into a cupboard—I asked what he had got there—he said he had got some wood—I told him it was no such thing as I saw it was not that—I considered it was poultry—I told him to take it out and take it away altogether—I saw him take it out of the house—I asked whether he worked by night instead of day—I afterwards examined the bag, and found it contained a very large and dark turkey, almost black—I should imagine that was about two miles from Miss Mayow's—Rosser was not in bed when I came home that bight at half-past nine o'clock—he came in in an hour and a half after.</p>

                  </hi>, I am the constable of Lewisham. I received in<lb></lb>formation of the twelve turkeys being taken—I apprehended Rosser at Bromley on Monday evening, the 28th of November—I told him I wanted him for stealing Miss Mayow's turkeys—he said he had not stolen them, or words to that effect—I took him to the cage—on the following morning I went to take him before the Magistrate, and he said he wished to say some<lb></lb>thing to me—I told him not to say any thing that would criminate himself, it might be used against him—he said it was a bad job, he should not have done it if he had not been drunk—he said that him and Cowper, and a man named <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> (he did not know his other name) had been drinking at Brom<lb></lb>ley</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120073"></xptr>
               <p>and they went to one of the beer-shops at Bell-green, Sydenham—he did not know which—that they went from there, (he did not know the hour,) over the fields to the back of Miss Mayow's premises, and found the turkeys there, and they took them; but he said they went to Cowper's house first, and got a bag and a smock-frock—they took the turkeys to Southend, and put one bag in a field at the back of the houses, and the other bag, with six turkeys, he took home—he left them in the field first, and then went and brought them in; and Sealey challenged him about having that property, and told him if he did not take the things out of the house imme<lb></lb>diately he would send for a constable—then about eight o'clock he took the six turkeys, with the bag, up the road; but I should say, prior to his taking it out he saw a brewer's drayman, and told him he was in a good deal of trouble, and wanted him to take the bag; that he fetched it out, and put it on the shafts, and told the drayman to take it away and do what he liked with it, and the other six he waited till after dark, and took them to Lewisham Bridge, and threw them into the water—I had the prisoners in separate cages, and on the Friday morning I went to Lee cage to fetch Cowper out to take him before the Magistrate, and when I went to fetch him, and the other man who was with him, Cowper wished to speak to me, I told him out to say any thing to me, as I did not want to hear him say any thing to criminate himself—he said he understood that Rosser had told all about it, and it was useless for him to deny it—he said it was a bad job, and he should not have done it if he had not been drunk—we were talking about the turkeys then, I said, "How could you be such a fool as to get into such a mess?"—he said, "Rosser told me he had got a market for them, or otherwise I should not have gone there."</p>

            . I am an officer. On February the 9th, in the evening between six and seven, I stood in Aldgate High-street. I saw the prisoner and her son in company together, as she passed by she looked very hard at me; I had suspicion; I followed her and she looked back two or three times, and just as I got by her; I turned round upon my heel she delivered a parcel to her son, her son ran to the other side of the way; I crossed over and stopped him; he cried out for his mother. I asked him what he had got, he said he did not steal it his mother stole it, I took hold of him and going to the watchhouse, I delivered him up to my brother officer. I pursued the mother, and found her in a wine vaults, in Petticoat lane, I told her I had taken her boy, he was crying for her, she said she had no boy except what was in the workhouse, when I took her to the watchhouse, the boy owned her as his mother, she said she knew nothing about it. The boy told me he would shew me where it was taken from; I went with the boy to Mr. Kirkpatrick's, in Gracechurch-street; the boy shewed me the pile where his mother took it from; the boy being under nine years of age was discharged. This is the piece of print.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that your property - A. It is; I had twelve pieces of the same sort only the day before; the mark is cut off; I am satisfied it is my own. I would not swear that it was.</p>

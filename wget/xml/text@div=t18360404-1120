                  </hi>. I have been made of the <hi rend="italic">William Lush<lb></lb>ington</hi> merchant vessel, which came from St. Kitts. On the morning of the 27th of February, I had come from Gravesend by the night-tide—I called at the Elephant and Castle for a little refreshment—I was quite sober—I was sitting in the top-room by the fire, having a glass of purl—the prisoner came in after me—he sat down some time about a yard from me—there was nobody between us—he asked me if I could tell him what time it was, very shortly after he came in—I told him one hand of my watch was loose, and I could not depend upon it—I took my watch out, and held it for him to feel the hand, that it was loose—I returned it to my fob—it had a black ribbon to it—I dropped asleep from fatigue—I was <hi rend="italic">dead beat</hi>—I was not asleep more than five minutes—when I awoke I missed my watch, and the prisoner was gone—I have never found my watch—I would give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I could, for my father gave it to me, and he is dead—I had bad it for thirteen years—the prisoner was quite a stranger—he turned his pockets inside-out, saying, "I have no money, give me a pint of beer," and I gave him one—I am sure he is the man—there was no clock in the room—I put my watch in my right hand waistcoat-pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the landlady of the Elephant and Castle. I recollect the prosecutor coming into the house at six o'clock in the morning, and he was there between nine and ten o'clock, sitting by the fire, and I saw the prisoner sitting by the side of him—I heard the pri<lb></lb>soner ask the time—Lock wood pulled his watch out to show him—he returned it to his right-hand waistcoat pocket, and fell asleep—I saw the prisoner go away about five minutes after the prosecutor fell asleep—I was not in the tap-room then—Lockwood missed his watch immediately after the prisoner was gone—there was no other person in the room from the time Lockwood showed his watch to the prisoner till he missed it—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I had information about this on the 27th of February—I understood the prisoner went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>—I apprehended him that day, within an hour and a half of the robbery, at Aldgate—I told him I wanted him for stealing a silver watch from a gentleman—he asked where—I said, "At the Elephant and Castle"—he said he was never there in his life, and that he was a hard<lb></lb>working industries man—I said I must take him to the station-house—he said he would go quietly if I would not lay hold of him—I took him to the station-house, and asked if he had any money—he said, "No"—I searched him, and in his right-hand pocket I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a knife; in his waistcoat pocket, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in his fob, half-a-crown.</p>

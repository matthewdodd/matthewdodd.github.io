               <p>Q. Have you lost any mutton lately? - A. Yes; I have lost meat out of my shop every week these two years; I am almost ruined; gentlemen, this day week, as I was coming from Whitechapel, I went past his shop, and I saw a fat joint of meat, it was a fat breast of mutton, outside; I went by again, and saw a neck of mutton, my property, and my own cut; no Jew butcher in London cuts the same as I do; it was pole mutton; there is a difference between pole mutton and horn mutton.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150058"></xptr>Q. How do you know from the neck, that it was pole mutton? - A. It was my own property; I am a butcher by trade, I can tell pole mutton from horn sheep to be sure, and so can any butcher; I cut it all myself; I have got three or four men, and I never let them cut any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recollect it was your cut? - A. My own cut, my own scores, and my own meat.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of scores are these? - A. Butchers scores to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of scores, long or short, or what? - A. Long and short, and all sorts of scores; there is no butcher in Whitechapel, cuts it like mine; every butcher in Whitechapel has different scores; it is my own meat, so help my God; good gentlemen, it is my own meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say, from all the observation you have made, that it was your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold it? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing in the shop at this time? - A. I took him to assist me, because I am a foreigner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, in the presence of Nathan, that it was your mutton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the shop to go for a constable? - A. Yes; I left Nathan there; I went to the Whitechapel Justice's; I left Nathan outside the door; when I came back, I did not find the mutton as it was when I went in; he took the fat off, and the mutton was cut in half.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the mutton was your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When you saw the mutton again in the prisoner's shop, it was not in the same state in which you had had it in your's? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had altered it, you did not know? - A. He altered it while I was gone; when I saw it first, it was just as I lost it out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a butcher in this country? - A. Very near twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. In Petticoat-lane? - A. No; in Duke-street, Aldgate; within these seven years, I have had a shop in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a particular way of cutting up your meat? - A. More than any Jew butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it by your own cutting? - A. Yes; and it was a particular sort of mutton.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal in a particular sort of mutton? - A. They were all pole mutton that week.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was cut up, how did you know it was a pole sheep? - A. I can tell from a thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. When the carcase is butchered and cut up, and a neck of mutton is separate from the sheep, how are you able to know it is a pole sheep? - A. I can tell a pole sheep from a horn sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. But how can you tell when it is cut up; suppose you kill a pole sheep to-morrow morning, cut off the head, cut up the carcase, butcher it in a proper stile, and after you have butcherd it, and put it ready for sale, and mixed it with other meat, tell the Jury how you know it? - A. Very well; a pole sheep is marbly, and a horned sheep is not marbly at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a pole sheep is the best mutton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pole sheep did you kill at the same time that you killed this one? - A. I bought fourteen pair of quarters of one man, all wether and pole sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell us how you know one quarter of a pole sheep from another quarter of a pole sheep? - A. I know very well it was my own score, there was not one killed for any Jew that week, besides mine; I buy them ready killed.</p>
               <p>Q. How then can you distinguish one part of a pole sheep from another? - A. It is my pole sheep, my own mutton, and my own score; not a Jew in England scores as I do; and if any man says he killed a pole sheep that week, I will give him a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a carcase butcher? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You retail it? - A. I cut it out in two-pound pieces as it is wanted; I found them with some scores as I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make the score? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Those persons you bought of, sell to other people? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they make the same mark upon what they fell to others, as they do to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man sells to you (being a carcase butcher, or a butcher that sells by wholesale), a carcase with the joints all marked the same, how will you take upon yourself to swear that this mutton, having the same mark, is your's? - A. That man killed no more that week than what he sold to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; but I leave it to any gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it only from the scores which were upon it previous to your buying it? - A. Yes; and the pole sheep; I insist upon the pole sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. One word more about the pole sheep, and I have done with you-how many quarters of pole sheep had you bought, at the time you bought this? - A. Fourteen pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of those fourteen pair, all marked in the same way that they are sold out to other retail butchers, how will you venture to swear that this, having the same mark, is your's? - A. He sold them to nobody else but to me; I never was before any Justice in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You were before the Magistrate alone? - A. Me and him, and all his friends, and only me alone.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought you had come from another country-you took him up, did not you?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150059"></xptr>- A. The Justice said, my dear good man, I cannot do any thing in this, you must indict him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him up upon a warrant? - A. No; only the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner attended at the same time? - A. Yes; he gave him leave to sell the mutton, and do what he pleased with it; I don't know the ways of this country.</p>
               <p>Q. You had taken out no warrant against him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You charged him with having robbed you? A. No; I did not say he robbed me; I found my property in his house; if a man sees his property in any body's possession, must not he demand it, or else there is no law; I did not see the man rob me, but my meat was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. He went voluntarily without any warrant, after you had made this charge upon him? - A. He went along with the officer and me.</p>
               <p>Q. You made a complaint of this mutton being found in his possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The Justice discharged the complaint? - A. Yes; he said, my dear good man, I can do nothing in it, you must indict him.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrate discharged your complaint? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the mutton here? - A. No; he sold it; I have got some of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Q. You say no Jew butcher cuts in the same way as you do? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know all the Jew butchers in Petticoat-lane, and round about there? - A. Yes, I hope so.</p>
               <p>Q. You hope you know them all? - A. Yes, I hope so; every one.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not all here? - A. No, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear for them, that they do not cut up their meat exactly in the same way that you do? - A. No; they do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever present when they did cut up their meat? - A. Do not I know the way, they cut it up the English way.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar is a Jew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been a servant of your's between three and four years? - A. No, not so long, about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, during the time he was with you, he cut up meat in the same way that you did? - A. No, he did not; because I got a neck of his mutton; I have got it, and I will shew it to you in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you learn him to cut up your meat? - A. No, I did not let any body cut up my meat; ask him if he ever cut up any in his life; this meat is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. But he saw you cut up your two pounders? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The Jews do not cut the same way as you do? - A. No, they do not like it, it is such a comical way.</p>
               <p>Q. When you charged the prisoner with having mutton in his possession of your property, did not he say he had bought the mutton of Mr. Cooper, a butcher? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Cooper? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrate referred you to Mr. Cooper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Griffiths go with you to Cooper, in consequence of the prisoner's desire? - A. Yes; he had sold him great fat mutton.</p>
               <p>Q. That was by the Magistrate's desire? - A. To be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go back to the Justice's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he let the prisoner go, and left you to indict him, if you thought sit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You buy it in pairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you cut it up in the Barbary or Gibraltar fashion? - A. Yes; in the Gibraltar fashion.</p>
               <p>Q. And none of the butchers in the neighbourhood, cut up in the same way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have no doubt the mutton was your cutting up, and your own property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the prisoner going voluntarily to the Magistrate there was a constable along with you, was not there? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been a butcher ever since I was fourteen years of age; I took a house, and set up for myself near Mr. Shannon; after having been there a short time he did all he could to get me out; he endeavoured to get my rent raised by offering more for it than I gave; finding he could not do that, he set his son up against me; I met him one day in Whitechapel, and he told me I had got some mutton of his; and I told him to go with me, and he went with me, and took it down, and said that was his; I told him it was a falsity, I could bring witness where I bought it and paid for it; and then he directly took the mutton and ran out of the shop with it, and was gone half an hour with it, and then he returned back again with five or six necks of mutton in one of his men's aprons, and laid them all down upon my block, and there was another man with him that they call Benjamin;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150060"></xptr>first of all, he said there was no butcher like him for cleaving the mutton; and then he said he made a mistake in cleaving it so bad, that he knew it by that; and a man told him he had better take his necks of mutton and go away; and the man said, there was a neck of mutton amongst them that he knew was Shannon's cut; I told him very likely it was, for it was one that he had brought there; and I went with him before a Justice, and I told him I had bought it of Mr. Cooper; and the Justice said, he should go with me and the officer, and we went to Mr. Cooper, and he said, it was impossible for him to say to three pounds of mutton; and I went and told the Justice, and the Justice told me to take the mutton and go home; I lived with Mr. Shannon three years, at his shop in Shoemaker-row; after I had been with him six months he never cut a bit of meat, I always cut it myself; it was a piece of a neck he charged me with.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a butcher in Aldgate High-street; I know the prisoner, he deals with me: Last Wednesday was a week, I told him three pair of fore quarters of mutton, what the Jews commonly call a sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they pole sheep or horn sheep? - A. They were horn sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. When meat is cut up, in the way you describe, in quarters, can any body swear to their having belonged to pole sheep? - A. The pieces that were brought to me I could not swear to; if they had been brought back to me whole I could have sworn to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were cut to pieces you would not undertake to swear to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Every butcher knows pole mutton from horn mutton? - A. Yes; but not when it is cut in these small pieces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you sell by fore quarters, and not cut up at all, you would know them again? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When it is sold by you in fore quarters, and afterwards cut into pieces, you cannot swear to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many parts of pole sheep do you think you might sell that week? - A. I dare say I sold better than twenty in the course of that day, and they were all horn sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had sold any one of these twenty in the course of that day, and the same that you sold to Lazarus had been brought back to you, could you have known them again? - A. Not cut in pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. But you deal in pole sheep sometimes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were to sell pole-sheep, and they were cut to pieces, could you identify them afterwards? - A. I cannot say I should be judge enough to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and prosecutor came with Griffiths, the officer, to your house? - A. Yes, on the Monday following; this was on the Wednesday that I sold them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been a butcher? - A. Near twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have modesty enough not to set your experience against a man that has been a butcher fifty years? - A. I never cut up at all.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street; I went to the prisoner's house, the prosecutor had been at the Magistrate's, he laid a complaint that he had been robbed of this mutton, and brought the mutton with him; I then went to the prisoner's, and the mutton was lying upon the block, and he gave me charge of the prisoner; I brought him to the office, and the Magistrate, Mr. Davis, after hearing the whole of the evidence, thought there were no grounds to commit the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the complaint discharged? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bind him under recongnizance to appear here? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner has surrendered to take his trial, or whether he is upon bail? - A. He was not committed, nor is he upon bad; I went the same day with the prisoner and the prosecutor to Mr. Cooper, I asked him if he could say any thing about that mutton coming from his shop; he said, he could not, nor any person else; I went back to the Magistrate with them, and told him what had passed, and he dismissed him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The Magistrate thought fit to dismiss him? - A. Yes.</p>

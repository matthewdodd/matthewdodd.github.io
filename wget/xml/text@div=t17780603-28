I found the door on the single lock; I left it double locked when I went out; when I opened it, three men rushed through the passage, out of the house, into the street. I am positive the prisoners are two of the men, though they were not both dressed as they are now; one was in a green coat, the other in a light; one of them was taken immediately, and was admitted an evidence. The things that were lost, part belonged to my master, and part to myself; the sword and the shoes were my master's; they were kept in the closet up one pair of stairs; what I lost, which were a silk handkerchief and two silver tea spoons, were kept in the back kitchen. I had used the spoons that day, and had the handkerchief about me very lately. I had seen the sword hanging up a few days before in the closet; the sword was found by a witness in the street, and the shoes were left in a bag at the bottom of the kitchen stairs.</p>

Yorke and the accomplice passed me several times in the street; Sidaway was standing at Mr. Gregory's door; I observed them very particularly, for they walked about several minutes, and then I saw them all go into Mr. Gregory's house, and shut the door after them; they opened the door with a key, which Sidaway had in his hand, and they all went in, but I not suspecting any thing of it, and not knowing but they might have a right to open the door. I took no notice of them, but when the outcry was made, I came out and mentioned what I had seen; it was so light, I could distinguish them very plainly, and they walked about so much in the street, that I took particular notice of them.</p>

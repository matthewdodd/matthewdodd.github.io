                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 133). On the evening of 28th August, about 1 o'clock, I was in Whitechapel-road in plain clothes, and saw the prisoners, and three others in uniform—I noticed their faces as they passed—I got a blow directly afterwards on the back of my head; I turned round, but could not tell which of the five took hold of me first for they all seized me—I tried to seize them, and Grover caught my watch-chain—I got my hand in his stock—(I had never seen him before, but I distinctly saw his face—I picked him out from forty or fifty men on the Parade at the Tower—Gearing was brought in by the prosecutor in the last case)—one of them caught me behind, got his hand in my waistcoat-collar, and pulled me back, I having one in each hand—I held one who has not returned to the Tower yet, and I could identify him now—I was knocked, down, and got up again still sticking to Grover and the other man—I lost three half-crowns out of my right trousers-pocket—the men were not rescued till I was knocked down again—Gearing came back first and said, "Are you going to let them go?"—I said, "No; I will not"—he hit me three times on the left eye, and the third time I was knocked down, and they all escaped—I did no duty for three days in consequence of their violence—I have no more doubt that the prisoners are two of the five, than that I am standing here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gearing. Q.</hi> Are you sure I struck you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Confident; I always said so—I said that the man I held in my right hand was fair haired, and rather <hi rend="italic">carrotty.</hi>

I was at the George public-house, and saw five soldiers there—I have no doubt that the prisoners are two of them—they left at about half-past 12—they were engaged for a few minutes outside, but I was taken away, and cannot say in which direction they went—I saw this robbery—I was going home, and the five soldiers were in front of me—I did not take notice of them, thinking they were the same who had knocked me about before—it was then about a quarter to 1 o'clock—I am not certain</p>

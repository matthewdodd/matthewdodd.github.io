The prisoner came into my master's shop, I think, on Friday the 1st of October, pretending to be a customer; I was then serving one. After I had done, she came to me to cheapen a handkerchief, and as she was standing by the counter upon looking round I missed my watch, to which I had been putting a new string before the other customer came in, and had laid it down in the window while I served her. The prisoner and I could not agree for the handkerchief, and when she was going out of the shop I charged her with having taken my watch, which she denied, and said she would be search'd by any gentlewoman in the house. I directly call'd down our maid, who search'd her, and found it; I saw it taken from under the prisoner's arm.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Brecknock, and was call'd down to search the prisoner at the bar in the back shop, while she was undressing herself I saw her put something under her arm, so I put my hand there and felt the watch, but she would not let me take it out; then I called to Mr. Sparrow, and he saw me take it from her.</p>

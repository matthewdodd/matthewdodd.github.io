                  </hi>, I live with my parents in Princes-street, Old-street-road. I am twelve years old—I was going along High-street, Shoreditch, on the 28th of October, and saw a lady and gentleman—the prisoner and another one were following the gentleman—the other one lifted up the tail of his coat, drew his handkerchief out, and gave it to the prisoner—they then ran off—I told the gentleman—he felt his pocket, and his handkerchief was gone—he ran after the two, and the prisoner ran, and before he was taken he threw the handkerchief behind him—I am sure I saw the other boy draw the handkerchief, and give it to this boy—they appeared to be acquainted—one did not appear to be con<lb></lb>cealing the other—the prisoner was looking at the other when he did it.</p>

I saw a gentleman running after the prisoner, and I hastened up to meet him—the gentleman caught him, and gave him into my custody, for robbing him of his handkerchief—he went part of the way to the station-house, but did not go there—the prisoner admitted to me that he had received the handkerchief from the other, with the intention of purchasing it for a halfpenny.</p>

               <p>PHILIP WHITE. I am a watchman. On the 7th of November, about five minutes to five o'clock, I found the prosecutor laying on a step in Jewry-street, quite intoxicated, without his hat, and took him to the watch-house - he had 15s. 3d. in his pocket.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEAUMONT. I am a watchman. On the 7th of November, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner in Rosemary-lane, about five minutes walk from Jewry-street, with this bundle under his arm, and this hat in his hand; I asked where he got them - he said it was a parcel given to him in the Borough, to bring over to Rosemary-lane, but he did not know the party who had given it to him; I am sure he said it was given to him in the Borough - I took him to the watch-house; some men were passing - I asked who gave it to him, and he said, "Those men there," and made a faint call after them- they turned round, but took no notice of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you to stop the people, who were not three yards off? A. He said they gave him the bundle, that is all; I told the Magistrate you said it was given you in the Borough.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He stated quite different to the Magistrate, who was going to discharge me; I met the party coming over the hill - they asked me to carry the parcel, and promised me part of a pint of beer; I pointed them out to him, and he could have put his hand on them.</p>

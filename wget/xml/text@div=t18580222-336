                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. At the end of July or beginning of Aug., 1857, I left my house, Oakley Lodge, locked up, and left the key with my mother-in-law—no one else had a right to enter it—I returned about 3rd Sept., and missed three door-mats, a table cover, a pencil case, two rugs, one with a raised lion in the centre, a figure of a lady in china, ten coats, two packs of cards, a great number of trousers, a pen knife, a dressing case, my wife's writing case, and some gold studs—this is the dressing case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am sure it is mine—I had some of the fittings out of town with me which I have here; this razor is one of them, it is marked No. 1, and No. 2 is left in the case still—the razors are all by Mechi—this is another part of the dressing case—it is of a peculiar construc<lb></lb>tion, and it fits—this is another part which I had with me, and which also fits—I had cards of this description (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no doubt this pair of trousers are mine; they are the same kind and make—I have not tried them on since—this plaster of Paris font is mine—the value of the property is from 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in Newgate, under sentence of four years penal servitude for forgery (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 127). I know the prisoner—I remember a conversation between him, Sowden, and myself in August—I cannot say the day or the week, but it was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—Sowden met us <hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi>, as I thought, but no doubt it was a planned thing, he told the prisoner he was going to do his <hi rend="italic">swell's drum over</hi>—I asked him what he meant, he said he was going to <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> into the <hi rend="italic">governor's</hi> house, which I afterwards found out meant opening the front door—in consequence of that, I went over with the prisoner to Mr. Edmand's house on the same day, about half an hour afterwards—Sowden stood at the corner of Pier Street, which is very near, it was the prisoner's practice to carry a bag con<lb></lb>taining skeleton keys and housebreaking instruments, and he introduced a key which opened the door—I was at the gate—he said, "I have got him at last," and opened the door, and told me to go in—he said, "Come along," and I went in with him—we proceeded over several rooms, and several articles, three mats, a table cover, and a paper-knife were packed up in a bag, and the prisoner carried them away, except the knife, which was given to Sowden; and it was taken by me to a man named Ainslow, a tailor, of Queen's Road, Chelsea—the prisoner waited outside while I went in—on the same evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock, we went to the prosecutor's again, and got a very large hearth-rug, with a lion upon it, and another rug; one was tied up and left behind the door, and the other was taken—that was all, I believe, that was taken that night—the door was only locked each time—(previously to the robbery taking place he had mentioned to me that there was such a robbery going to take place, and I had refused to have any thing to do with it)—we went again the next night, and the prisoner used a skeleton key again, we took several frock coats, two waistcoats, several pairs of trousers, the pair of grey trousers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), many shirts, a set of three studs, a gold swivel, a hearth rug, a pack of cards, and this dressing case, but there was another razor in it, I think—we took them all at once in a large bag—the prisoner afterwards said that he intended to sell the trousers, and the coats, and waistcoats—I gave information to the police on Christmas Day—I was only in the prosecutor's house on those three occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What policeman was it that you mentioned it to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Vincent Gummer, the same who took me into custody for the forgery, and that charge also originated with the prisoner—the street is a thoroughfare, but it is rather a retired spot—it took five or six minutes to fit the skeleton key—the house was closed—the street door is under a porch—you have to go through two wooden gates the width of this Court to get to the porch—there is pallisading in front, but it can be seen—I was in the house a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the first time, not more—Fox brought the things away, and I went at his bidding to Ainslow to dispose of them—I only re<lb></lb>ceived a pack of cards—I brought nothing away—there was nothing which required two people to carry—there was a very large bundle, but he carried it—he did not take me exactly for amusement—I assisted him to pack up the goods, and on the third occasion I carried the dressing case and the figure under my arm wrapped up; it was then somewhat later than it was the day before, but it was not dark: it was much darker in the house—the prisoner</p>

               <p>was forced to have a candle to view certain parts of the premises, which was the cause of his burning his hat—the bundle Fox was carrying was rather heavy, and he asked me to carry it while he carried these—I know these trousers, because they have no collar which frequently runs round the waist, and this part is peculiar—I am not a tailor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser, of No. 8, Waterloo Road, Chelsea. I know the prisoner and Wilmot, and have frequently seen them together at my shop, but merely coming to be shaved—I saw them together frequently during the course of last year, and on one occasion Wilmot came and left a rug with me—the prisoner was not with him, but he afterwards returned in company with the prisoner—Wilmot asked me to purchase the rug—I examined it, and thought it was too good for me—he asked me 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the prisoner's hearing for it—I refused to buy it, and they went away, saying that they would bring a party who would buy it, if I would let it remain—they returned in half an hour, saying they could not find the party, and would I advance them a little money on it—I lent him a sovereign on it, and he promised to redeem it next morning, but it remained three weeks, and was afterwards taken away—after that the prisoner came, and I said, "Wilmot has been here and taken the rug away"—he said, "Oh, very well"—it was a very handsome rug, with a lion worked in the centre.</p>

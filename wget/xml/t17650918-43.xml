As I was standing in my shop, on the 17th of August, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I heard a rattling in the shew-glass, and bid my servant see what it was: he ran to the door, and we perceived the shew-glass was drawn up a considerable heighth; they had lifted the drawer up, and drawn the board of rings out: they drop'd about twenty rings in the shew-glass, and I lost fourteen or fifteen: they took the board away. I secured the shew-glass, and looked after the thieves, but could find nothing of them: there was also a box of silver clasps for shoes, and buttons and studs, and such things that were taken away. On the Tuesday following, Millar came to my house, and said, Sir, you was robbed on Saturday last: if you will get a proper officer, and come with me, I will shew you the thieves, and you may take some of the things on them; he told me he was one concerned in the robbery. I got an officer, and we went into a public-house to get some more help, as Millar told us there were eight concerned in the robbery. I desired him to set their names down, which he did. After we had got a watchman, and two or three others, we went into a house in the Coach yard, St. Giles's: Millar went in first; the constable, myself, and another followed: there was a man; he said, this is one of them, his name is

I said, I wish you would, I will be as favourable to you as I can: accordingly we took Davis to St. Ann's Round-house, and Millar to St. Giles's, that they might not be together.

We went in pursuit of them to several houses, and took Simmonds three or four days afterwards: then I was sent for, and bound over to prosecute. There was a chimney-sweeper said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180030"></xptr> saw two of the rings in Till's possession: Mr. Welch bound him over as an evidence, and he ran away, but I am told is since taken up for another robbery. Millar delivered up several of the clasps that he had in his own custody, and Davis gave me two gold rings: I can swear to the clasps, and I think I could swear to the rings; but rings are so much alike, that I would not chuse to swear to them: here is my workman's mark on them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Davis. He says I had two gold rings; Whether I had or no?</p>
               <p>Fisher. He said I can tell you where two gold rings are: he took me to the house where they were; I think they said they took down a lath out of the cicling to get at them.</p>

I went away, and gave the rings to my wife to sell; she got 7 s. 6 d. for them: I also gave her the studs and buttons; she got for some 2 s. 6 d. for some 2 s. and for some 18 d. not knowing they were stolen.

            . I keep a silversmith's shop, in Tothill-street, Westminster. Millar came to me, on the 19th or 20th of August, with a man and a boy; they offered two gold rings for sale; I weighed them, and they came to 6 s. I did not look in their faces that brought the rings, but it was

               <p>John Ash depos'd. Between 7 and 8 at Night, within 20 Yards of that End of <placeName id="t17251208-44-crimeloc208">Chancery-Lane</placeName>

He did not get 5 Yards from me, nor at all out of my Sight, before I stopt him. I never offer'd to seize any other Person, for indeed there was no other Person near me at that Time. I thrust him into a Sword-Cutlers Shop in Fleet Street, just at the Corner of the Lane, and while I kept him there; a Woman came in and brought my Sword, which she said she took up in the Street. Being asked, if he was certain the Prisoner was the Person that rob'd him, he answer'd, How can I be sure of that, when he has got a Wig now, but he wore his own Hair then? Being further demanded, if he was positive that the Man that took his Sword, did then wear a Wig or not; What Colour his Cloths were of, and whether he had a great Coat or not; he could give no direct Answer. But however he was positive the Prisoner (and no other) was the Man. That he seiz'd him in Chancery-Lane, and did not let him go, till he thrust him into the Sword-Cutlers Shop. The Prisoner in his Defence call'd Mr. Farish, who depos'd, that the Prisoner was sent from his Shop to Serjeants-Inn, and was gone but about 6 or 7 Minutes, before Word was brought of his being taken up. That he then wore a Wig, and that he was close shaved. That there was then, and had been for near half an Hour before, a great Throng of People at Chancery-Lane End, occasion'd by a Stop of Coaches. Mr. Wist deposed to the same Effect.

             depos'd, that coming from Temple-Bar, he found that a Stop of Coaches, had gather'd a Crowd of 30 or 40 People at the Corner of Chancery-Lane. The Prosecutor was coming out of Chancery-Lane, and the Prisoner follow'd at a small Distance. At the same Time, 2 or 3 Fellows came shoving along, pusht down some of the People, and went towards St. Dunstan's Church. They were hardly got by, when the Prosecutor hastily turning about said he had lost his Sword, and was going to take hold of me, but I got out of his Reach, and then he seiz'd the Prisoner (who at that Time had a Pamphlet in his Hand) and thrust him into the Cutler's Shop. A Woman brought in the Sword, upon which the Prisoner said, How could you charge me with taking your Sword, when this Women has found it? - O says the Prosecutor, do ye begin to be saucy? I'll prosecute you closely for that.</p>

             thus depos'd. I was sitting upon my Coach-Box, there was a great Crowd of People. The Prosecutor turn'd out of Chancery-Lane, not having hold of the Prisoner, for he had not then mist his Sword. The Prisoner follow'd him. I saw not far off, a Fellows that I took to be Pick Pockets, they thrust thro' the Crowd and run off. The Prosecutor turn'd about and said he had lost his Sword, and offer'd to seize Davis, but he getting away, the other laid hold of the Prisoner. - They went in my Coach to the Justices; I had told the Prosecutor of these two idle Fellows, and said I wonder'd how he could swear so hard against the young Man; and he answer'd, I would no more valueto hang 50 or 60 such Fellows, than to drink a Glass of Wine.</p>

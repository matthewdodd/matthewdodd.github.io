On the 25th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, a boy came and threw the newspaper down the area, I opened the window to take it in, took it to the kitchen, which is backwards, and stood drying it by the fire. I had left the articles stated in the indictment on the pantry table - I shut the window. While I was in the kitchen I heard the area-door go; I went into the pantry, and missed them. I had left the pantry door open. There was a violent ringing and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170022"></xptr>knocking at the street-door. I ran up, and as soon as I got out, I found the prisoner in the custody of Watson, with the coffee-pot under his coat, and the other things in his pockets.</p>

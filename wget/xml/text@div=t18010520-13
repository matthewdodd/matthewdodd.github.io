               <p>JOHN WARNER sworn. - I am the son of the prosecutor: Between six and seven o'clock in the evening on the 22d of April, the prisoner at the bar came into our shop; there were several clothes-brushes lying upon the counter; I saw her take one of them, and put it into her apron, which hung over her arm; she then took up another, and after she had examined it a little while, she laid it down, and then walked out of the shop with the one she had in her apron; I followed her, brought her back, and took the brush out of her apron; I sent for a constable, and she was taken to the Compter; I know the brush to be my father's.</p>
               <p>(The constable produced the brush, which was identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Constable. The prisoner was very drunk, she could hardly get along; I asked her where she had been; she said that she had been with a sailor that had given her gin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very much in liquor, I thought I had paid for it; I recollect laying down sixpence; I am sure I should not steal it, for I could neither eat, drink, nor pawn it.</p>

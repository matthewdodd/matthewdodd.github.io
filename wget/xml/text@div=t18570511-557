                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Earl of Aberdeen public house, which is next door to the defendant's house, Bridport-place, Hoxton. He lived there previous to my coming there, two years and a half ago—he is in the Post Office—I do not know what his income is—he occupies the whole house; I do not know the rent of it—he is married, and has six or seven children at home, and one is in a public institution, Christ Church—I have frequently noticed the boy who is now standing on the floor of the Court; I first noticed him about twelve months back; he is a little vacant, which attracted my attention, and two or three months after that I noticed that he was very dirty, and was frequently scratching his head, and destroying the vermin that fell from him—he continued under my observa<lb></lb>tion from that time till Feb.—I communicated with the parish, but they took no notice; I communicated with them again about a fortnight after<lb></lb>wards, and next day the defendant came to my house after the authorities had been there—I said that I believed he was starving the boy; he said that he was doing no such thing, for he could assure me that he always cut</p>

I was engaged these in building for three months, and lived in the house after I built it—I have had opportunities of seeing the defendant and his family—I saw the boy up to Feb., until the parish sent to take him away; he seemed covered with vermin, and was very weak—I have known the defendant personally for some time—I have repaired his house for him, and he has paid me—I have never spoken to him about the condition of his boy—I have seen the boy foraging in the dust bin for food, and picking out small particles, and eating them—I cannot tell in what month that was, but he was generally there—I have seen him doing so several times, and eating what he got.</p>

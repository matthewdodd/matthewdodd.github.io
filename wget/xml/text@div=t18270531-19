On the 7th of May I went to Leadenhall-market with his cart, and a gelding belonging to Charles John Brickerton Chesterton; Parsons was with me - we got there about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and went into the market to purchase poultry, leaving the cart and horse in Gracechurch-street, as usual- I bought twelve fowls, twelve chickens, and six ducks - the fowls were delivered to Hart, to take to the cart; when I returned the cart, gelding, and all were gone. I have seen two of my fowls in the possession of one Royer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were they dead or alive? A. Dead; I never saw Chesterton write, but have heard him repeat all his names.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Chesterton. I was with Spike; I went into the market to make some purchases, leaving the cart in Gracechurch-street. I have seen two fowls in the possession of Wallis, and know them to be two of those I bought; I had sent them to the cart by a porter; when I went to look for the cart it was gone - I had been absent about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you still in Chesterton's service? A. Yes - his horse was brought to Jermyn-street by a person; my fowls were dead and plucked - I had put no mark on them - I had bought two dozen, and these two were precisely of the same quality and sort as the cost; they were tied the same way, by the leg; fowls are not all tied that way. I say they are two of the fowls - I bought them of Brooks, who had a great many fowls.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you see them? A. I think it was the day after I lost them - they had a few feathers left about the head.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bailey, a poulterer, of Davies-street, Berkeley-square. I was in Gracechurch-street on the 7th of May, and saw Spike's cart there, with a horse in it - I know it to be his; I saw the prisoner in the cart, driving it away; I had never seen him before, but have not the least doubt of him - he was in Gracechurch-street, driving it towards Bishopsgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time was this? A. It might be twenty minutes before seven o'clock - he had a hat on, and I think he wore the same coloured coat that he has now; he was driving very slow, and without a whip; I did not suspect him - he was not more than a minute passing me, it was just by the Cross Keys, opposite the market; his hat shone - I cannot say whether it was a glazed one.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. The cart was on the opposite side to you? A. Yes, just across the road; I took sufficient notice to be able to swear to him positively, when I saw him at the office.</p>

On the 16th of May I was fetched to the Turk's Head public-house, Charlotte-street, Portland-place, and Mr. Trapnell gave the prisoner into my charge; I told him it was for taking a horse and cart - he said the fowls he had sold Trapnell he had taken in exchange for string, in St. Giles', of a man whom he only knew by sight; I found some string and 17s. 6d. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is Trapnell? A. He is dead. Trapnell said he had dealt with him for string for seven years.</p>

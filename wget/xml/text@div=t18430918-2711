                  </hi>. I have been in the service of Mr. John Evans for two or three years. I saw the prisoner at my master's on Thursday, the 7th of September—I saw him again on Friday morning, the 15th, at eight o'clock, when I was going to work, and he said, "Can you bring me half a ream of paper a size larger than I had before?"—I said, "I will try what I can do"—he arranged to meet me at the corner of Chequer-yard, which it about three minutes walk from my master's, and not within sight of it—I took him half a ream of paper to Chequer-yard at two o'clock, and gave it to him—it was sealed up in a coloured wrapper—he walked away with it immediately, and I walked to the warehouse—as I was leaving him I saw Mr. Hughes, who is in my master's employ—the wrapper which I gave the prisoner was similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the prisoner had a bag which he put the paper into.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Evans. On Friday, the 15th of September, I saw Childs go out of the warehouse about two o'clock—he had what appeared to be a ream of paper under his apron—he said, "I shall be in in a minute"—I followed him down Dowgate-hill to Chequer-yard—I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Chequer-yard—Childs went up the yard, and the prisoner followed him—they were out of my sight—in a minute after Childs came back and passed by me—his apron was then quite flat—I communicated this to my employer's brother, and from his direction I said nothing about it that day—this wrapper is similar to what reams of paper in our warehouse are wrapped in—the prisoner had a bag in his hand, and some<lb></lb>thing in it when I first saw him.</p>

               <p>(Peter Brown, a general dealer, Bedfordbury; Edward Bradshaw, shoe maker, Back-hill; Richard Ryan, shoemaker; and Samuel Nesbit, of Devon<lb></lb>shire-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

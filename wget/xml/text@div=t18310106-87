               <p>JAMES SWINBURN. I am a <rs id="t18310106-87-viclabel501" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18310106-87-defend804 t18310106-87-deflabel502"></join> - I have seen him at public-houses, but never kept company with him. On Saturday night, the 12th of December, Williams was with me in the Edgware-road, between twelve and one o'clock; he had come for me from Duke-street, Grosvenor-square; I had left work at six o'clock, and received my wages about eight; I met Williams about a quarter-past twelve- I first saw the prisoner at the Caledonian Arms, Princes-street; I went in there after twelve o'clock, and found him there, with two more, one of whom is named Randall; I paid for a glass of gin and water - a woman had followed us in, and my friend handed her the glass: I took out my money to pay for the gin - I pulled out a sovereign instead of a shilling; I returned that to my pocket, and gave a shilling - Randall came, looked, and saw my money; I had received 30s., a sovereign, and the rest in silver; I and Williams left the house together; the woman followed us out - I got about two hundred yards, and saw the prisoner, Randall, and another following me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with the prisoner that night? A. They came and forced themselves into our company; I told them to keep to themselves - they came up to me in the street in a kind of jostle; they did not strike me, but knocked me down on my hands and knees; when I got up the prisoner put his left hand into my right-hand trousers pocket, and turned the contents out on the pavement - I caught hold of his hand as he turned it out, and never let go of him; he drew my watch with his other hand, and got it out of my fob: I kept hold of him, and caught hold of the watch - the Policeman and Williams came up and took him; I got 2s. 3d. off the ground - the 3d. was not mine; I saw a man pick the money up, and go away - Randall took up the money, and ran away; I lost the sovereign altogether - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060042"></xptr>was not drunk; I had a little, but knew right from wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to tell the Jury, on your oath, that you were sober? A. No, I was not sober, nor was I drunk; I knew right from wrong- I live at No. 19, Princes-street, right opposite the Caledonian Arms, and my wife lives there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been conversing with the woman before you went into the Caledonian Arms? A. She had followed us all the way; I did not take her there - I said, "I live here, and you had better go home;" she said, "Mr. Cross lives here, I know the place well," and followed us in - I did not give her drink; Williams handed her the glass; I was not turned out of the house - the landlord said,"These gentlemen will go as soon as ever they have drank their glass of gin and water;" he did not desire us to leave, to my recollection, but I will not swear that - I did not go straight home; the woman asked us to see her home - I asked where she lived; she said, "In this street;" I said, "I think not;" she said Yes - I said, "It is a fine morning, and we will go a little way and see;" I do not know whether she was a prostitute - Randall was by at the time my money was taken; I have seen him since - I saw him on Sunday night, but not since - I have had no money from him; it was not in my power to take him - the prisoner's friends sent for me to the public-house - his wife's mother came; I told the officer the prisoner had pulled my watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pass by your own door with the woman? A. No; my door is on the opposite side - it was after one o'clock when I left the public-house; Williams stopped at the end of Princes-street, and said he would go home - he left me with the woman; I went fifteen or sixteen yards further with her - I had left her when I was attacked; she was stopping six or seven yards off - we did not walk arm-in-arm; she came, put her hand on my shoulder, and caught hold of my arm two or three times, but never had hold of it - the prisoner and his friends began talking with the woman in the public-house - she went away after the Policeman came up; she had not been walking on the side that my money was - she was always on the other side.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I went with the prosecutor to the Caledonian Arms; there was a woman in company with us - she was quite a stranger; the prisoner was in the public-house with Randall and another person - I did not know any of them before; Swinburn took out his money to pay for the gin and water, and Randall said he had plenty of money - we went out, leaving them all in the house; the woman followed us out-Swinburn had got on towards drunkenness; I said I should go home - he and the woman parted with me, and went on; I stood a little while, and heard some men talking and coming towards where I stood - there is a row of trees on both sides of the road; I crossed on the opposite side, staid there, and heard one of them mention Swinburn's name; it was merely as they were talking - they went in a direct line across the road towards where Swinburn went; I went, and stood at the end of <placeName id="t18310106-87-crimeloc503">Princes-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She did not go away before it happened? A. No - she was in Swinburn's company before we went into the public-house, and remained till after this happened, to the best of my belief; I had been with the prosecutor about an hour before we went to the Caledonian Arms - he was drunk; he met the woman in the Edgware-road; they conversed together, the same as two or three might meet together on the road - he did not invite her into the house, nor offer to treat her; she did not ask him for drink - she had part of what we had; I suppose she was a street-walker - I heard him recommend her to go home; he did not cross over to go home - I was not watching to see what he would do with the woman; I do not believe they were arm-in-arm together - she was sometimes on one side of him, and sometimes on the other - the trees are in the road; it is a dark place - I came up after the alarm; the woman was behind him, but not close to him - she was as far from him as I am from you; he was not very drunk - the officer did not refuse to take the charge; what I said to the officer was before he came up- if the gas was put out at the public-house, it was after we came out; the landlord did not turn us out, he told us to go out.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was near the spot - Williams came up between two and three o'clock in the morning, and said he expected a friend of his would be robbed at North-bank; we went to the spot, and found the prisoner, prosecutor, Randall, and a woman; just before I got to the spot, I saw Randall raise himself from the ground, and run away - the woman stood a short distance from the prosecutor; when I arrived the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for robbing him and drawing his watch - the prisoner replied, "You may search me, I have nothing;" I found only 3d. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the woman afterwards run away? A. No, she walked away - the prosecutor was not very drunk.</p>

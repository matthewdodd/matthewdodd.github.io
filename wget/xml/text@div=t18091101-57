               <p>Murray's Defence. My prosecutor met me in Greek street, Soho; he asked me where I was going to. I told him my unfortunate situation. The prosecutor said he would not go to any house with me, he said he had not much silver about him, what he had he would give me, he gave me the half crown out of his pocket, telling me to give him eighteen pence out of it; I gave him sixpence out of it. I left him and went down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010037"></xptr>In company with several girls after he was with me. This young man, Shaffen, lived in the same house where I was; I had been in company with gentlemen before. I had eight shillings and nine pence in the whole; I gave it to this young man, he said he would take it home for me. The prosecutor went into the wine vaults in Greek street, again to treat me. When he met me again, he then said he had lost all his money.</p>

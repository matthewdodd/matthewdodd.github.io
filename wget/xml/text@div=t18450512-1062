At the time of the robbery I lived in High-street, Poplar—on the 22nd of April, about two o'clock in the afternoon, Harriet Patman spoke to me, and pointed out the prisoner to me—he was going across Grundy-street, which crosses Catherine-street, carrying a black bag—I followed him, and called "Stop thief!"—I did not come up with him then—on turning the corner of a street, I saw him running away—he was the same man I had seen with the black bag—the bag was then lying in the middle of</p>

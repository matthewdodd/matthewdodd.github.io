            . On the 26th of March, about haf past five I was going through King's Arms Yard, I saw the prisoner come from behind a coach that stood before a door that was broken open; I asked him what he did there, he said, he had been locked out of his lodgings, he had been laying underneath the coach all night; I said I was afraid he had not; I turned my head round; I saw the horse shoes in a sack at the back part of the coach, they were tied up. I asked him what he had got there in the bundle, he said, he knew nothing at all of them. I then saw the door broken open; I secured the prisoner, the shoes and the tools, and took him to the watchhouse. I produce the horse shoes chisels and punches, that were in the bag, and this hammer.</p>

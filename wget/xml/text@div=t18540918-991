                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Beale, who keeps the White Hart, in Seven-dials. On Saturday, 2nd Sept., the prisoner came, about 12 o'clock, and brought a bottle—she asked for half a quartern of rum—it came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served her—she gave me a shilling—I gave her change, and placed the shilling in the till—there were three sixpences there, but no other shilling, I am quite sure—as soon as she had left I went to the till—I took the shilling out, and gave it to the potman, to go to the butcher's—I am sure I gave him the same shilling; there was no other there—he came back and told me it was bad, and I put it away with the farthings—in about an hour, as near as possible, the prisoner came back, and asked for a quar<lb></lb>tern of rum—it came to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I knew her again—I served her, and she put down a half crown—I heard a <hi rend="italic">jink</hi>, which told me it was not good—I showed it to my husband—he tried it with his teeth, and threw it down—the prisoner took it up again—I said she was the party who came for half a quartern of rum, a short time back, and gave me a shilling—she said she did not know they were bad—I reached over and took the half crown out of her hand—she went out of the door, and my husband said, "Let her go," but I thought it was not right, and sent for the policeman—he took her, and I gave him the half crown and the shilling.</p>

I rent the bottom part of the house, and have the key of that part - the landlord does not live in the house - it is all let out in tenements. I am a washerwoman. I went out on the 4th of March, at near eight o'clock in the evening; I left the property stated in the indictment there, some on my table, some in my drawer; and some in a basket. I returned in about twenty minutes; I had locked my door when I went out, and on my return I found the articles were all gone; this is the property (examining it) - it is all mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Saturday evening, the 4th of March, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, I was in Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner coming down, with two bundles, one under each arm; this was about half a mile from Cox's-court - I called an officer, named Bradford, and we stopped him, and asked what he had got - he said he had just come from his mother's, in Hare-court, and he met a man, who sad he would give him a shilling to carry these two bundles; I asked where he was - he said at the Merry Carpenters public-house, in Old-street. I told him I would give him every chance to find the man, and went to the house with him, but he was not to be found. I then locked him up, and in consequence of taking another man afterwards, with some kid skins, who told me I might find some more skins in a house in Gloucester-court, Whitecross-street, I went there about ten o'clock that night, and found some more property belonging to the prosecutrix. The whole are not more than one person could carry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had not he a right to take the woman into custody where the property was found? A. Witness. There was a woman frying some fish there, and I saw a trunk open - I looked at the things in it, and saw some wet mud on them, which excited my suspicion. I took them, but I did not know they were stolen - they are a part of this property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason he did not is, because Harris, her brother-in-law, is an officer, who was with him. Witness. Yes - I called him to go with me.</p>

               <p>COURT to MARY CHARLES. Q. Tell us as nearly as you can the time you left you house? A. It was just upon the stroke of eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Between eight and nine o'clock at night I met a tall man in Redcross-street, with three bundles under his arm - he said if I would carry two of them to the Merry Carpenters, in Old-street, he would give me 1s.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

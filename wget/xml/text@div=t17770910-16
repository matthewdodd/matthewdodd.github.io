I said he had robbed somebody of a hat and dropped it; upon which he threw down a cap; I took it up, and gave it to some one; the prosecutrix had then fainted away; when she came to herself she related what he had done to her, and I delivered the cap to the lady; by the assistance of Spragg we took him to the round-house.</p>

I said nothing, but to know where he was going; he immediately dropped the cap; Mr. King asked what was the matter? I said, I did not know; upon that the prosecutrix came up and said, she had been robbed of a hat and cap, and the prisoner had left the hat in the road; I said, I supposed that was the cap: on his making use of some horrid expressions to her, she fainted away.</p>
               <p>What expressions did he make use of? - Very horrid ones; he said, he was going on the scamp; he blasted her for a b - h; and said, she assaulted him first.</p>

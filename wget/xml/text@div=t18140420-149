            . I am a carpenter. I was going by the building in Goswell-street, on the 10th of March, some time after two o'clock; I saw a man come out of the ground with two boards on his shoulder I asked him whether Mr. Brown had sent him for these boards; he said, yes, it is all right. I was doubtful whether it was so. I followed him half way down Sutton-street; I then saw the prisoner standing at the bottom of the street, with these two other scaffolding boards. I passed the man I first saw, and went to the prisoner; I asked him who his master was he pointed to the man I first saw come out of the building; he said; he was his master, the employed him to watch them. When the first man saw me with the prisoner, he threw the boards down and ran. The prisoner wished to go after him; I did not think proper. I took him to my yard with the boards, and gave him in charge of a constable. He said he fetched these two boards by the under of the other man, who employed him I asked him who is master was, he declared he did know who he was, nor where he lived. This is one of that boarding to the prosecutor a home is upon it. The other board is in the yard.</p>

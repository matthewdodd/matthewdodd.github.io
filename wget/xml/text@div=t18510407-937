                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Blenheim, Bond-street, Chelsea. On 19th Feb. all the prisoners were at my house—M'Nally, Dogherty, and Wooderson from about three o'clock, in and out, except Wooderson, who did not go out till six or seven o'clock—they had two or three pints of a porter—Cogan came about seven, and I do not think I saw him after half-past—I do not think I saw Wooderson there after six, but M'Nally and Dogherty remained till near half-past eleven—about seven or eight M'Nally and Dogherty, who had been out, brought in the girl White—they all came in sober, and had not been there long before they appeared to get tipsy, M'Nally, Dogherty, and Wooderson were continually sick and unwell about the room between four and six—they actually vomitted—they could not have got drunk on what they had had from me—when White was brought in she came to the bar, called for a pot of porter, and took it into the tap-room, and then began singing loudly—I told my man, she must go—she went away, and I did not see her again—she was not there above a quarter of an hour—I do not allow females in the tap-room—the cellar where I keep my best sherry is immediately under the tap-room—my attention was called to the floor next morning by the potman, and I found a hole, which had been evidently made by this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was of the same size, and had been burnt through, and the board came up easily—there was no nail in it—when that was raised the wine was in view, and a man could get at it by putting his arm down about a foot or eighteen inches—I found my stock of wine in a very disturbed state, and missed about two dozen bottles, at 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman to Mr. Palmer. I recollect the prisoners being at my master's on 19th Feb—I took them in some beer—it did not exceed three pints—Wooderson bad been drinking when he came in, but M'Nally and Dogherty were sober—White came in the evening; she was merry, but I do not think she was drank—M'Nally and Dogherty got tipsy, and Wooderson more so—M'Nally and Dogherty were sick—about eleven I put out the lights, except ohe small one, and laid down to take a nap—M'Nally and Dogherty were then in the room, and a stranger—in about ten minutes I was disturbed by a strange noise under the seat I was lying on—I looked round and said, "What are you <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> up to? I know there is something more than usual <hi rend="italic">up,</hi>" and I saw two wine-bottles standing on the floor, and M'Nally and Dogherty in the same box, about a yard from them—I laid down again and went to sleep, and did not wake again till twelve, when they were gone, and the bottles also—White came in the course of the evening, and commenced singing—I received directions from my master to forbid her singing, and tell her to go, as no females are allowed in the room—next morning, about ten o'clock, I found a board had been raised up, and showed it to my master—On 20th Feb. I heard Wooderson say, in the pretence of Dogherty and M'Nally, to a person not in custody, "Well, what if I did have a few bottles? I wish there was another concern to come <hi rend="italic">off</hi> to-night; who was the worse for it?</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 248). I apprehended M'Nally and Dogherty, and afterwards White, at Chelsea Workhouse—I told her she must consider herself in custody for being concerned with others, now in custody, for the wine at the Blenheim—she said, "Are not you going to have any more?" I told her I had got M'Nally and Dogherty—she said, "Are you not going to have Cogan? he was at the coffee-shop, and helped to have some of it; there was another girl in it"—she said that she and another girl were standing at the end of College-street when M'Nally and Dogherty came, and said to her, "Will you have some wine?" and M'Nally went home, and brought out two bottles, one of which they drank between them at the end of the street, and took the other to the coffee-shop; and she said, "Where did you get this wine from?" that M'Nally said, "From Mr. Palmer's, at the Blenheim"—she said they drank the other bottle at the coffee-shop, and then went back to the public-house; and she called for a pot of beer, and took it into the tap-room; and that she went there for the express purpose of bringing some of the wine away under her shawl; that she took the beer into the tap-room, and said, "Where do you get the wine from?" they said, "Under here" (under the seat), and they could not get it then, because there was a man in the room; she began singing, and Mr. Palmer sent, and ordered her out; she went back to the coffee-shop, and after a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> M'Nally and Dogherty came in with six bottles, and <hi rend="italic">Nipper</hi> Cogan came between eleven and twelve o'clock, and she helped to drink the wine—I after<lb></lb>wards apprehended Cogan at the station, and he stated that when he went into the coffee-shop, there was a bustling of putting some bottles under the seat; and he said to M'Nally and Dogherty, "What bottles are those under there?" and they said, "Why it is that wine from the Blenheim;" and he said, "Why you do not mean to say that is it?"—I apprehended Wooderson on 27th March, and told him he must consider himself in custody for being concerned with the others for that wine at the Blenheim—he said, "I was a d—d fool for having anything to do with it;" he knew he got very drunk on it, and he should like to have some more now, and he would not care where he got it from"—I had been on the look out for him a week—he had been away from home, and I traced him to Lambeth.</p>

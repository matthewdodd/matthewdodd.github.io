               <p>"When I passed the hospital, it was a quarter past ten o'clock." He presently after asked me to let him look at my watch; and as I wanted to know the time, I did; but held the chain in my hand, quite tight. He said, I need not be afraid that he was going to run away with it, and gave me a piece of paper, which he had before told me was a pound note, that he had had the misfortune to tear; on this, I did not hold it quite so tight - he snatched it out of my hand, and ran away. I caught hold of the flap of his coat, and called,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" he broke from me, and I pursued him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken. My watch was found on him.</p>

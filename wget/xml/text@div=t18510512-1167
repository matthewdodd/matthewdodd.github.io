                  </hi>. I am a porter to Messrs. Baxendale. The prisoners were also porters there—it was their duty to load trucks, I remember their loading some tea on the 6th or 7th May, at the goods-station, Camden-town—the chests were sound; the tea could not drop out—it was in Messrs, Pick ford's custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Messrs. Pickford's employ. On 6th May, about ten minutes to one o'clock, I was at work with the prisoners at the side-bank, Camden-town—they were loading tea into trucks from Messrs. Pick<lb></lb>ford's warehouse—I heard Jones say to Wood, "This chest of tea is in rather loose condition"—Wood got into the truck, lifted the chest on the end, poured some tea out, and said, "It is all right"—he got out, and gave Jones two sheets of paper, which he made up into two parcels, and put one into his bosom, and the other into his side-pocket—in about five minutes they left to go home, and I gave information.</p>

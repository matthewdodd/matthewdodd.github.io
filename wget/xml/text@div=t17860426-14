               <p>Between six and seven, on the Sunday evening the 9th of this month, a coach took me up at Osborn's hotel in the Adelphi,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260059"></xptr> and carried me to No. 9, in Orchard-street, Portman-square; there were various parcels, and two trunks put into the coach; there was a deal box which contained the things mentioned in the indictment, all the parcels were taken out of the coach at my lodgings, except this deal box which was under one of the seats of the coach and carried away by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who took the things out of the coach? - The coachman and a servant of Mr. Dalby's who was then with me.</p>
               <p>Is that servant here? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon after the coach was discharged was this box missed? - I do not believe it could be more than a minute or two at the furthest, I instantly ran down stairs and missed the box. I called out to the servant, the coach was drove off, I ran as fast as I could into Oxford-street in order to see this coach; I observed a coach at some distance painted the same colour as the coach that carried me, but it was not the same coach; I then took a coach and went on to the Adelphi stand, I searched all the coaches, I did not know the number of it, the servant described it to me lined with green cloth, I searched different stands but in vain, till nine that night; when I came home; I immediately sent for a porter and ordered a hundred hand bills to be printed, which were accordingly done, and dispersed on Monday by ten o'clock; I had it advertised in the Daily Advertiser, and two men came and desired to see the family that had lost a deal box, they left the number of the coach, and the nick name of the coachman, which they called Green Harness, they could not tell his other name; in consequence of this information I went the next morning to the coach office, and I found the number of the coach, and the man's name as they described; on the Thursday following, I took the prisoner with this coach at the door of Messrs. Stock and Cooper, linen-drapers in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself recollect the man and the coach? - No, I had his master with me, who pointed out the man and the coach to me; I did not recollect either, I should not have known either; I immediately crossed the way, and took hold of him by the collar, and before I said any thing to him, he said, Sir I was at your lodgings to day with my wife, with the box, I asked him why he did not leave the box at my lodgings, knowing it to be my property, and he said that his wife asked for the reward which is three guineas, that was offered; and as I was not home, they had taken it away, and that he wanted money, and had carried the box to the house of one

Stock and Cooper's door, he said he could not get my box without he had liberty to speak to this man, to get some money, I told him he should not, I would pay whatever money was demanded by the Jew, we then went to the Jew's house, Mr. Dalby got out first, and asked for Mr. Mitchel; he came down stairs, and without ceremony I told him to go up stairs and bring me down the box and its contents, which the coachman had left there about two hours before; the Jew did not hesitate in bringing it down, and when he brought it into the kitchen I examined it, it was open, it had no lock from the beginning, but it had a hasp, and was tied very strong when I lost it; when he brought it down there was no cording nor hasp on it, it was quite open; I examined the box and found the waiter, the forks, the shirt pin, and the knee buckles, and the red pocket book, from which all the papers had been taken out: upon opening the pocket book, I found all the papers taken away, and the little implements, such as knives, scissars, &amp;c. were taken away also; I immediately asked the Jew where the bonds and he other papers were, and he declared that he never saw a paper, that he never opened the book, that he never opened the box, and know nothing at all about them; I then asked the coachman if he knew any thing about the papers, he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260060"></xptr> yes, and I believe Mr. Dalby or myself then desired him to tell all he knew about the papers; he then said that the Jew had taken all those papers out of the book, and that he read them all over, but that he gave him a parcel of small papers, which he did not know what they were, as he could not read or write, and desired him to burn the small papers, for that they were of no use to him or any body; he said that the Jew took the papers out of the other side of the book, which were large papers, and that he pretended to burn them, but could not be sure whether he did or not; I then desired the Jew to produce me the bonds, and if he did, I should take no further notice of it; he persisted in denying any knowledge of them; I took the Jew before Sir Sampson Wright, and the prisoner and his master, and there was a Mr. Bond presiding. Mr. Bond examined them, and he committed this coachman, and bound over the Jew to prosecute; he did not think he was justified, he said, in committing the Jew; the reason he gave was, his readiness to produce the box.</p>

               <p>Was you the executor? - I was the heir at law, and executor; the things I found, and the box, were my property.</p>

               <p>How came you by that box, with these things in it, that Mr. Weldon found at your house? - On the 13th of this month, the prisoner, in company with another man and a woman, came to my house; I had seen him several times before; I knew him very well by sight; it might be about three, as near as I can recollect; he came to my house, and said he was in distress, and wished I could lend him a trifle of money; I said it was a wrong time, I could be of no use to him, it was holiday, it was passover; he said if it was but five shillings, it would be a service to him; I then took pity of him; I said I had a few shillings in my pocket, if he would put his hands into my pocket, and take them out, he was welcome to them, only to pay me another time; he was not very ready to do that; but his wife said, I will take it out of his pocket; she took eight shillings, which was all the silver I had; she wanted to return me three shillings, and she said five shillings was enough; I said, no, she must take all the eight. They had some papers in their hands, and they said, why you may as well burn these papers, and I saw him go to the fire, and burn some papers; the woman then opened her cloak, and laid down a box; the prisoner says, Mitchell, be so kind to let me leave this here till I return back, I shall soon be back; I said, yes, and welcome; then I took the box, and put it by for them: about two or three hours after, as near as I can tell, Mr. Weldon and another gentleman, and the prisoner, came to my house, and asked me whether such a thing had been left there as a box? I told him, yes, I shall give it; and I brought it to them, and I thought it was the people that were to come for it, as the prisoner had desired me to save it for him.</p>
               <p>What way of life are you in? - I am a dealer in all kinds of jewellery and watches, every day, except those days that I dare not go out; I wish I had not been at home then.</p>
               <p>Had you the curiosity to look into the box? - No, Sir; but when the gentleman mentioned bonds, I recollected their burning papers.</p>
               <p>The man charged you with burning these papers? - I never burnt any; Mr. Weldon said to the prisoner, you did not burn them; says he, I suppose Mitchell burned them.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>According to your representation of it, you did not ask for any deposit? - None in the world.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Some time; I have done business with the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lend him money before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was you ready to let this man have these eight shillings, without security? - Upon my oath, I did not desire any security, nor never thought of any.</p>
               <p>Should you have let it go, without the eight shillings? - Certainly I should.</p>
               <p>And you did not look in the box? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in this jewellery business? - Fifteen years.</p>
               <p>You saw them burn some papers? - Yes, I heard one of them say, you may as well burn these papers.</p>
               <p>Now, you are generally pretty sharp men, and know the world very well, did not you think how this box was obtained? - I had no present thought at all.</p>
               <p>No suspicion in the world? - None in the world, because I had never heard any thing amiss of this man, nor of the other that was with him.</p>
               <p>Did you take any care for your own security about the box, was the box locked, or unlocked? - It was with a hasp.</p>
               <p>No cordage, or any thing? - It was loose.</p>
               <p>I wonder you was not a little apprehensive of permitting these people to leave a box at your house, without your knowing, or their seeing that you knew, what the things were that were in it? - I had no scruple; I was easily persuaded that it was locked.</p>
               <p>You are a most open, unsuspecting Jew as ever I met with? - I should be sorry it should be otherwise; for there is not a person in the world that will speak against me in any one respect whatever.</p>
               <p>Why, I confess it does require some explanation, when you saw these people burning papers, that you should take no notice of it, and that you should let them leave this box? - They might have gone a message, or many things, and desire to leave a thing there for a little while: this man had never been at my house before; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260063"></xptr> other man said, then, says he, I did not know rightly whether it was in Castle-street, or Castle-court.</p>
               <p>And do you now really expect to be believed? - Why not; any person that is so well known as I am at the court end of the town by every body that knows me, why not trust me.</p>
               <p>From what I know of you, from this story, I promise you I will never leave a box at your house? - If you knew me, very likely you would not refuse leaving it, and there is no person that knows me, can say any thing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I was fetched from the Adelphi to take this gentleman up and the boxes, and when I came there, the waiter and the servants brought out the boxes, and put them in the coach, and I went to Piccadilly; I took up another trunk behind; then they ordered me to No. 9, Orchard-street; when I came there, the footman got down, and opened the door, and I took the trunks and put them in the passage, and one of the gentlemen sat in the coach, and gave me the things out one by one; I carried them into the passage, and I carried the large trunks up stairs, and he gave me sixpence above my fare; when I came down, he asked the servant whether all the things were out, and the servant said yes; I said to the boy, you had better look, to be sure; he said, I know they are; I then altered one of the traces of my horses, which was too long; I went to Marybone tank, and put in there for two hours and an half: when I got off from there, I went to carry a servant, with some boxes and some bundles; I put them into the coach myself, and when I came to take them out, turning up the flap of the seat, I saw this box; I said, this is not your's, says I, I cannot say whose it is rightly, I have carried a gentleman with boxes and bundles, and another person with boxes to the Greenwich stage; I took out the box, and I waited for the advertisement; the next day, when it was advertised, I went to the gentleman's house; my wife carried home the box, and the gentleman was not at home, and they would not give her the reward; and then this other man came to me for some money, and I told him if he would go with me, he should have it; and coming down Oxford Road, I saw a coachman; he asked me how I was; I told him I was rather in trouble, and I told him the whole affair, and he asked me if I knew any thing of such a box, that there were hand-bills about, and I found it was the same, and I told him I had been home with it, and could not get the reward; I said I wanted a few shillings upon it for a day or two, or three, and the man took me to Mitchell's house; he was not at home, and we called again, and Mr. Mitchell came down, and this man told him I was in distress, and wanted a trifle of money, and he would be obliged to him to let me have it; he said he could not touch money, it was passover time; with that, my wife laid down the box to ease her arms, and he took the box, and opened it, and weighed the waiter, and took out the forks and the pins; then the book my wife took to take care of, and he opened the book and took the papers out of the left side of the book, and read them; they were papers stamped and sealed with red sealing-wax, and they were printed and signed with a writing hand; he then said, these are of no use to you, you had better burn them, and he took and put some papers in the fire, but whether he put them all in, I cannot say; then he said they might as well burn the others; with that, I put some little papers, some bills, or something of that kind, on the fire, and he put a coffee-pot on the fire, that they might burn; my wife took the eight shillings out of his pocket, and I came off and I came home, and then my mistress said the two gentlemen had been about the box.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first tell your mistress that you had the box? - On the Thursday.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell her till the Thursday? - I waited for the advertisement, and kept it in my own possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260064"></xptr>What became of the gold shirt pin? - That was left in the box.</p>
               <p>What became of the callico drawers? - I cannot say, they were in the box, as far as I know, I never looked at the box but the night I took it home, then I looked at the waiter, and the spoons, and the pin.</p>
               <p>Is your master or mistress here? - I sent this morning but I was too late, I did not know my trial was to come on to day, he is out with the coach; I have sent for two gentleman to day, but whether they are come, I cannot say. (Called but nobody answered.) I have lived in Leather-lane these nine years.</p>
               <p>Court. As you had given notice to the gentleman in the morning by sending your wife with the box, how came you to suffer the Jew to burn any part of the papers? - I did not know he was going to burn any of the papers till they were in the fire.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Jew how you came by the box? - Yes I did, and that it was advertised.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that you had sent your wife that morning with it? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner since he has lived with this gentleman, I live in the same yard, my husband has known him a great while, he lived with an uncle in Leather-lane, I never heard any thing of him but soberness and honesty.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, in this case the prisoner had not taken possession of this box, the possession was thrown upon him by leaving the things in the coach; I shall take care, as far as it is a new case, to reserve it for the opinion of the twelve Judges, if you should be of an opinion upon the evidence, that there was that sort of fraudulent conduct in the prisoner, and that sort of case appears upon the evidence which would have amounted to stealing it; now although the conduct of keeping it till it is advertised to get the reward, is such as an honourable man would not pursue, yet as to question of crime it is another thing, such a box might be taken by a civil process out of the hands of a man who had found it; but as to the question of stealing, to be sure, such a man would not be guilty of stealing, because the original intention of stealing is essential: now if this man finding the box in his coach, and even having a shrewd guess who it belonged to, detained it in hopes of a reward, and then meant to carry it back; if you think that is the case, the prisoner ought to be acquitted; there is a probability, that when a man had found a box, he would uncord it to see what was in it; on the other hand if the prisoner uncorded the box with a view to embezzle some part of the contents, upon that ground of the case, I think it is proper for consideration, whether the man who is so guilty should not be reached as a felon; and if you find the prisoner guilty, I shall reserve it to be considered, whether it does amount to the crime of felony or not.</p>

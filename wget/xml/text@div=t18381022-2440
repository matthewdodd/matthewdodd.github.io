I saw the prosecutor and Lee both drunk—but Lee was not so drunk as the prosecutor—the landlord turned them out of the house—I saw the prosecutor's pocket was turned out—the prisoner was then at a short distance with another person—I took her to the station house, and asked her what money she had got—she said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which she took in Regent-street, for making a pair of stays—I said, "Get up and give in your name to the Inspector"—she got up, and one shilling dropped from her—she said she did not know where that came from.</p>

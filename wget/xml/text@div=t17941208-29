               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any thing particular having happened in their brew-house the 28th of November last? - Yes, that day, Friday. Between six and seven in the evening I went as usual, to see if the men were about their business as usual, to see if they were filling up the beer, and I found the cock was cut off the leather hole or pipe, that they fill the beer up with, and they could not go on; I then told them to look at the other place, and there was three cut away, and that is all that I know that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how these brass cocks were fixed. - It is a fixture to the leather pipe in the running storehouse, or tun room, where we fill up the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to find out how these were taken? - I could not that night, somebody else did, but I did not till the morning; the next morning the man that went to open the gates, found the lock had been wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing missing the next morning? - Yes, about ten or twelve feet of leaden pipe that was cut off.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the cocks and see if they are the same you marked? - They are; the cocks were left at Union Hall the Friday night till Saturday, and then they were taken to the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>To Purcell. Did you take any property, or see it taken from Union Hall to your Brewhouse? - I did. On Saturday I took and fitted this piece of lead to the place where it had been cut off, and it corresponded exactly; it appeared newly cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any place that had been broke behind the brewhouse? - Yes, I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080119"></xptr>Q. Is that Mr. Hanbury's brewhouse? - Yes; it is called Trueman's brew-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago did you make them? - A year and a half ago; there is part of the work that I make myself.</p>
               <p>Court. To what part are they fixed? - They are fixed to a leather pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that leather pipe fixed to? - To a vat.</p>
               <p>Q. When it is fixed there does it remain there? Is the leather a moveable thing? - The leather is a fixture, but the cock is removeable, and takes off to be repaired. The vat is a fixture to the brewhouse, and the pipe is a fixture to that, and the pipe is only moved about as is convenient, from barrel to barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. When once you put it on that leather it is never taken off. - Unless it is to repair.</p>
               <p>Q. They do not shift these cocks about from place to place? - No; it remains there until it wants repairing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this back or vat? - It is a large tub.</p>
               <p>Q. It is fixed in the freehold? - It is fixed in the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it is as small as this (holding up an ink stand) could you take it up? - No. It is very large.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a tub that is moved about in the brewery from place to place. - It is not. It is fixed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Is it so fixed on account of its weight? Is it nailed and secured? - It is fastened on things on purpose for it, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it as much a fixture to the building as this ink stand is to this book? - No. It is fixed, it is part of the building of the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What size first of all is this back as you call it? - I cannot tell very well the size of it.</p>

            . What is this vat or back? - This is a square vat that stands about seven or eight feet high, it holds about five or six barrels of beer, we pump the beer out from a well into that, and these leather holes are fixed to this vat on purpose to fill the barrels below, and these cocks are placed to the ends of the holes, the leather, are fixed to this vat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this vat part of the building or not? - It is a vat that belongs to the brewery.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in what manner is it fixed? - It is fixed on posts.</p>
               <p>Q. It is fixed on posts, and these posts are fixed on the ground. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. When the vats are not employed, do not these cocks unscrew? And are they not taken off for cleaning? - When we have done brewing we take them off.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they taken off for no purpose than that of mending. - When we have done brewing we take them off and put them by, for fear of having them stole.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you that they are put by at the end of the season? - The cocks and leather is all taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. The vat is less? - The vat is in the frames, which is fixed in the building, and then a frame made round, and the vat is put on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the vat, as light as that inkstand, in this frame work could not you take it up in that way? - No, it is above you; you could not lift it up without unnailing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is the frame work, a fixture to the building? - It is nailed to some part of the building, but I can hardly tell you where. This vat is a fixture.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the lead, that lead was fixed to the building, was not it? - Not to the building, to the brewery utensils.</p>
               <p>Court. The leaden pipes are not taken off, they are fixed to the utensils of the brewery, and the utensils are fixed in the freehold? - Yes, they are.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080120"></xptr>Mr. Trebeck. Unto what utensils they are fixed? - Mr. Purcell will tell you, it belongs to his department.</p>
               <p>Q. To Purcell. Where is this lead fixed? - It is a waste pipe of the jackback engine, and fixed to the brewery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I never did any thing but hard labour for my bread, I heard that there was a man wanting; and I went to the brewhouse to see if this place was convenient; and the first I saw, was the mill boy, and I asked him if they did want a man? and he told me they did; and I saw another man and he told me he could not tell; I called in again on Friday, and the mill boy told me he had a man. It was between three and four o'clock I was there, I staid there some time, talking with the mill boy; and I asked him how many horses there were for the mill? he told me twenty-four of them, I told him then the man ought to have good wages to look after so many; he told me he had sixteen shillings a week for looking after them, and four-pence a piece for harnessing these horses, and something the miller allows him a week; and he said they make more than their wages, by what they make out of the brewhouse, such as bran and corn, that they sell. I asked him which way they carried these things out, he said at the fore-door, says I, does not the watchman see? says he, the watchman will not see. Says he, on the morning, they come up this way; and I am here by three o'clock in the morning, and I give them the key, and they go out of this door; and says I, do not they of course give you any thing? No, says he, they never give me so much as a glass of gin; and I asked him, whether the watchman had any thing? He said, he supposed they went shares in it. After that I went to Ratcliffe Highway, where the great fire was, and came back again; and there was a cart there, and I saw something in the cart, and this sack rolled out from the hinder side, the cart having no tail-board to it; and I was going to halloo to the man that something dropped out of the cart, and there was a gentleman said, he thought he saw the man kick it out of the cart; says he, it is not worth while hallooing after him, and I took it up, to see what it was, and then I took it on my shoulder; there was a woman that came up East Smithfield along with me, and she saw me pick it up, and drag it to the cross-way, and see the gentleman help it on my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What day was it you saw the man there? - Friday the 28th.</p>

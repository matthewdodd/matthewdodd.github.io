On the 1st of August I was reading the newspaper at the Northumberland Arms, Grafton-street, Tottenham-court-road; during the time I was reading the paper the prisoner came in he asked me what news; I told him; with that we exchanged a few words together; he told me that he was a lieutenant in the navy; we drank together; I liked the appearance of him at that time; I asked him if he would come over and lunch with me: it being rather too late when he came, he dined with me; he came the next day and dined with me also; he gave me an invitation to come to the Aurora; he told me at that time that he was commandant and lieutenant of the Aurora which lay at Deptford; I promised him that I would do myself the honour of going and seeing him on board, that was the next day; I asked him to come and breakfast with me, previous to my going on board, he came and breakfasted with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was that? - A. I believe it was the 4th of August he breakfasted with me, and told me the cutter would be at Hungerford Stairs in the Strand, at such a time; we were rather too soon for the tide, and we went and took a walk; during the time that we were walking, he said we should have a very pleasant day to-day I dare say; he said I have been appointed to the Aurora, I am rather short, have you any plate you can lend me; I told the prisoner that I had one silver tablespoon and three silver tea-spoons, he should be welcome to them, and if they were not enough I could get more at my sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am a <rs id="t18051204-22-viclabel139" type="occupation">midshipman in the navy</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18051204-22-victim291 t18051204-22-viclabel139"></join>. He said that would be plenty; when we came to my apartments he began to think it was pretty near time that the cutter would be up, and the flood was pretty near done; he said he would go down by the ebb; I sent for some porter; I just went up stairs to put on a shirt and a coat, and came down again, in about five minutes afterwards the prisoner was absconded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing with him? - A. It struck me a little immediately of the impropriety of my inviting a stranger home; but previous to that I referred to the cupboard, and when I went to the cupboard the spoons were gone; three silver tea-spoons and a silver tablespoon.</p>
               <p>Q. The table spoon and the three tea-spoons that you told him you would lend him? - A. Yes, but he took them without my lending them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he went away that you had seen them? - A. About three-quarters of an hour; I had seen him while he was in the room, and can swear that they were in the room when I left him in the room alone. I goes down to Hungerford stairs to see if I could see or hear any thing of the Aurora cutter; when I got down there I was partly convinced she had never been there; I enquired of the watermen, they said the cutter had not been there, they knew nothing about her; then I gave it up. Last Monday week I was reading the paper at the Bromley Arms, and while I was sitting reading the paper, who should come in but the prisoner at the bar, with a woman, about eleven o'clock in the morning; he comes in; he was rather struck with astonishment; I says to him, how are you; pretty well, I thank you, says he; he leaves the woman that came into the room with him, and goes out into the passage, telling me he wanted to speak with me; well, he says to me, how have you been; I says, pretty well; how have you been, where is the spoons; come, says I, let us walk into the parlour; we went into the parlour again, both together; I just came out of the parlour to go to the bar to get the landlord to assist me in taking him to Bow-street; I had hardly got to the bar, he got hold of the parlour door, he was off in a minute; I asked the woman that followed him, if she knew any thing of that man; she said, what did I want with him; I said he is a thief, I dare say she is the same; I concluded in my own mind that he might hang out in the neighbourhood. On the 29th of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, when I was going up Southampton place, I happened to see him in the middle of the road, I laid hold of him by the arm; I says to him you are a damned thief, with that I had him taken to Bow-street. When I laid hold of him he begged and prayed that I would mitigate the matter, and not take him to Bow-street; he said he had a mother that was not capable of getting her livelihood, that he was the whole support of her. I immediately replies, do you support her by going about robbing; he says no, then says I, are not you ashamed to abscond out of my room without bidding me good bye, and taking my spoons with you; he says, I am; I told him it did not signify for him to endeavour to prevail upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040031"></xptr>me by what he was saying, I was determined to have him to Bow-street. I had him there before Mr. Bond; he was asked whether he was a <rs id="t18051204-22-deflabel140" type="occupation">lieutenant in the navy</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18051204-22-defend289 t18051204-22-deflabel140"></join>; he said that he had been, but that he had been a smuggling lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found out who or what he was? - A. I understand that he has been a lieutenant five or six years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am on the list of lieutenants at this present moment; I commanded the Wolf gun-vessel, I could not pass my accounts; and the cause of my getting acquainted with this young man, he desired me to try to get the R off his name, which I did; I wrote to Mr. Mears for the express purpose of getting the R off his name; he is a runaway mishipman.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Prosecutor.) Is that true? - A. It is not, I belong to a gun-brig.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. After the first two meetings he asked me to come to his sister's house, which I did; he requested me to write to Mr. Mears, to get the R off his name; I wrote to Mr. Ramsden. I know no one single thing of the spoons. When I met him I asked him the charge he apprehended me for, he then told me that the R was taken off, and he was a midshipman to the Zealand at the Nore. It strikes me now that the R is not taken off his name, that he is a runaway midshipman. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Prosecutor.) Whether any part of the prisoner's story is true? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is all the story that you have been telling true? - A. It is true every word.</p>

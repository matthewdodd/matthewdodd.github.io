On the 10th of this month, rather after six o'clock, I saw the prisoner about three hundred yards from the old workhouse going towards London, he had on his head a washing copper, after he had gone on some little way he took the copper off his head, and sat on it, he took the copper on his head again, and after he had gone about thirty yards I tapped the copper on the bottom, I asked him whose it was, he replied, not mine; then I asked him what he had, his answer was, that is no matter; I was behind him, I took him in custody; I told the prisoner to go along before me and put it where he took it from; he went without further direction and put it in its place.</p>

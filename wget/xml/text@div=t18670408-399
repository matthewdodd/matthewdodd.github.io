                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, and live at 17, Carthusian Street—the prisoner is my son—on Saturday afternoon, 16th February, he met me in Goswell Street, and followed me about for half an hour—he asked me what I was going to do for him—I told him I should give him nothing—he said he would follow me and show me up to all my customers—I gave him in charge to constable Mitchell for following me and threatening me.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody by the last witness, about a quarter to four on 16th February, in Aldersgate Street—I told him he would, have to go with me to the station—he said, "What! be taken by a b—like you?" and struck me in the chest with his fist; he closed on me and we both fell to the ground—I held him until I got assistance from another constable, and we then</p>

               <p>tried to take him to the station—he was very violent, frequently kicking our legs and throwing us down—Crouch and McKeogh came to my assistance—I saw him kick Crouch in the lower part of his body and McKeogh in the temple—he kicked Crouch while he was in the act of strapping his legs—I think it took six of us to get him to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 269). On this Saturday afternoon I saw Mitchell and McKeogh trying to take the prisoner in custody—I assisted—I knew the prisoner, aud said, "Now, Constable, come along with me quietly"—he said, "No, so help me God, I don't; I know I shall have six months"—I said, "That is nothing at all to do with me," and caught hold of him to assist the other two constables—we had got a little way when he threw both his legs underneath the wheel of a waggon and called out, "Gee up!" to the horses—we got his legs from there, and had got a little further when he kicked McKeogh and Mitchell, and they both fell—I caught hold of him by the hair and pulled him down to the ground—I took off my belt and gave it to a man named Wilson to strap his legs with, and as I was standing over him he kicked me in the lower part of my body—I called out "Oh!" and said, "You villain, will you kick me there again?"—we took him to the station, and afterwards I went to the hospital, where I was confined from 16th February to 4th March—the kick caused me great pain; I was unable to pass water—after 4th March I was out-patient for a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Harrild and Sons, of 29, Farringdon Street—I was passing Aldersgate Street when this affair took place—I saw the prisoner when Mitchell had first charge of him—he was very violent indeed—he threw his legs under a cart and said, "Drive on and cut my b—legs off"—Crouch gave me his belt to strap his legs with—I saw him kick Crouch—he seemed more like a mad-man than anything else.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 21st of January last, Freeman and I were in company together in Bromley between seven and eight o'clock; I saw the two prisoners; they were walking towards Poplar from Bromley in company together; each of them had a bundle. I asked them what they had got there. At first they seemed surprized at my stopping them, but upon my pressing them again they said they had some sacks. I asked Harvey where he got them; he said he bought them at a marine store shop in the Borough, he gave four shillings and sixpence a piece for them, he said, four months ago. I asked Frip where he got his; he said the other prisoner was to give him a glass for carrying them. We took them to Bow watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there examine them - A. Yes; I found eleven; there are only four here; the others are not marked; only these four were marked I called at Mr. Hills's; he said he had lost a great many sacks. When I stopped the prisoners they were about an hundred yards from the mills, going towards Poplar. These are the sacks.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There are three of the sacks marked with an S; this sack is marked with a V; I can swear to that positively. I hold in my hand the stamp by which the mark is impressed. I have lost a great many sacks of that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these sacks - A. Two shillings and nine-pence each. They are new. I gave five shillings for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Frip called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

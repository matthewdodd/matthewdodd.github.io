                  </hi>. I am an omnibus proprietor, and lodge at the King's Arms, Fulham; I formerly kept it. I first knew the prisoner as a waterman—I know the members of the Association at Fulham, and recommended him to them as a conductor—on the 10th of Nov. he was at my house—Mr. Webb came down from the meeting—a quarrel took place between the prisoner and Webb—he used very bad language, and I said it did not become him, he was getting a living under us—my wife was in the bar; she interfered in the quarrel; I told her it was no business whatever of hers, gave her a brush with my band, and said, "Go along"—a summons was taken out against roe on Monday, and Iappear—on the Saturday I received information; on Sunday morning I went to my drawers, and found they had been stripped of their contents—I made my wife put on her things, and leave the house—she went across to the prisoner's father's—I went to my drawers, and found the whole of their contents gone—in the room where my wife was I found a large portmanteau belonging to the prisoner, nailed and corded, in readiness to be removed—I did not allow them to be moved away—my wife never returned home—on the Tuesday I went with the constable to Mr. Gray's, in Drummond-street, at five in the morning, and in the back room, first floor, we found the prisoner and my wife in bed together—I gave them into custody, and they were taken to the station in Albany-street—they were discharged at the station—I afterwards followed them to Ireland, and gave them into custody—I went to where they lived in Ireland, and found six jugs, fourteen cups, seventeen saucers, six cruets and tops, four chimney ornaments, and other things, in a basket, and two twopenny-pieces in the prisoner's box—they are all my property, and the prisoner had seen them used at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly pot-boy to the prosecutor. On the Thursday before Mrs. Smith left I saw the prisoner, with a hamper in his hand, in the parlour, by the side of the gateway, at the back of the premises—he was packing the hamper with some cups and saucers—I do not know where they came from—I should not know them again—they were different to these—this hand-basket belonged to Mrs. Smith—I had seen both the baskets about the place—I had seen these baskets used by Smith—after the prisoner had packed up the things he told me to come in ten minutes, and when I went in ten minutes it was already corded—he lifted it on my back, and told me to take it to his father's back premises, and told me it was paint for his father—my master had gone up with the <hi rend="italic">bust</hi> to London, and my mistress was in the parlour.</p>

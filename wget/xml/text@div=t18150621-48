            . I keep the French Horn, in Beech-street, I don't know the woman at the bar. There was a woman came to my house about eight o'clock on the evening of the 8th of June, and asked for a glass of liquor, which she drank, and which came to two pence; she tendered me a sixpence, which I said was bad; she said it was good; said, very well, and gave her the change. The moment she went out, Mr. Johnson came in; he asked me what money that woman gave me, I shewed him the sixpence; he desired me to mark it, I did, and I believe he marked it also; there was no body else tendered me a sixpence before, and Mr. Johnson came in so quick, that he saw the woman go out.</p>
               <p>- . I live at the Globe Tavern, Moorgate. The woman at the bar, is something like a woman, who on the 8th of June came in and asked for a glass of gin, she paid for it with a sixpence and I gave her the change; Mr. Johnson then came in. and asked what money the woman had given me, I gave him the sixpence, which had been lying on the desk and was not put into the till. I have got it now, and here it is. The woman at the bar is like the woman who tendered the sixpence, and no other woman had tendered a sixpence.</p>

            . My sister keeps a stationers shop at No. 27, Great St. Helan's. I know the prisoner at the bar, she came to my sisters shop, at about half past nine, on the evening of the 8th of June, and purchased a sheet of paper in payment for which she tendered a sixpence, and received five pence change; I put the sixpence into the till; I am sure there was no other sixpence there. In about ten minutes, Mr. Johnson came in I shewed him the sixpence, he desired me to mark it, which I did, with a pair of shears, and he came for it the next morning; I have seen the woman before.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HOCKLEY. I know the prisoner at the bar, I keep the George Inn, St. Mary Axe. On the night of the 8th of June, about ten o'clock the prisoner at the bar came in and called, for a glass of gin, which came to two pence farthing; and she tendered me a sixpence in payment. I, said it was bad, and told her to change it; she had, drank the gin; just then Mr. Johnson came in, and by his desire, I kept the sixpence, he desired me to mark it; he took her into custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I know the prisoner at the bar for some time to be a common utterer of base money, I saw her on the evening in question a little before seven; she went into the French Horn in Beech-street. As soon as she came out I went in, I got the sixpence there; the landlord marked it, and so did I; I told him to keep it safe, and I afterwards called for it, and got it. I next saw the prisoner go into the Globe at Moorgate; I went in there after she came out; I had looked through the window and saw her tender a sixpence, I went in and marked it, and the landlord marked it too; I followed her down London Wall; and when she came to St. Helens, she went into a stationers shop that was shut up; I did not go in directly, but first followed her to Mrs. Hockley's, she there tendered another sixpence, I desired the lady to keep it; I searched her at Mrs. Hockley's I found sixpence in halfpence, on her and a good sixpence; I then went to Mrs. Berkeley's, and there I got the sixpence she had tendered there, Miss Berkeley marked it with a pair of shears. I next went to the prisoners lodgings where I found a punch stuck up against the wainscoat; it has a mark on it, and is evidently the same instrument with which these sixpences were cut, as each of them has a similar mark. There was a little cream of tartar also and a hammer, also a lapstone which appeared to have had copper beaten on it, and a piece of copper plated, but not cut round. Here are the sixpences which were tendered at the houses of the different witnesses; I have had them in my possession ever since, and they are all marked.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. I am solicitor for the Mint, I am in the habit of inspecting counterfeit money. These sixpences are all counterfeit, they are merely marked and are exactly of the same manufactory.</p>

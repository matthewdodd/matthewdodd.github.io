Mrs. Parry and myself went to church, on Sunday, leaving him and two other servants at home; the bureau was in the dining-room, on the first floor - the servants would not be on that floor. We returned from church about half-past twelve o'clock, and the maid servant immediately asked her mistress if she had locked the dining-room door - she said No; we found it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220033"></xptr>locked, and the key gone. The lodgers on the second floor had gone to chapel - we waited till they came home, to see if they had locked it.

I did not see him again till he was apprehended, about a fortnight ago - he had received his wages on the Saturday night. He said when he first saw me,</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's consin, and lived in the house. I and the prisoner were left at home on Sunday. I went out, leaving him and the maidservant in the house - they were the only persons there. I do not know whether the lodgers were gone to church or not. I returned about half an hour before my cousin - the prisoner had then left the house, and the room door was locked. I thought he might have locked it because I was out; when my cousin returned, I got in through the window, found the bureau forced open, and the cash-box gone, and in about an hour, I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings - he and his wife were gone; we found the cash-box in the room, with the bills in it, but the money gone; some of the clothes he wore that morning were in the room.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and found part of his clothes, and the cash-box, containing all the bills but one, for 31 l. 16 s. 9 d., and the key of the room door was there, but no coin was left. On the 11th of this month, the prisoner was passed from the Borough, as a pauper, to St. Leonard, Foster-lane, and recognized as the man.</p>
               <p>MR. PARRY. This is my cash-box, and the bills are mine - the one for 31 l. 16 s. 9 d., was returned to me by post; they were all in the box that morning. I have only lost the money. I took him from the parish, gave him 5 s. a week, and boarded him.</p>

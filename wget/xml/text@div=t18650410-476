                  </hi>. I am a draper, living at 65, Wellington-street, Wool<lb></lb>ner standing at the corner of the window peeping through a guard—I saw him make a move in the direction of the counter—I went up to him, and asked him what he wanted—he appeared confused—he said, "I want a penny worth of thread"—I served him with it—directly he had gone, I found these shirts wrapped up in this handerchief—the handkerchief smelt of polish or vaanish—the shirts were my property—I went after the prisoner—he had got about fifty or sixty yards when I caught him—I brought him back, and said, "I want you respecting those shirts you have taken"—he said, "I beg your pardon; I hope you are not going to account me of taking them?"—I gave him in charge.</p>

On Monday night, the 11th of January I was sleeping there, I had a blunderbuss which I had charged a fortnight before with shot, No. 3 and gunpowder, and primed it. About three o'clock in the morning I heard a man in the carpenter's shop, in the premises, which awoke me. I got up, took the blunderbuss in my hand, went to the door, and met the prisoner. I collared him, and told him to stop, or I would shoot him, as he was my prisoner. He took hold of the blunderbuss, and a scuffle ensued between us, in which we both fell to the ground - and by seizing me by the throat, and other means he got the blunderbuss from me, and stepping back a few paces, he levelled it at me and pulled the trigger. It flashed in the pan, but did not go off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the flash of the flint only - A. Yes the priming did not flash. He turned round, and ran away, I followed him, and called to him three times to throw the blunderbuss down. He ran, until he came to some pales, and then threw it over the pales into the high road. I caught him again as he was trying to make his escape over the pales.</p>

The watchman brought it to me a few minutes after he threw it away - Mr. Colville, jun. took it into his possession till the morning - he then went with it to the watch-house; I went with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was anything done with it in your presence - A. It was fired off accidentally that day at Queen-square office by a butcher's boy, I was present. I produce a specimen of the shot with which it was loaded.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce the blunderbuss - it was discharged by accident in a room at the office - the shot went into the wainscot. It appeared to me to be shot - I believe it flew back. I examined the wainscot, and found a hole in it about the width of the muzzle; the hole was not through. There appeared to be little holes from the shot within the large hole. I have not ascertained whether there was any shot in the wood - the mark was not there before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might not the mark be from the wadding - A. There were small holes, as if it were shot - it was fired about two feet from the mark. It must have been something hard, to have made the impression in the wainscot. I believe it is a deal wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have been something that rebounded - - A. It might. It was brought to me at the watch-house by Billingsley, about ten o'clock in the morning. I took it to the office, and had it in sight until it went off. No person could have loaded it while I had it. I suppose the powder must have shook into the pan.</p>

             re-examined. I always keep the key of my room, and never leave it open. No person could get at the blunderbuss after I loaded it. Nobody had been in my room during the last fortnight. I make my bed myself, and always lock the door. I go into the room to my meals, and live there by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not go out sometimes without locking the door - A. Never. I loaded and primed the blunderbuss myself. My room is on the ground-floor in the garden - the window is left open sometimes. It has only two panes of glass - a boy could not get in. I am certain he levelled it at me. I primed it when I loaded it, and did not examine it afterwards.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'BRIDE. I am a watchman. On Monday morning I heard the cry of murder in Mr. Colvill's grounds. I went to the spot as soon as possible, and saw M'Cabe, the watchman, coming towards me, and stopped him. I saw the blunderbuss in the road. A watchman, who is not here, came off Chelsea Common, and picked it up - it was in his possession. I went away. M'cabe was present.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM M'CABE. I am a watchman. I saw the blunderbuss lying in the road - another watchman picked it up. Mr. Colvill came, and he gave it to him in my presence. It was out of my sight for five minutes before Colvill came. I returned, and saw it still in the watchman's possession, and saw him give it Mr. Colvill.</p>

            , JUN. I came up, and found the blunderbuss in the possession of Barnet, a watchman of Sloane-square. The prisoner, M'Cabe, and my man were there. The watchman gave the blunderbuss to me - the pan was open and the hammer down. I took it, and kept it in my bed-room till nine o'clock the next morning, as I went to bed again. In the morning I brought it down myself, and took it into the breakfast parlour, and then took it to the watch-house. It was out of my sight about a quarter of an hour, in a room in the nursery.</p>
               <p>Q. Any one could have got at it then - A. I do not know - I cannot say exactly where I left it. Billingsley brought it to the watch-house. I did not see it discharged. I found some shot on the ground. I got to the office about eleven o'clock - it was then gone off - the room was full of smoke. Maybank was in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going into the country to get work, and got over the fence for a necessary purpose. I went across the place, and the prosecutor said he would shoot me if I did not stop. We fell, and in the fall I heard the trigger snap - I ran and threw it away, to prevent his doing me any harm. I never pointed it at him.</p>

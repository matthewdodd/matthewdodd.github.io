                  </hi>. I am a gardener, of Bushey Down, Tooting—on Monday night, 17th, I was by the Plough, at Clapham, with the prosecutor—I had treated the prisoner to some drink, and went out with North—when we got about ten yards off, the prisoner came and asked for <hi rend="italic">a smoke</hi>—I said I had given him sufficient and would not give him any more—he followed us, and I put my watch in my trowsers pocket for safety—I saw North's watch in his coat pocket—about ten minutes afterwards some men came to us from behind the trees; the prisoner was one of them—he followed behind us—the men struck me over the head with stakes, while North was engaged with the prisoner—when I got free, North was lying in the mud—he was out about the face, and his chain was hanging loose—he was all over mud and blood—this hedge stake was lying close to the footpath—we afterwards met a policeman—I had had a glass of ale, but was not tipsy, though excited.</p>

I am a gardener, of Hill House, Tooting Common—I was with Smart at the Plough—I was not quite sober, and have no recollection of what passed—my watch was safe before I came out—I afterwards found myself on the ground, covered with mud and blood—I was so knocked about that I scarcely recollect getting up—I missed my watch, and found my chain hanging loose—I remember nothing about the prisoner.</p>

About 12.30 on this night I was in the Balham Road, about half a mile from the Plough, and heard cries of "Stop thief!"—in a few minutes I saw Smart, who said something to me, and I went back and found North—his face was bleeding, and he was covered with mud—I found this stake dose to him; his chain was hanging from his pocket, and his watch was gone—Smart was in liquor, and North was worse—I looked at him, and saw a bruise on his right shoulder, which might have been caused by this stake.</p>

On the 19th January, the next day, I was with Smart, about 200 yards from where this happened, and saw some persons coming along, and Smart pointed out the prisoner as one of the three who assaulted him—I told him I should take him in custody for being concerned, with two others, in assaulting this gentleman and another, and stealing his watch on Monday night on the Common—he said, "Very well, I will go quietly," and he did so.</p>

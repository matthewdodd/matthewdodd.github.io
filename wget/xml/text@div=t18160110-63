On the 28th of December last, about half past five in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, in company with another man; he asked for a glass of gin; I gave it to him, and he offered a three-shilling token in payment for it; I told him it was a bad one, and he said, he had no more money. He looked round for his partner; but the other man was gone. There was an officer standing on his right side, and he said, let me look at the three-shilling piece; he accordingly looked at it, and marked it; it was the one which the prisoner had given me. The officer then took him into custody, and searched him in a back parlour. The prisoner on my refusal of the three-shilling piece, pulled out two-pence, which was the price of the gin, after he had said he had no more money. The officer found in his waistband six more bad three-shilling pieces. I asked him how he came possessed of them, and he said, he had received them all in change of a one-pound note.</p>

            . I am an officer of the City of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100042"></xptr>London. I observed the prisoner before he went into the prosecutor's house; I had followed him from the Ship in Newgate-street. I then went to the Tun on Holborn Hill. While I was in there, the prisoner came in, and called for a glass of gin, which the prosecutor drew and gave to him; he tendered a three-shilling piece in payment, which the prosecutor rang, and said was bad. I then got up, and went to the side of the prisoner, and caught hold of him; I looked at the three-shilling piece, and saw it was a bad one; I marked it, and gave it to the landlord. I asked the prisoner if he had any more of that kind about him, and he said, he had no money about him at all. Upon that, I took him into the back parlour, and searched all his pockets, and nothing could be found. I then put my hand inside his breeches,and between his thighs in the fore part of his shirt,I found a paper; I took it out, and laid it on the table, and opened it; there were six counterfeit three-shilling pieces, with pieces of paper between them. This is the one tendered to the landlord, and these are the others.</p>

I live at No. 7, St. George's Court, with my mother—I slept in the same room as my mother and father—on 24th of February my father came home late; the chamber pot was on the chair, he said it was not in its proper place and he threw it behind the fire—he then turned to the window, and mother picked up a piece of the pot and threw it at him, it hit him on the side of his ear—he went one step and fell over the wash stand—mother then led him to the arm chair; he was insensible-my brother came down and took him to the hospital.</p>

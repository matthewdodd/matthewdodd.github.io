Then they struck me several Blows with them, and told me, if I made the least Noise, they would shoot me through the Head, or blow my Brains out. Upon this, the third Man came up and put his Hand into my Breeches Pocket; from whence he took Half a Guinea, 7 Shillings in Silver, a Key and a Piece of Nutmeg. When this was done, they asked me, if I had no more Money about me. I told them, they had got all I had, and immediately the Man that rifled me snatch'd my Hat off. Then they left me, and run thro' St. Clement's Churchyard, and thro' a narrow Passage towards Butcher-Row, so I saw no more of them. I am positive Fluellin is the Man that robb'd me, for I very plainly saw him, as he rifled me, by a Lamp within two or three Door's distance from the Place. I am very positive too, to Udal the Evidence; he was one that held me, and I believe Slade was the other: it was a Man of his Stature, but I won't be positive to Him.</p>
               <p>Fluellin. On which Side of the Way, was this Robbery committed?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173809060004"></xptr>Davis. On the Right Hand Side, going from Temple bar, by the Alms-houses, and near the Church.</p>
               <p>Fluellin And pray what Distance was the third Man from the rest, before he came up to rifle you?</p>
               <p>Davis. They were all pretty near together. As soon as the two Men laid hold of me, the other came up.</p>
               <p>Fluellin Well Sir; and what Cloaths had I on?</p>
               <p>Davis. Light colour'd Cloaths, with flat Metal Buttons. My Hat was found at a Pawn-broker's by the Direction of Udal. He was taken up for another Fact, and seeing him accidentally in Newgate, I tax'd him with being concern'd in this Robbery; upon which he made a Confession, and discover'd the two Prisoners.</p>

            . I gave my Information before Capt. Margets. The Prisoners and I, about five Weeks ago, met at the Coach-and-Horses at Temple-Bar, where we staid about half an Hour; then we agreed to go a Street Robbing. We accordingly went as far as Charing Cross; but nothing offering, we came back again to the dead Wall by the Gulley-Hole, - 'tis one Part of the Alms Houses near St. Clement's Church-yard. There Slade and I caught hold of the Prosecutor by each Arm, and run him up against the Wall. Then we held a Pistol to his Forehead, and Fluellin came up, and took out of his Pocket a Half Guinea, seven Shillings in Silver, a Key, and a Piece of Nutmeg. When he had got the Man's Money, he snatch'd off his Hat, and we all run thro' the Church-yard, and down the Butcher Row, to a Publick House, where we shar'd the Money. The next Morning Fluellin and I pawn'd the Hat in Aldersgate-Street for a Shilling, which we divided between us, and then we parted.</p>
               <p>Fluellin. On which Side of the Way was this done?</p>
               <p>Udal. On the Right Hand Side; - there's a Cork-cutters Shop on this Side the dead Wall.</p>
               <p>Fluellin. Where did we share the Money?</p>
               <p>Udal. Fluellin went into a Pastry-Cook's in Fleet-street, and bought a Tart, or a Cheesecake; there he got the half Guinea chang'd; and from thence we all went to the Thatch'd-house in Field-Lane, and divided the Money.</p>

            . About three Weeks ago I went with the Prosecutor to Newgate, to see Udal. While we were there, Udal desired me to go to Justice Margets, in order to his being admitted an Evidence. I went the next Morning; and his Information was taken, in which he told of this Robbery, and where the Hat was pawn'd for a Shilling, which I fetch'd from a Pawn-broker's in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Fluellin Udal the Evidence is a lewd Rascal; he lives upon the Spoils of lewd Women: He was taken up for another Fact, and made an Information to save himself; but finding the People he inform'd against could not be taken, he made another, and put me and my Friend Slade into it. Mr. Car (who is now in Newgate for defrauding a Banker) drew his Information.</p>
               <p>Udal. * Ramsey and I had got some Things from a Surgeon, and I was taken up on that Account. While I was in Custody, Ramsey and Fluellin sent me a Letter, in which they promised me some Subsistence; and this was the Reason I did not put them into my first Information. But when I was before Justice Margets, I thought if I did not inform of all I knew, he would not admit my Information.</p>
               <p>* Ramsey was the Evidence against Car and Cross, for defrauding Mr. Hoare. See Sessions-Paper Number V.</p>

            . I have known Slade 16 Years: I liv'd with his Father and Mother eight Years, and have been always going to and fro the whole Time. For these 13 Months I have regarded his Conduct, and never saw any thing relating to ill, - but on the 9th of July, I met him at the New Church in the Strand, about Three o'Clock, and when the Sermon was over we went together to his Brother's House in Burleigh-street in the Strand, and we were there together 'till Ten of the Clock, - he was never out of my Company; - by the same Token he offer'd to go home with me because it was so late, but I refused him. I have been there every Sunday these 3 Months; for they have a Note of my Hand for Money I owe them, and as they are particular Friends, I always pay them on Sundays. I remember it was the 9th of July, because I made a Memorandum of paying the Money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant major of the Royal Marines, the prisoner is in that corps—I remember the sailor coming to the barracks on this Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening—he gave me some information, and mentioned the prisoner's</p>

               <p>name; in consequence of that the prisoner was brought to me in about a quarter of an hour, and I told him that a sailor had been, and laid a very serious charge against him for robbing him of a sovereign—he denied any knowledge of it, in fact he said he had not been out of barracks—I said it was a very serious charge, not only disgracing himself, but the corps; and if he had taken it he had better see the man, make amends, and settle the matter—he said, "If I have done anything wrong, I am willing to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I can't see why I should pay for two"—I cannot say what he meant by that, except that I have since learned that two of them were in company, and that they divided the spoil—he was apprehended about 10 minutes past 3 o'clock the next afternoon.</p>

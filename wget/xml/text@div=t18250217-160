On Tuesday evening, the 1st of February, in consequence of a message from Mrs. Ladd's, I came home to my lodging, and found my boxes broken open, and missed two coats, two watches, two handkerchiefs, a ring, a pin, and a brush. I had seen them safe at eight o'clock that morning, when I went to work. I left nobody in the room. Debenham had gone out. I have seen the coat and hat-brush since.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH LADDS. I am a widow, and live at No. 8, Gilbert-street, in the parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury. I rent the house. Debenham and the prosecutor lodge in one of my rooms. On the 1st of February, Titswell went out about nine o'clock in the morning; Debenham had gone out between seven and eight o'clock. He came in about six o'clock in the evening, and asked for a light to go up stairs to his room. I gave him one; he was up stairs about a quarter of an hour. I went up to ask him to carry a trunk to Oxford-street for me; he said he would in half an hour. I went into the room; he was doing nothing then; I spoke before I entered the room; he said he was going out, and would return in half an hour. He came down stairs in five minutes, and gave me the light at the door; he had nothing in his hands, and appeared to have nothing with him; only he had changed his clothes. The instant he had shut the door, I went up; lifted up the lid of the prosecutor's box, and found part of his property gone, for I had heard him say his box would hardly hold his clothes, and I found very little in it. I ran down immediately, and went down the street with my son, but did not see him. I sent my son another way, and afterwards sent for Titswell. Owen was taken directly. Debenham did not return.</p>

I went up; Debenham saw me, and made off. Owen stood with his back to me; I collared him immediately, and asked what he had got; he said his own property; I asked what it consisted of; he said a pair of boots, a jacket, waistcoat, and a few other things. I said he must go with me, and let me see if it was so; he objected; I said if it was so, he had nothing to fear. I took him to the watch-house. He had a coat on his arm, and I found a hat-brush in his breast pocket. As I took him to Marlborough-street, he said he had been to Kennington that day, and coming up High-street, he fell in with the other prisoner, who asked him to be so good as to carry this bundle to the Red Lion public-house, Tottenham-court-road, and he would give him a pot of porter. I asked him what induced him to go up that dreadful place; he said, in consequence of Debenham having dropped a coat in the dirt, and he went up there cleaning it. I did not notice whether Debenham had any thing when he ran away.</p>

I had information, and apprehended Debenham next morning (Wednesday) about nine o'clock on foot, going through Kensington. I took him into a public-house, and told him I took him for robbing my son. He said he hoped I would shew him lenity. I said I had nothing to do with that, it depended on my son, but he had better tell where the property was. My son was behind, and gone for an officer. The constable found a pin and a silk handkerchief on him. We found a watch at Townsend's in Little Russell-street; a coat at Harrison's, Drury-lane; a watch, silk handkerchief, and ring, at Reeve's. My son is twenty-two years old.</p>

I saw him go opposite to Mrs. Ladd's house, and look up. I went in, shut the door, and soon after heard Mrs. Ladd's had been robbed. I never saw him before; but I recognised him at Marlborough-street, and am sure he is the man. He was dressed as he is now.</p>

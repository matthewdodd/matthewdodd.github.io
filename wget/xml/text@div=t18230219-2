On the 4th of January, the prisoner applied at the stables for a horse and chaise to hire, for twenty-eight days - he was to pay ten guineas for that time; he said he was the son of Mr. Hale, of Grosvenor-place. I knew there was such a person, a gentleman of property. He said he would have given me a reference to Martin's banking-house in Bond-street, but not being on good terms with his father, he did not like to give too many references at the banker's - that he lived at Hyde Cottage, near Edgware. He also referred me to Mr. Smith's, North Audley-street; I called upon him, but he was not within. The prisoner came again, I told him I had not seen Mr. Smith; he then said he would have referred me to Martin's, as I said before; on his representations, I was induced to let him have the horse and chaise on those terms, and gave him the stamp office ticket for the month. In about ten days or a fortnight, I began to make enquiry about my horse and chaise, and after the month had expired, I found the chaise and harness at Stone's livery stables, Marylebone-street, and the horse at Mr. Parker's of Southall; they were the same that I let the prisoner. I had found the prisoner at the Mitre, public-house, Connaught-terrace, on the Thursday after the twenty-eight days had expired, and asked where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190005"></xptr>the horse and chaise were, he said at Hampstead, and not being satisfied, I took him into custody, and found them in consequence of information; it was a brown gelding - they are now in my father's possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I first applied your foreman stated the terms much higher; but they were lowered in considation of my taking it for three months - Witness. I recollect nothing being mentioned about three months - it was let for one month.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Southall. On the 27th of January, the prisoner came to me in Berner-street, where I live when in town, and said he had got a horse and chaise to dispose of (I did not know him before, but my servant had seen him); he brought the horse and chaise to the door. I sent my servant with him to Mr. Stone's, in Marylebone-street, to enquire his opinion of the value; his hostler said, 20 l. I asked the prisoner where he got the horse and chaise, and how long he had had them - he said about three months, but did not say where he got it. I asked what he was, he said an officer in the army; I asked him if any one recommended him to me; he said, Yes, Mr. Kemp of Pimlico - I had known Mr. Kemp, of Pimlico, upwards of thirty years. He asked 23 l. or 24 l. for it altogether; I said I was informed 20 l. was the value, and would give no more - he agreed to take it, and gave me this receipt for the money (looking at it); my servant wrote the body of it, and he signed it in my presence; it is signed

               <p>Q. Did not you make an express stipulation to take it as a pledge for one month, at a certain interest, allowing a month's keep - A. Never. I said I should sell it again. I said I would have nothing to do with it but buying it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hired the horse and gig under the belief that if I paid regularly for the first month, I was to have it for three months, and before the expiration of the first month, I was unfortunately embarrased, and wanted to pledge it, hoping I should be able to redeem it before the time expired. I applied to Kemp, a pawnbroker, of Pimlico, who said it was not in his way, but that Parker took pledges of that kind, and I went, and saw him in the presence of his clerk - he said, No, it would eat more than its value in the year, but if I chose to make a sale of it he would insure me the return in a month, and if I called on Monday, he would look at it, which I did; he came down, and looked at it. I had said I only wanted 20 l., but on Monday asked for 25 l. - he said,</p>
               <p>"You said 20 l. at first, and 20 l. you shall have." He asked where I lived, I gave him the address; he asked if I would let his clerk drive it into the City to get a bill cashed, and if I called in an hour I should have the money; he agreed to keep it for a month. I returned in an hour, and when his clerk returned he laid the money on the table. I repeated the stipulations before his clerk. I asked him to write the agreement at the back of the receipt; he said he often had dealings of this kind, and never had his credit called into question, and it was not customary to write the stipulations. I gave him the receipt, he engaging to keep it for a month, and said if it was a day over the month, and the interest and keep not paid, he should not keep it. He asked what interest I gave, I said 3 l. would be sufficient; he said 3 l. would be too much, he would say 2 l.; and at the time I pledged it, I had every idea of being able to redeem it before the month expired, and had no idea of making away with it.</p>

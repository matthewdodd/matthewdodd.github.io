I did not like very well their appearance. I asked them how much they had got. She said she had got 3 s. I then took four pair of ear-rings out of the window, which were linked together. I gave them into her hand, and asked her if they were the kind she wanted, if they were I would let her have a pair for 3 s. She looked at them some time; and then the other girl, of the name of Dyke, said they are not the kind you want: you want a pair with knobs. I told her I had a pair, but they came to more money; but as they seemed poor girls, I would let her have a pair. I took a pair out of the window, and laid them upon the counter: Dyke took them up in her hand; the girl, Robinson, at the same time had the four pair in her hand; and, in taking her right-hand, and putting them to her ear, in passing her mouth, I observed she bit a pair off: I then missed the other pair, with the knobs, that laid on the counter; I caught hold of Dyke's hand, to take them out of her hand; one of them was broke, and I ran round the counter, and caught hold of Robinson who had the pair in her mouth. I had nobody in the shop but a boy. I desired her to give the ear-rings immediately out of her mouth: she said she had none in her mouth. I caught hold of her, and pushed her against a stool that was behind her: I then put my finger into her mouth and took the ear-rings out: I afterwards searched her, and found she had only a pocket-book, a few thimbles, and a 6 d. I pushed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150008"></xptr>Robinson then towards the door, she ran away. I was going to search the other's pockets: in the interim a gentleman came in, and I was just going to tell him what happened, when Robinson returned with two women: one of them was seen to take up a handful of mud. I slipt out, and brought Robinson in again. The two women, soon as they saw a gentleman at the door, ran away. I then sent for a coach and took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these two pair of ear-rings? - About 3 s. the two pair, they are not exactly new.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner Dyke was too ill to be tried, at the last sessions? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Mrs. Parker, you desired Dyke to go about her business more than once? - I did, I was not sure that she meant to steal any of these or not.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, if she had it, she might have gone about her business? - She might, I told her twice she might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she only had the ear-rings, but did not do any thing with them? - She had them in her hand; I thought it proper to take care of them, when I saw the other bite one pair off.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take them from her at the time? - I did, and have had them in my custody ever since.</p>

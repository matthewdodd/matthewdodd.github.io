               <p>Q. Was it before or after the conversation? - After that she took the money from me, the same time while she was speaking these words.</p>
               <p>Q. You must describe in what manner she took the money from you? - By taking of me quite round the waist, and then picked my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. And you felt your money go? - No, I did not, I plunged myself from her, and wished her a good night, and she said I might go to hell if I liked, the half crowns were in my breeches pocket, I had seen them in the afternoon when I was at play with my little children.</p>

Halloo, said I, you have robbed me, in the mean time of my speaking these two words, she dropped the two half crowns on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150034"></xptr>pavement. I heard them fall before I catched hold of her, then I charged the watch with her, and picked up the half crowns myself, I see them fall from her, she dropped them out of her hand, I know them to be mine, because I was at play with them along with my children, there is two plain heads, and one a plain tail, and the other quite smooth, (the half crowns produced, and shewn to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Mr. Small, how came you not to say any thing about this handkerchief before? - Because I did not find it on her, but I believe it was written in the letter before the magistrate: indeed I forgot it now, I never found it, it was a new handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you say you lost more money than the two half crowns? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge her with an highway robbery? - I never charged her with a highway robbery no more than they please to put down, I never charged her than of robbing me of my money.</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the firm of Rankin and Vick<lb></lb>erman. The prisoner was in our service in Jan.—on his receiving these two sums his duty was to have made a short memorandum in the book, and have handed the money to out cashier—the memorandum has not been made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was your cashier on 18th Jan.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Walker—he has been our cashier since the beginning of this year—Mr. Hurton preceded him—I think it was in the early part of Feb. that I was first aware that these two sums had not been accounted for—to the best of my recollection Mr. Johns first informed me of it—I said he had better ascer<lb></lb>tain to what extent it had gone, and let me know—he afterwards told me the prisoner had made up a story of his having been robbed of this money, and that he produced a portion of a bank-note, stating that the other part had been forcibly taken from him—I do not recollect that he told me Cooper had directed him to come and tell his master—I am not aware that the prisoner used to make disbursements for the office—it was not his duty—an account for stamps was shown to me—I did not admit it; I expressed surprise, because we generally have a stock of them in the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-ecamined. Q.</hi> You have been cashier a short time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it commenced this year—it is the duty of the persons who receive money to make a return of it to me—I am not aware that if they receive a moiety they keep it till they have received the whole—it was not the collector's custom to keep what they had by them for a day or two till the persons paid the re<lb></lb>mainder—I cannot swear that it was not sometimes done.</p>

                  </hi> I am managing-clerk in the house of Rankin and Co.

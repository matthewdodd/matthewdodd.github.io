               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>B. Dunn. This was betwixt nine and ten at night. On the 8th of May he overtook me, and took hold of my arm; I said, what business have you with me?</p>

               <p>Q. Did he strike you hard?</p>
               <p>B. Dunn. No, it was very lightly with his hand; then I said, very well, I'll know you to-morrow; I went home for about a quarter of an hour, then I went to his wife, and told her what he had done; she said he had served me right, what had she to do with it. The next morning I went to his mother's, and was told she was in the workhouse; then I went to the constable that knew him and me; he took his handcuffs, and brought him and me before the Justice at Guildhall. I got nothing again.</p>

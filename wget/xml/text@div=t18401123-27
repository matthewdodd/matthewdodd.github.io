About six o'clock in the evening on the 24th of October, I was drawing a truck with two paper parcels, a trunk, and two boxes—some one told me something—I looked, and missed this parcel—I saw the prisoner with it in his arms—I went after him—he was walking on the pavement—I collared him, and told him the parcel was taken from my truck—he said it was found at his feet, and afterwards that a man had put it into his arms—he struggled to get away—he knocked my hat off, and got a short distance.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, at 7, New Square, Lincoln's Inn. The prisoner came to my chambers on 29th June—he asked me if my clerk was in—I said he was gone out for a short time, but would be in shortly—he said he came from Messrs. Davis's respecting a fee of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an extra fee on account of difficulties respecting certain papers—he did not say he came to pay it—he said his call was respecting this fee; and he said he was quite sure Messrs. Davis would pay it—I expressed my regret that they should have the trouble to send about it—while we were talking, the clerk, Mr. Marsh, came in—I accordingly left the clerk's room, to which I had gone, and went into my room—I rather thought I should see the fee come after, but it did not—the prisoner certainly did not pay me—I did not receive from my clerk any account for the purpose of my clerk signing it—the clerk came in, and I left it to him to attend to it.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe this 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was made up of two fees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was it; you said Mr. Davis was a perfectly honourable person—I think you produced the bill—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner, ray brother Thomas; we are solicitors, and live at 25, Coleman-street. The prisoner was in our employ, as clerk, in June—he had been so since the 10th or 12th of April—I am a client of Mr. Williams'—on 29th June I gave the prisoner this account, with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In gold, to pay it—the amount is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was going to the westward—I saw him on his return, about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon, he then told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160006"></xptr>
               <p>me he had paid Mr. Williams himself the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he told me he had left the account with Mr. Williams to be receipted, and that Mr. Williams never receipted accounts himself—he said I should have it the next day—I did not have it—the last day the prisoner was in my employ was on 1st July—he went out on business, and I did not see him afterwards till 7th July—I had no notion whatever of his leaving my employ—on 20th July, after he had been before the Magistrate, I found this account amongst the papers of a suit in Chancery, which no doubt the prisoner had had occasion to use—on 7th July I heard he was in the lower part of the house, and I went down, and found him in the passage—he complained of my having spoken harshly to him, and I accused him of what I termed embezzlement—he stated that he had lost two sovereigns of the money, and he meant to make it good—I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> There is no other office there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Our rooms are the only offices that are occupied; I have no recollection that you offered any explanation, or said that you came to explain—you did say you had come to make up your account, but you had no account to make up—I keep a cash-book—if I gave you money to pay, it was your duty to enter it in the cash-book, but that only applied to petty amounts—this was a transaction by itself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it his duty to enter in the book what he paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Either myself or the clerk enter those amounts, but these sums are generally a few shillings—when it is a large amount I make it a transaction by itself—I always supply the clerks with money for the small sums—they are never called to pay money out of their own pockets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You say it was only usual to enter small sums in this book; I see here is an entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I believe there are others as large? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be instances of that; you never had any notice from me to quit, nor I from you—I inquired about the key of your desk—I do not know that I knew about the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. then—I am quite clear that you said you had left the bill—I have no doubt I could have found where you were, from the information of the clerks—I do not recollect anything about your saying you had come to explain.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say on 29th June that he had lost the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he stated that he had left the money with Mr. Williams himself, and this entry in the cash-book I made myself at the very period of his making that statement to me—I had not the least notion of his being about to leave me—he was employed in some Chancery suits, that required daily attention—I knew that he lived in the neighbourhood of Goswell-street, but his direct address I was not acquainted with—my clerks knew it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Williams. I remember coming in on 29th June, when the prisoner was there—my master went into his own room, and left me with the prisoner—he produced an account to me of some office fees that had been made before, and some extra fees that had been omitted, and he asked me if I would give him an account of the fees that were then due—he said Messrs. Davis were very good ones to pay fees, and he would bring them up in a few days—he did not say he had lost the money, or had got the money; nothing of the kind—I gave him the account of the remaining fees, and he left the office, taking the account away with him—he did not leave it with me to put the receipt to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is very true what is stated by Mr. Davis and Mr. Williams; the fact is, having other business to do, it was my custom to put down the daily work on a slip of paper, which I carried in my waistcoat</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160007"></xptr>
               <p>pocket; I changed the half-sovereign, and the three sovereigns I wrapped up in my daily list, and put it into my waistcoat pocket, and, going to other places, I must have dropped the money; Mr. Davis knows how difficult it is for a clerk to state to his employer the fact of a loss; I told him I had paid it, but I had lost it; how it was I cannot say; I did not go to the office again till I had used my utmost exertions to make the money up, but, not having done so, I went for the express purpose of telling him the fact; if I had absconded it would have been a different thing, but I never kept out of the way; he knew where to find me; I could have had a good character from a gentleman with whom I lived seven years, but he is dead; and my late employer, with whom I lived four years, is in Brussels; I only regret my error in having stated that I had paid it, but I did it hoping to make it up; if I had stated that I had lost it, it would not have been credited.</p>

               <p>Q. Before the number of this note, I see the letter T. I will ask you whether there are any other notes of the number 8042 with the letter T. before the number of them - A. No. There is with the letter S.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any of this number without any letter at all before them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any note of this description, answering in number, but with a different date - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. Mr. Patterson is the principal. There is another clerk besides myself, who is not here; he enters notes as well as I do. In speaking of this note, I speak from the books here. The entry is in my own hand-writing. This is the note issue book; it begins in 1809, and ends on the 30th of October, 1813. All the entries in this book, are in my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that no notes have been issued from the year 1809, to the year 1813, but such as have been entered in that book - A. Not of that letter and number.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other issue book - A. Yes; with different numbers that are done out with. There are other books with other letters, which I have left behind me. But there other books in which another clerk made entries.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you then venture to swear that nobody else has entered a letter T-A. The letters follow regularly, and the letter T is in no other book but this. We issued none without any letter, except before I came to the Bank; none dated 1813, were issued without a letter. Those without letters are not all in yet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it the course of your Bank to have a separate book for each letter - A. We go a certain number of Ss, and then begin Ts. The beginning of the Ss is in a former book; but there are some here in this book.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Coxe and Merle, who live in Little Britain. I am enabled from an entry in my waste book to say that a Dorchester Bank note came to our house on the 22nd of August last. (Reads.) "22nd August, Wilson, Dorchester Bank, 8042, Ten pounds." That is the whole of the entry. Then follow the notes which were given for it; I made no entry of the letter in this book; but I made an entry of the letter in the day-book, which is not here. The notes I gave in payment were eight one-pound notes, from 72,543, to 72550 inclusive, all dated August 3rd; I have no memorandum of the year, and two more notes dated 4th of August, No. 52611, and 52612; I received these notes at the Bank of England either on that morning or the morning before, I can't be sure; it was not further than the morning before; they were new notes, and had not the appearance of having been in circulation, because they were running numbers. The name of Wilson in my entry means that the person to whom the notes were paid stated his name to be Wilson; I have no recollection whatever of his person This note was brought at about three o'clock I should think in the day; it could not be much before or after; I know it was that hour, because the day book is balenced soon after three, and I observe there are only one or two entries after this; I made an entry in another book. (The note put into the witness's hands.) I know this to be the same note; I look at my day book, by which I know it to be the same note. Here is an entry of my own "to letter T 8042." That entry was made on the same date; but not until night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you any other number 8042 with the letter T - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. When I say it is the same note, I mean it corresponds in number and in letter; there is no mark upon it, which enables me to know it. I believe there was a little error in my entry, I believe it ought to be 51611, and 51612, instead of 52611, and 52611; we got the numbers afterwards from the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other payments in the fiftyone thousand - A. Yes, there was a payment on the 23rd of August, of 51623; I had notes from 51601, to 51610, that was previous to this payment.</p>
               <p>Q. The entry which you made at the moment of payment is fifty-two thousand - A. Yes; that entry I made from the notes. I have received information from another quarter that that entry is wrong. I have not yet had any other errors in my entries corrected.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTHOVEN. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. I issued some notes to the house of Coxe and Merie previous to the 22nd of August, I issued fifty one-pound notes, and various others, amounting in the whole to nine hundred pounds; there were amongst the rest from 51601, to 51612, dated 4th of August; I have no entry of the year; but it must be last August; for they were new notes; I do know from another entry, and from mine being the hand that paid them, to whom the notes 52611 and 52612 were paid to Messrs. Willis and Co. on the 26th of August; they were bankers, and those were new notes also.</p>
               <p>MR. HIGMAN. I produce a book, in which I made entries of the numbers of the notes which Mr. Northoven has been speaking of; he called the numbers out to me, and I entered them as he called them, from 51601 to 51612, were paid to Messrs. Coxe, Merle, and Co. and the two notes 52611 and 52612 were paid to Messrs. Willis, Wood.</p>

            . My situation in the Post Office is clerk in the Receiver General Office. I have seen the prisoner as a letter carrier, in our office to pay his charge. (The note 51611, put into the hands of the witness.) I received that note in payment of a charge; but I do not remember from whom; I suppose from the prisoner, by his name being on the back of it; his name on the back is not in my hand writing; it is the duty of the letter carriers to write their names on the backs of the notes which they receive in payment for the postage of letters. The name on this note is "John Cutler." I received this note on the 23rd of August, in the last year. I have no recollection of what time in the day it was paid, but I suppose it was about nine, half past nine, or ten, in the morning, which is about the time the letter carriers go out. It is the duty of the letter carriers to pay their charge into our office; that payment is a payment of money they have received on the two days previous; therefore the payment on the morning of the 23rd, ought to be the receips of the two days before; we receive only three times a week, and never in the evening: always before the letter carriers go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. How do you know you received it on the 23rd - A. By my entry.(Reads.) "23rd, eight," that means the 23rd of the eighth month in the year.</p>

            . I am a letter carrier. I know the prisoner at the bar. On the 22nd of August last, he was a letter carrier; he was an assistant to the Brunswick-square division; I am not certain whether Barton Crescent is in that division. (The note No. 72547, put into the hands of witness.) I received that note from Cutler, on the evening proceeding my paying it into the Treasury, at a house in Fulwood's rents; it must have been on the 24th of August, and I paid it in on the 25th; he wrote his name on it in my presence, (reads,)"12, Bar. Cresc." which means Barton Crescent.</p>

            . I am the son of Mr. Parkins, Post Office Solicitor. I was at the examination of the prisoner at Bow-street, on the 24th of October. (The five notes proved to have been in the possession of the prisoner subsequent to the 22nd of August, put into the hands of the witness." I received these notes at the Bank of England; the numbers are 51611, 72543, 72548, 72549, and 72547. I shewed them to the prisoner previous to the examination. I did not tell him that the best thing he could do would be to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say with respect to them - A. I shewed him each note separately, and his name on the back of it; he admitted that the name on each of the notes was his own hand-writing. 51611, he stated that he received it at 26, Lucas-street, on the 22nd of August; he stated that the words 26, Lucas-street, August 22nd, were his hand-writing, and that his name written under it was also his hand-writing; 72547, he stated he had received at Barton Crescent; but he could not say the date, for that was not upon it; he also admitted it was his hand-writing on that note; 73545 he stated he had received of Mr. Webbe, in Gray's-inn-lane, at the Nags Head public-house; 72548 he also said he received from Mr. Webbe; 72549 he said he had received at No. 8, Guilford-street.</p>

I paid him a one-pound note on the 22nd of August last, at about two o'clock, I believe I did not pay him a one pound note on any other day in August last, that I recollect. When I speak of two o'clock, I mean about that time; I don't know what sort of a note it was that I paid him; but it was a one-pound note, which I received from Mr. Bennet either that day or the day before; my master did not give it to me while the postman was at the door; I can't say at what time he gave it to me; I don't recollect what sort of a note it was, whether it was new or old.</p>

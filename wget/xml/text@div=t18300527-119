               <p>THOMAS, LORD RANELAGH. On the 17th of May I hired a boat, and took off my coat and waistcoat to row - I placed them and my watch in the bottom of the boat; the watch had been in my watch in the bottom of the boat; the watch had been in my waistcoat pocket - I took it out, and placed it under one of the benches; when I had quitted the boat a minute or two, I was told by Mr. Biddulph that my watch had been taken, and I saw the prisoner deliver the watch to him - he was not at all concerned with that boat; he had just landed a passenger from another boat.</p>

            , ESQ. I was with Lord Ranelagh, and saw the prisoner take the watch from the boat his Lordship had just quitted - he put it into his right-hand breeches pocket, got into his own boat, and was pushing off; I jumped in, and demanded the watch of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What distance was the boat you got out of from the shore? A. There was one boat between that and the prisoner's; his Lordship had quitted the boat perhaps a minute - there were eight or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270060"></xptr>ten boatmen about the stairs; any of them might have seen the prisoner take it - the waterman was in the boat his Lordship had quitted, but his back was turned towards the prisoner. The prisoner had not inquired for the owner - he jumped into his own boat, and was pushing off; perhaps twenty minutes elapsed before the prisoner was taken - his Lordship had hired the boat at Battersea.</p>

            . I took the prisoner, and produce the watch; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>LORD RANELAGH. This is my watch; I had asked for my clothes; I was putting them on, and then I should have asked for the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had left the boat? A. Yes, and the man had given me my waistcoat out of it; I am a Viscount.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is common for us to step over one another's boats, and any one might have taken it; it is no place to lay a watch - it is as common as any place can be; I did not take it to keep it: I meant to make my boat fast and take it up to the stairs - when the gentleman asked me for it, I gave it him; had I been disposed I could have thrown it overboard.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

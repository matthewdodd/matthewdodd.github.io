                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor in this case—I was married on 15th March, to the prisoner—I first became acquainted with her on board a steam-boat, on an excursion to Sheerness—I saw her again some time after that at Clerkenwell police-court—after I met her there the acquaintance was kept up and we ultimately married—I made a great many enquiries about her, and I found out from a good many people that she was a highly respectable woman—she said her name was Ann Daniels, and that her husband had been dead ten years.</p>

               <p>(81 <hi rend="italic">D</hi>). I knew the prisoner when I took her in custody—Kirkaldy went with me to the house—when she got to the station she said to him, "Kirkaldy, when you married me you told me that my husband, who was transported was dead, and you were satisfied that he had died three months after our marriage"—Kirkaldy denied that—I know that the first husband was transported, for burglary—in 1848 he went out of this country—I found a certificate in the drawer relating to John Daniels; this is a copy of it; it is not the original.</p>

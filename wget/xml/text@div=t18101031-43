               <p>Q. What day was it you lost the shilling and sixty penny-pieces - A. On the 13th of October, they were in my front shop; I had seen them in the shop the night before; the penny-pieces were in a five shilling paper on a shelf; I had missed some two days before, that made me mark them. On the preceding night I marked the outside paper with my initials, about ten o'clock at night; about six o'clock the next morning I concealed myself in the shop, in a few minutes there was a ring at the bell, the prisoner came down stairs and let in one of my journeymen; the man came in, crossed the yard, and went into the workshop; I heard the prisoner follow him across the shop at some distance, and presently returned and went to the till. I had left out twenty shillings in my till to give change; the key was in the till, she unlocked it, I heard the silver in the till rattle, and the paper of halfpence moved on the shelf; she went out of the shop, and I immediately followed her, I asked her what she had got there, she said, nothing. I looked in her hand, I saw a shilling and a paper of penny pieces; she said it was the first time, she hoped I would forgive her. The shilling was marked, and also the paper of penny-pieces. I have kept the shilling and the copper money ever since.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence; called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

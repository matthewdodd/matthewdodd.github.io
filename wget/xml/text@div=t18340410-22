On the 24th of March the prisoner came in at a quarter before nine o'clock - he called for a cup of coffee, and sat down near the mantle-piece, where the time-piece was - he called for the Times newspaper, which I gave him - he then called for the Dispatch - he sat there at ten o'clock, when I went and put too the shutter - I then saw the time-piece was safe - the prisoner sat there till half-past ten o'clock - I then went to the door, and as I stood with the door in my hand, he got up, came past me, paid me 1d. for the cup of coffee, and said, "Good night" - I turned my head, and missed the time-piece - I pursued him - he had not got out of my sight - I followed him into Craven-court - he then ran, and the policeman took him - he took the timepiece from under his right arm, and threw it on the ground - I took it up.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 10th of May there were a great many riotous people assembled by the Mansion-house, between nine and ten o'clock at night; after they had broke a great many windows and lamps, I took my hat and stick and went out among the mob; I stood to see if I could apprehend who broke them; for half an hour I stood near the prisoner Woodcock, I stood rather behind him; I saw him take a stone out of his pocket and look at it several times, and fling it directly at the second lamp on the right hand; I saw it go part of the way to the lamp, and heard it break it.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people might be assembled together?</p>
               <p>Hale. It is impossible to give an account; they were very riotous in flinging stones and d - ning my Lord Mayor, wishing they had him out, saying they would kill him; they broke several windows more that night than the night before; we did expect we should have been in more danger than the first night; the furniture was damaged the night before, but not that night; after he had flung a stone, he would say that was well done when a window was broke; then I went and told the constables I had made observations of a man that broke a lamp, and if they would assist me we would take him; the people were hallooing and hissing; the constables came out with me, with intent to take him; at last they grew very outrageous, and demanded money of several coaches; I did not see the prisoner demand any, but he would make the people say who they were for; I kept close to him; the mob cried Wilkes and liberty; I said, you had better not stop coaches and demand money, that may be termed a robbery; I then gave Woodcock a shilling; after that he kept close to me and seemed friendly; I did not see him do any thing after that, only make people say who they were for, and call Wilkes and liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take him instead of giving him the shilling?</p>
               <p>Hale. I feared the mob would be too strong for us; we took him about half an hour after</p>

            . I was with my fellow-servant; the prisoner had got three or four more along with him; he asked me if I knew any good fellows<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060066"></xptr> that would come round the Mansion house to break the back windows; he said, we could break a good many before any body comes to us; I said, we have several here, and we will go round with you; I said, what shall we do for stones; he said he had been to the Borough or to the King's-bench, and had got a pocket full of stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your Lord's livery on?</p>
               <p>Stinton. No, I had a black waistcoat on, I had altered my dress; upon his saying this, my fellow servant laid hold of him, and we got him into the house; we ordered the constables to search his pockets, and there were four stones taken out of his pocket which the constable has now.</p>

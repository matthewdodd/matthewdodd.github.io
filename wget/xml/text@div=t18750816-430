                  </hi>. I live at Hope Cottages, Northfleet—on Friday, 26th February, the prisoner came to my place and wanted apartments—I let him two bed-rooms which communicated by a door, and a sitting-room—he said he required two bed-rooms and a sitting-room for his sister and himself—he said "I will take the place for three months, and if I don't stay I shall pay you"—he said he would come on Monday, and bring his sister probably on Thursday—he came on Monday 1st March and Miss Tremlett came with him; he said she was his sistor—they stopped over a week—they went out together and absconded, they knocked at the inner door, and the young lady asked if there was a back way where they could get out—I said we had not a back way and they went out by the front—I said What about dinner?" she said "We are only going for a short walk we shall return shortly"—he did not say anything—I did not see him again till he was at the police-court.</p>

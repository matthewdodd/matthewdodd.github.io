I lost a sow pig, on the 27th of March, I found it on the prisoner, in his sack, dead, the same day, between five and six in the evening; he had a sack on his back, and the pig being fresh killed the blood was running out behind, he had only part of it in the sack, the two quarters of one side, and half a head and two feet; he was in the street when I stopped him close by my own door, I missed the pig about half an hour before; I know the prisoner, he belongs to Mr. Morgan's brewhouse, it goes by the name of Picard's now; I examined him concerning the pig, and he owned that the property belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise, or use any threats to induce him to discover? - First of all when I stopped him, he said that he knew the property was mine, and begged I would not expose him in the street, if I would go home with him he would give it me, he said there were three others concerned, and then he would send for the other three, and they should pay me what I pleased to charge for the property; I made answer, that if he would pay me for the property, on account of his family, I would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you knew the prisoner at the bar? - I did, he is a <rs id="t17940430-24-deflabel125" type="occupation">brew-house servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Mr. Picard employs a great many servants? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Your pigs are running about in the street? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they never strayed into other persons premises? - They might stray in the brewhouse for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. When a pig strays into the brew-house, don't the brewhouse servants think it belongs to them, and immediately cut it up.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall not take such a question.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man came up to you he was coming up to your own door? - He was taking the pig home to his family; he has four children, and his wife ready to lay-in again.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you say any thing to him, that it would be better for him to tell all about it? did you say any thing to him till he got home to his wife and family? - He owned at the time that it was my pig.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was a side of pork? - It was quite hot.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw a side of pork it had been scalded? - But there is a difference between my scalding a pig and them that don't understand it. I can give you the description and marks of the pig likewise, a bit cut out of the ear and off the tail, only the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long he has worked at this brewhouse? - He has lived there twice, six months each time.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this man had maintained an extreme good character in the brew-house? - I never heard any otherwise.</p>

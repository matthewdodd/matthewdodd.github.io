On the 6th of February, just about six in the evening, I was informed the prisoner was at Mr. Bullock's window, attempting to cut a pane of glass with a diamond. He had been at our window several times trying to cut it. I went out at our back door, and crossed the way to him. I laid hold of his collar, and saw he had the end of a piece of handkerchiefs, and had got it out at a hole through the glass, about five inches. A person that lives with the prosecutor came out, and we took the prisoner into the house. We found the diamond afterwards upon a boy that was with him.</p>

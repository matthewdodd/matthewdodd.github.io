                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Michael Davis, of the Blue Posts, Berwick-street. I had been there seven months—I had been there when a man named Ashton was barman—he went away in Oct.—I had seen the prisoner there during the time Ashton was there—I knew him—I met him going up Broad-street, nearly three months before he was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody at the latter end of Oct.—he asked me if I wanted any money "worked" for me—I said no, I did not want any—he said it would be a great deal to my interest if I worked any—I said no, I never worked any, and did not wish to have any worked for me; that was all I said to him at that time, and we parted—I had heard "worked money" spoken of by my master, and had</p>

               <p>read about it in the newspaper—I communicated to my master what had passed between me and the prisoner—about six weeks after my first conversation the prisoner came to my master's house—my master was in the bar at the time—he did not say anything then—on the 5th of Jan, my master gave me directions, in consequence of which I went to Lambeth-square, New-cut, where I thought I could find the prisoner—he was not in the way, am I wrote this note by my master's direction, and left it for him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Williams will greatly oblige me by calling on me at Mr. Davis's, Blue Posts, Berwick-street, as I have got a little business for you to do for me upon what you spoke to me about a little while ago")—I left it about five in the even<lb></lb>ing—about half-past seven he and his wife came to my master's house—I saw them outside the door—the prisoner came and patted me on the shoul<lb></lb>der—I said I did not expect to see him down so soon—he said directly he got the note he came down—I asked if he could come on Saturday evening—he said perhaps I could give him something that same evening—I said he could come in if he liked—he came in, and bought some liquor with a six-pence—I gave him the proper change—he came a second time the same even<lb></lb>ing—I drew him a glass of liquor—he put down a shilling, and said, "On to it now"—I did not give him any more money than he was entitled to then—on the following Sunday I saw him in the street, and walked with him along Compton-street, and down Covent Garden-market, into the Strand—I went to the Red Lion there, and had a conversation with him about Ashton—an arrangement was made between me and him that he was to come down that evening, and come in once or twice in the evening, and I was to give him what I could each time—he said he was to put down a shilling, I was to take it up, make a pretence of putting it into the till, take out two or three more, and place it on the counter, end he was to take it up, and if he was to come in again, I was to rub my arm, if not, I was to put out my finger—I told my master all that had passed—the prisoner came in twice during that evening—on the Monday he was to come again—I saw some money marked, and put into the till—he came between seven and eight in the evening—an officer was sent for—the officer had arrived when the prisoner first came in that evening—I did not give him any money the first time—he came in again and bought a pennyworth of gin—he put down a shilling—I then gave him four marked shillings, the shilling he gave me, and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—directly my hand was off it, he took it off the counter and put it into his right hand pocket, and was going to walk off with it, when he was seized by the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the C division of police. On the afternoon of the 9th of January I saw the boy Lincoln come out, and the pri<lb></lb>soner was standing at the corner of Compton-street—I went on the following evening to the house—the prisoner came in—I searched him, and found on him five shillings and some copper—the next morning he wanted to have some coffee—I said, "No, I must keep this money"—he said, "It is my own money, I brought out six shillings, and I changed one shilling"—when I first seized him I found the money in his pocket—I showed it to Mr. Davis, and he identified four shillings of it as his money—the prisoner had just got to the door, when I seized him—he was not out.</p>

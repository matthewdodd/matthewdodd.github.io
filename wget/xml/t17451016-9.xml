            . On the 21st of December the Prisoner offered me some pieces of silver to sell ; I asked him how he came by them; he said he found them in the Park. He went out of my shop, and a gentleman who was coming by spoke to him; when I saw he went farther than my door, I said, young man don't leave your silver in the shop, but come back and take it: he did not seem very willing, so I took him by the collar and brought him back, and then he offered to run away; I brought him by force into the shop, and looked into the advertisements, and found there was an advertisement of Mr. Cole's, and I sent to him, and the Prisoner was carried before a Justice, and there he said he found it upon the kitchen stairs in Mr. Cole's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into the gentleman's shop to ask him whether it was silver or no, and he said he believed it was.</p>

               <p>Cole. I believe his master is a very honest man, and that it is the first fact the Prisoner ever committed. <rs id="t17451016-9-verdict47" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Mortiboy, a grocer, in Upper Holloway-road. On the 20th of April, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was in the back kitchen, and saw some men in our yard, which has an opening to the road—they passed my kitchen window going out into the road—they were coming in a direction from the shed—one of them had a sack on his back, and I believe that was Williams—I should not like to swear to either of the prisoners, as I only saw their side faces, but I believe they were the men—I went to the shed, and found the door broken open—it had been shut and locked that morning—some coals were kept in it, and some kitchen<lb></lb>stuff in two tubs—I went into the road, and met my brother-in-law—I told him, and in about two hours afterwards I saw the prisoners at the station—I cannot swear to this kitchen-stuff, but it resembles ours, and I missed about this quantity.</p>

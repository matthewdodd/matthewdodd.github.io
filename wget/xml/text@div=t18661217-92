               <p>at my master's gate with John Shaw—the prisoner came up the gate-way to ease himself—Shaw wished him to go away, and said there was not a place there, there was one opposite—the prisoner called him all the names he could think of—I told him not to do so, and not to hit the old man—he struck me, and I fell on the shaft of a cart, and then he struck Shaw with his fist—I went for an officer—the prisoner was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Wacey—on the 13th November I was with Petts under the gateway—the prisoner came up to commit a nuisance—I told him that was not a proper place, there was one over the way—he called me an old b—and said he would knock my b—eye out—I said, "You had better go out of the yard"—I went up the yard to get out of his way—he struck Petts on the side of the head, and knocked him on one side—he then followed me up the yard and struck me a blow on the side of the head—I went further up the yard for protec<lb></lb>tion; he followed me—I took up a splinter bar that stood in a corner, and said, "If you strike me again I will hit you with this"—he made a grasp at me, and hit me on the side of the head, knocked me on my knees, wrenched the splinter bar out of my hands, and struck me on the head with it—I called out for help—Mr. Wacey, my employer, came to my assistance and a constable with him—I have been ill from the blows ever since, and am not at work yet—I feel a great deal of pain now, and can't rest at night—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the splinter bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 5, Circus Place, Finsbury—Shaw was brought to me bleeding profusely from a large scalp wound, about two and a half or three inches long, and cut appa<lb></lb>rently to the bone—the skull was not fractured, but he was very ill at the time—there was a kind of concussion of the brain—he had a shivering fit—in my opinion that was occasioned by the blow—I feared at one time he would have an epileptic fit—this splinter bar would inflict such a wound.</p>

Shaw shouted out to me it was not a proper place; I took no notice of it, and stood against the wall and eased myself; Shaw came up and pushed me away, not having my trousers fastened up. I struck him with my fist, he held the bar up, I rushed in and wrested it from him, and in doing it the iron part of the bar struck him on the head, and he fell down on his knees"</p>

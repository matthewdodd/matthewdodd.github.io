I live at 3, Blandford Mews—my wife's name is Caroline—my son, James Taylor, is now undergoing penal servitude in Pentonville Prison—on Tuesday evening, 2nd or 3rd of August, the defeant called at my place—he said "I want to speak to you on the quiet"—I took him into the room, we were alone—he said "I have got a letter from Jem," that is my son—I said "A letter, what is it about?"—he said "Why, be wants some money"—I said "I can't read the letter, I have not got my glasses, you read it"—I said "My son can't read nor write"—he then produced a letter and read part of it to me—he said "He wants 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not afford it, but I would take him to Dean Street—I walked down to Dean Street with him, and there saw Elizabeth Watson and my wife—Elizabeth Watson had been living with my son as his wife—the prisoner handed the letter to her and she read it—I said "What are you going to do with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Why, we can keep him like a gentleman"—he said he would take anything in to the prison; he could get anything in that he fancied, tobacco, or anything like that—I said "I had no money," and Elizabeth Watson said "We have no money by us, but we will pawn some<lb></lb>thing on Friday"—he asked for a bit of paper and a pen, and said we were to send the money to a post-office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what he wrote (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Mr. W. Colville, Post-office, St. James's Road, Hollo way, to be called for")—he told me he was a warder and had got forty under his charge, and could take them anything in—he said he was a bricklayer by trade, and my son was out on the works as a bricklayer's labourer—I then walked with him to the Regent Circus, after we had had a pot of ale in our room—Elizabeth Watson gave him a shilling to pay his <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> fare—he said he was a stranger about there—I said I was going that way and I would put him into the right way, and I put him into a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> at the top of the Caledonian Read—he was dressed in plain clothes—I was not there when the money was sent, and I never saw the prisoner after.</p>

I live at 8, Little Dean Street, Soho—I used to live with James Taylor, as his wife, and went by the name of Taylor—I lived with him about eight years—I am twenty-five years old—in August the prisoner was brought to Little Dean Street by Taylor's father, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening—he said he had brought a letter from James Taylor, and he showed me this pencil letter—I said that James Taylor could neither read nor write—he read the letter to me—I asked him where he had brought it from, and he said from Penton<lb></lb>ville Prison—I said "I am not very well, will you please read it," and he read it—Taylor's mother and father were present—I said "What does he want with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., what could he do with it if he had it?" and he said he could carry mouey into the prison—I said I had not got the money then; but I would try and get a sovereign by the Friday—he asked me if I would give him a piece of paper, and he would give me the address where to send it—this is the piece of paper—he said "That is not my right name and address"—he did not say what his right name was; he did not wish it known—by the Friday my mother and myself, between us, got a half-sovereign, and it was put into a card—I wrote a letter, and enclosed the card in the letter—I said I was very sorry I had not a sovereign to send; but I had sent half—I directed it from the piece of paper to W.

Report in the Penton<lb></lb>ville Prison, 21st September, 1870, against assistant-warder Marshall, for attempting to obtain money from the sister of a convict, for the alleged purpose of supplying him with tobacco"—the explanation is "Sir,—I beg to say I don't know any prisoner related to the persons who accuse me of attempting to obtain money from them, and I beg to say I have not at-tempted to obtain money on behalf of any prisoner, or supplied him with tobacco, or other things prohibited by the rules of the service").</p>

               <p>before I was examined at the Police Court, the prisoner came to my house at 33, Murray Street, Kingsland Road—he told me he came from Penton<lb></lb>ville Prison, and he had got a note from my brother, Charles Whiting—he said my brother had written the letter, and wanted a sovereign to find him in tobacco and other necessaries that were needed, and I told him it did not lay in my power to give it him—I saw the note—I can't read—I told the prisoner I could not read, and he said he would read it for me, and he did so—it was about my brother wanting the sovereign—we were in a little wash-house at this time—the man was a stranger to me, and he said he wanted to speak to me privately, and I did not like to take him up stairs—after he had read the letter be put it in the fire—he said he did not wish anybody to know that he had been—I told him I could not afford to give him a sovereign, as my husband had been very ill, and I could not give him anything—when I said I could not give him anything, he said "Then I must be at the loss"—he told me my brother was on the works—the prisoner had his arm in a sling, and wore plain clothes—he said he had met with an accident, and was off duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was nearly six weeks after that you were spoken to about this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between five and six weeks—I am positive the prisoner is the man—I made no note of what was said—I can't read or write—I have carried it in my memory five or six weeks—my memory is not very good—the prisoner read what was in the letter to me—he did not press me at all for any money when I said I could not send any—he took my answer at once, and went away—he told me if I did not give him the sovereign he should be at the loss—he did not ask me for money after I said I could not supply him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in Pentonville Prison, undergoing a sentence of five years' penal servitude—I have been at work under the defendant—he has never supplied me with tobacco or any other articles—I had no such thing in the prison—Elizabeth Hooker is my sister—I wrote her a Letter about ten weeks last Saturday, while I was in the prison—I wrote it in pencil, and gave it to another prisoner—I refuse to name him—I did not give it to Marshall—the prisoner I gave it to was to give it to somebody to take to my sister—the purport of that letter wis that I wanted a sovereign in order to get some luxuries into the prison—Thompson was not the prisoner I gave it to; I refuse to name who it was—I gave it to him on the works—I was not working under Marshall.</p>

On the 23d August, about a quarter to eleven o'clock at night, I had taken a place in the Blackwall-stage, in Leadenhall-street. I put a parcel in, but as it was not going to start immediately, I walked on for it to overtake me: and saw from four to seven men come out of the Cock, public-house, in <placeName id="t18240916-59-crimeloc318">Leadenhall-street</placeName>

He ran down Cree-church-lane, I followed calling Stop thief! the others put their legs out to prevent my pursuit; every obstacle was thrown in my way, and a very large dog, which must have been set at me, seized me and hung by my legs, for twenty yards, but I kept the prisoner in my sight, and he was taken without my losing sight of him for an instant. I am quite sure he is the man who took the watch - it was found near him.</p>

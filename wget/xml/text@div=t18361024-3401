               <p>time I seized this piece of lend, which was in the pot, it was hot, but not melted—he was taken by surprise—as we came suddenly in upon him he said, "Yes, that is it"—he said, "Have you taken the two men?"—I said, "I have"—he said, "For God's sake say nothing about its being on the fire, and I will give you any thing"—he repeated that several times—I said, "This is not all"—he said "No, I will give you the rest," and he gave me this other from under the counter in the shop—it weighed about 56 lbs. altogether—I took him into custody—on the way he repeated again, "For God's sake say nothing about its being on the fire"and he would give us any thing, or do any thing—he was asked at the station if he knew the man belonging to the New River Company—he said, "Yes; one of them perfectly well"—I took Taylor—I have not been able to find Robinson—I thick I took Taylor on the Tuesday following—I found him at work—he gave himself into my charge, saying, "Have you taken Robinson?"—there were two examinations before the Magistrate before Hawes was ex<lb></lb>amined—I did not like to produce him if I could have done without him, as he is a boy of not a very good character.</p>

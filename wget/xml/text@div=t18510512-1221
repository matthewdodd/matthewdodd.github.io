On Sunday evening, 6th April, about six o'clock, I was on duty at the end of Bermondsey-street, and saw some persons, among whom were the prisoners Walsh and Lynch, turned out of the Marquis of Waterford beer-shop there—Walsh and Lynch immediately began fighting, and Lynch was taken into custody by Purver—I went up to Walsh, took him by the collar, and said unless he went away quietly, I should be obliged to take him up—I believe he then went away—I assisted Purver in taking Lynch to the station, and when we got to the railway-arch, other persons came round us—I saw Coghlan there, who said, "I would not go with the b s; make the b—s get a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>"—that appeared to be addressed to Lynch; he said it loud enough to be heard at a great distance—a person named Hollis came up, struck Purver, and knocked him down—I made my way through the crowd, and took him into custody; Purver came to my assistance, and after that we were taking Hollis to the station, and when we got near the Adam and Eve public-house, Hollis snatched my staff out of my hand, but I got it back directly; stones and bricks then began to fly in all directions; I was struck once to my knowledge at the back-part of the head; it knocked me down insensible, and I believe I was carried to the hospital—I was insensible till ten o'clock—I cannot speak to any one of the prisoners besides Coghlan, Lynch, and Walsh—I had received blows before the one that knocked me down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, at Guy's Hospital. Congdon was brought there about six o'clock on the Sunday evening—he was in a complete state of insensibility, supported on men's shoulders—he could not walk—he was bleeding profusely from a wound at the back of the head—the skin was divided, and the wound went completely to the bone—there were also several contusions about the head, the result of other blows—the wound I have described was decidedly such as might have been inflicted by a brick thrown by force—he was under my care in the hospital about a week, and I attended him about a fortnight—he remained quite insensible about forty-six hours, and slightly incoherent for the next two or three days—I did not consider his life out of danger fur two or three days—he was much more severely injured than Purver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Sugar Loaf-court, Garlic-hill. On 29th May I was in Hugging-s lane, Thames-street—my son came to me, brought the two prisoners, and told me that they came to take pos<lb></lb>session of my things, and that they wanted 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told them I would go and see if I could borrow the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went and borrowed it—I than met these two men in Queen-street—I told them I had got the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they said, "Very well"—they showed me a paper, and said it was a warrant of distress—I owed some rent at that time; I do not exactly know what it was—I went into a public house, and there I paid the money—Barnett gave me this receipt for it—Brewer was present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live, at No. 59, Old street St. Luke's. I gave the two prisoners a warrant to execute on the goods of Mrs. Bradbrook, I think on 29th May—they returned, and told my wife they could not get in—that satisfied me—I have never spoke to them at all about the warrant.</p>

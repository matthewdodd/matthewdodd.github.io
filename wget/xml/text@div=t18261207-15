On the 23d of November, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was in town, and intended to sleep in town, as I felt unwell in my back - being a stranger here, I inquired of the witness Bowden if she could recommend me to a public-house where I could get a comfortable bed - I do not know what street I was in: while I was inquiring of her, the prisoner Stevens came up to me, and said he knew me very well - I had told Bowden that I had come from Staines, and wanted a bed - Stevens then came up and said he knew me very well, and that I came from Staines; I did not know him; he said he could recommend me to where I could have a bed - both him and Bowden were strangers; he took me to a public-house close by; I do not know the street; I went into the public-house; they could not accommodate me - he stood at the door, and then said he would find me a bed and a comfortable one - I had not seen the other prisoner at this time - we walked a little farther, and he said, "Go down this alley, and you will have a comfortable bed, I will be bound" - I said, "No, I am not going down there, that is not my way;" he immediately seized me by the coat - his arm went against my breast, and he pushed me against the wall - two more men immediately came up; I cannot say who they were, as I did not remark them - one of the three thrust his hand into my left-hand breeches pocket - I put my hand down as soon as I could, and said, "No, that won't do;" but I was not soon enough<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070012"></xptr>- he snatched his hand out of my pocket very hard, while I had hold of the bottom of the pocket, and then let me go - Bowden came up and asked me what was the matter - I said they had picked my pocket of a purse and a sovereign - it was a leather snap purse; I had felt it in my pocket just before - one of them must have taken it - one of the men went away directly - Stevens stopped near the place for a bit; I do not know what became of the third man; I went to the watch-house, and gave information - the constable went to look for them. I said, in Stevens' presence, that he had robbed me of my purse - he asked how I could think of any such thing - I said, "I felt your hand go into my pocket and come out" - he kept abusing me, and I went away to the watch-house.</p>

Brahney went up the court first, and when the prosecutor and the other two got to the court, Stevens said, "I will take you up here" - he said, "I will not go there, that is not my way" - he was rather bending forward, having a pain in his back - Stevens seized him with his left hand, and held him against the wall - they were all three about him; Brahney held him with his right arm, and the other one received what was taken out of his pocket; I saw something pass to him, but what they took from him I cannot say; I saw the other man receive something from Stevens, and he went away directly. The prosecutor said he had lost his purse and a sovereign - Stevens said, "Search me, I have not got your money," and abused him: there was a great mob collected, and I took the prosecutor to the watch-house - Stevens was taken in about seven minutes, and I saw Brahney in custody on the Friday week following - I have seen them both before many times, as I live opposite where the robbery was committed, and have seen them standing there together - Brahney was taken at the Horse and Groom public-house.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was informed of this robbery at the watch-house, and immediately afterwards apprehended Stevens at the door of the house he first took the prosecutor to - I took Brahney that day week (Thursday) - Bowden had described him, and I knew him; I had been looking for him all the week - I think I saw him once between those times, but he had a different dress on: when I took him, I went into the public-house, and he came in at the door; I told him what I wanted him for; he denied it, but seemed much hurt - when I took Stevens, he saw me, and turned away to a young man - I said, "I want you" - he said, "What for?" I said, "About that countryman;" he turned round to his companion, and said, "It is about that old fellow's purse."</p>
               <p>STEVENs' Defence. I was going for some supper; the prosecutor and that woman stood at the corner of the court - I heard him ask for a lodging, and I said, "You can get one at the Bull's-head public-house, in Peter-street" - he said, "Where is it?" he leaned on my arm all the way along, as he had a pain in his side - the landlord could not give him a bed, and I told him to go to the Ram inn, in Smithfield - he asked me to take him there, but I could not, as my supper was ready, and soon afterwards he said he was robbed - I offered for anybody to search me. I am as innocent as a child.</p>
               <p>BRAHNEY's Defence. I had just come out of the public-house - this woman kept talking to me, and I said, "If you don't let me alone, I will kick your -." I told her to go on - she would not - I said again I would kick her -, and after the man was robbed, she had me taken on suspicion.</p>

               <p>Mr. DANCE sworn. - I am an attorney: On the 8th of April I was spending my evening opposite Mr. Frowd's; I had observed the copper at the door some few minutes before; I had asked Frowd the price of it some time before that; I saw the prisoner with the copper, carrying it before him covered with his apron; and from his manner of carrying it, I suspected he had stole it; I looked at Mr. Frowd's and saw that the copper was gone; I went over to Mr. Frowd's, and informed his wife of it; I went after the prisoner, and stopped him going into Russel-street; I asked him where he had that copper from, he said from his master, a Mr. Wilson, I think he said; I said, you have stole that copper; he put down the copper, and at that instant Frowd came up, and the prisoner ran away; I pursued him, and he was brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A copper of mine had fell out of a cart, and I took it by mistake; there were two coppers standing, and I took the wrong one.</p>

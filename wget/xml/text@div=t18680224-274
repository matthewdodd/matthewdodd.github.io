I am thirteen years old—my mother is dead—I live with my father and his second wife, at Argyle Street, Euston Road—I went into Miss Ratcliffe's service, in the Gray's Inn Road, last August twelve months—they had no other servant—there were three children, the eldest a boy about thirteen, was at boarding school when I first went; the other two lived at home—they were a boy of eleven, and a little girl—the little boy went to school during the day—on the last Sunday I was there about a quarter to two—while I was cleaning the grate in Mrs. Ratcliff's bed<lb></lb>room, she came into the room—I was kneeling, taking up the dust—she was cross because I had not done the silver before that time, and she</p>

               <p>kicked me, and hurt me very much—she was behind me when she kicked me—after the kick I continued to feel hurt from it; it has hurt me ever since—Mr. Ratcliff was in the room when this occurred, and he sent me downstairs to go home—he said, "You send the girl downstairs"—he sent the eldest boy home with me—I continued in pain when I got home—I told my step-mother, and she examined me—in the evening I was taken to the police-station, and then to the hospital—I remained there eleven days—I often feel the pain now in the place where she kicked me—when I went into the hospital I had a swelling inside my legs and groin—I had nothing to eat on that Sunday but a piece of dry bread, and that I left—on the Friday before I was in the back drawing-room, and Mrs. Ratcliff boxed my ears—Mr. Ratcliff came up and saw her doing it, and sent me downstairs—after I went down, he went out, and Mrs. Ratcliff came into the kitchen—I was cleaning some spoons—she was going to wash up the tea things, and she took some water out of the kettle, put it in a cup, and threw it over my neck—it blistered my neck and bosom—I found the blisters in the evening, when I went to bed—she did nothing else to me that day—on the next day, Saturday, I was at work in the kitchen—she came in and asked me where the soap was—I told her I did not know—I went out to empty a pail of water, and she came out after me, took the iron bowl from the sink, which I was using, and struck me on the head with it—it made my head bleed—later in the evening, I was cleaning the kitchen, when she came in and beat me with a long stick—she had been cross all day because I did not know where the soap was—she struck me on the arms and back—my arm bled—the stick broke in two across my back, and she put it in a clothes'-basket on the copper—the blood from my arm went on the floor I was cleaning, and she said I was a dirty thing to let the blood drop, and made me wash my arm in the pail—she gave me some cold potatoes and onions for dinner on the Saturday—next morning I was cleaning the knives, about eight o'clock, in the back kitchen, and she took a cane from a hamper, and beat me on the back with it—the arm that had bled the day before she made me scrub, with cold water and a scrubbing-hrush—she stood by while I was doing it—it hurt me very much when I scrubbed it—she told me to go out and scrub my arms in the pail—it was outside that I did it—if I cried, she said she would beat me till I left off—she said, if I did not mind what I was about, I should not be able to walk home—that was when she was getting the dinner ready, before she kicked me—she had been going on at me all the morning for not doing my work properly—she said, if I did not mind, she would keep me another week and serve me the same—on the Friday, when I was standing still, she hit me on the side of the head, and knocked my head against the wall—it hurt me very much, and as she struck me she gave me a knock in the eye, which gave me a black eye.</p>

               <p>Ratcliff came round to know why I had not been there before, and my mother asked her to take me back again—I do not remember when she began to ill-treat me, but a good while ago—I met my sister in the street, and told her about it, and told her to tell my mother how I was treated—this was a good while after I had been sent home because my frock was dirty—she treated me well up till last August, when she beat me and kicked me—I know it began in August, because it was about twelve months after I had been there—I did not tell my mother, because from what Mrs. Ratcliff said I was afraid—when I was sent home about the dirty frock my mother asked her to take me back—I did not tell my mother then, because I had not been sent home altogether, only to show my dirty frock, and I did not tell her then because Mrs. Ratcliff's little boy was with me, and I was afraid he would go back and tell his mother—I told my sister about a month or six weeks after the affair about the frock—Mrs. Ratcliff complained about my being dirty—she asked my mother if she would mind my sleeping at home—that was not because I was dirty, but because her little boy was coming home from school—I believe I slept at home for five weeks—I am not in the habit of falling down stairs—I slipped down two or three stairs once, not all the way down—I hurt myself a little, there were no bruises from the fall—it was a long time ago, before I was sent home about the frock—I fell down on the Saturday before the Sunday I went home—I was going upstairs to hang up a hat, and I slipped over a bit of grease from one stair to another—I did not fall down stairs—I hurt myself a little on my thigh, not on the groin—I had not fallen down on the Friday—I only had two falls, one a long time ago, and one on the Saturday—I know James Coutts—on the Saturday before I left he was cleaning the back shop, about seven o'clock, and I was assisting him—I tried to kneel down, but it hurt me very much—in consequence of the state of my legs I was unable to kneel down, and he asked me the reason—I did not say to him "When I fell down on the stairs with the scuttle of coals yesterday I hurt myself just here (pointing to the groin)"—I never fell down with a scuttle of coals, at all since I have been there—I fell on the Saturday, but not on the Friday—it was through Mrs. Ratcliff kicking me that I could not kneel down—the state of my legs on the Saturday was not in consequence on the fall—that had nothing to do with it—I swear I did not fall on the Friday—I do not know whether Coutts knew that I fell on the Saturday—he asked me what was the matter, and I told him that I slipped—I appeared to be in great pain, and was rubbing my thigh—my father came there on the Saturday—I heard him and Mrs. Ratcliff talk<lb></lb>ing in the kitchen a long time—I did not hear what they said, I was in the back kitchen cleaning—my father is here—on Saturday, 11th, William Ratcliff, the little boy, asked me what made me lame—that was about an hour or two after I had slipped—I did not tell him that I fell down stairs with a scuttle of coals and hurt myself in the groin—I said that I had slipped oa the stairs as I was going up, over some grease—either William or Ernest Ratcliff let my father in when he came on the Saturday—they told me that he had come—I did not say "What will your mother do to keep me out of father's way, he will murder me if he sees me"—I did not say that or any<lb></lb>thing like it—I was carried into Court to-day, I cannot walk—I did not walk home from the Court last Monday with my mother, we had a cab—I walked to the cab with my mother's assistance—I walked nearly as far as the cab rank, and I walked to the Court in the morning with my father and mother—thev did not carry me, but I was assisted by both of them—I was</p>

I am house surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road—on Sunday evening, 12th January, the little girl was brought to the hospital in a most exhausted condition, and apparently suf<lb></lb>fering very much from pain and weakness—I had her removed to a ward and undressed; I then examined her—her face below her eyes were swollen and bruised, also her nose and her face was very much injured otherwise with small contusions—there was a small incised wound, about an inch in extent, on the right side of the top of her head, which had bled rather pro<lb></lb>fusely some hours previously, and there were stains of blood about her hair and neck—her neck and shoulders were very red and painful, much swollen, and portions of her shoulders were denuded of skin, apparently from blisters—there was a small open wound on the right side of her chest—her wrists, abdomen, and back were covered with small contused wounds, and as her mother says, you could not put a half-crown anywhere without coming on some contusion—her external genital organs were injured, being discoloured, and immediately above them there was considerable tumefaction or swelling, which extended to the groin on the right side, which was also discoloured—her things, legs, and arms were considerably contused and swollen, more particularly her shins and feet—her arms and legs were so much swollen that she presented the appearance of a dropsical patient—she could scarcely move her legs, arms, or thighs—the skin was off her thighs in some places,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240071"></xptr>
               <p>no doubt from a scald or burn of some kind, it appeared to be denuded of skin between her thighs—she was an in-patient eleven or twelve days, and subsequently for some time an out-patient, and is not discharged yet—the state she is in now is, I fancy, consequent on the injuries she received then—the wound on her head might be produced by the corner of an iron pot, if used with sufficient force; it was not very serious, it was merely through the scalp—I do not think I remarked any outs on her arms, although she maintains it; there may have been small abrasions, such as we should scarcely take any notice of—the swelling of the external genital parts might be produced by a kick with a boot only, but, of course, it would have to be applied directly to the part—if she was on her knees, and received a violent kick with a boot from behind, that would produce what I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might it have been caused by a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but there must have been some projecting substance to have fallen against—I hardly think a fall down stairs could have done it, unless anything was on the stain—I did not examine her as to being of a dropsical tendency; but I should fancy certainly not—her flesh was not more tender than that of other girls of her age—one fall might have caused the injuries on her private parts and groin; but they appeared only to have been done a few hours—I examined her on Sunday night, and I fancy it must have been done only a few hours before—it might have been caused by a fall on Saturday evening, certainly—there is nothing in her constitution which would give her a tendency to fall at times, that I am aware of; but I did not examine her as to that—if I heard it proved on indubitable testimony that she was in the habit of falling, there is nothing in her physical condition to which I could attribute it—I can imagine a state of body in some children of her age which would render them liable to fall, but not in her's; for instance, in epilepsy and with spinal disease and disease of the brain, they very often fall about—what other causes I know, I did not examine her with a view to find whether those causes existed, because I was not told—I should also attribute being given to falling, to having been laid up with any diseases of different kinds that would cause bad legs, hip, or joint diseases; or if she had been ill-treated, improperly fed, badly clothed, and so on.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the time she was in the hospital, eleven or twelve days, did you observe anything indicative either of spinal disease, epilepsy, disease of the brain, or anything of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever—her private parts could not have presented the appearance I saw without violence from some foreign body applied directly to the parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Or the parts applied to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so; that is to say considerable violence of some form or other—I should say that what I observed on the groin was not caused by the same violence, they must have been separate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never struck her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; and never was angry with her—she never was afraid of my violence—Coutts works for Mr. Ratcliff, I believe—I went to Mrs. Ratcliff before Susan was sent home—I was ordered to go, and Mrs. Ratcliff said that she was lazy and dirty, but she had never told me that before—she said that she had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. coming to her, I did not know what it was, and the girl did not know—she paid it to me—I asked to see the girl that night, and Mrs. Ratcliff said that she was at her work and not fit to be seen—Coutts was present—I did not say that I did not know what to do with her, it was the old story, all she was fit for was the high walls, but when I got her home I would half murder her; Mrs. Ratcliff said she was a very bad girl, and very dirty in her bed, and one thing and another, and it very much upset me, knowing that the girl had been always a good hardworking girl before, up to the time she came home to me one evening—I said that I was very sorry to hear it—she said, "Well I shall not keep her, but you cannot take her away to night; oome round on Monday night—I said, "Of course I will come for her"—I was, of course, out of temper, and I said I was very sorry the girl had turned out as she had, if it was all true—I did not say, "When I get her home I will half murder her," I said, "I shall give her a good beating, I should not care if I was hung for her"—Mrs. Ratcliff did not say, "For God's sake, do not do anything in my house"—Coutts did not say "She is a very bad girl, but she has got a good master and mistress"—I did not say I knew it, and I was quite stunned at the letter she sent to her mother—there was a letter came, but there was nothing in it about her having a kind master and mistress—I did not say to Coutts, "The girl's mother told me she considered she had got a mistress who was more like a mother."</p>

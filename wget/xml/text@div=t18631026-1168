                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and Co., accountants, of Moorgate-street—on 10th October, about half-past 12, the prisoner came to the office and said he had been clearing out the private drains—I asked him what private drain, and he said it was the drain leading from the back of our premises into the main sewer—he said he had been employed by the Commissioners of Sewers—I told him we paid sewers' rates, and he said this was extra for cleaning the private drain—he asked for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he named the amount himself—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the faith of the statement he had made to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never mentioned the Commissioners of Sewers—I had nothing to do with them—I was to have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for cleaning out the closet-pan. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Nothing was said about that; he never went down stairs—he did mention the Commissioners of Sewers.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Buckland-street, Hoxton, and am inspector of sewers, employed by the Commissioners of Sewers of the Corporation—the prisoner is not nor was he ever in their employ—I did not employ him, or authorize him to do anything to the sewers in Moorgate-street, or any drains leading from this house, nor could he get to this par<lb></lb>ticular drain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the cleaning of such a drain as this be the duty of the Commissioners of Sewers to attend to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the duty of the parties occupying—he could not have got to the drain without opening the ground, and the ground was not opened—I was there the same day.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">MCCLOUD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 141). On Saturday, 10th October, about half-past 12 in the day, I was in Moorgate-street, and saw the prisoner coming from Messrs. Quilter's—in consequence of some information I had re<lb></lb>ceived, and some inquiries which I had made, I went after him, and took him back to Messrs. Quilter's—I said to Mr. Lewis in the prisoner's presence, "Is this the man you gave the two shillings to?"—he said, "Yes; that is the man"—he also said that he had demanded 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. representing that he was employed by the Commissioners of Sewers—the prisoner made no reply to that, but became very violent, and tried to kick and strike me—with the assistance of Mr. Lewis I held him till an officer came to my assistance—I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He kicked me on the shoulder going round Princes-street because I wanted to go back to the office; I was to clean the pan, and I did not get the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wrongly, or I should not have wanted to go back; I cleaned the pan on the Saturday, and he told me to call on the Monday as he was busy, and could not attend to me; I called on the Monday, and I was taken into custody directly I got there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, of Gravel-lane, Southwark. I went on 30th March to work for Mr. Hussey, in Red Lion-street—the prisoner was at work there on 3d April—he and two others were discharged by the master—they got their money about 11 o'clock—I was at work the same afternoon—the prisoner and another brother, who has got his sentence, came in between 2 and 3—his brother said to me, "You b—r, you think you have got my job"—I said I had not, and if he thought otherwise, to go to Mr. Hussey and settle the matter—he took up a hammer and struck me with it, and the prisoner, who stood by, cried, "Go it, <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> it into him, <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi> it into him"—I warded off the blow with a pair of tongs and a hot ring—I got away from him—the prisoner laid hold of me, we got into a scuffle, he threw me down with my face near the fire—after that I received a blow on the head, and was felled to the ground senseless—the prisoner went at me with his feet</p>

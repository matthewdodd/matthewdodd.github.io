               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had the prisoner been in your service? - About four or five weeks; the prisoner said she had no money, but a guinea and a half-crown when she came to us, she said, that was all she had in the world.</p>
               <p>Did not you make her any promises to induce her to confess? - I said this to her, Sally, if you have any person concerned with you in breaking the house, inform me who it is, and I will shew all the lenity I can; this was after the money was taken; I had suspicions, for I had heard of her keeping this soldier's company; she told me, nobody was concerned at all; she acknowledged it fifty times; she said she had robbed me, and the Devil must be in her to do it.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of March I went with the prosecutor into Little James-street, Oxford-road, to No. 16, the prisoner at the bar was sitting in the right hand parlour, with another woman and two soldiers; I took the prisoner out of that parlour on the staircase, and in her pocket, tied up in this silk handkerchief, were seventeen guineas, and eight half guineas, in her pocket two pounds nine shillings and sixpence in half crowns and shillings; I then went with the prosecutor and the prisoner where the boxes were, in Stonecutters-alley, in a Mrs. Smith's house; there I found in half crowns, shillings, and sixpences, five pounds and sixpence; in a little box, in one of her own large boxes, I found ten of these clouts; there were some new stockings, and six silver tea-spoons, which were new ones, a new umbrella, and a pair of new cotton stockings; the prisoner was not with me.</p>
               <p>When these clouts were found, was any promise made her? - The prosecutor prosecutor promised her he would be as favourable as he could, if she would tell where the boxes was.</p>

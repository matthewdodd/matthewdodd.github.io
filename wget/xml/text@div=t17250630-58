             thus deposed: I was Surgeon in the Christopher Galley, of which the Prisoner was Captain. On the 12th of January, 1723. we went with our Boats up the River Andona to buy Slaves and Palm Oil. Atkinson (one of the Deceased) happened to set a small jar of Palm Oil (about the Value of 5 or 6 s.) upon some Bars of Iron that lay in the Fore Sheets of the Long Boat. The Prisoner soon after ordered West (the other Deceased) to hand some of those Bars out of the Boat; and West, in taking one of the Bars up, threw down the Jar, and broke it. The Prisoner flew into a violent Passion, and ask'd who set the Jar in that Place? And one of the Crew told him, that it was Jack Atkinson. Then he swore, G - for ever D - 'em, says he, I'll beat them both alike. He had got a knotted Cane in his Hand, about an Inch and a half thick; (we call it a Bamboo Cane) and with this Cane he knock'd them both down, and fell a beating of them in a very furious manner. I was then in another Boat about three Fathom from the Long Boat; so that I heard and saw all that pass'd betwixt 'em. I haul'd up my Boat close to him, and ask'd him, if he intended to kill the Men? G - D - you, says he, I'll kill ye all before I go aboard the Ship. But then, Captain, says I, how will you get your Boats aboard? (for we were then Ten Leagues up the River Andona.) He Scratch'd his Ears, and cry'd, Why then, D - you all, I'll kill you when I have got ye aboard. He still kept beating the two Men till his Cane was broke all to Pieces: I believe he gave them a Hundred Blows apiece, and then, as they lay down, he stampt upon their Breasts, till the Blood gush'd out of their Mouths, and so left them in a miserable Condition, and never ordered any Care to be taken of them. When we came on Board, I apply'd a Seton to each of their Poles. Each of them was seized with a violent Fever: They spit Blood daily, and Atkinson grew delirous Their Heads especially were black with Bruises, very much swell'd, and as soft as an Apple. Yet, tho' they were so extremely ill, the Prisoner never Shew'd the least Regard to them; but, on the contrary, if he came by them as they lay upon the Deck, he would kick them, stamp upon them, strike them in the Face with his Fist, and make them get up to work. I remember the second day after their Beating, that West was put to the Helm; and I coming upon the Deck, he call'd to me, For God's Sake, Doctor, says he, take hold of the Helm, for I am not able to stand; and before I came to him, he fell down. They both died in Calabar River; Atkinson in fifteen days, and West in nineteen days after the Prisoner beat them; and I verily believe that that Beating threw them into the Fever, and was the Cause of their Death. Before they died, they desired me to write their Wills, which I did; but the Prisoner having some Intimation of it, he called me down between Decks one day, and clapping a Pistol to my Breast, I understand, Doctor, says he, that you have got the Wills of these Fellows; and if you don't deliver it to me, or let me see you tear it, by G - I'll shoot you thro' the Body this Minute. So I fetch'd it, and tore it before his Face.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence: Atkinson and West died of a violent Flux and Fever, (the common Distemper of the Country) which they brought upon themselves by drinking Palm Wine, and eating Plantanes. My Gunner and

            , and two or three more, died of the same Distemper, much about the same time; and whatever the Doctor swears now about Atkinson and West, he then turned them and some others over to the Boatswain, and told him they were a Parcel of lazy Sons of Bitches; that they were able enough to work, if they were but willing; and they afterwards did their Duty.</p>
               <p>To this the Doctor thus answered: The two deceased Men were free from the Country Distemper; one of 'em indeed had a small Looseness, but nothing like a Flux: I believe they did drink some Palm Wine during their Illness, but not to excess, and I don't know they eat any Plantanes As for turning them over to the Boatswain, I never did, for it was not them, but the Gunner and Jerry Clampet; nor did they do Duty after the Prisoner beat them, for they were not able; only, as I said before, he forced them to do something. Then the Prisoner call'd his Witnesses.</p>

             thus deposed: I was Carpenter and Second Mate, and I Staid on board while the Boats went up Andona River; and when they came back, I heard that the two deceased Men and the Doctor had got drunk and tumbled over-board; and that the Captain had given the two Deceased three or four Blows with a Rattan. I did not hear them complain of being beat; they did their Duty aboard; and I did not see that they ail'd any thing; - not but that they had Setons and Blisters upon 'em: But then they had such a violent Flux, that it run from 'em all over the Deck, and I could have thrust my Hand up their Fundaments, they were grown so very wide. I remember, that 14 or 15 days after they were beat, they were both very well, and the Doctor turn'd 'em over to the Boatswain, and said they were lazy Dogs, and able enough to work; - tho' indeed they were then in a sort of a Fever, and had several Blisters upon them, and one of 'em died the next day, and t'other in two or three days after him; but then there were seven more that had got a Flux at the same time.</p>

The Palm Wine will seldom keep 24 Hours; 'tis like Canary in the Morning, Syder at Noon, and Vinegar at Night. It being so pleasant in a Morning, the Sailors are commonly so fond of it, that they drink to Excess, the Consequence of which is commonly a great Flux, tho' not always attended with a Fever.</p>

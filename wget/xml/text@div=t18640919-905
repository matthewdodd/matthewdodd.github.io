                  </hi>. I live at 3, Ann-street, Plumstead, and am a labourer in the Royal Arsenal—the prisoner was a lodger in my house previous to 9th August—he left on August 10th, with his wife and children—his wife went away about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with his family and a bundle—he took his furniture away with him—he had a bedstead, some shaving mattresses, five chairs, and two tables—he left them behind him—he came back in the fore part of the evening, and said to me, "Do you know that I can shake hands with a man at night, and he shall be a corpse in the morning?"—that was about 8 o'clock—he had had a little drop of drink, but was not anything out of the way—he came again at half-past 11; he was then a little worse—his own mattresses were off of each other, and I made them up in one corner of the room as a bed for him—I then went to bed on the ground floor, and after I had been in bed some time I heard him walking about—he then walked down stairs, and went out at the back door—I then heard a crackling and snapping—I was in bed with my wife, who was asleep—I went up stairs, and found the prisoner's room full of smoke, and the partition wall on fire—the mattresses were shifted, and there was a hole where he had put his hand in and pulled the shavings out—the lath and plaster partition was burning, but not the mattress—the hole was in the middle of the partition at the bottom, and just at the top of the skirting board—some shavings were on fire close to the hole—he had made a hole and shoved shavings in and set fire to them—the partition is standing now, but it has been repaired—When I went up the shavings in the hole were not all burnt; there were a few bits there still, and the remainder was partly burnt—the partition divides the front and back rooms—I sent to the Arsenal for the fire engine—when I left the prisoner he had half an inch of candle in a candlestick.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you know of any motive I could have had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you moved into my house by the back-way, and went oat at the back-way also on the night of the fire—you made the house a regular thoroughfare, but it has been closed ever since—I was perfectly sober—my son came home about 11 o'clock—I had been to sleep before you came home—I went to bed about 11; we all went to bed together—on the Saturday before the fire the brokers were in my house for rent—the house was in good condition—the fire was about five feet high—the fireman is not here, but Mr. Fisher is, who examined the whole—there was a good handful of shavings—I did not weigh them—part of them were against the partition wall, and the candlestick was shifted close to the wall—I had told you to let it remain on the hob—I had not my clothes on—there was nothing in the room but the mattresses and the candlestick—you told me to leave the candle there, and I told you to put it out—there was a fastening to the window—I was awake all the time you were in the house—I heard no other noise besides you walking about, and no crackling till after you went down stairs, and when I listened for your return I heard the crackling, went up, pushed the door open, wd the room was full of smoke, and the partition on fire—I said nothing at the Woolwich Court about your wife quarrelling with my wife—I go to work at the Arsenal at 6 in the morning, and come out at 6 at night—my son ought to know something about it—I did not keep him back at Wool<lb></lb>wich—he came up in case he should be called.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, R</hi> 14). On the morning of 10th August, I heard a cry of "Fire," and went to 3, Ann-street, Plumstead—from information I received I went in search of the prisoner, and found him in an unoccupied house, 1, Robert-street, the next street to where the fire was; the two streets are back to back—he appeared very drowsy, as if under the influence of drink—he would have to get over two high fences to get in the backway—after he was properly awake I told him he was charged with setting fire to a house—he said, "Me? so help me God I would not do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190089"></xptr>
               <p>such a thing"—there was no furniture in the room where I found him—I got access at the back; the back door was unfastened—he must have got there the same way as I did, by getting over two fences six feet high.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rose-street, Plumstead, and am agent for the Liverpool and London Fire Insurance Company—the prose<lb></lb>cutor's house is insured there, in the name of Tompkins and Lewis Davis, but nothing else—I went to the house about 2 o'clock, and found that a very small fire had taken place; I suppose 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover the damage that was done—in one corner of the under part of the mattress there was a small bole, and it looked as if about as many shavings as I could take in one hand had been taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you suppose the fire could have been caused by accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not—the hole in the wall was about a foot in diameter—there was loose paper hanging from the wall, in consequence of the water which was thrown upon it, but whether there was loose paper before I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Will you state what condition the house was in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was in a very bad state of repair—I should say that it was not in a letable condition—I should not like anybody connected with me to take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you accustomed to examine premises after fires? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was a somewhat circular bole in the partition about a foot in diameter—the two uptight pieces were charred, and the skirting was charred—I should judge that it had all been done within a few hours, the hole and all—I think there was enough mortar on the floor to fill the hole if it had been put together—there were a few shavings which were not burnt—the houses are very badly built—there was enough timber burnt to make a crackling noise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I was taken in custody I was completely stunned, and I did not realize my situation through the stupor of drink till the following day. When leaving the police-station, a neighbour walked alongside of me, and told me that the prosecutor's son had most grossly insulted my wife on Sunday night—I then began to think there was some trickery at work, which I soon perceived when I was taken before the Magistrate, who told me that the fire insurance company had withdrawn the prosecution, and asked if I had anything to say; I told him that I had not the slightest knowledge of anything connected with the fire—he said that the charge must go on. The prosecutor then altered the charge. If the fire was not the result of accident on my part through drunkenness or carelessness, or from the prosecutor leaving the light with a drunken man, it behoves me to see if he had any purpose; he had brokers put in on Saturday for a deal of rent which he was unable to pay; he paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off, and arranged to pay so much a week, as he had lodgers to move in on the Monday. Through the insults and the bullying he made at my wife, she and the children left the place, and said they would not sleep another night there, and left the key with a neighbour, telling him to acquaint me when I got sober that I might take a decent place. The place not being in an eligible condition, the landlord would not let it, and there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190090"></xptr>
               <p>fore he must lose his property, or resort to stratagem of some kind. I had lived in the house I was found in in Robert-street three or four months, and got a good connexion there as a tailor, and my first impulse was to go then, but I do not recollect being there at all; I perhaps was faint or sick, and made my way out the back way towards Robert-street; I knew the street-door was open, because I hung the key up for the landlord to go in for it. I could have no motive for destroying my furniture. If shavings were taken to set fire to the house, would they not be more than half-burnt? As regards the threats he says I used, he did not think of them for fourteen days afterwards. I swear by the Almighty Father who is in heaven, that I am innocent.</p>

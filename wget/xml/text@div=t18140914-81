            . Q. How old are you - A. I am nineteen. My father is a hackney coachman; he lives in Nelson's-place, in the City-road.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. Yes; I have known Powell, and Wood, six months, and Hart, about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with the three prisoners on the night this robbery has been said to be committed - A. Yes; I was with them from seven o'clock in the evening until nine; we were at the King of Prussia-row, Hoxton, altogether; Mr. Wood told me I was to get the horse and cart out that night, and to meet them at the Westmoreland Arms, Westmoreland-place, City-road, at ten o'clock at night. I went home to get the horse and cart; I got it I went to the City-road; Wood met me, and took the cart of me at the bottom of Westmoreland-place; Wood was by himself. Then he told me to go home, and to come back to him as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you to go home - A. Because I did not want to let my father know I was going out. I went, and returned to the Westmoreland Arms a little after eleven o'clock; I found Hart there then, nobody else. I expected to find Wood there; I found Hart. I went with Hart to the Blue-coat Boy public-house, at the top of the City-road; when I came to the Blue-coat Boy, Wood and Powell were there. Powell got in the cart, and laid down in the cart; Wood led the mare by her head, and walked on. I and Hart walked on fast, and followed. We turned down a turning to go to Bagnigge Wells; we at last, got to Battle-bridge; Hart and me went down the left hand, towards Bagnigge Wells; Wood and Powell went another way with the cart and horse, towards Maiden-lane way. A little after twelve o'clock, Hart heard the horse and cart coming back to us. Wood said, it was too soon to go. We all got within the cart, and went towards Maiden-lane; it being too soon, we drove up Maiden-lane, to a large brick field; the mare and the cart we put into a barn. Wood directed me to stay with the horse and cart until they came back again; they all went together down Maiden-lane, towards Battle-bridge, all three. I stopped there until a little after two o'clock, then Hart came, and throwed some dirt in the cart, to rouse me. I laid down in the cart, and fell asleep. Hart throwing the dirt in roused me. Hart told me to follow him; I followed him down the road that leads to Bagnigge Wells; I drove the cart; Hart went on foot first. I drove on; when Hart stopped, I stopped; I saw a man coming along the road, that I was informed was Mr. Hutt, the officer, he came from the turnpike out of Spa-fields, towards me, and looked into the cart. Then just as we got to Baggnigge Wells, Hart jumped into the cart; he told me to drive on. I asked him what for; he said, never mind, drive on; he struck the mare with the pin out of the tail-board on the rump. I drove on very fast; I could not hold the mare; then we went down to the turnpike; he kept saying, I hope the turnpike-gate is open; we stopped at the gate, the gate was open; we drove on, and went up a lane by the Workhouse, into the City-road. We put the cart and mare up just about three o'clock, in my father's stable. On the next day, Hart and I went to Bagnigge Wells. Hart said, Wood and Powell were fools for packing up so much, it would have broken the cart down.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what the hampers contained - A. Hart told me red wine; he said, they packed them up; he said also, there was brandy, rum, gin, and peppermint.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him, whether they had packed up all the wine - A. No. Hart told me they had put it in hampers. He said, they had only drank one bottle, and he had spilled some over his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. When Hart jumped into the cart, do you remember his telling you any thing at that time - A. Hart told me the man in the road, was Hutt, the officer, that weighed his bread once at Battle-bridge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. How old are you - A. I am nineteen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a thief - A. Not long, three or four months. I gave information of this when I was taken up.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went in company with Hutt, and searched the prisoner Hart's house, in Cloth-fair, on Friday, the 19th of August; I found a pair of breeches with the remains of port wine upon them, and I also found a phosphorous-box at Hart's house. Hart told me he had not done any baking for a year and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it contain hampers of wine and gin - A. No; the hampers were in the yard; they were empty. There were wine, gin, anniseed, and noyean, they were all in the cellar, except the anniseed and peppermint, they were in casks, or stone bottles; the port in quart bottles; one cask of wine; there were sherry and lisbon wine also; there were a quarter cask of red port, that was in the cellar; that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140051"></xptr>moved the next morning from where I saw it the over night. At three o'clock, I was alarmed; I went to my cellar; I saw the cellar door had been broken open by an iron crow, which was found in a hamper. Afterwards, I saw the crow fired to the cellar, by Hutt; the crow corresponded with the marks exactly. The cask of port wine was not in the cellar. All the rest were removed completely out of the cellar: the port cask was removed completely out by the door. The port wine and spirits were under my charge.</p>

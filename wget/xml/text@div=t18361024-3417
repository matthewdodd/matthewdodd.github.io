                  </hi>. I live in Marchmont-place, Russell-square, and as a labourer. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the night of the 16th of October, I met the prisoner, and walked with her along Holborn—she followed me, and squeezed her hand round my middle, and took all my money out of my pocket—I had three shillings, one sixpence, one half-crown and threepence in copper—I followed her till I saw a policeman and gave her in charge.</p>

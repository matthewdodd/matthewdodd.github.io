               <p>Q. How long before this robbery you now complain of, had the prisoner lodged in your house? - A. About two years and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you, before this matter happened at all, intimated to her a desire that she should quit your house? - A. Yes; she has had warning for three half years; Mr. Carter wrote the last half year's warning.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not comply with those notices? - A. The last notice that I gave her was not expired till after I was robbed, it had expired the 23d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. And she remained in your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the matter, which is the subject of the present prosecution, happened, you had had some losses? - A. I had; on the 15th of March I had lost nineteen pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 6th day of April, tell me whether any thing excited your suspicion then? - A. On Saturday, the 6th of April, I had been ill for three days before that, that was the 4th day I had never been out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time in the course of that day, did you miss any thing that excited your suspicion? - A. Yes; about three o'clock in the afternoon, I lost the keys belonging to a desk, where there was twenty pounds thirteen shillings and nine-pence deposited.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room, and in what place, was that money deposited? - A. The parlour; it is a kind of parlour and accompting-house together.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house was it situated? - A. Behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the sum there deposited was twenty pounds thirteen shillings and nine-pence? - A. My son was with me at the time I counted it, his name is

            ; there was about seven guineas in gold, and the rest was in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. In what place was it contained? - A. In a mahogany writing-desk, in the room behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the keys belonging to the desk been placed before that? - A. I had left them upon a round mahogany table, by the side of the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it when you last saw these keys upon the mahogany table where you left them? - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it that you heard any thing that induced you to go and see if the keys remained there? - A. I wanted them to settle some accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had you seen the keys? - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that was said by any body, did you go up to see if the keys were upon that table? - A. I went up stairs on purpose to find them, to settle that account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the keys upon that table? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find them any where else. and where? - A. Yes; they were put upon another table, which was covered by a piece of green baize.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they under the green baize, so as not to be visible? - A. They were under the green baize.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding them concealed in that way, did you give any directions to your family respecting those keys which you had found so concealed? - A. I told them to let them remain where they were.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had given those directions in your own family, did you find them again in the same place or not? - A. About an hour, or an hour and a quarter; after that time, I went up stairs on purpose to see whether they were removed or not, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Those keys were the keys that would open the bureau where the money was put? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you perceived these keys had been removed, did you see the prisoner, and how soon after? - A. I fancy it might be about half past six o'clock; she came into the kitchen to do some little domestic concerns.</p>
               <p>Q. She had the use of the kitchen? - A. Yes, always; the prisoner at the bar then told me, that Mr. Thorpe, a banker at Loughborough, in Leicestershire, had been there in the morning, requesting that I would meet him at the George inn, in Aldermanbury, at eight o'clock; I replied to the prisoner at the bar, that my health had so indisposed me, that I was incapable of going out that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing to that? - A. She immediately replied, she wished me to take the two lads along with me, in case I might be more indisposed than I was, that I might send one of them home to inform my daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. You have two sons, have you? - A. Yes, one is John, and the other William, they are both here.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is John? - A. I think John is between fifteen and sixteen; William was thirteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080071"></xptr>the 9th of last month. The prisoner at the bat was very pressing for me to go; I told her I was very incapable of going.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any more than two sons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your two sons and your daughter were the whole of your family? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lost your wife? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she living in that house at the time? - A. No; she lives in Northamptonshire; I went down to see her the week before last.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any servant in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole of your family consisted of yourself, your daughter, and your two boys? - A. Yes; after that, the children said to me, while she was in the kitchen, that they would advise me to go to speak to Mr. Thorpe; I then took the two boys up stairs with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were to go to the George, in Aldermanbury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Thorpe an acquaintance of your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know that? - A. Yes; she answered him in the morning, I heard her answer him as I lay in bed in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come for in the morning? - A. I heard him say to the prisoner at the bar, that he would be glad that I would meet him at eight o'clock at the George, in Aldermanbury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. At that time, where were you that you heard him say so? - A. I was in bed in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. After that conversation, what did you do? - A. When the prisoner seemed so over pressing for me to go, I ordered my little girl to bring a candle, and I went up stairs, taking my two boys up, and the girl, leaving Mrs. Lacon in the kitchen by herself. My eldest son is very hard of hearing, the youngest I thought would be the most proper object; I placed him in a cloaths-press, which is a kind of cupboard, where I hang my cloaths, and desired him to be seated there until I came home; I had communicated to them my suspicions, and the circumstance of the keys having been lost; I shut the door, and left him there seated; there is no lock to the door of the cloath's-press, it is a kind of a three-corner, and he was seared in one corner, concealed behind some cloaths that hung before the door. My daughter then shewed me a light, and I and John went out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, was the prisoner in sight to observe whether you went out with one or both sons? - A. She was not.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it that you left your own house, as near as you can guess? - A. About eight o'clock, that was the time appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned to your own house? - A. The watchman was calling ten as I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the George or not? - A. I went to the George, and staid till that time, except the time of walking there and back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Mr. Thorpe there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned, did you receive any information from your son whom you had placed in the closet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information you received from your son William, did you examine the drawer where you had left your money? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any sum deficient, and how much? - A. There was 16l. 10s. gone out of the 20l. 13s. 9d. and likewise the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What note do you mean? - A. It was an account of the money put into the bag, which I had put within the bag, containing an account of the quantity of gold, and likewise the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you put that note into the bag? - A. On the Thursday, as this was on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information your son had given you, and the loss you found you had sustained, what did you do upon that? - A. I went immediately up to the prisoner at the bar, accompanied by the child that saw her take it, and John went with him likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner? - A. I went into the dining-room, where she was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the dining-room join her bed-room? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the apartment that you let to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she was in bed? - A. There was a chair-woman there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you went in so as to see her in bed, or do you only collect it from information? - A. I only went to the door of the bedroom, and the children with me; William told her respecting the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did William charge as having committed that robbery? - A. He charged her with having committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. In your bearing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner asleep, or did she make any answer to it? - A. She said, no my love, you may depend upon it I should never attempt to rob your father; the child told her, but, ma'am, says he, you have.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you had discovered your loss, and received the information from your son, that you went up to this bed-room with your son? - A. As soon as I had done unlocking my desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass that evening, that is material to tell us? - A. I told her I thought it was a very cruel circumstance for her to rob me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080072"></xptr>when, at the same time, she knew my situation in life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your situation at that time distressing? - A. I have been distressed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been distressed for money at that time? - A. I had, and that through losses in trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at that time distressed for money? - A. Yes, I was distressed in one point, for this money was not mine, it was other people's money.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you were collecting your debts, for the benefit of your creditors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed that evening? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing afterwards pass from her, or in her presence? - A. I went up the next morning again, Sunday; I took the children with me; she appeared to be very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you at that time? - A. I repeated the same business to her again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by the same business? - A. The same as before the robbery; she said, if she had got it, she would keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing afterwards pass as from her, or any friends of her's, in her presence? - A. There was nothing more passed that day; but I observed a woman that used to wash and chair for me, to be let secretly into the house, and I then went to that woman's house, on purpose to know her business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in consequence of pursuing that woman? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. When you left your shop on Saturday night, who had the care of it till your return home? - A. My daughter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. After this, was there any thing passed between you and any of her friends, in her presence? - A. Yes, on Monday, and Mr. Holbrook called.</p>
               <p>Q. The Monday after the robbery, which, was on the Saturday? - A. Yes; he said, I had no right to detain the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken the prisoner into custody at that time? - A. No; I told him the door had never been locked upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. You will tell us nothing but what passed in her presence? - A. No, this was in her presence; he then asked me, why I did not pursue public justice; I told him, I was immediately going to Bow-street; I went there, but was too early.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the office open? - A. No, it was not, this was just after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that after Holbrook left you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How early was it then on the Monday morning that Holbrook called upon you, and held this conversation about the matter? - A. I think it must be between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, what did you do? - A. I then went about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after that? - A. I called there again in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. At Bow-street, do you mean? - A. At Carpmeal's house, which is close to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed at Carpmeal's, did you go to the office for a warrant? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you obtain any warrant at the office, or not, that evening? - A. I did not; the clerk said, it was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing afterwards pass, either that evening, or subsequent to that evening, between you and the prisoner, or any friend of the prisoner's, in her hearing? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This woman, the prisoner at the bar, lodged in your house for two years and a half? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lived upon excellent terms with her? - A. I can say, very much to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. She has had three half-years warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the three half-years, had you lived upon good terms? - A. We were not always, to be sure, quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Not always, but pretty much so? - A. Yes, I had a reason for it; the whole of it was, I wanted her to depart my place.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard something about your wife-your wife does not live with you? - A. No, she does not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did not all the time she lodged with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live? - A. At Kettering, in Northamptonshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at separate maintenance? - A. Yes, she has.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my learned Friend, you were rather distressed in your circumstances? - A. I remarked that, and that it was from the loss of money in trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You have compounded with your creditors twice, have not you? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Never at all? - A. No; it was about two years back I asked them for a little time, but I paid twenty shillings in the pound.</p>
               <p>Q. You then never offered eleven shillings in the pound? - A. I offered twelve shillings, and the first payment will very soon commence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what circumstances this woman was in? - A. No, she never told me in her life.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard? - A. I have heard other people say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in good circumstances, or not, from the information you have received? - A. That says nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080073"></xptr>Q. But it does say something in this Court? - A. It has been generally understood that she was left a woman of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you believe that she was a woman of property, from the information you received, or not? - A. I cannot say but I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, at any time an oath is a serious thing? - A. Very, it is with me, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you ever made application to her to become security with you for the payment of any of your debts? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she never sell out any stock of her's on your account? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But, from the information you have received, you believed her to be a woman of property? - A. I believe nobody disputes it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife being at separate maintenance from you, you never proposed any terms of marriage between you and the prisoner at the bar? - A. Marriage!</p>
               <p>Q. You seem thunderstruck and surprised? - A. Enough to surprise me.</p>

               <p>Q. Never? - A. No, never, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor never said so to any body? - A. Never, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever drew any bills, which she accepted? - A. She never in her life accepted a bill for me.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you, because I will prove it to you by-and-by; I put it again; have you never drawn bills which the prisoner has accepted; I will shew you the bills? - A. Never in her life; she has paid me for goods with bills, and paid rent with bills.</p>
               <p>Q. But you never drew a bill upon her which she accepted? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I take it for granted, you have never offered at all to compromise or settle this business, either by yourself, or any of your friends? - A. Never, I always refused it; it will be proved very shortly, I have sufficient witnesses to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you never desired any friend to make any offers of that sort? - A. I never did; it was proposed to me by

             made the offer of compromise upon the part of the prisoner? - A. Upon the part of the prisoner's sister; the sister had said to Davis -</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this, whether the prisoner ever saw Pugh, until you brought Pugh to your house, to the best of your knowledge? - A. She was never at home when Pugh came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put it to you again - I ask you whether the prisoner had seen Pugh before you brought him to your house? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that the prisoner, or her sister, ever knew Pugh before you brought him to your house at that time? - A. Oh, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with Pugh? - A. I have known him for some years, he is no particular acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he the constable of your parish? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he not the constable of St. Sepulchre's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he is not the constable of your parish? - A. No; I went to two constables of my own parish, and could not find them, and I was told that I could take her up by an officer from another parish.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her up? - A. On the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. And it happened on the Saturday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Davis, what relation is he to you? - A. He married my sister; the prisoner was never out of bed, I believe, Sunday or Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. From ill health? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apprehend her? - A. I had no opportunity of apprehending her.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an answer - when did you apprehend her? - A. I believe it was on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. What, Monday last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This last Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Monday? - A. No, it was Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Tuesday; - A. Oh, no, it was on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The Wednesday after? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. No, my Lord, last Wednesday, during the present Sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was it you lost your money? - A. The 6th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she remain in your house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080074"></xptr>after you charged her with having stolen the money? - A. I do not know, I am sure I fancy it was a week, I am not exactly clear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my Friend, you went to Bow-street twice, once early in the morning, before the office opened, and in the evening after it was shut? - A. No, the office was not shut, but it was too late for a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You live at Clerkenwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Hatton-garden office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there? - A. No, I did not go there for a certain reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go, during the fortnight the prisoner was in your house, to any office for a warrant? - A. I did not, I was advised not; I waited till the Sessions commenced at Hicks's-hall, to find a true bill against her.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that was the only reason? - A. I mean to say, that they had been to three different offices, her and her party, and I conceived it better for me to file a bill against her at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in fact, you did not proceed by warrant from any office in town at all, but preferred your bill first? - A. I went to Bow-street for a warrant, and should have apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not prefer any charge against her at any office, till you preferred your bill to the Grand Jury? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet she lived in your house a fortnight after you charged her with the robbery? - A. I do not know whether it was a week or a fortnight, I am sure I believe it was only a week.</p>
               <p>Q. The only reason you did not go to any office to prefer your complaint was, from the advice you had received from your friends? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any complaint made against you, and of what sort, at any office, by the prisoner? - A. I do not know by what means there could be any complaint.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether, in point of fact, there was any complaint made against you at the instance of the prisoner, at any Police-office? - A. Why, you know it was in consequence of Davis and Pugh, and their indiscretion, who acted contrary to my orders.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you why or wherefore: I ask you, in point of fact, whether there was any complaint, and you know that I know there was a complaint made against you by the prisoner at the bar? - A. There was something said, but it was proved to the contrary that there was no complaint against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you before the Magistrates? - A. Yes, at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. And of what nature was the charge and that complaint? - A. That I shall never know.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was made known to the Magistrates? - A. I believe not; I believe the Magstirate was misinformed very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any complaint made by the prisoner, or at her instance, against you at the Police-office, in Hatton-garden, and when was it made, if you can recollect, perhaps your memory may not serve you? - A. To be sure I was at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon a charge at the instance of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, if you can, try and recollect yourself, and tell us what the charge was that was made against you there? - A. I am sure I cannot, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what the charge was? - A. I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps I may refresh your memory a little; was it any thing like this sort of charge, extorting money for the compounding of a felony? - A. It cannot be.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether there was any such charge against you for extorting money for compounding a felony? - A. They wished to prove that, but it could not be.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there such a charge? - A. It was proved to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask, whether, in point of fact, there was such a charge made? - A. I believe it was generally proved that there was no charge made; they wanted to make a charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was there such a charge made? - A. It was never my desire for any money to be extorted, nor I never saw any money; I did not extort money.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, was not the charge that was made against you at the time you were at the Magistrates in Hatton-street, for extorting money for the compounding of a felony? - A. I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not? - A. I do not know that it was; if it was, it was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not an examination take place of witnesses, because my learned Friend was there, and examined and took a great deal of pains about it, and another learned Friend of mine too, relative to a charge of that sort, and in your presence? - A. I was there, but I never understood that I was there upon extorting money by false pretences.</p>
               <p>Court. He must know what the nature of the charge was; he has been hanging back, and has not given evidence in a way that he might have done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I ask you, upon your oath, whether the charge was not for extorting money? - A. If it was, it was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a charge against you for <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080075"></xptr>extorting money? - A. I said before, if there was, it was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not witnesses examined before the Magistrate to make out that complaint; did you not hear them examined? - A. I heard them examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them examined upon a charge of extorting money? - A. I do not know that it was, my memory will not carry me to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a charge, then, made against you for obtaining money under false pretences? - A. There perhaps might be that, but if there was, it was not so, in no respect.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, whether it was so or not, the Magistrate was not fool enough to commit you to custody for it, and you were in custody four or five days? - A. To be sure I was in prison four or five days, but I was never heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, and I put it to you, and there is a gentleman by me who knows the fact, though Counsel for the prosecution - upon your oath, were not you discharged, because the Counsel, who attended for you, contended it was not a legal charge; and therefore, upon that account, only, you were discharged? - A. It was proved it was not a legal charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Does your Lordship think arguments of Counsel are to be gone into in evidence?</p>
               <p>Court. A. It is not necessary I should answer that question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you never received any money for settling this business? - A. No, not a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor no Bank-note? - A. No; at Hatton-garden I saw some times in Mr. Dickinson's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What notes were they? - A. I do not know, for I paid no attention to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you taken up? - A. At the Horse-shoe, in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there? - A. A gentleman of the name of Cummins, a silk-mercer, in Cheapside, went with me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you go there to settle the business? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go there to meet Davis and Pugh? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not know of any money being received by any body else on your account? - A. I did not till after I went into the Horse-shoe, in Goswell-street; I went there, and Mr. Cummins went with me, to see if Mrs. Lacon was not there, and he was to keep her in conversation till I got a constable to take her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not go for the purpose of settling the business at all? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Davis and Pugh were at that house? - A. They were not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Davis was there? - A. No; he told me before I went out, that he was to meet Mrs. Gilbert at the Horse-shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Davis married her sister; and he told you he had made an appointment to meet Mrs. Gilbert, who is the prisoner's sister, at the Horse-shoe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Davis tell you, before you went, for what purpose he was going to meet Mrs. Gilbert? - A. I told him, in the afternoon, I was determined that evening to take up Mrs. Lacon.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether Davis told you the purpose for which he met her? - A. He told me he should meet her for no other purpose than this; because he had promised her that he would meet her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you have told us of this little boy; after he had told you of this business, had you ever any conversation with him upon the subject? - A. The conversation I have had with him has been this; my dear, keep within the bounds of truth, and say very little; I never gave him any instructions.</p>

               <p>Q. You never gave him any instructions as to the nature of the evidence he was to give? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the child ever repeated to you what he was to give in evidence to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that from the time he first discovered it to you, to the present time, he has never repeated the story about the discovery? - A. He has frequently talked about the badness of the crime, what a terrible thing it was, and all that; there were three or four gentlemen in Cheapside sent for him, to examine him, but I never went with him; they did it for their own satisfaction, to know whether the robbery had been committed or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no charge against this prisoner at Hatton-garden of this sort that you are now indicting her for? - A. I never had any opportunity at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your boy examined? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sworn? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was not he sworn? - A. I do no know; the Magistrate did not swear him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know any reason why? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any reason given by the Magistrate? - A. I do not know that he assigned any reason at all; he seemed to wish to postpone the business to another day, on purpose that he might have an assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Mr. Kinnaird? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at another day, he had an assistant, and a pretty intelligent one, Mr. Bond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sworn then? - A. No; none of my witnesses were asked a question; there was not one of my witnesses admitted into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you expect to be indicted yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080076"></xptr>Q. This Sessions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath you did not? - A. Upon my oath I did not, by any means; I was convinced to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The complaint that was made against you before the Magistrate was dismissed, and you were set at liberty? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember walking out with your father in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your father well or ill before that? - A. He was very ill indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening did you go out? - A. I fancy it was somewhere about six or seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. To what place did you and your father go? - A. To the George, in Aldermanbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body accuse Mrs. Lacon of having done any thing wrong? - A. Yes; I heard my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on that day Mrs. Lacon was accused of having done any thing wrong, that you went out with your father in the evening? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see what part of the house your father kept his money in? - A. Yes, it was in the desk in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the parlour to the shop? - A. They are both joining together.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, at the back part of the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see what money your father had in the desk? - A. Yes; there were twenty pounds thirteen shillings and ninepence, in a purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice, when you saw the money, what sort of money it was, Bank-notes, or gold, or silver, or what? - A. I believe there were three or four seven-shilling-pieces; and, I think, one guinea, and silver, but no notes, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you at all recollect the exact quantity of gold and silver that made up this money? - A. I cannot be correct as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this charge against Mrs. Lacon was it that you saw the money? - A. I believe it was about four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any silver? - A. Yes, a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to speak positively as to the very day that you saw it, or that you can only speak within a certain time? - A. I cannot be positive to the exact day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect exactly, the precise time before this, that you did see it? - A. It was about four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q. It was within that time you are positive? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many brothers and sisters were living with your father at that time? - A. I have one brother, and one sister.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them went with you and your father to the George? - A. There was none that went but my father and me.</p>

               <p>Q. By whose directions was he left in the closet? - A. My father put him in himself, I was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what time it was that you returned home at night, as near as you can guess? - A. The hour was ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home, was any thing said by your brother to your father? - A. Yes, immediately as he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell us what. - After your brother had told this to your father, what did you, or your father, or any of you, do? - A. My father took the candle, and went to the desk in the parlour, I went with him, and he opened the drawer where the money laid, and the bag was open.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How could he open the desk without the keys? - A. Mrs. Lacon had put the keys, after she had done this, under the pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he took the key from, yourself? - A. No; my brother found the keys before he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was your brother who furnished the keys to your father? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When your father examined the desk, did you see in what stare the bag was? - A. Yes, I did; the bag was wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your brother give the key to your father? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was open you say? - A. Yes, in a drawer in the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag in the same state, as to money, as it had been before you left it? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was missing from the bag? - A. There were sixteen pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of that deficiency, or was it what your father told you? - A. I did, because I helped my father to count the money over, and I had counted it over myself when he put it into the bag.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. If you counted the money with your father, you can certainly tell how many guineas there were? - A. I am not positive in that, because my father generally puts upon a bit of paper what it is, and I put it in the bag, but the silver I counted over myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing missing from the bag besides the money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean money-was there a ring, or any thing whatever? - A. No, nothing else.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080077"></xptr>Q. How do you know that there was this money in the bag? - A.

               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether there was any account taken of it in any book, or any where else? - A. No, only upon a piece of paper that was put into the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that note gone when you returned, as well as the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After your father and you had found this money missing, what did your father, or any of you do? - A. My father and me, and my brother and my sister, all went up to her bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother say any thing to Mrs. Lacon when you went up to the bed-room? - A. Yes; he told me of the circumstance that was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what he said to her that she had done? - A. He told her that she came into the parlour and called the dog, then she opened the parlour-door to go into the parlour, and then she opened the glass-door which looks into the shop; he told her, after she had done that, that she opened the door which looks into the closet where he was, that he laid down, and covered himself over with coats; that after that, she took the keys out of her pocket and went to the desk, she pulled one key out of her pocket that was on the bench, and that did not do; then she took out another key, and that did undo it.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did he say to her that she had done? - A. He said that she had opened one drawer belonging to the desk, and that was full of halfpence, and that he supposed she did not want; then she opened the other drawer, and that was the drawer that she wanted, where the bag of silver was in; then she put her hands into the bag, and filled her pockets; after she had done that, she locked the desk, and put the key behind the pillow upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any bed in that room, the parlour? - A. Yes; after she had done that, she went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were these keys put behind the pillow of the bed where your father slept? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When he said that, did she deny it? - A. She did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect the words as well you can? - A. She said, why then if I took the money I will keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after your father had missed his money was it that you went up, and your brother accused her of doing this? - A. We had been in the house about half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Now tell me, how, when the press door was shut, you saw her look all over the shop? - A. I did not see her look all over the shop, I could tell she opened the door, because she had the door in her hand; she was not a minute looking round, and then she opened the shop door.</p>

I have never talked with them about it above three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they said any thing about it? - A. They have said, what a sad thing it was that a woman of her property should rob my father.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has your father talked with you about it? - A. He always told me this, always to speak the truth, and not to tell a story at all.</p>
               <p>Q. But how often has he talked to you about it? - A. He has not talked to me, only asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has he asked you? - A. He has asked me, to the best of my knowledge, about three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father, you know, was in jail a few days? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. No, only one Thursday, going to Hatton-garden; he bid me mind what I said, and not to tell any stories.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure Mrs. Lacon only said, my dear, my love, I don't know what you mean? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not say any thing like this, if I have, I have? - A. I did not hear any such thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Your brother is very deaf, we understand? - A. Yes, but he was better then.</p>
               <p>Q. He heard a great deal more than you, how happened that? - A. She must have said that when I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave him in the room after you went down? - A. Not a minute, about a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you went down first, you or your father? - A. I went down first, but I came up again.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080081"></xptr>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That was Saturday night, that your father had her searched the next day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no search for this 16l.? - A. No; she said, as far as this, that my father might search her pockets, for her pockets were there.</p>
               <p>Q. That was that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father did not chuse to accept her offer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And she must have had the money about her then, she had not been out? - A. She had been out for a rush-light, after I went out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you went out of the parlour? - A. Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after your sister had been out? - A. Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go to fetch the rush-light before or after she had taken the money? - A. After.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when she went out for the rush-light? - A. I went down Cow-cross-street, my sister opened the door, and Mrs. Lacon called, and said, who is at the door, and my sister said, I am going to stand at the door, ma'am, and then I went out, and when I came in, Mrs. Lacon came in with a rush-light in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your sister when she went in, standing at the door? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go into Cow-cross for? - A. Because I was afraid if I staid at home, she would know I had been at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after you came home, where did you go to? - A. I went down stairs in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. And how long did you stay in the kitchen? - A. Till my father came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father come down into the kitchen to you? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were a constable of St. Sepulchre's parish? - A. I was, when this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Sumner? - A. I have been trying to recollect, and, as far as I can learn, between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to you? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it? - A. I am pretty sure it was of a Tuesday, I suppose about the 9th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the day? - A. A little after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you of some complaint he had respecting Mrs. Lacon? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to his house? - A. I did not go to the house immediately, I went about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any previous friendship or acquaintance with Mrs. Lacon? - A. Never; all I know of Mrs. Lacon is, as a professional man, being a watch-maker, I cleaned a clock for her about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Mrs. Gilbert, Mrs. Lacon's sister, before that? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, though you are Mr. Sumner's acquaintance, I expect you will tell me the truth? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Sumner introduce you to Davis? - A. As far as I can charge my memory, I really cannot be certain, but I believe it was either that day or the next that he introduced me to Davis; I recollect it was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between Davis and him, and you, respecting the taking of any money? - A. As near as I can charge my memory, it was between Mr. Sumner and myself; he told me Mrs. Lacon had robbed him; I told him I supposed it was an odd kind of business, and so on, I thought it was best that they might settle it; I told him I did not like to interfere in a thing of this kind, it was not handsome, for it was in another parish, but I did add, imprudently, as a peace-officer, that I thought it were best if they made it up; he, on his part, told me, there was a Mrs. Gilbert, that wished, from the anxiety she felt, to release her sister from the difficulty that she laboured under, that Mrs. Gilbert would settle the business; he then told me that Mrs. Lacon had taken from him, I think, 16l. 10s. and there were about 9l. due for rent; the whole sum amounted to 25l. 10s.; he told me, I think, it was he informed me, I cannot remember every particular circumstance, but I think it was he informed me, if I met Mrs. Gilbert at the Horse-shoe, in Goswell-street, that she would pay the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on the Tuesday or the Wednesday? - A. It was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Davis present in any part of this conversation? - A. I rather think not, but I am not quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass between you and Sumner at that time? - A. Nothing more, than that I was to go at seven o'clock that evening, the Tuesday evening, and I should have gone to the Horse-shoe, and have taken of Mrs. Gilbert this 25l. 10s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass that evening? - A. I saw Mrs. Gilbert at the Horse-shoe, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080082"></xptr>anxicty she was in made an impression on my feelings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sumner again the next day, the Wednesday? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you the next day? - A. On the Wednesday I certainly did see him, but it was when I saw

               <p>Q. Did what passed take place between Davis and you, or Sumner and you? - A. Between Sumner and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sumner the next day, Wednesday? - A. Yes, at the Golden-horse, in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet by accident, or did you agree to meet? - A. My memory does not furnish me to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you did meet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. I think about two o'clock, it was half past two.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between Sumner and you when you got to the Golden-horse? - A. I do not know, it was defultory conversation, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it about this money? - A. Yes, I told him I had been to the Horse-shoe, and that I had told Mrs. Gilbert we could not take the money; when I told her we could not take the money, either Davis and I, or both of us, I cannot tell which, told Mrs. Gilbert we could not take the money, we had had the advice of an attorney, and it might be the ruin of us if we touched the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Sumner say to this, when you told him? - A. I do not know that he said any thing to it, for he supposed it would drop there.</p>
               <p>Q. What else was said? - A. We went into a conversation about indifferent things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him any more that day? - A. Yes; at his own house about a quarter after five; I waited there at Mr. Sumner's for Mrs. Gilbert, we chattered upon indifferent subjects.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again the next day, the Thursday? - A. No; I stand corrected, for I saw, him at New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive any directions from him respecting any offer of money? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to this talk of your's to accommodate that, they might as well compromise it, for you thought it an,odd affair-had you been applied to by Mrs. Gilbert, or any other person on the part of Mrs. Lacon to do it? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not at the request of her or any of her friends? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you did not know Mrs. Gilbert? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mrs. Lacon with Davis? - A. I never saw Mrs. Lacon from the time I cleaned her clock, till I saw her at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him when he received the twenty-six pounds? - A. No; I would fcorn it to fly in the face of the laws of my country, after I was told what the law was.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you spoke of its being an odd affair, had he told you what his son had said? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. Let me understand you; in the first place, you were a constable at that time? - A. I was headborough.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were then, and are now a man of an excellent memory? - A. No; my memory has got very bad, like all my other faculties.</p>
               <p>Q. And, besides that, you did very wrong upon this occasion? - A. On the Tuesday, beyond a doubt I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying, and upon your oath too-far be it from me to fly in the face of the laws of my country? - A. By receiving the 25l.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not first of all advise that it should be settled? - A. No, I did not; for he had thrown out the idea of its being settled.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he ever throw out any such idea, except telling you Mrs. Gilbert wished to settle it? - A. He himself told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is what you call throwing out the idea of settling it? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not, though a constable, advise him to settle it, after he had told you Mrs. Gilbert wished you to settle it? - A. I have told the Court I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - A. So long, that I promise you I will never be again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, Mrs. Gilbert's anxiety had made an impression upon your feelings? - A. Yes it had.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you tried to persuade Mr. Sumner to settle it? - A. I wished them all to settle it, for it was an awkward business.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said Mr. Sumner never proposed it himself? - A. It might be proposed by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, I ask you, did Mr. Sumner ever himself desire that it should be settled? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not just now tell me he never did propose it to be settled? - A. I never did tell you so, I am no logician, I am but a plain mechanic.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not told this Jury, that Mr. Sumner never proposed to settle it? - A. No; if I have indirectly said so, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I will tell you what you said, that you did it at the request of neither, that Mr. Sumner never did desire it, but that you did it from your own feelings? - A. I felt it was an awkward piece of business; he told me he had lost so much money, and I knew he was a distressed man; he told me that Mrs. Gilbert was very much distressed about it; and if I have said any thing wrong, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080083"></xptr>hope you will forgive me, as I hope God will for give me, for I came here to tell nothing but the truth.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a nephew to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for by your aunt on the Monday morning? - A. I was; she sent on the Sunday afternoon, and I went on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there, what happened? - A. I went in, she was in bed crying; I asked her what she laid there for; I told the servant to go and ask Mr. Sumner to come up stairs, she went down three times before he came up; I asked him what business he had to keep her in custody; he said he did not keep her in custody, for the door had never been locked upon her; she had told me she was kept in custody; he said he had been robbed; I said, if you have been robbed, why don't you do your duty? he said, I had no business with it, it was nothing to me; says I, if you won't do your's, she shall do her's; he then said he was going about it; he went down stairs, and I went to Clerkenwell sessions to see if I could get a warrant; I did not get one; I then came back to Mrs. Lacon, and told her she must go herself about it, and with that I left her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. After that she called upon me just after she had taken this man up, and desired me to come to Hatton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge at Hatton-street that was made against the prosecutor? - A. We were all ordered out of Court.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer of Hatton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You took up the prosecutor? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose directions did you do so? - A. By order of Mr. Kinnaird.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Mrs. Gilbert at the time the money was paid? - A. I was there at the time the money was paid in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you accompany Mrs. Gilbert to the Horse-shoe for the purpose of the money being paid? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that money so paid by Mrs. Gilbert, under the directions of the Magistrate? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the money paid to? - A. The money, I believe, was paid to Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the adjoining room? - A. Yes, there was a glass looking through from the taproom into the kitchen where the money was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You took Davis just afterwards? - A. Yes, and Dickinson searched Davis in my presence, and he took out a ten pound note, a five pound note, a guinea, and nine shillings, making sixteen pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take the prosecutor? - A. During the time I was searching Davis, Mr. Sumner came into the kitchen, and then I took him into custody, by the direction of Dickinson, for I did not know him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any resistance made? - A. Very great by Sumner, and by Davis likewise; Davis struck me several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any resistance made by Sumner? - A. Yes; he made all the resistance he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Sumner what you took him up for? - A. Yes; I told him I had orders from the prisoner at the bar, for extorting money under false presences for compounding felony; he said, at your peril detain me, if you dare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Upon your oath, have you not been in and out of this Court several times since the trial began? - A. I have been in once, and I have been out once.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, during what time of the trial did you come in that once? - A. During the time two people were examined, I cannot particularly recollect the time.</p>

               <p>Q. And when did you go out? - A. When I was called.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the witnesses for the defendant were examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you come as a witness for the defendant too? - A. I do not know that I do service to any party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not come here as a subpoenaed witness for that woman? - A. No; I have attended voluntarily without any subpoena at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And staid in Court while the witnesses on your side of the cause were examined? - A. I suppose I might have been in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Hearing what the witnesses had to say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a constable in the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, therefore, in the habit of attending Courts of Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know then, that it was particularly ill in you to attend the Court when the witnesses on both sides were ordered not to be in hearing? - A. If it is improper I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, for what purpose did you come in and hear the witnesses, knowing it to be wrong? - A. I do not perceive that my evidence is of any use on either side, as an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, knowing it to be wrong, why did you come in and hear that evidence, on your side the question, for half an hour? - A. I cannot say any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give us any reason, and upon your oath-do recollect you are a constable? - A. I know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then can you give these gentlemen any satis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080084"></xptr>factory reason why you have been in Court, hearing the evidence on your side the question, give it an answer? - A. I cannot say; I did not conceive my evidence of any use whatever, I was only the officer that went to apprehend the party.</p>
               <p>Q. You can give no reason for it, but are sorry for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Sumner resisted, and told you to take him at your peril? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce a warrant to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you had none? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you believed it was paid to Davis; upon your oath, have you any doubt upon earth that the money was paid to Davis? - A. I believe it was, because it was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were in the act of taking it from him before you saw Sumner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Sumner came in with a gentleman? - A. I believe he did, but I cannot say, in the scuffle I could not distinguish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there was such a croud and scuffle, that you could not tell whether he came alone or not? - A. No, I cannot; there were a great many people in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come in? - A. I cannot say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the money was taken from Davis did you see Sumner? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner called five witnesses who had known her from seventeen to twenty-three years, and gave her an excellent character.</p>

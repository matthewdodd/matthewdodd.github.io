               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That is a good price? A. No, it was a very good calf; I had two more calves - they were not marked in the same way; it was very uncommonly marked with a blaze of white in the face- there are not many with such a blaze as that; it was a particularly white mark that I knew it by; (looking at the skin) you do not see a mark like that in one in five thousand, but this skin is dry now - it was narrow at the middle, and wide at the end; if I had seen it fifty miles off I should not have sworn to it - the meat and all was on it when found; the meat and the bones made it all perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not calves always tied up by the nose? A. No, not exactly that tie; if I had seen it in Yorkshire I could have told it was my calf's head - there is very little hair on two of the feet, but I know it was white; I had seen the calf twice every day for seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the feet found in the prisoner's pocket been boiled? A. I do not know - they had been in scalding water I dare say; the hair was off - they could not have eat them without boiling them; I did not fit the feet to the marks - part of the road I traced them in is public, but some of it is a bye road.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You do not speak so particularly to the skin now, as you do to the head; had you any doubt of it when it was found fresh? A. I was positive of it; I should say that the feet found in the prisoner's pocket had been white.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Why, is the colour of the skin different, when it had been covered with white hair, than with black? A. The skin is generally white; if the calf had black legs the skin looks black.</p>

            . I am a constable of Friern, Barnet. On Sunday morning, about seven o'clock, I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's cottage - I saw him coming up the lane; I said, "Evans, I want you - I have business with you;" he said, "What do you want?" I said, "I have a warrant to search your house for a stolen calf;" he said, "You can go without me;" I said, "You must go with me," and took him back - I found the two feet in his pocket, and went to a ditch near the hovel, where I found two calves' feet and the entrails - a little further I found the body of a calf; a little further on Holman found the head and two feet; he said, "That is my calf's head, any how."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were the feet found in the prisoner's pocket boiled? A. No - they were not, for there were white hairs left on; it had been partly hooked off, and warm water put on - they had not been boiled, but coddled; I found nothing in the prisoner's house - the prisoner did not say he was going to Brook-green: the ditch is about twenty yards from the hovel, down at the bottom of his garden - the hovel was on his premises; nothing was found there, but by going into the hovel I saw the window was open and nettles broken down, as if something had been dragged out to the very place where the calf lay - it gave me a fair track; I do not think I mentioned that before; any body might have access to the ditch - the hovel was unlocked and the key hanging loose to the door.</p>

            . My husband is a labouring man, and lives seventy or eighty yards from the prisoner. On Sunday morning, the 22nd of May, a little after seven o'clock. I saw the prisoner going out of his hut three times, from the door of the hut to the window, and from the window to the ditch, where the calf was found; soon after he had gone three times, I saw the constable and Holman come.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLMAN. It was Saturday morning that I traced the marks, but I took the prisoner on the Sunday morning, and then we found the calf - I did not get the warrant till late at night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know he was in the habit of going to cut down nettles and things in the ditch? A. Yes, but he had not any thing to do it with that morning - he went through empty handed; he could not have had his tools in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not his pockets hold a pair of scissors or a knife? A. Yes, but they would not cut enough to clear a ditch out - he did not drag the calf there when I saw him- he had no jacket on; he was dressed in breeches and shirt-sleeves.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Mr. Young, a butcher, of Baker-street - I have been a butcher seven years; I saw the different parts of the calf on Monday morning - they are all here; I have not a doubt that they all belong to the same animal; the two hind feet and one fore foot were cut off at the proper joint, the other was not - they all corresponded; the two fore feet were white: the two hind ones had been scalded, but I think they were white for they have white tufts corresponding with the two fore feet; if they had not been white feet they would have been a darker colour - I have not a doubt all the feet belonged to the same calf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call the feet which were found on the prisoner white? A. Not now, because they have been laying so long; there is as much hair on them now as when found - they have been scalded too much, and then the hair does not come off properly; a good deal of the flesh has been taken off with a sharp knife - I will not swear the hair on this leg may not have been black; there is very little grazing in that part of the country - my master has two or three calves every week; there are six butchers in the place.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were the two feet dressed as butcher's would dress them? A. No - I fitted the bind feet to the joints; they fitted exactly - I have not a doubt they belonged to the same calf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I feel it a duty incumbent on me, as well for the preservation of my character as for the ends of public justice, that I should make a few observations on the evidence that has been adduced to sustain the present charge, and I beseech you, as a British Jury, who believe in the divine attributes and value the sacred obligations of an oath, that before you come to any decided conclusion respecting such evidence, you will give it a mature deliberation. The evidence that has been adduced to you against me certainly appears suspicious, but I do most solemnly assure you that on the night of the robbery I was in my bed, and that I am entirely innocent of the charge brought against me; the constable and headborough, my Lord, have both known me a number of years, and never knew any thing wrong of my character - I have lived upwards of thirty years in the neighbourhood, and always bore a good character for honesty and sobriety. I humbly submit that it is not likely that a man of my time of life should be induced to commit so henious a crime for which I am now unfortunately arraigned at this bar. Since I have been in prison there have been frequent robberies committed in the neighbourhood, and no person has been found that committed them. As regards the tracing of the calf's feet, it was very easy for him to do it, being a regular road way, and fifty or sixty carts passing in the course of the day. and therefore I submit it was very easy.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Ray-street, Clerkenwell, and am a skin-dresser. The prisoner had been in my employ about eighteen months—I had advanced him some money in December last—that was the first me—I advanced him more again in February—he worked by the piece—owed me some money—he owes me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now—on Saturday, the 24th of February, I paid my men as usual—one of the shopmen who says the men was to deduct what the prisoner owed me—about half-past seven o'clock that evening I was sitting in my parlour, and heard the pri<lb></lb>soner ask if his master was in—I went to the door immediately, and said, What do you want, Bill?"—his reply was, "You have sent me home without money"—my reply was, I could not make more of him than I did with the rest of the shopmen—he directly after tried to catch hold of me—was at a distance from the half door, and he was outside it, leaping over—he tried to catch hold of me, with his left hand, by my coat, and he drew a knife from his coat pocket, where he had it inside, and got it ready will give me a stab—I rushed from him, and called out, "O my God"—I observed him put his hand inside his coat, and saw a handle as if it was a knife—he had caught hold of my coat very slightly, but I got from him, exclaiming, "My God, I am going," and ran away—I heard the half door burst open—he caught me, and as I was opening the shop door he stabbed me—I do not recollect any thing further for a few minutes till the witness Finnegan took hold of me—I was not aware that I had been stabbed for two or three minutes—I did not feel any blow at the time—I fainted away, and when I recovered I saw Finnegan holding the prisoner round the waist,—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Martin, take care, he has got a knife in his hand"—I found I had been stabbed—I knew I had had a blow on my neck, but whether with the blade or handle of the knife I could not tell at the moment—I sent for a surgeon—I afterwards saw a knife which was found, and it is the very knife the prisoner drew out of his pocket—I know it by the handle—he used it in his employ—I had seen it often before—I was laid up for six or sever days—I had more clothes on than when I am at work—I had a coat, waistcoat, shirt, and flannel shirt on—I have got the coat here which I wore—there are two cuts in the back and one in the collar.</p>

On Saturday, the 24th of February, I was at home—the prisoner came and asked if his master was within, and stated that he had a child dead, and a girl lying it—I heard that, and I heard the prosecutor afterwards exclaim, "Oh, my God, I am going"—I went out into the passage, and saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor with one hand, and the other hand at the back of his neck, and in a faint voice the prosecutor said, "He has a knife in his hand"—after it was all over I picked a knife up in the passage, and gave it to a policeman of the E division—I saw the place where the prisoner was standing—I did not see any thing in his hand—I was very much alarmed—I picked up the knife close to where I saw him holding the pro<lb></lb>secutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Deval, of 6, Tunbridge Place, Peckham—on 13th January I had two shawls and a pair of boots in the kitchen—I saw them as late as nine o'clock at night—we did not go to bed till eleven—I fastened up the doors and windows before going to bed—I was the last up—the door is very easily forced open, as the bolt is a very bad one—I was not disturbed at all in the night—my husband was up first in the morning—my daughter went down at seven—I came down about eight—I did not miss the shawls till twelve in the day—I saw that a great many lucifers had been partly burnt, and then I looked about, and missed the shawls—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the boots have not been found—I found the brickwork and the woodwork of the window broken away—that had been all safe the night before.</p>

About a quarter-past four on the morning of the 14th January I was on duty in High Street, Peckham, and saw the prisoner in company with another man—the prisoner was carrying these two shawls in a handkerchief—knowing him, I went and asked him what he had got; he said, "Two shawls"—I asked where he got them from; he said, "From Mrs. Brown, of Cambridge Place; the number I can't tell you; I am not certain; it was near the Red Cow"—I went part of the way with him, but, not believing his statement, I took him to the station, and said I would go and see myself.</p>

               <p>the beershop Brown came out again, and came along with me a little way—the prisoner said to him, "Ned, come back with me; he thinks I have stolen these shawls; come back, and see they are all right: I have told him I had them from Mrs. Brown, and I am going back to give him satisfaction"—I took the prisoner to the station, and then went to Mrs. Brown to make inquiry—I am quite sure he said Mrs. Brown gave them to him.</p>

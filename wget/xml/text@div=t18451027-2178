                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Shaw—lie is a linen-draper—the prisoner was his housemaid. On Saturday night, the 18th of Oct., I, with a policeman, searched the prisoner's box—she was not present, but the policeman was, and Mr. Rogers—believe it was the prisoner's box—it was in a room adjoining her room, which is merely used to hold boxes and a chest of drawers—I found in the bottom of the box this book, which is mine—I also found three lengths of new calico, containing about ten yards—it was my father's, and had our private mark on it—I had missed my book about a month.</p>

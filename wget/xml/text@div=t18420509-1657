                  </hi>. I am out of business at present, and live at Stock, in Essex. In the early part of 1839 I carried on business in Queen-street, Cheapside, in partnership with Mr. Taylor, and resided in the country—I became acquainted with the prisoner in May, 1839—I rendered him some service at that time—in August, 1839, the prisoner and his wife called on me at the warehouse in Queen-street—his wife said in his presence that her husband had a valuable property case for a person named Wall, at Whet<lb></lb>stone, and from the great kindness I had rendered him in his distress, it was his determination I should receive a portion of the property when recovered—his wife said that, and he rejoined by stating that I had been a great friend to him, that, this property would amount to a very large sum, and it was his intention that I should have a share of it, but at the same time they stated their circumstances would not allow them to carry on the suit unless furnished with money for the purpose, and also for their support during the time the Chancery suit was in hand—his wife said this, and he himself stated so afterwards—shortly after, in October, 1839, he brought me a copy of a will—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said he brought it for my satisfaction, to show me that there was such a Chancery suit in existence, and to satisfy me as far as was in his power—he said he could show me that there was such a property to which this Wall was entitled, and he would introduce me to Wall, and also to other members of the family—he did introduce me to Joshua Wall, I think in September, 1839, at the Anchor in Newport-street—that was previous to his bringing me the copy of the will—on the 24th of January, 1840, I gave him a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I produce—previous to my giving him that cheque he said that he was desirous of relieving Wall's family until the business was settled—I asked him what he proposed to allow Wall and his family until the business was settled—he said he thought 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week would be sufficient—I told him to make the most he could of the money that I advanced him, but I should have, no objection to his advancing from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to Wall until the, business was settled—on the 22nd of February he came to me again at Queen-street, and stated that he was going to the Court of Chancery, and it was his intention to make a present to some of the clerks—that he found the clerks in the Court more ready to attend to the business he had in hand if he made them presents—no one was present but our two selves when he stated that—he got from me a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion—he said he was going with Mr. Taylor to the Court of Chancery—that he (Mr. Taylor) was the acting man in the business at the Court of Chancery—this cheque is dated the 22nd of February—on the 2nd of March, he came to me again, and said he was going to the Court of Chancery with Mr. Taylor, that they should have to discharge some heavy fees at the Court, and on that occa<lb></lb>sion he obtained this cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was in my warehouse two or three times a week on the average, all the year round, and was constantly pestering me for money—I drew so much from the firm that it almost embarrassed us, and caused a dissolution of partnership between me and my partner—about the beginning of December, 1840, as near as I can re<lb></lb>member, the prisoner went to town—before he went, he expressed his</p>

               <p>opinion that he should find the business settled—and when he came back, he said it was just as he had thought, that he had seen the attorneys, that the Chancery business was finally concluded, that the cheques were drawn for the division of the property, and that he had nothing more to do but to bring up Wall and the members of Wall's family to receive; that he should require a suit of clothes to appear in at the Court of Chancery on that occasion and also a great-coat—in consequence of that I wrote to Pearson, my tailor, who came down to Leytonstone, and measured him for a suit of clothes and a great-coat, of the most expensive cloth—I was present when they were brought in by my tailor, and saw the prisoner in them afterwards—they were furnished on my credit—the prisoner has had three suits of him on my account altogether—I have seen him wear that particular suit frequently, and the great-coat too—it had a velvet collar, and the waist<lb></lb>coat was a figured velvet—I believe the suit cost 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this letter, (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is the prisoner's handwriting—I received it from the hands of his wife, and gave her a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note when she brought it—it is dated Jan. 22, 1841—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. Hinton, 2, Forest-place, Leytonstone,—My dear Sir, I write merely to say that the business is concluded with the exception of fetching up Wall, which I intend doing to-morrow, and must beg a little of the needful from you to enable me to do so. I should have come down to you, but I am afraid I should increase my cold, which is very bad, and my boots are too thin to attempt to come through this deep snow; my wife is coming back to me to-night, and I wish to start early in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and she will bring to me what you choose to send,—I am, dear Sir, your's truly, Richard Hitchcock."—at the latter part of 1839, the prisoner said that Messrs. Shave and Taylor had sent out two agents to Antigua, who had proved the identity of Wall as the heir of the property: that they had returned, and had successfully accomplished their mission—some time after he said the Lord Chancellor had issued the decree in favour of Joshua Wall.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the prisoner told you the names of the attor<lb></lb>neys, what else did he say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said it was on condition that I made no inquiries of them, that they would not be interfered with in the busi<lb></lb>ness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184205090193"></xptr>
               <p>—he safe me strict injunctions that I should not go to them or com<lb></lb>municate with any one of them—I lost sight of the prisoner about tea days after I sent him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had hand-bills circulated, offering 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for his apprehension—he was not taken dn this charge—he was taken in Whitechapel, I think, in October last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the nature of this flourishing busi<lb></lb>ness you were carrying on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A branch of the iron business—I had been in it four years, about two years and nine months before I became acquainted with the prisoner—I think I had been living in Tredegar-square about six months before I married—the prisoner was living at Tredegaer<lb></lb>square the whole time—I removed and lived with them in Tredegaf-square—at least they lived with me there—I engaged the apartments—I believe I and the prisoner occupied the house on the same day together—the prisoner might be in the occupation of the house a few hours before I went there, but not a day with his family—the prisoner, his wife, the daughter I afterwards married, and three children, lived there—before I went to Tredegar-square I had a furnished bed-room near Southwark-bridge, at Bank-side—I did not live there with the prisoner—I removed my clothes and trunks to Tredegar-square from Bank-side—I had only one room there—my habits were economical—before that I lived at Mrs. Wallace's, a friend of mine, at No. 6, Stamford-grove East, Upper Clapton—I cannot toll you how long I lived there—these are foolish questions, they have nothing to do with the case—the prisoner did not live with me then, nor I with him—I believe he lived in Garnault-place then—I went to Garnault-place after the first time he came to my warehouse, previous to my going to Trede<lb></lb>gar-square—I visited them there—I never went there to live—after leaving Tredegar-square I went to Herman-hill, on-Epping-forest, and had the greater part of a furnished house—I did not agree to board with the prisoner and his family at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, nothing of the kind—they engaged the house at Herman-hill, but I found the money to pay the lodgings and support them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on your oath, was it not during the time you were living there that some of these sums were paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I speak of the pri<lb></lb>soner having had, was expressly for Wall's business—I found money for the housekeeping—I lived at Herman-hill from April to June, I think—I went to live with him originally in May, 1839, and we continued to live together, from one place to another, till January, 1841—the prisoner's wife had the management of the house—I cannot say exactly how much I paid them for housekeeping during that time—I kept no account of it—on my oath the prisoner had 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me for the purpose of carrying on Wall's business—the prisoner did not pay the whole of my wedding expenses—I paid for the whole of them—Mrs. Hitchcock received the money in my counting-house last March—I cannot say the precise amount—I kept no account of it, but she, the prisoner, and all the family, had new suits of clothes—I have received money from him to the amount of a few shillings, not to the amount of several pounds—I think Wall came to my warehouse twice, and met the prisoner there, with some other members of his family—they met for the purpose of talking of this law-suit—I should certainly not have trusted to the prisoner unless I had seen Wall—what I heard from Wall and other members of his fauie mily, and from his friends, certainly impressed the belief on my mind that he was entitled to the property—unless that belief had been impressed on my mind by Wall and his friends, I should certainly not have trusted to the prisoner's representations.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, in partnership with Mr. Shave, in Fenchurch-street. I remember some time in 1839, the prisoner coming to me and bringing a person with him who he represented to be Wall—he stated that Mr. Wall was entitled to large property, that he had been ad<lb></lb>vertised for that—there were proceedings in Chancery, and he brought some papers, but what they were I do not remember—by my desire he showed the advertisement to me—it referred to Messrs. Teasdale and Symet, solicitors, in Fenchurch-street—in consequence of that reference I went to Messrs., Teasdale and Symes's, leaving the prisoner and the man he called Wall in my office—I came back and told them that the suit had been disposed of by the Court of Chancery, and there was nothing for Wall, he had applied too late, or something of that sort—the prisoner did not em<lb></lb>ploy us as his attorneys for Wall in the Chancery suit—I never saw the prisoner afterwards till he was in custody—I did not go with him to the Court of Chancery to pay for the costs, or any thing else—there was no pretence for saying there was any suit going on about Wall's property in our office,</p>

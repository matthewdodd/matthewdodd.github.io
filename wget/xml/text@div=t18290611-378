The prisoner lodged at my house, with two other young men - he came on the 13th of May; he was there two or three nights; the then said he was going to Yorkshire; some of this property was in drawers, and some in a trunk - he slept there on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights. On the Friday evening I put my pocketbook into the trunk, in the room in which he slept, and on the Saturday morning I missed it, when I went to get the money - he had left that morning, and said he was going to Yorkshire, by the steamer, on the Monday morning; he had paid me, but I thought he was coming again on the Saturday night and Sunday, but he did not return: I have only seen the coat since, which had been in the trunk - I lost two pins, a brooch, three coats, four pairs of trousers, and various other articles, and five sovereigns; the value of the whole was 10l. - I have only seen one coat. On Saturday, the 6th of June, I met the prisoner in the Com<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110167"></xptr>mercial-road; I took him by the arm, and said, "You are the thief that robbed me!" he never spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you observe any alteration in my dress? A. No; when he left he put the sixpence on the table, and walked out; I do not know that he spoke to me, nor I to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this coat and the other articles were in the room I slept in? A. I cannot swear that; they were my lodger's clothes.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JOSLIN. I am shopman to Mr. Williams, a pawnbroker, of Brick-lane. I have a coat, pawned by the prisoner, on the 26th of May, for 25s., in the name of Joseph Byron - I knew him before.</p>

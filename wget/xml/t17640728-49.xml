            . I live in Houndsditch, and am a brasier. The two prisoners came to my shop, on the 27th of June, and brought forty-five copper hoops, seven brass hooks, and a screw; I never had seen such before, being but young in trade: I gave them 9 d. a pound for the hoops, and 7 d. a pound for the other things; the day after a gentleman said they were stole, and shewed me the King's broad arrow upon some of them, which I did not see before. They came again on the 18th of July, with fifty-three more copper hoops; I weighed them, and kept them in discourse, while I sent my maid out for an officer; she not meeting with one, I said they must come again to-morrow. Last Friday they came into my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280028"></xptr> neighbourhood, and were taken up in Gravel-lane: they were taken before my Lord Mayor; there they said they found them in a bush. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Furnis and Mr. Dalton, officers belonging to his Majesty's stores, deposed, there were hundreds of copper hoops, which belong to the powder magazine at Greenwich missing, of the same make and sort, the property of his Majesty; and that the prisoners were two matrosses, whose business it was, in their turn, to watch the magazine.</p>

               <p>Watson's Defence.</p>
               <p>Griffin is my comrade; he came and told me a young man had shewn him a quantity of such things in the field. About a month after we went that way, and saw them lying there; and as we could neither write nor read, we did not know the broad arrow; we thought they were as lawfully ours, as any body's else.</p>
               <p>Griffin's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was walking on the bank, and a young man gave me a call down to a hedge; he said he had found a parcel of things; I saw them, but did not remove them; they lay there a month after; then we thought we might sell them.</p>

            . I was on guard at Greenwich, about five weeks ago: when I came from guard, I took a walk in the field; I saw this parcel of hoops lying in a bush; I called Griffin, and shewed them to him: I took no more notice of them; and what became of them I do not know; they had green leaves over them: this was just behind the guard room, in the hedge.</p>

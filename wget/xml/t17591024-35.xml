               <p>Q. Were you partners in business?</p>
               <p>Folger. No. I never knew her above eight weeks; last Saturday was se'nnight I missed a handkerchief, and some other trifles. I told her, I had missed such and such things. She said, She knew nothing of them. I got a warrant and took her up; after that, she owned she had taken the things mentioned in the indictment, and had pawned them at Mr Fryer's in Wych-street, for 3 s. or 3 s. and 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live with you then?</p>
               <p>Folger. Yes. This was a week after I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let it pass so long?</p>
               <p>Folger. I told her, If I had but the things I would let it pass.</p>

On the fifteenth of this month, the prisoner brought a black silk handkerchief called Catgut, and a black silk apron and handkerchief, and pawned with me for 3 s. and 6 d. she said, they were her own property. She said, she lived in the street where I do. But I never saw her before.</p>

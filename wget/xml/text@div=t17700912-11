I went down a little way; she wanted me to go lower down; I told her I would not: I began to feel about her for my watch; she said, what do you want to rob me? I said, no; I only want my watch again. Just as I spoke them words the two other prisoners came up to me; they came one of each side of me, and laid hold on each side my collar; there was another man came with them; they clapped something to my breast, which I believe were pistols.</p>

               <p>Wright. Both. I told them the girl had taken my watch, and I begged they would not use me ill; they bid me go a little farther along with them; I begged for my liberty; they pulled me farther down, and began to feel all about me; one of them put his hand into my fob, and took out my money; the other put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out a shilling, which was all I had in that pocket; I had four guineas in my fob; then they laid me down upon my back, and they clapped something to my breast again; I begged they would spare my life and take all I had; they stript off my coat and waistcoat and took off my hat; then they said, Run for your life, or I will blow your brains out. I immediately ran, and I run against a post and knocked myself backwards; I got up again and ran a little way, and called the watch, and went back again to the place, but they were all gone; somebody looked out at the: window and said they knew the people.</p>

               <p>Wright. She stood by; and begged they would take my life before they parted with me; as I lay upon my back I took particular notice of them. I went home to my lodgings, and in the morning I went to Sir

               <p>Q. How did you describe them?</p>
               <p>Wright. That one of them was about five foot and six or seven inches; the other a short man, with a long nose and black curled hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell the dress they were in?</p>
               <p>Wright. I told Sir John, that I believed they had both of them blue jackets on, but I could not be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did you give of the woman?</p>
               <p>Wright. That she was a stout, bold, large featured woman, and had a manly look.</p>
               <p>(Note, the prisoners answered this description.)</p>
               <p>Q. What account did you give of the third man?</p>
               <p>Wright. That he was quite a young fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. He did nothing to you, did he?</p>
               <p>Wright. He gave me a push on the back as they were driving me away.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken?</p>
               <p>Wright. The woman was taken the day after the robbery; I was not present at taking her; I saw her at the prison at White-Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the men taken?</p>
               <p>Wright. The day following; and I saw them before the bench of Justices at the Rotation at White-Chapel, on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Wright. No nothing at all. Josephs said before the Justice that if I could swear to him he would turn King's evidence. Simpson was taken first; I swore to him: when I had sworn to him, he asked the Justices to admit him an evidence; and said then he would help me to all my things again.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120007"></xptr>Q. Where had you been that night?</p>
               <p>Wright. I had been that day to a club-feast, at the Vine in the Minories. I was there from twelve o'clock to nine at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking pretty freely?</p>
               <p>Wright. No; very trifling.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you after nine o'clock?</p>
               <p>Wright. Several of us went to a dancing in Spitalfields. I staid there some time; and as I was going back to the club, to call for two or three acquaintances, I met a young woman at Rosemary-lane, who told me she was afraid to go through Rosemary-lane by herself, and begged I would go with her; I walked with her to the top of Rosemary-lane; she leaned upon my arm; in coming back again I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Wright. I was not perfectly sober, but I was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Wright. There were several lamps just by where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish a person's face?</p>
               <p>Wright. There was sufficient light for that.</p>

               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider here are three people's lives at stake upon your single testimony. - It was dark - a late hour of the night - you had been drinking. - Now are you able to recollect the persons of these people with so much certainty as to be able to swear positively to the persons of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Wright. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you challenge them immediately when you first saw them?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes, I did. I never had a doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking in that house a great while, was you not disguised?</p>
               <p>Wright. I take care never to disguise myself with liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman that leaned upon your arm was not the prisoner, was she?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you going any where with that woman?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did she not ask you to go to a house with her?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you greatly surprized?</p>
               <p>Wright. Greatly so.</p>
               <p>Q. And would not that surprize take away your recollection?</p>
               <p>Wright. I was not surprized by the woman, when I lay upon my back my surprize was more over.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in no house after you left the club but the place you danced at, with no woman nor man?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you told by a man that looked out at the window, for the first time, who were the people that had robbed you before you had any apprehension of them?</p>
               <p>Wright. Upon my oath I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. from Simpson. Did not you say before the Justice that you was much disordered in liquor?</p>
               <p>Wright. I did not.</p>

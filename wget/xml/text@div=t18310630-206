The prisoner was in my service; I put three marked shillings and three marked sixpences into my breeches pocket, which I left hanging on the back of a chair at the foot of my bed, on the 6th of June, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - I went up about two, and 1s. 6d. of the money was gone; I went up again in the evening, and it was then all gone - I had told the Policeconstable to be in the tap-room, and just as the prisoner was going home, about nine o'clock in the evening, I told her to stop in the parlour - the Police-constable then came in; I said I thought she had some money which she took from my breeches pocket up-stairs - she gave no answer; the officer said she must give up what she had or he must search her - she then gave up these two shillings and two sixpences, which are what I had marked; the other 1s. 6d. was gone; she said if she had had them she must have lost them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Had you a good character with her? A. Yes; I did not give her the breeches to brush - she had not the care of any clothes; she did not say, "In brushing your clothes, the money fell out, and I forgot to give it you."</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was called in - the prisoner denied taking the money, and the prosecutor wished me to search her, which I did; I took from her these two shillings and two sixpences - she took her pocket off, and I found them in it; I asked what she had done with the rest - she said if she had that she must have lost it; the prosecutor stated he had marked the money - the marks are on it now; she acknowledged taking it afterwards.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

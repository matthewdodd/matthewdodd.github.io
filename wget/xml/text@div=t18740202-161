                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a tobacconist, of Greek Street, Soho—on 9th January, about 1.30, I served the prisoner with a twopenny cigar, he gave me a half-crown, and I gave him the change, and put it in the till—there was no other there—the same afternoon, about 2.30, I sent a woman named Clementine to market with the half-crown, and while she was out the prisoner came in again for a twopenny cigar, and gave me a florin, and I gave him the change—after he left Clementine came back with the half-crown cut—about 7 o'clock the prisoner came again for a twopenny cigar, and gave me a half-crown—I sent Clementine to a public-house with it, to see whether it was good—she came outside and told me to keep the shop door shut while she went for a policeman—I did so—she returned in twenty minutes or half an hour with a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge with the coins—the prisoner remained in the shop—I had spoken to Clementine in French.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an Interpreter</hi>). I saw the prisoner come into the shop about 1.20 or 1.30—the prosecutrix served him—she afterwards gave me a half-crown to go to market with—I took it to a public-house, and the landlord cut it and gave me back the pieces, which were put into the till—the prisoner came again about 7 o'clock for a twopenny cigar, and I saw him tender a half-crown—I went to a public-house to inquire if it was good, and went back to the door and told the prosecutrix to shut the door and I would fetch a policeman—I did so, and gave him the half-crown in the street, and the prisoner was given into his custody with the cut half-crown—I have seen the prisoner there several times, and have served him several times—I recollect on one occasion when a cigar would not draw, I put a darning needle into it to make it draw better.</p>

She said she had taken a cut of Irish to make some aprons, and then another cut of Irish, to make three aprons, and three pairs of shoes - I found this piece of Irish at Bennett's and this pair of shoes - Bennett said this was one pair the girl gave her, that one pair she had worn out, and one pair she had lost; and this comb was also found.</p>

I saw her on the 5th, standing before my own door; she was missing early on the morning of the 6th. I took considerable trouble to find her, but without success. I came to town afterwards, in consequence of a letter, and saw the prisoner Johnson. I saw Chapman at the Police-office, on the 10th of November. I think I have seen him before, but cannot swear to him. I have seen Johnson several times at Marshfield, but always knew him by the name of Carter.</p>

I know Johnson, and saw him that night in Mr. Jones's tap-room - he was having a pot of beer, and had the newspaper - he had a white smock-frock on, grey-stockings, and low tied shoes. I knew him long before - he went by the name of William Carter down there. I came to town afterwards, and saw the mare - it was the same.</p>

            . I am a carrier from Marshfield, and know Johnson - I saw him on the 5th of October, sitting at the King's Arms public-house, which is kept by Jones - he had then got on a smock-frock, grey stockings, and low shoes - that might be between four and five o'clock in the afternoon - I saw him again up in the street, between ten and eleven that night: he then had boots and spurs on, and a light coloured top coat - the front of the coat appeared pushed out on one side, and was buttoned up. I said, "Good night, Carter," and he said,"Good night, Bond." I cannot be mistaken in him, for I have known him for years; I watched him a good way down the lane which leads to Jones' field, where the mare Poppet is kept. I have seen the other prisoner before, but did not see him in Marshfield that day - his name is Thomas Derrick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long before you saw Johnson at the King's Arms had you seen Chapman? A. I might not have seen him for six months, not to notice him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. What day was it you saw me? A. On the 5th - you were at the King's Arms, and opposite Mrs. Martin's - it was not dark; the moon was full that night.</p>

            , and the same features - I never saw him before that I know of: I met him in the street, and had an opportunity of observing him - I think he had a blue coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the man at the bar is the man? A. He is the same features, and he is the man - I saw him first about the middle of the day, and I saw him again sitting on a wicket-gate, which goes into one of Jones' fields, about a quarter-past three o'clock. I saw Derrick at the office in town afterwards, and had not the least doubt of his being the man I saw on the gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why then do you say it was a man about the same height and features? A. He is the man; I thought I was going to be asked the description of him- he had a black hat on; I know he had a coat, but will not swear what colour it was. I saw him first about the middle of the day; I do not think I ever saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Chapman shown to you at the office, and you asked "Is not this the man?" A. Yes - I said it was. I have not a doubt of him; I saw him coming twenty yards off, and he passed within a yard of me. I saw him on the gate for five minutes - he got off the gate, and got on again; I went down a field, and when I got to the bottom of it he was still there. I knew Johnson before - I do not know that I saw him that day: I heard they were both taken for this offence. I do not recollect that Derrick was pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We understood you to say he was pointed out, and you were asked if he was not the man? A. I do not recollect it - I do not know that any one pointed him out; I knew him directly I went in, and said, "This is the man;" I had not the least doubt of him - I really do believe he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you are not quite confident? A. I mean to say that is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was not Chapman brought into the yard and pointed out to you, as the man who was apprehended with Johnson? A. Nothing was said to me, to the best of my knowledge; I knew him as soon as I saw him.</p>

            . I am a coppersmith, and am owner of some stables in Bath-street, St. Luke's. On the 8th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in company together to my stables - they had each a mare, and wished to leave them there for the night, which they did; they told me to feed the mares- they each unsaddled one; Johnson principally gave the directions - they were both present. I locked the stable door, and asked if I should feed them in the morning - Johnson said No, they would come in time to see them fed, which they did, and stood talking for a little while; Johnson examined the shoes, and asked who was my farrier; I named Blake, and the mares were sent there by Johnson's direction; they went away, and about seven o'clock in the evening they both came again; one of the mares was still at the farrier's - I sent my son for it, telling him to bring a bill; he brought it, and gave Johnson a bill of 8s. - he gave him a sovereign; my son paid the bill, and returned him the change: the mares were fetched from my stable on Thursday, the 11th; Brown, the officer, brought Chapman to the stable that evening, and asked him, in my presence, if the mares belonged to him - he said they did not, they belonged to the other man; Chapman was left there, in Armstrong's custody, and Brown returned in five minutes with Johnson in custody, and asked him if those were his horses or mares - he said No, he had never seen them before; Chapman was present.</p>
               <p>Q. The principal, if not all the conversat on which passed with you was with Johnson? A. Yes; I do not know that I exchanged two words with Chapman; I had let part of a stable in the same yard to William Hallam - these mares were in my part of the stable.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 11th of October I went to the stable in Bath-street, and left Armstrong in possession of the two mares - I then went to No. 5, Coleman-street, Bunhill-row, St. Luke's, and apprehended Chapman in the top room of the house - that is Johnson's room; I took him to the stable in Bath-street, left him in Armstrong's custody, and as I returned to No. 5 again I met Johnson, within two doors of the house - I took him also to the stables. - The mares have been in our possession ever since. Armstrong asked them both who the mares belonged to - they were both handcuffed together, and both denied all knowledge whatever of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners, in your presence, afterwards say any thing about these mares? A. Yes, about a fortnight afterwards; they were brought before the Magistrate, but no examination was taken - they were merely brought to the bar, and sent back for re-examination; Chapman then said that the black mare, which he had rode to Wilkins' stable, was his own - that he had bought it, and paid for it; nobody had claimed the mares at that time: he said he had bought her of a man, whom he did not name, but I think he did name a place, which I do not recollect. The prosecutor afterwards claimed that mare; it was one of them which I had brought from the stable in Bath-street; it has not been out of our custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at the stable with Wilkins when you had Chapman in hold? A. Yes - I have heard Wilkins examined, and heard him state that Chapman said the horse was Johnson's - he did not say so to me; he might think I was there - I never heard it said. Wilkins was there when I brought Johnson in. Both of them, when I asked, said, "No, we know nothing about them."</p>
               <p>Q. Has any reward been offered? A. No; I had seen no bills about them, and I do not know of any reward - I have not been promised any reward if they are convicted; I expect to be paid for my trouble, either by the prosecutor or the Court. I asked Jones, when he first came to town, if there was a reward, and it may have been talked of since - I do not know what reward there is; I have talked to him about being paid for the food of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not talked to him twenty times about the reward? A. No, nor ten times; I think about 5l. has been named, and I have had the horses to keep all this while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, was not your share of the reward to be 5l.? A. No, I cannot tell what it would be till I come to share it among those who have had the trouble - I do not expect more than 5l. from Jones.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who has kept the mares all this time? A. They have been at a livery-stable - I expect I am responsible for their keep. It will make no difference to me whether the prisoners are convicted or not.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not you know the stable-keeper has been paid? A. I am sure he is not, for the bill will not be given in till after the trial - I expect it to be sent to me - one has been sent some time ago, expecting the horses would be sent home before the trial.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 11th of October I was at Wilkins' stables, and saw both the mares; Brown gave Chapman into my custody, and brought in Johnson: I handcuffed them together. I pointed out the two mares to both of them, and asked them how they came in possesion of those mares; I am sure I asked them both that question - they both denied ever seeing them before: they gave their names as Chapman and Johnson; I searched Johnson, and found on him a small farries's bill, which I put into my pocket, in going to the office, and have lost it. About a fortnight afterwards I was present at the office when they were brought up to be remanded, and told they were committed for another day; there was no examination whatever at that time, as we had not found an owner; no deposition was taken, nor any body sworn - no threat or promise was held out to them; Johnson said he bought his mare of a man at Portsdown fair - Chapman said he bought his of a man, but he did not know his name; those were the two mares of which they had previously denied all knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was this conversation? A. At the bar, before the Magistrate; the depositions had been taken at a former examination - they were not questioned at all: they came up boldly, and asked for their own property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, having said a fortnight before that they knew nothing about the mares, they came forward voluntarily, and said where they got them from? A. They did - nobody had claimed them then.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoners know that? A. That I cannot tell, but nobody had appeared against them- they were present at all the examinations, and when the depositions were written down.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you looked at these boots? A. Not particularly - I believe they belonged to Johnson, for he claimed them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to THOMAS WILKINS. Q. Did you take sufficient notice of the mares as to know on which each of the prisoners rode? A. Yes; Jones claimed the one which Chapman rode.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time of night did they come? A. About eight o'clock - the yard was locked - my son opened the door - he is not here - I went out - I did not see them on the horses, for they led them - Chapman led the one which Mr. Jones claims.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Johnson ride out in the morning? A. I did not see him go out - but I saw him come in - it was not Jones' horse that he rode in.</p>

            . I am married - my husband has left me - I live in Broadwall, Blackfriars - the prisoner Chapman came to sleep at my house on Tuesday evening, the 2d<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060031"></xptr>of October - I did not know him before that - he slept at my house every night till the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing which enables you to recollect the time from the 2d of October till the Sunday? A. Yes; I had a letter from my friends, concerning my husband - I do not know what the prisoner's occupation was - he never went out till after breakfast - he sometimes breakfasted at ten o'clock; sometimes at eight or nine - he slept at my house every night till the Sunday - ten o'clock at night is the latest hour he ever came home.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you now live? A. Down at what's-the-name of the place? Blackfriars, 19, Bear-lane - I have lived there three weeks, with one Mrs. Hunt - I have a room there - the prisoner was the only lodger that I had on the 2d of October - my husband had left me, and I thought I must get a bit of bread somehow - I have since sold my things - my husband has left me five months today - the prisoner is the first lodger I had - he came and asked if he could sleep there - I said he could - I made no inquiry about him - I have a child about four years old - the prisoner went by the name of Thomas Chapman.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear you were to be examined here to-day? A. I heard nothing of it till Thursday, when a person came and told me he was in prison, that was his father - I had never seen him before; I went to Mr. Isaacs', the lawyer, and told him what my evidence was - I remember the 2d of October by the letter I received - there was nobody in the house but myself and child; the prisoner had what victuals he wanted - he cooked it himself - he sometimes came home to dinner, and sometimes did not - not a soul called on him while he lodged with me; when he left me he said he was going to Weyhill fair; he came back again, and slept at my house on the 10th of October; I am sure it was the 10th; it was Wednesday night; he paid for his lodgings, and left; I did not ask where he was going, nor did he tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask him before where he was going? A. I made it my business, as he was in the way of travelling, if he should see my husband to ask him to be so good as to come home - I do not know what part of the country my husband is in.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he to know your husband? A. I do not know - he might have seen him before perhaps - I do not know whether he knew him - I said if he should happen to hear his name.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure he slept at your house on the 10th of October? A. I am.</p>

            . I live at Bristol. I know Chapman - I came to town on Monday, the 1st of October, under the idea of obtaining a situation - I was in Smithfield-market on Friday, the 5th, and saw Chapman at Harry Harmer's, the Plough public-house, Windmill-court - I have known him for the last four or five years; he asked me to drink, and we went to Harmer's together, and drank.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who gave you the drink? A. The girl brought the porter into the room - there were several persons in the room - I have known Chapman under the denomination of a horse-dealer - he kept his cattle at his father's at Bedminster, near Bristol - I cannot say where he lived in town - I did not ask what brought him there; his name is Derrick - I never knew him by the name of Chapman at Bristol - I never heard him called Chapman, to the best of my recollection - I have known him for the last four or five years, seeing him about, and have drank with him - I am not sure whether I told him what I came about - I asked him how he got on - he said pretty fair - I said you look the same as usual, and that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you had come to get a situation? A. I signified such to him - I had been at Marshfield - it is about eleven miles from Bristol - Bedminster is about one mile from Bristol - I am an accountant and collector of debts - I did not get a situation in town - I left, and came up again - the prisoner's father brought me from Bristol, to this trial - I was in London a week - I did not appoint to meet the prisoner again, and did not see him, except that day, Friday, the 5th - I have not seen him since - it was about two o'clock when I met him.</p>
               <p>JOHN BISHOP. I am a carrier - I have a horse and cart, and live in Pitfield-street, Hoxton - I know Chapman - I saw him on the 5th of October, at Mr. Harmer's, the Plough, at Smithfield, about three o'clock in the afternoon - he came with me to Smithfield, to buy a horse for me - we bought one of a person named Kimpton, of Highgate, for 4l. 10s. - the prisoner went to look out a good one for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is Kimpton? A. A horse-dealer - he gave his address at Highgate - the prisoner asked the price of it, and spoke to him about it a good deal - I suppose we were half an hour making the bargain - we had something to drink at Harmer's - nobody but the prisoner was in my company, nor was anybody in his company that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the last witness there? A. I did not see him - he might be about; the place was very much crowded; he might speak to him; he was not drinking with him while I was there - I went in about three o'clock- I had met the prisoner in Smithfield about half-past two o'clock, and remained with him till we went to Harmer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a carman? A. Yes; I move any goods - it does not make any odds to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had the misfortune to fall into trouble? A. Yes; I do not think I am obliged to say what.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not asked whether you were guilty or not, but what were you accused of? A. I do not think it is my place to say - I do not wish to tell; I was taken up twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell what you were taken up the second time for? A. I do not wish to resolve that question - it was sometime ago; it is about two months.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you certain that on the 5th of October, at half-past two o'clock, you met him in Smithfield? A. Yes; I cannot tell who he might have met before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to Harmer's with him? A. Yes, but I left the house first.</p>

            . I live in Wilson-place, Gray's Inn-lane. I was in the City-road on the 27th of January, and saw a man coming from the wharf, with two pieces of timber belonging to this gentleman; I do not know of any other timber-yard near there - I then saw the prisoner come up with these three pieces; I asked him where he got them - he said, "The foreman," pointing to the other man; I desired him to put the timber down, and sent him back with Greenaway, to see where he got them - they returned, and Greenaway said "It is all wrong;" the prisoner then said, "I will pay for it;" and he put his hand to his pocket to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say the foreman had paid for lit? A. No - he said "The foreman, - the foreman." I knew he was the foreman of Mr. Buxton, a baker, in Chapel-street, Islington; he did say the foreman would make it all right, and then offered to pay for it. I have heard that he is servant to Mr. Allerdine, another baker; he went back, and wished to have the foreman brought back, and when he found it was not paid for he offered to pay for it.</p>

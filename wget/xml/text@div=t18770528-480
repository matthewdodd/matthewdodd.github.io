(<hi rend="italic">An interpreter was here sworn</hi>.) I put the shilling between my teeth as he had been there five times, I sus<lb></lb>pected that it was bad—I told the prisoner that it was bad, and that that was the fifth time he had been in, and I should give him in custody—he tried to run away, but my husband stopped him—he struggled to get away, but was given in custody, and I went to the station and gave the shilling to a policeman—Mr. Saddington came over from the public-house opposite and said something, and with him I looked at the money in the basin and found four bad shillings, which I took to the station and told the prisoner that these were five pieces, he said that was the first occasion he had been in the shop.</p>

I keep the Eagle in Farringdon Road—on 2nd May, about 10.45 p.m., I went over to Mrs. Bauraud's shop—she was very excited and had a bad shilling in her hand—the prisoner was there—I said "Have you any more bad money?"—she said "I don't know," and emptied her basin into my hand, and I found four other bad shillings in the prisoner's presence—she said that he had been there five times and passed a shilling each time—I handed the four shillings to the constable and the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

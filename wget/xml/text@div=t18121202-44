               <p>Q. Did she give your daughter any notice of her going - A. No. When she was gone we missed a piece of beef out of the pickling pan, and some tobacco and a pair shoes of her mistresses. On the next morning I missed the linen out of a box in the room where she slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that box locked - A. Yes, and when I went to search, it was locked. I missed five pair of sheets, and five tablecloths. I value the sheets at six shillings a pair, and the tablecloths at six shillings each. My daughter missed nothing but a pair of shoes to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been in your daughter's service - A. Near five weeks, and I am sure the sheets and tablecloths were safe in the box when the prisoner came to her service. The box was in the room where the prisoner slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them in the box during the five weeks - A. No. I live with my daughter, to assist in the bar. They keep a public-house. The sheets and tablecloths belonged to me. I did not see the prisoner until Tuesday, the 24th of November. My daughter saw her in the street, and brought her into the house.</p>

I asked her, when she began to take them. She said, on the Friday before the 9th of November; the 6th of November that was when she first began to take them.

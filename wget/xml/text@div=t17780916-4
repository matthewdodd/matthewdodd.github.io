             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am journeyman to Mr. Zenogle. I was in the compting-house when the linens were taken away; they were taken off a pile of printed linens which I had laid not above an hour before near the door; they were taken away at about four in the afternoon; I heard somebody go from the door; as there was no one in the shop it raised my suspicion; I went to the door and saw a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160004"></xptr> person with some linens on his moulder turning the corner.</p>
               <p>Was that person the prisoner? - I believe it was; I cannot swear to him; I only saw his back; I missed the linen-immediately as I came to the door; as soon as I had called the maid to take care of the warehouse, I pursued the man but went a wrong way, so I was not present when he was taken; I saw him in custody of some gentlemen who were taking him to Guildhall. The person I saw with the linen had a dark grey coat on.</p>
               <p>Mr. DEPUTY JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 4th of August in the afternoon, as I was going to Guildhall, I saw the prisoner at the end of Basinghall-street in Fore-street, with some pieces of linen on his shoulder; I said to Mr. Wyat and Mr. Hall, who were in company, that I thought by the manner of his carrying the linen that he had stole it; Mr. Hall and I followed him; seeing himself observed, he stopped to make water; we went up to him and asked what he had got there; he said some lines which he was carrying to Mr. Jones's in Moor-lane. He had passed through Moor-lane. We met Mr. Jones, the beadle, by the way. When I found the prisoner's account so trifling I gave the constable charge of him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Upon the 4th of August, between sour and five, going along Fore-street with Mr. Jones and Mr. Wyatt, Mr. Jones said to me, Take notice of that man, I think he has stole that linen. We followed the man down Moor-lane. He was asked how he came by the pieces of linen, he said, he had them at a house in Coleman-street, and was to carry them to Moor-lane. We asked him to go back to the place where he had them from; he said, he could not do that for he had them of a man who gave him sixpence to carry them. Mr. Deputy Jones gave the beadle (who we had picked up by the way) charge of the prisoner. We took him to Guildhall, and while we were there a young man came in and said he was servant to Mr. Zenogle, and that they had lost the four pieces of printed linen.</p>

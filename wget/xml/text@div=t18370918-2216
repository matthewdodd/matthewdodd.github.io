                  </hi>. I am a milliner and dress-maker, and live in Salisbury-street, Strand—I have met the prisoner in the street before, and was acquainted with him. On the 7th of September I went to the corner of. Norfolk-street, and met the prisoner with a woman whom I knew previous to her being acquainted with him—we went to a house in the Strand—I do not know the sign—the prisoner wanted something to eat—I told him I had not money enough, and as I wanted 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I would go and pawn my watch—it was a gold watch—I pawned it for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went back, and paid for two glasses of brandy-and-water, which the prisoner and I had taken—then I had one half-crown and one shilling left—it was in my purse, I put the duplicate into my purse, and put it into my bosom—I went back to the public-house, and he asked what I was waiting for—I said for the omnibus—I was going to Chelsea—he said I had better take another glass—I said no I would not—I felt ill—he said, "It may be the heat of the room"—I said, "No," and went out, and he unfastened the cape of my dress, and my bonnet string, and took out my purse—I did not feel it taken—he said I had better take a glass of brandy—I said no, if he would get me</p>

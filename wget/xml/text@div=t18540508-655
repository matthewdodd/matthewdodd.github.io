                  </hi>. I keep the Alsop House public house, at the cor<lb></lb>ner of Upper Gloucester-street, New-road, in the parish of St. Marylebone. On Saturday night, 29th April, I was the last person up, the house was all fastened up—I went into all the rooms about twenty minutes or half past 12 o'clock, I saw them all perfectly safe—I went into the back drawing room—the window was shut—it was not fastened but closed—there was a flower stand in front of one window, and the windows were down—about 20 minutes past 4 o'clock, I was rung up by the policeman; I went in to the back drawing room, I found the window open, and three boxes of cigars, and a great coat of mine lying against the window on the floor—my coat had been, on the night before, on the back of a chair at the further side of the same room, and the boxes of cigars had been on the flower stand, against another window in that room—I came down and found the back door open which led into the yard—it had been opened from the inside—any one getting in by the draw<lb></lb>ing room window could come down and open that door—I went into the bar, and found one of the tills had been forced open, and the drawers had all been opened—we missed about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I think four or five shil<lb></lb>lings, three 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and two sixpences—we always leave the same amount in the till—after we came back from the station, I found three halfpence on the floor; the till had been locked, and the key taken up stairs—the draw<lb></lb>ing room window opens to a balcony over the back yard—any one could get to that balcony; if they came along a wall from a mews, they would have no difficulty in getting on—there are some wooden rails on the top of the wall—en active man no doubt could get over them, though they are rather high, and then walk along the wall—I lost some screws of tobacco which had been in a drawer in the bar—I missed all the cheroots there were—hey were rather curious, and were wrapped in a piece of paper in the bar parlour—I have seen them since—they were amongst those which were found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>lire is at the back of Mr. Ratcliffe's. I was coming out of my house on that Sunday morning at a quarter past 4 o'clock, to fetch some water—I saw the prisoner getting down from the rails at the back of the premises—I have since shown those rails to Mr. Ratcliffe—a person on those rails could get to Mr. Ratcliffe's balcony very easily by going along the wall that the rails are on—when the prisoner was coming down from the rails I spoke to him, and asked what business he had there—he asked me what business it was to me—he drew a few paces back, and he turned round and asked me if I was going back—I said no, I thought he was a thief, and I would not leave him—he put his hand in his breast and said, "I will give you something:" but he pulled nothing out—lie then went to Gloucester-street, and turned to the left; and when he got opposite Mr. Ratcliffe's, he pulled out a handkerchief and some cigars, and 1 saw him throw them down in the kennel opposite Mr. Ratcliffe's—he then ran sway—I ran after him—he ran to the second lamp post, about fifty yards, and there he threw away a crowbar and some more cigars—he still ran on to Dorset-square—I still ran, and kept calling, "Stop thief!" the policeman came across the square, and took him—I had never lost sight of him—I was within fifteen yards of him the whole time—we took him back to Gloucester-street; we found this instrument before we got there—I believe the words the prisoner used to me were, "I will pay you the first opportunity."</p>

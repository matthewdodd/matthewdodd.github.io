               <p>Q. When did this happen to you - A. On the 5th of March, about a quarter after twelve in the night. I was returning from my benefit society coming up <placeName id="t18120408-9-crimeloc48">Snow Hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18120408-9-crimeloc48" type="placeName" value="Snow Hill"></interp>

I was attacked by three men, two of them took hold of my collar, Skippey on the right hand side; I cannot say which of the three took the watch from me, they were all present at the time the watch was taken away, one of them stood before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they take your watch - A. They pulled it out of my pocket; I laid hold of the middle one by my right hand, I received a severe cut in my right hand, and one of my fingers bled very much for sometime, and then I had a violent blow on the knee, which brought me to the ground; I cannot say which of them struck me with the bludgeon on my knee, I have been lame about three weeks. They made their escape as soon as I called out stop thief, one towards Fleet-market, and two towards Holborn. A gentleman coming along at the end of Field-lane gave Skippey a blow and turned him into the hands of the patrols, and he was taken to the watchhouse by the patrols. The watch was picked up by the watchman and brought to the watchhouse. I am sure that Skippey is the same man that had hold of me by the collar; I was very lame, I called out stop thief very loud, one of the watchmen threw his stick at him, he was running without his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the watchhouse you was sure he was the same man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Were you quite sober at the time - A. Upon my oath I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before that night - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at your club - A. About nine o'clock. We had a shillingsworth of rum and water, and a pot of half and half between three of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in company with you - A.Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was only three men that stopped you - A. No, there were two women just by, whether they belonged to them I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you or have you not said there was a fight in the street at the time that you lost the watch - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You fell in consequence of the injury offered you - A. Yes, by the blow on the knee. I lost sight of the person that brought me to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it that you saw him at the watch-house - A. About three or four minutes; the blow was given me just after they got the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that you was collared - A. Yes, and after that I received a blow on the knee. The watch was brought in the watchhouse by one of the watchmen.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BROWN. I am one of the patrols of St. Andrew's, Holborn. On the night of the 4th of last month just going upon duty at twelve o'clock, I heard the cry of stop thief at the time of hearing the cry I was going along Shoe-lane, in consequence of hearing the cry of stop thief I returned into Holborn, I saw people running down Field-lane, I made the best of my way down the lane, the prisoner was coming towards Holborn, there was a gentleman behind him, called out stop thief; when the prisoner came towards me I took him, I put my hand upon his shoulder, and the point of my foot against his and tripped him up and brought him to the ground; I took him by the collar and took him to the watch-house. At the watchhouse he said, gentlemen, I have not got any property belonging to any person excepting my own; he took his watch out, he said, gentlemen, this is the only watch I have got, it is my own. The prosecutor was asked by the constable of the night whether he could identify the prisoner, at that moment he could not identify the prisoner. One of the watchmen understanding that a hat had been lost, returned to the spot where the prisoner fell, or was knocked down; the watchman returned and asked the prosecutor if he should know or give the description of his watch, he gave the description of the watch, and further stated that he had the maker's name and number in his pocket book; the description answered to the watch, and then immediately he recognised the prisoner. The prisoner was given in charge and conveyed to the poultry compter.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN. I am a watchman; I was just finishing my round, about a quarter past twelve on the 5th, and coming Holborn Hill, I heard a cry of stop thief, I ran down the hill in order to meet the person, and just as I came to the corner of Field-lane I saw a man running as fast as he could without a hat, I went four doors down Field-lane, I saw the young man down on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that young man - A. Henry Skippey. The patrol was just rising him up off the ground, I helped to assist to raise him up, we conveyed him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the man that you saw running without his hat - A. I believe he is the very same; after being taken to the watchhouse he was searched, he pulled out a watch, he said it was his own property, his father gave it him. They searched him, no property could be found, both the prosecutor and the prisoner lost their hats; I returned to the spot where the prisoner fell, to see whether I could see either of the hats, being late at night, and in looking for the hat I found the watch out of the case. I took the watch to the watchhouse, I asked if the gentleman had lost his watch, the prosecutor answered, I have lost my watch; he said it was a plain silver watch, a small steel chain, and a metal seal; the constable of the night looked at the watch, and saw the maker's name exactly as the prosecutor had stated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not the prosecutor seem as though he had had a good share of liquor - A. I do not think he was the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>- HOLT. I was patrol. On the 5th of March between twelve and one, 
               <persName id="t18120408-9-person138">Brown</persName>
             the patrol and I came out of the watchhouse; we were both talking at the end of Shoe-lane, Brown left me and went up Shoe-lane; we heard the cry of stop thief; I called him, he came back; we both ran across the way; we saw some man running on Snow Hill, he turned down Field-lane. We turned down Field-lane about three or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080011"></xptr> four doors down I saw the prisoner returning without his hat, he was returning back again from Field-lane into Holborn; Brown met him, whether he struck or pushed him I do not know; the prisoner fell, and immediately he fell Brown took him by the collar; I assisted to lift him up; he said he had done nothing. We asked him what he ran away for, he said he thought a press gang was after him. On going into the watchhouse with him he said he had lost his hat. When we got into the watchhouse the watchman went to look for the hat, and while he was gone two of the patrols brought the hat, which was found at the end of Fleet-market. The watchman on his return came into the watchhouse and asked what gentleman had lost his watch; he said he had lost his, it was a plain silver watch, a steel chain, and the maker's name so and so, which he had got in his pocket book. The watch was produced, and it answered the description that he gave.</p>
               <p>Chapman. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent of the charge that is alledged against me.</p>

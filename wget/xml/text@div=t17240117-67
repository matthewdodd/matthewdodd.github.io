That indeed he did not give him the Opportunity of taking out his Money. That having got his Hand at Liberty, he knock'd him down, and hurt him very much; but he got him secur'd, and some of his Accomplices cry'd, Knock him down, sour him. However he got him apprenhended, and when he had seen him secur'd in Bridewell, he was oblig'd to make off out of the Crowd, some of his Comrades, as he suppos'd, being bent upon doing him a Mischief. That a young Man who was with him, being taken by them for him, was wretchedly beaten and abus'd. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and call'd some to his Reputation, but having the Misfortune to have no Person there but a Woman, with whom, it was said, he liv'd, he therefore call'd one of the Officers in waiting in Court, who depos'd, That he did know him to be a noted Pickpocket, and a Villain. <rs id="t17240117-67-punish342" type="punishmentDescription">

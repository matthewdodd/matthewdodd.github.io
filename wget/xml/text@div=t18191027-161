            . On the 2d of October, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I left home with a gentleman, and went into <placeName id="t18191027-161-crimeloc868">White Conduit-fields</placeName>

As we were going towards them there was a fight in the field, which continued about twenty minutes - my friend parted with me. After that was over he came to me, and said he had lost his handkerchief. I felt my pocket, and said mine was safe; I felt farther, and missed my snuff-box - I found a hole cut in my waistcoat-pocket, and the box gone. Soon after that I heard they were taking up a great many pickpockets, went to the mob, and informed the officer - my snuff-box was produced; they took the prisoner to the Belvidere. It had a cut in it, which proves that it was cut from my pocket.</p>

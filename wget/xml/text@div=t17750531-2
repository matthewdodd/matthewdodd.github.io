            . I have known the prisoner several years, we have lived in great intimacy, and our families visited. On the 1st of November, 1774, he applied to me at my house in Charles Street, St. James's Square, to let him have a sum of money: the particular sum he did not then mention. But, I told him, I had at that time no more cash by me than for my own occasion, and therefore I could not accommodate him. Upon this, he said, there was something of very great importance, and if I could raise the money it would be a great advantage to him. I told him, I did not know any way of raising the money, as I had not cash in my banker's hands. Then the prisoner said let me have some of your Ayre Bank Bonds. I said, I did not think of parting with them; when you asked me to raise the money. But he said, if you will let me have them, I will give you a bond of Mr.

I told him, he should have the Ayre bonds upon that condition. I took out a roll from my bureau of these Ayre bonds to the number of about twenty one, and asked the prisoner how many he would have of them. After some little hesitation, he said, he would be obliged to me for fifteen: they were all of a hundred pounds each. I desired him to take down the numbers of the bonds, which he did upon this paper (producing it.) at the bottom is wrote thus - 1500, Ayre Bonds, bearing date the 29th of June, 1774, and payable to

The Ayre bonds were not replaced in the eight days, according to the promise, but I thought they might be a convenience to Mr. Perreau, and so I did not demand them of him till about the middle of December; when, as I intended to call for the interest due upon them, I thought it proper to give Mr. Perreau timely notice of it, and did so in the middle of December.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310023"></xptr> Upon giving him this notice; Mr. Perreau said, it was very well, and that I should have the bonds. But a few days afterwards he asked me, if I had no other reason to call for these bonds, but on account of the interest? I said, no, I really had not. Then, Mr. Perreau said, he would be much obliged to me, to let the bonds lie in his hands a little longer and he would pay me the interest due upon the bonds. I said, if it was any service to him he was welcome to keep them longer. Nothing else happened till I heard of the prisoner's being in custody. Then I went to Mr. Adair's with the bond, on Saturday: I believe, it was the 11th of March that I heard of this affair breaking out of the Perreaus: at first, I could not believe any such charge against them.</p>

Mrs. Rudd desired me, if my master wrote any letters that she might see the directions of those letters; she desired I might take them from the footman. The footman came up about a month before this affair broke out, and said Mr. Adair was below, and she said she would go to him.</p>

I did not go to bed till 1 o'clock; I was called up about 7 by a neighbour and told my door was open; I went down and found it so, and the goods mentioned in the indictment gone. I went to Mr. Fielding, and told his clerk how I had been robbed: a person came from him to me on the Saturday following. I went on the Monday; he ordered me to go to New-prison, and enquire for a person by the name of Simpson, who he said had confessed the robbery. I went there, I found the prisoner Watson; he there owned to me in what form they got into the house. He said,

            , he, and and another were in company, and they took the goods mentioned and carried them to the Mulberry Gardens and divided them: that he carried his part to a woman at Mile-end, he said her husband dealt in horses, and sold them to her; he said the watch was going 2 o'clock when they went into my house, and they had taken 2 lamps from 2 doors, and they had one of them a light in my house and left it burning, and he returned and put it out. I found it on my counter, out. (Produced in court) I got a warrant to search the womans house (at the bar) but found nothing belonging to me. The neighbours told me they had absconded a week before I came there; but I found when they heard Watson was cast last sessions, they came back again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present landlord of the Crown at Cricklewood—prior to February, 1869, I carried on business as a wine merchant—I had fallen into difficulties previous to that, and became bankrupt in 1869—I had known the prisoner previously to that, and had dealings with him—at the time of my bankruptcy I owed him about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he, with the rest, was discharged under my bankruptcy—they were money transactions for which I had been paying from 100 to 200 per cent.—to cover the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I owed him he held goods of mine to the amount of about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have never had back; so that I owed him nothing—in July, 1870, I was travelling for a wine merchant—I again became in want of money, and applied to the prisoner—he was then living in Morton Street, Pimlico—the name of "Mr. Cooper, auctioneer, St. Martin's Lane," was also up there in an inner office—the prisoner had a ticket up, "Money Advanced"—I had interviews with him in July, and he subsequently placed some documents before me to sign, and I signed them—they were read over to me—I had applied to him for an advance of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the documents were signed, Mr. Cooper's clerk was present; I believe his name was Harden; but they were not read over or explained in any way—at that time I believed I was going to receive 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through the means of the prisoner—I never received a farthing of that money—subsequently to that, by the aid of my friends and the brewers, I was enabled to take the Crown—I took it as it stood, with the furniture and things at a valuation—the prisoner never brought me the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or came to me during the rest of the year 1870—about May, 1871, he came to me, and in consequence of what he said, I was induced to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I hold a bill of sale over your head, give me some money"—he wanted about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then—I refused at first to give him any; I told him that I did not owe him a sixpence—he said he should not leave without he had some money, if I did not give him any, he had got some vans, and he should take my goods away—I said I should not give him any, but after some time, having heard what a desperate character he was, having served other people in the same way, taking their goods put of their houses, I was induced to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would damage my credit with everybody—I asserted more than once that I had never received a shilling from him—I did not see the vans at the time, they were left round the corner—I had a policeman on the premises at the time, in con<lb></lb>sequence of what I had heard—the prisoner was content with the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and went away—previously to that I had seen a man named Tanner in the prisoner's company—the prisoner introduced him to me as Sergeant Tanner—I had heard of Sergeant Tanner, and I believed him to be the man—the prisoner said he was the great Sergeant Tanner who had brought Muller over to this country—I don't think Tanner was with him at the time I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am not certain—on 18th July I was away from home—my wife was ill at the time—when I left home in the morning, I left my fur<lb></lb>niture and everything safe; when I returned in the afternoon I found all the upper rooms stripped, my wife's dressing-case broken open, and jewellery and money taken away, some spirits and cigars, and goods, altogether to the amount of between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were taken away—I made inquiries of my wife as to who had been there—some of her underclothing and some of the</p>

               <p>children's clothes had been taken away—in consequence of what I heard from my wife, I went in search of my property, and found it at the prisoner's residence, Morton Street, Pimlico—a good deal of it was damaged and broken—the prisoner was not there—I went with the police and found him a few streets off—next day, by order of the Magistrate, I took what I could of my furniture back to Cricklewood—what was damaged and what was missing would amount to about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also a gold chain of the value of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never got back the spirits or cigars, or the jewellery—even my razors were taken away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> When I came to you in Morton Street, in July, 1870, I did not bring my brother with me—I did not come several times before you consented to do anything with me, only once or twice—I believe my brother did once take a message that I wished to see you—I believe I did not ask you to ask Mr. Phillips to lend me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never went to his house—that was three or four months before you introduced Tanner—there was no business between us at the time I saw Tanner—Tanner came down to my house afterwards, with a note demanding money—when I first came to you in Morton Street you did not say "I shall not do any business with you unless you give me some satisfaction for the amount due to me, and which I consider you have defrauded me out of"—you said nothing about what you were out of pocket by my fraudulent conduct—I had known you about three years at that time—Mr. Schofield introduced me to you—he is an agent and value in Clerkenwell, an intimate friend of mine—I saw in your shop some announcements of sales, by Mr. Cooper, auctioneer, St. Martin's Lane—I saw none of Schofield's—I believe it is a usual thing for house agents to have auctioneer's bills—I had had three or four previous transactions with you, always on bills of sale—you took a bill of sale on my furniture, jewellery, and general effects—you charged exorbitant interest, and threatened that you would take my things away if the money was not paid, and if I did not pay more interest—I did not tell you that I wanted this money for a large wine order, I told you it was to pay a former bill of sale that I owed, and you agreed to get me the money to pay that off—I forget the amount of the first transaction; there were three or four, for something between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never joined security with my brother, I remember wanting some money to get my brother out of trouble—I am not aware that he went through the Court—he was security with me for the money—that was settled, and everything paid—I had a transaction with you on 30th June, 1868—I did not come to you fraudulently or deceptively—I had not at that time assigned the whole of my property to Mr. Bennett, of Clapham Road Place—he was trustee for the benefit of my creditors; I forget the amount I failed for—everything was bought back, and I went on business again—on 21st February following I assigned the whole of my stock in trade, household furniture and goods, to Mr. B. B. Smith, for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on a bill of sale—that was borrowed capital to go on in business again—I am not certain what I owed you in July, 1868; about that date I owed you 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before my bankruptcy I paid you everything I owed you except 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and for that you had a cart, a phaeton, a ring and bracelet, worth 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as security—in November, 1868, you took possession of some of my goods—I never took you to my solicitor—just before my bankruptcy I gave you a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that left a balance of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know that the goods you seized realized 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never heard what they realized—I don't know that Mr. Schofield sold</p>

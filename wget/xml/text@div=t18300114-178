               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.You say it had got out? A. Yes, into the yard - Dallos lives two or three miles from my house; I lost it on Sunday, and found it on Tuesday - I think this is the fowl; he carries his tail on one side - you will not see one in a thousand do so; it is what is called Watney-street breed.</p>

            . I am a pigeon-fancier, and live in Brick-lane - the prosecutrix came and asked if I had a Malay cock to sell; I showed her this one - she told me to catch it, which I did, and put it into her possession; she said, "Oh, my dear, I have got you once more;" I had bought it of a young man, but not the prisoner - I never saw him till he was at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did not you say, upon your oath. that the prisoner came on Sunday morning with the fowl? A. I did not say "the prisoner;" the person who brought it asked 2s. 6d. for it - I gave him 1s. 6d.; something was read over to me, but I do not know what - I did sign something; this is my hand-writing.

I am a bookseller, of 518, Oxford Street—on the night of 27th February, about 7.30, I saw the prisoner at my shop window—I have seen him there several times before—I crossed the road, hid myself in a doorway, and watched his proceedings for twenty minutes or half an hour—I saw him look at this book particularly, and put it down again—he went from one end of the window to the other, and then put it under his coat—there is a case of books outside, and he leaned over them, and put it in his pocket, I suppose—it is "Scripture Illustrations," value 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he came out of the shop, and I crossed the road, and collared him about six doors off, and my daughter came up and collared him at the same moment—I said "I have got you at last"—he said "Let me go back to the shop—I gave him in custody—while I was feeling his coat skirts for the book, it fell at the policeman's feet.</p>

I am a daughter of the last witness—I was in his shop on February 27th, about 7.30, and saw the prisoner outside the window, walking up and down outside the shop—he watched me several times, and took the book down, and put it under the skirt of his coat—he afterwards came into the shop, and asked to look at a "Byron," which I showed him, and told him the price was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said that it was rather more than he thought; he thought it would be 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said that if he was passing again, perhaps I might have one to suit him, and he walked on—I knew he had got it under his coat, and went after him, and caught him just as my father came up on the other side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, at 15, George Street—I have known the prisoner about nine or ten years—he is the son of a gentleman in Hamburgh, a respectable man—I am not acquainted with his family—my son knows more concerning him than myself—I know nothing about his brother but what my son has told me—I have known the prisoner up to the time he was given in custody—some time ago he came to me, and said that the object of his visit was to see if I could obtain the aid of a capitalist here, to unite with some parties in Hamburgh, to build a number of steamers to ply between Hamburgh and America, and he thought</p>

               <p>Mr. Chadwick would be a very likely person—Mr. Chadwick is a M.P.; his offices are in Moorgate Street, and he is well known—he inquired if I had any objection to accompany him to Mr. Chadwick—we had an interview, but his statements were so much at random that Mr. Chadwick looked at him, and then at me, and recommended him to walk outside while he con<lb></lb>ferred with me—he thought the prisoner was drunk, but he was not—the prisoner told him about this fleet of vessels, and Mr. Chadwick asked him some questions, which he answered; and he said that there was a port on the other side of the water, which he was not at liberty to name, because the water was not deep enough to receive them—he afterwards told me, in my office, that he was not at liberty to name the port, because the water was not deep enough; but it would astonish the world when they knew: that there would be a great revolution, and there would be a new heavens and a new earth, and the things mentioned in Isaiah would take place, and a great tidal wave would come and scour out this harbour, and then there would be plenty of room and plenty of water—he talked at random to Mr. Chadwick—this was about five months ago—about two months ago I went to pay him a visit at his lodgings, and he inquired which way I had come—I told him along the Strand, through Temple Bar and Fleet Street—he said "Did you look at the top of Temple Bar?"—I said "Not particularly"—he said "Did you look at the new timepiece?"—I said "What time-piece?"—he said "To indicate when the new globe is to appear"—I said "Don't talk nonsense"—he said "You have not faith; you have not spiritual discernment; you cannot comprehend it; how is it likely, when you are not born of the Spirit?"—I said "Don't talk nonsense"—he said "It is not nonsense. Did you not see that shop at the corner of Iron-monger Lane, where there is the first movement?"—I then began, not only to imagine, but to be satisfied that his mind was affected—he spoke about the French war, and about Paris being this and the other, as mentioned in the Bible, and Bismarck being <hi rend="italic">rose</hi> up by Providence to accomplish a certain work—I think he told my son what Bismarck was—he said that he had been to hear the Rev. Dr. Parker, of the Poultry Chapel, and liked him very much, and had seen him, and told him what he thought of a certain passage in the Bible—I saw him from time to time till he was im<lb></lb>prisoned—I have always been under the impression that he was not in his right mind since he introduced the steam packets to my notice; and what convinced me of it was, that he attempted to take some offices on a large scale, and referred to me—I saw at once that he was wandering—he had not the means of taking an establishment like that, and I wrote to the party and said that I could not be responsible for anything that he did—I inquired what kind of engines he proposed to put into the steamers—he said "That I shall not be able to communicate to you; but it is a new motive power which has been communicated to me by the Spirit; I shall want you to be the engineer; it is neither steam nor electricity; I have got all the plans before me."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What has struck me as peculiar in the last two months is, that he had a very curious expression of face and staring of the eyes—he had called at my office, and attempted to occupy people with such topics as great revolutions which would astonish mankind—that might be the opinion of many—I may say, for your information, that his manner at the times of those visits was so entirely different to when I have seen him in London and in Hamburgh, when I have been over there, that I was con<lb></lb>vinced</p>

               <p>that his mind was wrong—I saw him last a few days before he was taken in custody; if persons were there he would chat to them, and on one occasion he began to sing—I communicated with Mr. Foster, but did not mention it to his father—my son wrote to his brother-in-law—I never com<lb></lb>municated with his friends, and suggested that he should be looked after, but my son did—he professed to be an agent for Mr. Foster, and had an impor<lb></lb>tant situation in Hamburgh, but he only paid this country periodical visits—I have known him both in London and Hamburgh; occasional visits in Hamburgh, and coming over to London in connection with business under<lb></lb>takings.</p>

I am the son of the last witness—I have known the prisoner eight or ten years—I know his family, in Hamburgh, and have met his brother—I know, from his brother-in-law, that the prisoner's brother is a lunatic—I met the prisoner at Gatty's, in January last; he said that as I had just come over from Germany, he supposed I had seen Bismarck, and people who had figured in the late war; that there was no doubt about it, he had studied Revelations, and Paris was the great whore, and Bismarck was the great beast; that he had had a vision, and seen a great hole dug in the Strand, at the wide part near Somerset House, and the famished poor of London thrown in—he has not spoken to me about steam packets—I have only had one conversation with him since I have been back, but I have seen him, before, <hi rend="italic">carry on</hi> in a most eccentric manner.</p>

I am an iron-master, at Walsall—I built the ironwork of New Blackfriars Bridge—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years, and up to last June, when I was in Berlin, where I met him in most re<lb></lb>spectable society—I did not hear anything of him till my return from the Continent, last Christmas, when I received a letter asking me for money to go to Hamburgh, enclosing a strip of paper on which he signed himself "Carl B. Ellison, son of my mother, a name adopted on account of my spiritual inheritance"—I showed that letter to a gentleman, who said that he believed him to be quite mad—I sent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay his expenses; he was always able to get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from me, I knew him so well—he said that Mr. Britton had mentioned his religious views; that Paris was the great whore sitting on seven mountains, and I was quite sure that he was quite off his mind—I saw him before he was given in custody—he was always the same as to religious subjects, but I could not detect anything else, except that he was wild.</p>

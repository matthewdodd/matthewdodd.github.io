I am employed by the Mint—on 18th January, be<lb></lb>tween seven and eight, I went to 17, Turk Street, Bethnal Green, with Inspector Bryant, Broad, Fife, and other officers—the street door was open, and the parlour door inside was ajar—the female prisoner was standing inside the doorway—I went in and saw the male prisoner sitting on the bed, undressed—I said, "My name is Brannan; I have received instructions to look after you; I have come to search for coining implements and coun<lb></lb>terfeit coin"—they made no reply—on a table I found some pieces of white metal, a piece of glass with a little plasters and grease adhering to it, three bands for making moulds with plaster adhering to them, a file with white metal in its teeth, and a pipe with a small quantity of fused metal in it, some pieces of copper wire, a small brush, a saucer with composition in it, and two or three pieces of copper wire, some of which have been dipped in solu<lb></lb>tion—Inspector Bryant produced the small box, open, from under the table—it contained two moulds for making shillings, and one for sixpences, eight bad shillings, and twenty-seven bad sixpences—in a little purse in the female prisoner's dress-pocket was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, one of the coins corre<lb></lb>sponded with three of those found in the box by Bryant—Bryant said that the cupboard under the stairs and the back shed were locked—I asked for the keys—the female prisoner said, "It's no use to deny this," and went to the cupboard and brought two keys, which I handed to Bryant, who went out and returned with twenty-nine skeleton keys, about the most complete set I ever saw; also a piece of wax to take impressions of keys, and every article necessary for coining—I said, "Anything you state I shall have to name hereafter, therefore you are at liberty to say what you like"—the woman said, "I know who sent you here, and so help me God they shall suffer."</p>

            . The woman at the bar took me out of the street into her house to live with her, and I lived with her about four months; she kept a bawdy-house in Eagle-court in the Strand. It was agreed between us, for me to give her all that I got, and she was to give me victuals and drink, lodging, and cloaths: she used to ask me, when any gentleman had been with me, for what they gave me, and I used to give it her all; she never allowed me any thing; there were other young women in the house, they used to do the same. There was a gentleman in company with me there, he asked upon what terms I was there; I told him; he gave me an 18 s. piece and half a guinea, to clothe myself and get out of that house. This was about four days before the first of June; I was taken up upon the first of June as a disorderly person, and put into <placeName id="t17660702-12-crimeloc66">Tothill-fields, Bridewell</placeName>

I was forced to call out for assistance; there were other people present that saw her take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose cloaths had you got on?</p>
               <p>Caton. I had her cloaths on.</p>

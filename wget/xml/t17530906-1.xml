            . About 11 at night, as I was going home by the watch-house in Leadenhall-street, I heard somebody behind me say, You dog, what do you want to follow that gentleman; you mean no good. I turn'd about, and saw

We were then a little from the place where Mr. Grant had first hold on him against the wall, to which place we went, and there lay my handkerchief on the ground where he stood, (produc'd in court and depos'd to) so we took him before Sir

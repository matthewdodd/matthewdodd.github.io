               <p>Had you any suspicion of him? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>You had kept a pretty sharp eye on him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What then, did you mean to give him an opportunity of rifling the shop? - Yes; I had a suspicion of his taking some things: I did not particularly watch him: I went to the side of the counter, to fetch some things, and left the things with him.</p>
               <p>Did not you keep your eye upon him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. There was one question asked you by the Court, to which you did not give an answer; it is a very important one; upon your oath did you not retire from the place where he was, on purpose that he might have an opportunity of taking something? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You said you went for the constable, Shallard; he is an officer, at Bow-street; where did you find him? - At the publick-house, opposite my brother's shop.</p>

               <p>So when this young man came in, and was looking at this shew-glass, it was before you invited him to look at the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240031"></xptr>articles; you left him there on purpose that he might have an opportunity to steal something; and you went to fetch an officer on purpose that you might have an opportunity to take him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner: I was appointed to be there for the purpose, on suspicion that he was coming to rob the shop; I was in waiting just by: I searched him, and found a pair of gloves and a handkerchief, which I put on the table, and Ting shook one of the gloves, and out fell a bracelet; then he shook it again, and out fell another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Had you been consulted as to the manner in which this was to be done; have you explained to anybody what would make this a capital offence? - Oh, no, by no means.</p>

               <p>I am an officer. I was with Shallard at the publick-house, in waiting, about half an hour; then he sent for us, and we went into the back parlour; there was the prisoner and Mr. Lynam; and in his glove I shook out two bracelets, one in one finger, and the other in the other.</p>
               <p>(The bracelets deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Lynam. Do not you know that your brother appointed the prisoner to come that afternoon? - I sent to the constable about four o'clock: the prisoner came in about eight: the prisoner was there the day before; he said he should be there the night following: my brother did not send for him; he told my brother he should come the next afternoon.</p>
               <p>Your brother invited him to come? - No, I do not believe he did.</p>
               <p>What are these bracelets worth? - About twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>How much of that is for fashion and workmanship? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>They are very grim things; nobody would wear them now? - They are not very fashionable.</p>
               <p>What is the gold worth; is it worth five shillings? - No.</p>
               <p>They are out of fashion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What would they sell for? - I do not think they would fetch five shillings.</p>
               <p>If you was to buy them, you would buy them as old gold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have a great many respectable witnesses, but I think it better not to call them; I shall not expose the young man any more.</p>

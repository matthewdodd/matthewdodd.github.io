I am usher at the Court of Bankruptcy—I pro-duce the original proceedings in the bankruptcy of Robert Wilson Brookes—the petition for adjudication was made by Messrs. J. and R. Morley, of Wood Street, on 16th Aprils—there is also a certified copy of the bankrupt's estate, signed by him, and also a copy of the declaration of insolvency by him—the first meeting of creditors was held on 3rd If ay, at which Mr. Bailey, of Wood Street, warehouseman, was chosen assignee, and Mr. Baggs, of King Street, appointed manager of the estate—on 10th May, a private meeting was held; on the 16th another meeting was held for the examination of the bankrupt—here is his examination, signed by him—on 4th June, he filed his statement of affairs, and on the 15th he applied to pass his last examination—that meeting was adjourned till 13th August—there is an order on the proceedings that the bankrupt should file in account of the debts and items of his dealings with Messrs. Wolff and Farish and Mr. Johnson—he was also directed to give the address of Mr. Johnson and specify from whom various goods had been received, and particular of the bills and invoices—he has not filed such amended account—he applied again on 13th August to pass his last examination, but as the accounts were not produced, the meeting was adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die,</hi> with, liberty for him to apply again.</p>

I am manager of the Greyhound Tavern, Bermondsey—on the afternoon of 14th September, two women came there and had a pint of sixpenny ale, which was 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they tried to pass a bad shilling—I threw it on the counter and said, "Give me a better one than this; this won't do for me"—Breech, who was there, bent it, and then put a good shilling on it and bent it straight again, and then gave it back to the woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Harding-terrace, Camberwell New-road, and am a journeyman butcher—on the afternoon of 14th September, I was at the Greyhound—two women came in—I saw one of them give a counterfeit shil<lb></lb>ling to the last witness—he bent it and said, "Cannot you give me a better one than this? this won't do for me"—he put it on the counter—I took it up, straightened it with a good one that the woman then put down, and then marked it with my teeth—the woman who had given it took it away—the two women went away together—I followed them—I had to go about 150 yards through a passage, and I saw the prisoner and the two women in com<lb></lb>pany—I watched them, and as soon as the women caught sight of me they all turned their backs to me and huddled up together in a lump—I could only see what was done, by the working of their arms behind them—the women then left the prisoner and passed me—the prisoner went the other</p>

               <p>way—I followed him about 70 or 80 yards; I was about 10 yards from him—he stooped down, and I ran after him and saw him pull out his hand from some fence—that was the same side of the road that we were walking—there was only a piece of high grass on the other side of the fence where he put his hand—as soon as he pulled his hand out I put my hand in and found there a paper package, which I opened—it contained four counterfeit shil<lb></lb>lings—one of them was the one which I had marked at the Greyhound, and which one of the women took away—I am sure of it—I then followed the man—as soon as he saw that I was following him, he turned and came back again towards me and passed me—I turned again and walked behind him—I said, "It is no use, old fellow; I shall stick to you"—he made use of a bad expression, and said that if I followed him any more he would knock my head in—I said, "Well, if you do, I suppose I shall be there"—he went into a brick-field and hid himself under a lot of leaves—I sent for a con<lb></lb>stable, one came up, and I gave the prisoner into his custody—I gave the constable the four shillings which I had found in the paper.</p>

On the 18th of September, I was paid my wages at the Plough, at Blackwall. I received 14l. 7s.; it was about two o'clock in the afternoon. About twelve o'clock the same night, I was passing by St. James's Church, near Old-street, St. Luke's - I was perfectly sober - I had been to Drury-lane Theatre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190039"></xptr>with some of my shipmates; I had not taken any lodging; I came from the play between nine and ten o'clock; I fell in with two women in the street, who asked me to treat them. I went to a public-house with them; the prisoner,

I do not know where the public-house was; I stopped with them nearly an hour, and treated them with supper; we came out of the public-house together, and then took a coach. I told the coachman to drive to Whitechapel; both of the women got into the coach with me; it drove to Old-street, near the Lying-in-Hospital. We went to a room where they told me that they lived; I was perfectly sober at the time, and am quite sure that I had 7l. 12s. 6d. about me at the time. I bought some clothes before I went to the play. I went to their room, as the room of two women of the town; it was in <placeName id="t18170219-70-crimeloc394">James-court</placeName>

When Eleanor Hiett returned, they both stopped with me. I took off my clothes, and went to bed. After I had got into bed, the other woman said she was ill, and left me; she did not return again. After she was gone, two men came up stairs; there was only one bed in the room. The prisoner, Eleanor Hiett, put out the candle - They came in after she put it out-she left the room as soon as they came in. When I got into bed my money was in my fob-my notes were there. The men came in immediately as she put out the light, before she left the room. She had no opportunity of taking my money before the men came in. I took my trowsers, and put them under my arm, and went to the door, meaning to go out, but they stopped me. The room-door was open. One of them opened a knife; there was a light that came through the window; I could see what passed in the room perfectly well; it was a bright light. I could not see any light in the passage. One of the men caught me by the collar, and the other seized my clothes from under my arm, and took my money out; the other man was holding me by my shirt-collar. The man who took my trowsers, took seven 1l. notes out. I saw him take them, and give them to the other man; they counted them in the room, at the window, before my face. He said,"there is only seven," and came back to me, and asked me if I had any more. He had the knife open in his hand. I was frightened at two men, and one with a drawn knife. I said, I believed that I had no more. He shook my under-waistcoat pocket, and said, "You lie; there is more money here." There was 11s. 6d. there - He took that also. They went down stairs, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they came to you and took the money, did they say any thing to you - A. He gave me no reason for taking it; he said, I should not lose it. When he counted the money, he said, "Do not be afraid, mate, you shall not lose it." He said nothing about the women. He did not accuse me of getting into company with his wife. The man who took the notes is not here. The prisoner,

I dressed myself, and as soon as I got my clothes on, I came down - They did not leave the room until I had dressed myself; they ran down first, and I followed them. They ran into James-street - I lost them. James-court comes into James-street. I went to a light, and called out, Stop thief as soon as I got down. I am quite sure that there was light enough for me to see that the prisoner, John Hiett, is the man who had the knife in his hand. I went into a house about three doors further, where I saw a light, at the opposite side of the court, and told a woman; she dressed herself, and we went to the watch-house and gave information. After this, I went back with her, and laid down by her fire-place; she went to bed with her husband. About nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner,

I heard him say that he had made a fine haul last night, and that he had shared the notes between himself and his partner; he then went out to fetch half a pint of gin-the woman was not in the house at the time - He was talking to her husband; when he came back to the door, he saw me, and ran away. I had been to the officer-he took him in my presence. I am quite sure he is the man. He was searched in a baker's shop. I saw two 1l. notes taken from him. I should not know my notes again; - They were 1l. notes that I lost. While he was in the shop, the prisoner,

               <p>Arthur Ginn. On the 17th of March, between 4 and 5 in the Evening, the Post Man brought me a Letter from the General Post-Office, with the Town Mark upon it, I paid Three pence for it, and then open'd it, and found the Contents of it were to demand 10 l. to be laid at such a Place, by Six o'Clock that same Evening. This was the Letter.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Ginn, in <placeName id="t17380518-35-crimeloc168">Noble Street</placeName>

               <p>This with Care.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ginn,</p>
               <p>"We are 10 in a Gang, and desire you'll lay 10 l. in the Corner of the Old House at Brick-Lane<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180020"></xptr> End, the 17 of this Month, by Six o'Clock in the Evening, or else we will set Fire to your House and burn you alive in your Beds. The Money you shall have again in a Month.</p>
               <p> I am your Humble Servant,</p>
               <p>B. R."</p>
               <p>Mr. Camm. On the 17th of March, Mr. Ginn shewed me this Letter about five o'Clock; at six, out of my own Curiosity, I walked to the Old House, and as I went thither, I met a Friend, who went with me; when I came to the Place, I found the Prisoner leaning against the Wall of the Old House, and reading in a Book; I came back and told Mr. Ginn that I believed the Man was waiting for the Money. Then we sent another Man to see if the Person was still waiting at the same Place; he returned and told he was yet waiting there. Upon this Mr. Ginn and I went to him, and asked him to go and drink with us; he consented, and we went to the Cock in Old-street, where we charged him with Writing the Letter, and he denied it. I have nothing further to say, but only that I found him kicking the Brickbats about, as if he look'd for something. I know the Prisoner, he liv'd a little Time ago (next Door to me) with Mr. Lawrence, a Tobacconist.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ginn. The Prisoner liv'd lately at Chelsea, and his Master and some Gentlemen from thence, were to come to speak in his Behalf. <rs id="t17380518-35-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

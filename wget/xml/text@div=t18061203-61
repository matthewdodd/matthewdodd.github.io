On Monday the 1st of December, I missed a mahogany board, I had seen it on the Thursday before; from information I went to Mr. Hutchinson, the Carpenter's Arms, Kingsland Road, about seven o'clock on Monday; there I saw the prisoner, in possession of a mahogany board which was my property; the prisoner had worked for me occasionally six or eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he worked for you on the Monday you lost the board. - A. I saw him in the yard about nine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030052"></xptr> o'clock in the morning, I thought he was going to work.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner with this board of mahogany, what did you say to him. - A. I asked him how he came by it, he was very much intoxicated, he could hardly answer, he said several times that he had taken it out to sell; being so intoxicated I left him that night, and ordered the board to be detained; the next morning I had him apprehended.</p>

            . I am a bird cage maker. Last Monday night about seven o'clock, the prisoner brought me this board, and offered it me to sell, I refused purchasing it of him; I had some suspicion that he had stole it, and soon after his master came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went to that public house I set the board down on the outside of the house, they told me to bring it in for fear it should be lost; I brought it in, and they joked with me, they said they would give me four shillings for it. I said do you think it is a bit of deal.</p>

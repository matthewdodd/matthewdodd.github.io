                  </hi>. I am a cloth-dresser, and live at Leeds, but came to town, and lodged at No. 3, Duke-street, Aldgate. On Friday, the 13th of March, I saw the prisoner in Duke-street—he desired to see some cloth—I showed him a bundle—he requested me to let him take it out to show some parties, and he could sell it—I said, being a stranger, I could not allow it; if he sold it, be must pay for it, or bring the party he sold it to to pay for it, before he took it away—he said he was in the habit of selling cloth at Mr. Adcock's—I said I was going there—I took it there with him, and delivered it to Mrs. Adcock—I told her the prisoner was a stranger to me, and she must have the money before she parted with it—I came away, and saw the prisoner on the road, in Whitecross-street—I went back to Duke-street, and afterwards heard it was gone—I never gave the prisoner leave to fetch it from there—I told him I could not part with it without the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Adcock, and live in Golden-lane, Barbican. Wade is an acquaintance of ours—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner about six months—he and Wade came to me on Friday, the 13th of March, with a piece of cloth—Wade said, "Mr. Coltman is going to bring a person to show this cloth to"—I said, "Very well; it is not to go from my place"—he said, "No"—I said, "Mr. Adcock is not at home; he cannot be accountable for the cloth"—the prisoner went to the door—Wade went after him, and they went away together—Wade returned again, and safe, "You must not let the cloth go"—I said, "Take it off the counter, and lay it on the shelf"—he did so—the prisoner returned in about five minutes, came up the shop, and said "Well, Mrs. Adcock, I must take this piece of cloth"—I said, "No, you must not; Mr. Wade, said you must bring the parties to look at it"—he said, "No, I can't bring them; Wade says I may take it; it is' all right, if it was twenty pieces'—I said, "I can't give you leave to take it"—he went out of the shop with it, saying, "I will return the cloth or money in an hour's time"—I did not give it to him, he took it off the shelf, and took it away—he did not come back that day—he came next day about half-past twelve, o'clock—I said, "You have got me into, a fine deal of trouble"—he said, "What is that?"—I said, "About the cloth; I hope you will go and fetch the cloth or the money immediately"—he said, "I will," but he never came back.</p>

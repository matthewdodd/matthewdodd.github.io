I am a boot and shoemaker, living at 17, Nelson-street, Greenwich—On Friday, 13th May, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came into my shop—Karppeamin asked for the best boots I had for the other prisoner—I endeavoured to fit the other one, but could not succeed—I had taken them into the shoe room—there were a number of boots lying on the floor—I was engaged in fitting for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I had to go to a glass case in the same room to get boots, and while there my back was turned to them—I could not succeed in fitting Taossin, and they both left the shop—the same afternoon, about two hours afterwards, a policeman came to me and brought four pairs of boots; they were my property—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to them—they are the same sort of boots as those they were trying on.</p>

I am a servant to Mr. George Triggs, of London-street, Greenwich—on Friday, 13th May, a little after 3, I was in the passage of my master's house, which affords a view of his shop—I saw the two prisoners there, and the shopman, Watson, was fitting a pair of boots on Taossin—whilst he was so engaged the other prisoner was standing at the back of him, and I saw her take a pair of boots off the side of a desk, close to where she was standing—she then lifted up her cloak and put them underneath—I went upstairs and told my mistress, and in consequence of what she said I told the shopman what I had seen—he then desired the prisoners to go into the back parlour—I did not see my mistress come into the parlour—I saw Karppeamin standing at the bottom of the counter afterwards, at the time when Watson came into the shop, and then I saw Watson pick up four pairs of boots from the place where she had been standing—I bad seen that spot a short time before, but there were no boots there at that time—Watson picked the boots from the floor at the end of the counter.</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Triggs—in consequence of what was told me, I went into the back parlour, on the afternoon of 13th May—the prisoners came in after I was there—Karppeamin was very much agitated, and very pale—she had a cloak on—I lifted up her cloak and jacket, but could not find anything, and she said she was innocent, so I did not search her much—I saw her leave the parlour—the moment Watson's back was turned, she went into the shop, close to the counter—she remained there about a minute or so, and she said that her husband would give 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if we did not fetch a policeman—not a word had been said about fetching a police<lb></lb>man before she offered this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think Watson was going towards the door at the time—when she was at the counter, she had one hand on the counter, and the other down under her cloak—she left the counter, came to me, and asked me to search her again—at that moment the shopman came in, and I saw him pick up four pairs of boots from the place where she had been standing.</p>

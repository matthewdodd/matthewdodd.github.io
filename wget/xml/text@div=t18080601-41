               <p>Q. Who gave you the blow - A. The prisoner at the bar; I saw the stick coming to my throat, which made me scringe from it; he was behind me when he struck me; he thrust the stick forwards.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that you coversed with him did you take such notice of his person - could you swear to his countenance from what you saw of him before he was apprehended - A. Yes; I told the watchman what kind of a man he was, and what kind of a stick it was, before I saw him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he cross to the other side of the way - A. I do not know which way he run; he ran up the Haymarket, I called stop thief; the watch took him; I thought he would run to Whitcomb street when I found I was robbed so, I run to the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you for a while you lost sight of him - A. Yes, for a while, till I saw him in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How long after you was robbed - A. About four or five minutes; he asked me what sort of a man he was that robbed me; I described the man to him; he said we have got a man in St. James's watchhouse, we have no charge against him.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the morning do you think it was - A. Nigh two o'clock, I heard him cry stop him, he has run away with my watch; I saw a man run across the Haymarket towards St. James' street; I ran to stop him, he turned the post and ran into Oxendon street, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010036"></xptr>ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him - A. Never; he crossed Panton street and came into the Haymarket again; here I took him. I took him to St. James' watch-houses because I caught him in St. Jame's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overtake him - A. Yes, and took him to the watchhouse; I had another watchman with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Another watchman came up in the way, he was running - A. Yes, and he was stopped between us both.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out - A. Yes, I called out stop thief, and another watchman coming up a contrary way, the prisoner stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took the prisoner did you see him do any thing - A. No, he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your companion seized him as well as yourself - A. Yes, he took hold of his arm, and I took him to St. James' watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him - A. Yes, in the watchhouse; I found nothing upon him he; had the stick with him; we took it from him when we took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the watch did not you - A. Yes; I went out to look for the prosecutor, I brought him into the watchhouse; he swore to the man and the stick; I went and searched the track in which I had followed him, as the man said he had been robbed of a watch; I thought he might have throwed it away; in Oxendon-street I found the watch upon the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it was in the track that you and the prisoner ran. - A. Yes, I am sure of that; I noticed the track, I made several blows at him to try to knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried the watch to the watchhouse did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew it to the prosecutor - A. I did; the prosecutor swore it was his watch; he said his own name was in the watch; this is the watch, I have had in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive whether the prosecutor was in liquor - A. He had been drinking for certain, but he was more in a passion with the man, than he was affected by drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you to be a man that was so drunk that he did not know what he was about - A. Far from that; he was capable of any business whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. You should have thought that he was capable of any thing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Andrews. You searched the prisoner at the watchhouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing upon him - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Look at that watch and seal - A. That is my watch it has my name upon it; I am confident of it being my watch; I had it in my pocket before I felt the blow, and I felt it go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the Haymarket towards St. James' street; the prosecutor ran away from me, the watchman attempted to stop me, and I was taken to the watchhouse; the prosecutor came in the watchhouse soon after I was taken in, he said I had robbed him of his watch; I denied the charge; a watchman came in soon after and said he had found the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and reside at Bridge House, Kingston-on-Thames—in consequence of seeing a newspaper advertisement I went to Dean Street, Soho, and saw the prisoner Wicks—I told him I called in reference to the advertisement—he made excuses, and said the owner of the horse had gone to Richmond—I asked if he had a horse there that would suit me—he said he had one four years old, and knew its history, mention<lb></lb>ing the name of a railway contractor as its late owner, that it was very quiet, and would stand at the door of a house without requiring any<lb></lb>one</p>

               <p>with it; it was thoroughly sound—when I asked him about the speed, he said it would go ten miles an hour if put to it, but was not a fast horse—he said a lady had taken it out in Oxford Street with no one with her—I liked the horse because it was quiet—he asked me if I could not come the following day—I did not think I could, and he promised to bring the horse down, which he did not do—that was on Monday, 11th September—I called again, and saw Wicks, who took me to the stable, where I saw Quint and the horse—they showed me this warranty—the price was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I agreed to buy the horse, with a trial—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, September 11th, 1871. Received of Mr. De Lisle the sum of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my bay cob, six years old, which I warrant sound, quiet to ride, quiet in single and double harness, and to carry a lady, and free from all vice, and if not approved of at any time within fourteen days the horse may be returned, and the cash given back at the same time (<hi rend="italic">signed</hi>), W. H. HALL")—The groom gave me that paper—I went to some business men, as I had not the money in my pocket, and obtained a cheque for the amount, and paid it to the man, and rode the horse home that day—he was too quiet going home, and was a long time getting down—the following day I put him in saddle—he seemed quiet till we had a dispute—he wanted to go one way, and I wanted him to go the other—he stopped about five minutes without moving, I lashing and spur<lb></lb>ring him—he suddenly threw his back up, and butted all round the place—he was one of the worst buck-jumpers I ever saw, although I've ridden some bad ones in Australia—I rode him that day, and on the following put him in a gig—he would not draw it out of the yard—at last he did, and stood at the front door—I got in the gig, but the horse would not start, but threw down his head, backed the gig against the wall of the house, and when he could go no further, lay down—I showed the horse to Mr. Moon on the same morning, the 13th September, and he told me the horse was unsound, a screw—I took the horse back to Dean Street, and saw Wicks, and asked for my money—he said he had nothing to do with selling the horse, and the groom to whom I paid the money had gone away to New-market Races, I think he said—he gave me an address to write to him—I noted the place, and applied for a warrant, and afterwards received a letter (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "25, Dean Street, September 18th, 1871. Dear Sir,—In answer to yours, I beg to say I am sorry to hear that the cob does not suit you. I have no use for her at present.

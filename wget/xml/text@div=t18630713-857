                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bradfield, and reside at 14, Westmorland-place, City-road—I know the prisoner, and knew his wife Hannah Webb—I knew them between six and seven years—they had been married about five years—he is a cow keeper at 3, Cross-street, Hoxton—I lived at No. 14, not far from them—I last saw the deceased alive on Whit-Monday night, at twenty minutes past 1 at her own street-door—I had seen her at 9 o'clock that evening—the prisoner was not then present—she was perfectly sober at that time, and also when I saw her at half-past 1—at that time the prisoner was sitting in his kitchen with his head lying on the table—that is about six or seven yards from the street-door—I could see from the street-door into the kitchen, but I could not see him, because he was near the fire-place—the street-door was open, and the kitchen-door also—I don't think that anything said at the street-door could be heard in the kitchen—the deceased wished me to go into the kitchen, and I went to the door and saw the prisoner with his head on the table—I went back to her and had a little talk about her sister, she then wished me good night and closed the street-door, and I went home—I never saw her after that alive—I had seen her about half-past 11 that night, and she then showed me her apron where a woman had thrown a pot of beer over her—the prisoner was not present then—he keeps a milk shop—I heard the prisoner say that he would strangle his wife—that was at the street-door—a woman named Robinson came and put an empty beer pot in her face, Mrs. Webb shut the street-door, and Mrs. Robinson said, "Is the drunken b—sober now?"—the prisoner said something, but I did not hear what—I have been given to understand that he was acquainted with that woman, but I don't know it—they stood a. little at the street-door—the woman then left, and the prisoner pushed his door open, went in and shut it—I went and listened at the street-door, and I heard him say, "Kiss me, Hannah"—she replied, "No, James"—I heard a scuffle in the shop—I looked through the key-hole—I could not see them, and I went and looked between the gates into the yard close by the street-door, and saw him have her partly by the head or shoulders, dragging her into the yard—he was pulling her out down two steps into the shed, and she said, "Don't, James; don't James;" in rather a faint voice—he said, "Come along"—I then knocked violently at the street-door, and all</p>

Q.</hi> If I understand you rightly there was blood from a broken artery which circulated over the system and stopped the breath? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that broken artery was in the substance of the lungs, and the blood infiltrated into the air tubes—that would account for the frothy mucus—an intemperate person very often, contracts congestion of the lungs—that would make a person more susceptible to concussion from violence and make the arteries more likely to give way—I did not find the lungs at all congested; I am quite sure of that—you may call it congested if you like, I call it blood extravasated in the substance of the lungs—the lungs were highly congested where the blood had escaped.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after it was taken would you find traces of alcohol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps not half-an-hour, it evaporates very quickly—my <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> was not till the next morning—when I first went to the room the bed clothes were slightly disordered, but I saw no marks of any struggle.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any evidence of any congestion existing six hours before death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None at all—there is congestion arising from inflammation of the lungs which comes on slowly, and causes a hardened state of the tissue, which is called hepatised—there was no trace of anything of that kind—there was no congestion that I could ascribe to pure disease—in my judgment the extravasation was caused by an injury just previous to death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that injury cause death immediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not immediately; a person might walk about for an hour after, there would be some difficulty of breathing—I should say a person could not walk about and talk, and appear quite well for two hours after the injury; there would be a difficulty of breathing and also a certain amount of bloody expectoration—the bursting of this vessel from whatever cause would account for all the internal appearances—the bruise under the right collar bone was about the size of my hand, and swollen about an inch in height from the surrounding structure—it was immediately above the right breast—a blow in that place would not be likely to cause death without a rupture—I should not ordinarily anticipate death from a blow there—the ribs were not at all injured—the ribs would lie between the blow and the lungs; the shock of</p>

               <p>the blow would pass through the ribs—the ribs bend to a certain extent with great force—the bruise was of recent date, within a few hours.</p>

             and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose an oil-cloth at any time - A. I did from outside of the door, it is my brother's property and mine, I did not see it taken; in consequence of information I went after the prisoner, I found her in Houghton-Street, about a hundred and fifty yards from my house with the carpet under arm, I then told her that she and I would take a walk to Bow-street with it. I took her to my own home and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by it - A. I told her it was my property, she said another woman gave it her. This is the piece of oil-cloth, I believe it is mine, I cannot positively swear to it having no mark on it, I had seen it about a quarter of an hour before, it is worth fifteen shillings.</p>

            . Q. Did you see the prisoner on the 7th of this month - A. Yes, that is the woman, I saw her take the piece of oil-cloth from Messrs. Warlter's door, there was another woman along with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner that did it - A. Yes, it was rolled up as it is now, she unrolled some of it and then she rolled it up again, she took it before her until she got into Clare market, I told Mr. Warlters of it, he brought her back with the oil-cloth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The woman that gave me the oil-cloth was head and shoulders taller than me, I was not in Clare-street that day, the woman that gave it me I knew some time ago, she said you take this, she was going to New Inn, I was going up Houghton-street, when the gentleman stopped me, instead of looking after the woman, he took me to his shop. I have three small children to provide for, my husband is at sea. I get my living by going out a chairing.</p>

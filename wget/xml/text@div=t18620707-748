F. and Mrs. Phillips, June 20th, 1862," is written upon it—that is one of the three that I gave; these other two are not mine—I saw the prisoner again on 30th—I then owed Mr. Betts 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid that sum to the prisoner in cheques and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; before I paid it, I asked him if he had placed the other money to my credit, to Mr. Beets, and he said, "Yes, all right."</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Betts; the prisoner was in his service as carman, and had been, I suppose, about two years—on Monday, 30th June, the prisoner paid me 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he produced this book at the time—there is no entry in it, on 23d, of the receipt of a sum of money from Mr. Fruin—the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he paid me on the 30th, was composed of three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a cheque for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the rest in gold, silver, and a few coppers—these are the three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes he gave me—I called his attention to this one marked "Forged"—I said it looked different to the others—I was not aware that it was bad—I had never seen a bad one before—he said, "Oh, it is good enough"—I asked him who he look it of—he said he had taken them all of Mr. Fruin, of Acton—he did got say when—I showed the note to Mr. Betts a few minutes afterwards—I took it to the Bank of England the next morning—I put the name of "Fruin, Acton," on that note myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tea dealer, residing in Oxford-street, and an the prosecutor of this Indictment—the prisoner has been in my service about two years; his salary was 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, and commission—his duties were to go out with the horse and cart, collect orders, and deliver goods, receive any bills that were paid to him, and any money that was paid for the parcels he took out on the same day, which would be entered in the parcel-book; and any money taken previously would be entered in the credit-book, and the total amount received in the parcel-book—when he received a sum of money he was to pay it the same evening, directly he got in; if he came in too late in the evening, it was his duty to hand the cash in an account for it the next morning; but that is a thing which hardly ever occurred—if he had an overplus of money, he should make an entry at the bottom of the page at the time his money is made up; but then it is presuming he does not know where it comes from—putting down "Fruin's plus" is an absurdity—he did not pay me a sum of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which</p>

            . I am an officer. I was waiting at the prosecutor's door, and followed the prisoner to Tabernacle-walk - he went into No. 5, and in four or five minutes he came out, and went into a public-house - I took him in charge, and took six pair of gloves out of each of his coat pockets, and this dozen from his hat - he said they were his own.</p>
               <p>MR. ARNOLD. These are my gloves - they are what I marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JONES. Q. What is the mark? A. This is it; "six not welted" - I never received any gloves of the prisoner in my life - he said two or three times that he had two duplicates of gloves, which he bought of a little manufacturer, who had broken, and I purchased them of him - I went into a public-house with the prisoner on the morning he was taken, on our road home - we had some porter, but no gin - I said to him, "Bartlett, I am sorry for you" - my house has not been searched for stolen goods.</p>

            . I am journeyman to the prosecutor. The prisoner worked there - he told me if I would take some gloves, he could sell them, and he could put me up to more than I knew - he came on the Monday morning to work, and took two skins - I told my master, and he told me to hold on with him, and try if I could pick out where he sold them - he came again on the Tuesday, and took a pair of gloves which were finished; and on Wednesday morning he took three pair, which were not finished, and said he was going to sell them at dinner-time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he could put you up to something? A. Yes, on the Saturday night - I had only been there a few days - I had before lived at Yeovill with my brother-in-law, and worked for 
               <persName id="t18340410-196-person1275">Mr. Wilmington</persName>
             - there was something occurred between us; but he gave me a very good character, and gave me up to

             - I was not discharged for having received money for goods, and entering them in the book as not paid for - I received the money, and gave it to my master's daughter - I was then called down to tea, and was told I had received half-a-crown more than I had paid; but I had not.(The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring his innocence.)</p>

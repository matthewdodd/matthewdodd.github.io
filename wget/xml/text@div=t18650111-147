                  </hi> I live at 31, Upper Ebury-street, Pimlico, and am a general postman—on the afternoon of 27th December, about half-past two, I was in Eaton-place, South—I there saw Murray, he came to me, and in consequence of what he said to me, I proceeded to give him change for a shilling—I did not see Jones at that time—I took out my purse, and poured out a portion of its contents into my hand—I gave him change with a threepenny piece and nine penny pieces—he then took a sovereign out of my hand and got up into a cart—I followed him, and cried out, "Stop, "he did not stop, and I cried, "Stop thief!"—at that time I saw Jones in the cart—he was near enough to hear me cry out "Stop thief!"—a third party was driving the cart; they drove away, I followed them and kept crying "Stop thief!"—they were stopped by a policeman—Jones then jumped out of the cart and ran away—the policeman let go of the horse's head, and ran after him; a milkman then got hold of the horse's head, Murray got out, the milk<lb></lb>man then let go of the horse's head and ran after Murray—I also ran after him, and the man in the cart drove away, I believe—I went to the station-house with Murray, and when I came back the cart was gone—I have not seen my sovereign since—I am quite sure it was a sovereign he took, and not a sixpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milkman, living at Chelsea—about half-past two, on 22d September, I was in Sloane-square, and saw the two prisoners in a cart, they got out of the cart and enquired for change of any persons who might be passing by—knowing them before by seeing them about the neigh bourhood, I went and gave information at the police-station—I then came hack with a policeman, and saw the prisoners and another man with the cart in Eaton-place, South—Murray was then getting change from the postman, Sweetlove—I am not sure whether Jones was in the cart or behind it then—when I saw them in Sloane-square he was out of the cart with Murray—they were together when they were asking for change—I saw Murray leave the postman and get into the cart—the postman called out "Stop thief!"—the cart made a plunge off—the policeman went after the cart, laid hold of the horse and stopped it—Jones jumped out at the near side of the cart and ran up Chester-terrace, the policeman ran after him; I then laid hold of the horse's head, and Murray jumped out and ran down Burton-street, I ran after him—Sweetlove said to me, "That is the man who had my sovereign;" a waterman stopped Murray and took him to the station—it was in cones<lb></lb>quence of something I said at the station before, that the policeman was sent with me to Eaton-place, South—he was sent by the inspector.</p>

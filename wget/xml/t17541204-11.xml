            . On Sunday the 27th of October, about a quarter after eight in the evening, I was walking along by the side of <placeName id="t17541204-11-crimeloc59">Fleet ditch</placeName>

I taxed him with taking my handkerchief; he had got a silk one in his hand, and said he was going over the way for some ham, and that he was a poor apprentice boy; I took him into the inn, and sent the drawer out with a candle; he returned, and brought my handkerchief, which he said he found lying on the ground where I directed him, at the place where I took hold on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you took hold on the prisoner?</p>
               <p>T. Salter. It was in less than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner own he took it?</p>
               <p>T. Salter. No, he did not. He told me he was apprentice to Mr. Alcock, a smith, in Swan-alley; I sent for him; he gave him a very indifferent character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel his hand at your pocket?</p>
               <p>T. Salter. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that drawer that brought in your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>T. Salter. He being a servant, is gone home, and is not yet returned.</p>

               <p>I was walking behind the gentleman, he turned, and said, My lad, you have got my handkerchief; I must take and search you; there were two or three other lads by; I was going for six-pennyworth of ham.</p>

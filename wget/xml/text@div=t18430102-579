                  </hi>. I am a pork-butcher, and live in High-street, Wands-worth. On the 24th of Dec. the prisoner came to my shop and asked if it was convenient to pay the little account I owed to Mr. Day—I said, oh, yes, certainly, and tendered him two sovereigns to take the amount of the bill—I had known him previously as working at Mr. Day's, the saddler, in the same street—no sum was mentioned, but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the amount of the bill—I-placed the bill before him to write a receipt—he said, immediately, "I have not change"—I then gave him one sovereign and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he receipted the</p>

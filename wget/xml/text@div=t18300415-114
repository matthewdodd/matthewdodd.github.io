            . On the 23rd of March I was on duty at Frogwell, between the prosecutor's shop and his farm - I heard a cart stop early in the morning, and saw Brown pass me with a truss of hay on his back; I said to him, "Good morning;" he said he was going to Bates', and some more was coming - I went to see that he took it to Bates', who is a cow-keeper; he did so, and came away without it - I then went to the cart, and saw it was Mr. Cunnington's - I took the name of it, and then went to the prosecutor's; he was gone to Smithfield-market - I did not see Bates.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where Brown got this hay you cannot tell? A. No - I did not see him take it from the cart; Brown was at liberty till one o'clock that day, when I took him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was he from the cart when you saw him? A. One hundred yards; I did not say any thing to him then, but at one o'clock I said, "You are my prisoner" - he said, "What, about that little bit of hay?" I said Yes.</p>

I speak rather under than over, both times such sort of money as in the indictment; the first time I left my breeches on the floor, the second time I put them between the pillow and bolster, and the next morning I found them behind the board next to the head-cloth; I came down stairs, and asked my wife if she had taken any money out of my breeches-pocket for change; she said, no; I had not told her what I missed before; I told her the last time I believed I missed 25 or 26 l. I went up and examined all about, but found nothing; I concluded it was by some body in the house, the man lay in the garret; my wife said he went to bed when she did, and he had not been up stairs before he went to bed; she recollected that the prisoner went up stairs once after I was in bed; I got a constable, and called her aside into the dining-room, and said, here is a most terrible affair happened last night, and likewise that day week before, I have been robbed; robbed, said she, of what; I said, of a good deal of money, God knows whether you are guilty, if you are innocent I shall be sorry to charge you with it; she said, as to me I have no money, but a 5 s. 3 d. and some halfpence, which I had from the last place I was in; I said, I suppose you have no objection of being searched, you and your box; said she, I will go up stairs, and you shall search me to my shift; I said, that is not decent for me, my wife shall go with you; she said, with all my heart; I called my wife, and said, go up with her, and see if she has any thing about her; my wife refused going; then I sent for a neighbour, she came; I said to the prisoner, Hannah, there will be no indecency in my seeing what you have in your pocket; she said, no; she took off one pocket, and emptied it out, she did not seem inclinable to take off the other; immediately she took out what she had in her pocket, and held it in her hand, and turned her pocket out, she was for returning her hand to her pocket again; I said, put that down on the table which you have in your hand; she did, there were a 5 s. 3 d. some half-pence, and a 9 s. piece; I said, you told me you had only a 5 s. 3 d. and some halfpence; this 9 s. piece gives me a deal of reason for suspicion, tell me where my money is, that I may have it again, and you may meet with more favour; if it should be found upon you, you shall go about your business; she said she had not got it; I said, how did you come by the 9 s. piece; she hesitated a little, and then said she received it for wages at her last place; I asked her where was the last place she lived at; she hesitated, and said, she did not know; then she said, I forgot myself, I remember I was out before I came to you to buy me some things, and there I had this 9 s. piece in change; she had no sooner said that, but she said I was out on a Sunday at Mr. Dickey's, and he gave me change<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070043"></xptr> for half a guinea, and in that he gave me this 9 s. piece, that was where I had her character from; I said, you tell so many various stories, I believe you are the person that has my money; she still persisted in it that she knew nothing of the matter; the gentlewoman being by, I said, go up stairs, and let them see what you have about you; they were gone up about twenty minutes; I went up, I said, have you found any more; they said, no; I heard her making a good many protestations, saying, I have not got it, I have not got it; I said, no, not about you, but you know where it is; while I was thus talking, my son called me down, I went down, there the constable said, here is your money, I have found it in the copper-hole in the yard; I took the money of him, and went up stairs, and said to the prisoner, here, do you know this, holding it up to her; said she, I am glad you have found it, I am glad you have found it; said I, do you know any thing of the taking it, it was wrapped in a coarse cloth; yes, said she, I do; I said, did you take it from me last night; she said, yes, I did; I said, did you take any money from me this day week at night; yes, she said, I did; upon that I said, I do not know what quantity of money you did take, but upon opening the cloth I said, that was like this; she said, I told the money the first time, which was 9 l. 13 s. 6 d. and what I took last night I do not know, for I did not tell it; she said, there is half a guinea among it that is mine, and all the silver, and a 6 s. 9 d. piece, but the 9 s. piece I had in my pocket, Sir, is yours. I talked to her a good deal, I asked her how she could think of committing a thing of that kind, not only a first, but a second time; she said she did not know, but hoped I would forgive her, and let her go about her business; she having been out on the Sunday, I asked her if she made away with any of my money then; she said, no, she had not, there was all my money; she went down on her knees, and asked forgiveness; I said, no, if the law will forgive you I will.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was there of it when you told it out?</p>
               <p>Harris. There was 23 l. 4 s. 8 1/4 d. that was the whole, with the money she demanded; I put it all together, and took her before the Alderman, there she confessed the same, and told the Alderman the half guinea and silver were her own; then the Alderman said, give it her, which I did; then she said a 6 s. 9 d. was hers; the Alderman said, you go on, but I will grant you no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the pieces?</p>
               <p>Harris. There were four guineas, ten half guineas, two 18 s. pieces, seven 13 s. 6 d. pieces, eight 9 s. pieces, five 6 s. 9 d. pieces, one 5 s. 3 d. two 4 s. 6 d. pieces, four shillings and four-pence three farthings. I should be glad if she could meet with mercy.</p>

            . I am the constable, Mr. Harris sent for me; he called the prisoner in, and told her he had been robbed two separate times of so much money; she said she knew nothing of it, she said she had so much money in her pocket, and when she turned out her pocket there was a 9 s. piece more than she said; then she said she had it in change: Mr. Harris taxed her closer and closer, she would own nothing about it; then he sent the woman up to search her: while they were up stairs I searched about, and found the money in the copper-hole in the yard, done up in this rag (producing one;) then I came in, and ordered the prosecutor to be called down; I held it to him, and said, here is your money, I found it in the copper-hole; we went up to the prisoner, I said I have found the money; she cried, and said, then I am ruined for ever; I said to Mr. Harris, what money have you been robbed of in all; he said, I believe of 24 or 25 l. before the money was told our I put it out on the table, there was 23 l. 4 s. some half-pence, and a farthing; then we went before the Alderman, and he committed her to Newgate; before the Alderman she said she stole all the money from her master, she claimed all the silver, and half a guinea, and after that she claimed a 6 s. 9 d. piece more, but the Alderman would not allow her that.</p>

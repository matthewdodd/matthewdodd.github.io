               <p>I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they are worth 38 s. About a quarter before twelve I left the things upon the cutting board in the shop: the prisoner worked for me: he went to dinner about half an hour after I went out; in a quarter of an hour after I went up stairs, my silver buttons were gone from the place in which I left them; I went to the alehouse to look for him, and to his lodgings; he had not been to either; then I concluded I had been robbed; I got a horse and followed him to Harrow on the Hill; I enquired at the King's Head at Harrow, and found the prisoner was there; he ran out of the door and fell into a dunghole, and I a top of him; I brought him back to the house and found the breeches; and he pulled the buttons out of his left hand waistcoat pocket, and laid them on the table.</p>

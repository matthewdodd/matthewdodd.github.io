On Sunday, the 8th of May, the prisoner came into my house; I knew her before: I am sure she is the person; she lived within two doors of my house. She frequently had half a pint of beer, and took it into the tap-room to warm. My servant had washed the pots, and put them by the fire to dry them; the servant left the tap-room to bring some pots into the bar. When she returned, there was a pot gone, and the prisoner only in the tap-room. I went into the tap-room, and asked the prisoner if she knew any thing of the pot: she said, no. I told her there was one missing; suspicion fell so strong upon her, as not to allow her to leave the house until she was searched; she said, she would not be searched by any body in the house. I sent for an officer; before the officer came, my wife asked the prisoner to stand up, to see if the pot was under her; she got up, and moved round so quick, which shewed the bulk of her pocket. I caught hold of the pot through her clothes, and held it until the officer came in and took it out. This is the pot; it is mine. I saw it taken from her pocket. After the officer had taken the pot out of the prisoner's pocket, we went and searched the prisoner's room. We found a frying-pan with pewter all over it.</p>

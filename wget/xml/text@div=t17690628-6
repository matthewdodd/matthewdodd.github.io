I told her nothing, I would have nothing to do with her. There came in two or three more girls. She said they were her sisters. They picked my pocket: I missed my watch first: being a little in liquor I did not know what they were about. They took my silver knee-buckles out of my pocket, and my pocket-book, two pocket handkerchiefs, my paper snuff-box, and two half guineas, I think there were four of them in all. When I took hold of them to get my things again, they cried out, and there came a woman from below. She rescued them from me, and they went off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in London?</p>
               <p>Ranees. I had been in London but a week or two. I never found any of my things again but my snuff-box. The next morning I saw the two prisoners lying in bed with one man. I knew them to be two of the persons that took my things away. They denied it. I said if they would give me back my watch, I would say nothing at all about it; but they would not.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in Nightingal Lane, East-Smithfield. The prosecutor applied to me in the morning about five o'clock, and told me he had been robbed by a parcel of girls. He went with me to shew me the place, but they were gone. An acquaintance of mine went with us, and we found the two prisoners and another woman in bed with one man,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280006"></xptr> in Aldgate parish. We made them get up, and turned the clothes up; but could find nothing. Ingram wanted her pocket sadly. I had taken it up. I took out this paper snuff box. The prosecutor said that was his box ( Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) He had before told me he had lost a paper snuff-box, with other things. In the snuff-box were three shillings and sixpence, and a quarter guinea. Ingram said she found the snuff-box on the bed, in the other room.</p>

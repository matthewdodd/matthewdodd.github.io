                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 130.) I was on duty on the 18th of September in Old Kent-road—I saw the prisoner Green driving three horses with a dray—he drove them up to the front of the Prince of Sare Coburg stables—he went to the tap, and had some refreshment with the ostler—he then walked to the dray, and took a quantity of clover-hay to the stable door—I saw Thorn receive it, and take it into the stable—Green then drove the dray on—I followed him till he got opposite the station-house in Black heath-road, and there I took him—I told him it was for stealing a quantity of hay, and at the station-house he said it was only half a truss of hay when he brought it from the farm, and it was usual to leave it for the horses when they returned—I said I believed it was more than half a truss—he still said it was to bait his horses on their re turn, and was set at liberty—I saw the sergeant, and went with him to the Prince of Saxe Co-burg—Thorn was standing outside the door—I called him aside, and said "I have received information that you have some hay left by Barclay and Perkins' man this morning"—he said, "No"—I said, "I have received information that two men have left some here belonging to Barlclay and Perkins"—he said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure of that?"—he said, "Yes"—he went into the stable where a horse was feeding, took from the rack some hay similar to this, and said, "That is all the hay I have got in the stable"—I said, "Is it possible that Barclay and Perkins' men could have left hay here without your knowing it?"—he said, "They could not"—the sergeant went to the next stable, and I followed—he said, "Is this it"—I went to the bottom of the stable, and saw a truss of clover bay apparently the same as I had seen taken in—I brought it out at the stable door, and said, "What is this?"—Thorn said, "It is mine"—I said, "Where did you but it?"—he said, "I bought it"—I said, "Did you pay for it?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Who did you buy it of?"—he said, "A man who has a bit of hay at different times when he called left this hay to pay me for what he had had"—I asked if he knew the man or his employer? he said, "No"—I have brought a sample of the hay here.</p>

I was at Deptford on the 18th of September, in the Broadway, and went to the Saxe Coburg public-house with Sedger—Thorn was on a bench in front of the house—we called him aside, and asked if he had received any hay from two men belonging to Barclay and Perkins—(Green is in their employ)—I went the same evening to New Cross, and saw Green coming with a dray—I asked if he belonged to that dray—he said he did—I said he must go along with me—he said, "What is to become of my horses and dray?"—I said, "I have seen some of your firm, and have brought a man to take care of the dray"—he said, "You will allow me to speak to him"—I said, "certainly," and he did so—he then asked me on what charge I took him into custody—I said on suspicion of disposing of a truss of hay belonging to his employers, and that he had better not say anything to me about it, as he would come before a Magistrate—he said he had nothing to say, but what he had stated at our station that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse keeper to Barclay and Perkins. It is usual for men going any distance to take out hay with them—I did not see whether Green took any out—I recollect when the dray went away, turning round and seeing some on the dray—it is usual to take hay when going as far as Welling, and the quantity I saw.</p>

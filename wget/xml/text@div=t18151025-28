She said, she would take me to the house where the person was who slept with me; she took me to a house, but the person was not there. I then suspected her, and invited her into a public-house, until I could get an officer; I sent for one, and then she made her escape.</p>

            . The prosecutor acquainted me with his loss; in consequence of which, I apprehended the prisoner; she immediately put something like a bit of paper into her mouth; I suspected it was a note, and seized her by the throat, to prevent her swallowing it; but it was no use. I then was about to search her hair, when she put up her hand, and took something out of her cap; it was a five-pound note. The prosecutor told me he had the five-pound notes, all of following numbers two were stolen, and he had one in his possession. On comparing the note I found on prisoner, it was the following number to note the prosecutor then had in his possession.</p>

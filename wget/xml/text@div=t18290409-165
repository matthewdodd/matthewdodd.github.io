            . I am apprentice to Mr. Attenborough, a pawnbroker, of Crown-street, Finsbury. On the 7th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought a pair of new cord trousers and a new waistcoat to pawn - I asked his name and residence; he said he lived in Peter-street, Spitalfields - I knew there was no such street; I then asked him whose the property was - he said it was his mother's, and then that it was his own; I told my principal - he sent for an officer, who found a pair of fustain trousers in his hat; I had seen the prisoner on the 23d of January, when he pawned a pair of trousers and a waistcoat - these are the articles he brought first, and these are what he brought last.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge with these trousers - I went to a house in Plummer's-row, where I knew he lived, and found these linings; I found a woman there - she came to the office afterwards, and begged of me to let her see her husband; when she saw him, she said, "William, what have you been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090084"></xptr>doing, and what is this all about?" he said, "I don't know what could possess me, but it all belonged to my master; I am sorry for what I have done, he has been a good master to me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where was this? A. In the yard of the office - the property was in my possession, but had not then been shewn to him; he said that the trousers which were taken from his hat were part of his master's property.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Jackson; the prisoner had been with him seven or eight years. On the Monday after he was taken I went to see him at Clerkenwell - I asked how he could rob his master, who had been so kind to him; he asked if Mr. Jackson held out any promise to him - I said I had no authority to say so; I asked how he got the things out of the house - he said on his person; the trousers under his own trousers, and the waistcoats in his pocket; that he took the things home, and put them into the cupboard: his wife knew nothing about them - and when he went to his meals he took and pawned them at different times; I asked him where - he denied taking them to any other shop but Mr. Attenborough's, and said he had burnt the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give him any encouragement yourself? A. I said he had better speak the truth.</p>

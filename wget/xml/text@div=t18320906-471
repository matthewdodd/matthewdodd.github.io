On the 20th of September, 1831, the prisoner came to my house and asked me to cash an advance-note for the ship Trusty; I agreed to do so - he looked out some shirts and other things; I gave him a sovereign, and some silver out of the note - I took the goods he bought on board the Trusty; I then missed a waistcoat - I never saw him again till the 11th of September last, when he had the waistcoat on; I said, "You are a pretty sort of fellow to come and get my things from me; and leave me a cash-note of which I could make no use, as you left the ship directly" - he said he had come home from Antigua, and if I would go with him I should find where they were to be paid; he walked me round the dock twice, but I refused to go any further, and took him into custody - I am quite certain he is the man. I went back to the ship - he had taken these things he bought of me, and was gone; I cut out vthis waistcoat, and know it well - this is the note he gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6 1/2, Bowling-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. I am the housekeeper—on Sunday morning, the 12th of Jan., about half-past four o'clock, I came down stairs, and discovered two of my bird-cages had been taken off the nails on which they hung, in the shop where they usually were, and were standing on the table, and the birds were gone—I also missed a bird-cage, and when I came to look round, I found that my till had been opened, and about a pound's worth of copper money gone—it consisted of halfpence and farthings—I had locked it myself about ten o'clock the night before, just before I went to bed—the door between the dairy and shop was open—that was fastened the night before—it was locked I believe, but I am not positively certain—I know it was closed and shut, and I believe it was locked inside—we generally lock it inside—that opens into the dairy—there is a door that opens out of the dairy into the yard—I found that door ajar—I saw it shut at ten o'clock over night, but not fastened, only on the latch—I know the prisoners—Settle lived about four doors off in the next street—about two o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, I saw Mrs. Palmer, the mother of Palmer—I went with her to her house in North-street—I found a box there, and in it I found my birds, and the cage that was taken—I found six birds in it—I firmly believe them to be mine—I can positively swear to the cage—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hawker, and live in Brook-street, Hamp<lb></lb>stead-road. On Sunday, the 12th of Jan., the prisoners came to me with another boy, named Spencer—I knew Spencer and Palmer—they had two canaries in a cage, and asked if I would buy them—I would not—Settle asked me if I would buy seven cock canary birds that he had got at home—I said I would if he would bring them—he said he would bring them on the Sunday following—he did not come—the policeman came, and I gave him information of what had passed—on that same Sunday I met the two prisoners about two o'clock in the afternoon—I spoke to them, and Settle ran away—I informed Palmer what had happened—he said he knew all about it, that the birds were at his mother's, and he told me to go and tell his mother to take them back—he said at the same time that he did not know they were stolen—I went to his mother's, and saw her—I should not have known where the birds were if Palmer had not told me that—I afterwards told Palmer what had passed between his mother and me—Settle was with him—I told him I had told his mother to take the birds home—he said he was very glad of it—I asked Settle about it—he said it was him that did the robbery—that he got in at a window at the back of the premises, that he reached through the panel of the window, got the key out, opened the door with it, walked in, and took 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Palmer was by at the time—he said to Settle, "You have got me into a nice trouble"—Settle replied, "Oh, I won't get you into trouble, I will go and give myself up."</p>

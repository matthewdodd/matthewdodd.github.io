If you don't find 'em there, go to ' the Horse-shoe behind Green's Free-school, and ' if you miss of 'em there too, desire the People ' of the House to tell you where Mr. ' Morris the Shoe-maker lives, for they often ' meet at his House. Paternoster is a young ' Man with a bald Head, he wears a fair ' Wig, an out-side light Drab Coat, with a ' great Cape, his under Clothes are Snuff-colour, ' and sometimes blue Grey turn'd up ' with Black, a Silver Watch with a Crimson ' String. Darvan is a young Lad near 19 ' Years of Age, pretty well set, wears a light ' Wig, a new Hat with a Silver Loop and ' Button, a blue grey Coat, and a work'd ' Waistcoat; and sometimes an olive-colour'd ' Suit. Each of 'em wears a small Diamond-Ring.' I took these Directions in Writing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173112080008"></xptr> and went to the Three Cranes in Castle Lane.

We secur'd 'em, and then search'd the Room. Their Hats, Wigs, Clothes, Watches and Rings, and their Persons, answer'd Callicant's Description; and yet with horrible Oaths and Imprecations they protected at first that they never knew nor heard of such a Woman as Callicant; but afterwards confess'd that they were acquainted with her. In the Drawers we found these 7 Holland Waistcoats, mark'd G R, with a Crown at top. One of the Crowns is partly pick'd out; above 20 Pair of Stockings, Mens and Womens, Silk, Thread and Worsted; some Womens Linen, and several other Sorts of Goods. I examin'd how they came by them. They said they bought the Mens Apparel for their own wearing, and the Womens Clothes were their Wives.</p>

The Prisoners were my Lodgers; they were recommended to me by Mr. Morris the Shoe-maker, who said they were Gentlemen's Sons, and had 700 l. left 'em by their Godmothers. They kept pretty good Hours. But one Night they came home about 6, went up with a Candle, lock'd the Door, staid about half an Hour, went out again with the Key, and return'd between 2 and 3 in the Morning. I was a Bed when they came, and they wanted to light a Candle, but I huff'd 'em for staying out so late, and so they went to Bed in the dark. I ask'd 'em one day what they did with those Wives , and they said they went a fishing with them .</p>

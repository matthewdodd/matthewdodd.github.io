                  </hi>. I am station-master at the Stratford station of the Eastern Counties Railway. On the 18th of July, I was in attendant there—I have been seven years in the company's service—I remember the arrival of the Ipswich up passenger train that day—according to our regulation that train would have become due at Stratford at four minutes to four o'clock in the afternoon—it arrived as near as I am able to state at nine or ten minutes past four, but I am not able to state positively—I think it was near about ten or twelve minutes late—it consisted of ten or eleven carriages—the hinder one a second class passenger carriage—the time for it to stay in our station depends on whether we have many passengers and luggage to get out—sometimes a minute, sometimes not so long, sometimes two minutes—they were in the act of taking in water at the time of the accident—I should think it had not been there a minute when I looked down the line to rear of the train and saw the engine and trucks coming in between the signal and the passenger train—I saw them come towards me after they passed the signal—at that time the signal was down as it is now on this model—it was painted like this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—that indicates that the line is clear, and when there is anything to stop it you drop it—when it is placed in an inter<lb></lb>mediate state the train should approach cautiously for 100 yards past the signal—unless an indication is then given by a man there that the line is clear, and then they may come up as far as the station—it indicates that caution is necessary, and that being done they must stop instantly—when I saw the train approaching the signal was down—I did not see it down before the truck-train arrived—it had been down not long before the passenger-train arrived—as near as I can say the train was approaching at the rate of ten, eleven, or twelve miles an hour, but I am not competent to say the exact speed—I did not see whether the steam was escaping—I ran up by the side of the engine of the passenger-train as fast as I could, calling out to the driver, "Go</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210067"></xptr>
               <p>on, go on," in order that he might get on the move, and that concussion might not be so great, but that was found impracticable, and the engine with the trucks came on the hinder part of the passenger-train—a great deal of mischief was done, many persons were injured, Mr. Hind among the number—to the best of my knowledge I have known the prisoner about three years, or longer perhaps—I cannot say to a certainty—I have seen him coming from the yard and on an engine as driver.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been at Stratford all the seven years you have been in the employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, during six years—the number of persons stationed there has been reduced, I cannot say precisely when—I think there was a reduction of a man or two about two years ago, but I cannot exactly be positive—I believe one of the men was the clerk, and I believe a porter as well—I am not aware that there has been any reduction since that time—we have had an increase since that, a few months before the accident, and I have always been at liberty to employ an extra hand—I believe the prisoner has been engaged by the company something more than a twelvemonth, but cannot be positive—he drove Mr. Jacksoa's goods-train—that was not on the Cambridge line, but on the Colchester—I cannot say how many times he has driven—I do not know that he has driven only twice before this—I believe he was engaged as an engine-fitter, but I have nothing to do with him—I can see he is a one-eyed man—the regular signal-man was not at his station at the time the passenger-train from Ipswich came up, but a lad, or I may say a man, eighteen years of age, had been appointed by me to attend to the signal in his place—the signal-man was engaged in some other matter, and I sent the lad Unwin to attend to the signal—a few minutes previous to the passenger-train arriving I saw him sitting on the handle which works the signal, with his back the country way, and his face looking towards London—his back was to the country where the train was coming from—I directly requested him to torn his face, and pay proper attention to the signal—I should say that was four or five minutes before the train came up—I will not undertake to swear that positively, but think I might safely—as near as I can say, the train was ten or twelve minutes late—I do not think it was a quarter of an hour—I might have sent the boy to the signal-station about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before—I will swear it was five minutes before—I will not say it was more than five minutes—I must have sent him to the signal-post before the train was due, or else he would not have been there, because when I came out to look for the Ipswich passenger-train I saw him there—that might have been after the train was due.</p>

               <p>it, he would use his hands—it is not usual on this line to exhibit a hand-signal in addition to the other—I do not think it is necessary—one signal of that kind is sufficient—that signal had been out of order, but I cannot tell how lately before I put the boy on it—it might have been a week—I cannot tell whether it was four days or two—I know it was in working order when this occurred.</p>

I am out of business—I have been a draper—I live at Stratford—I am quite unconnected with the Eastern Counties Railway—I know Maryland-point bridge, it is the second bridge down from the Strat<lb></lb>ford station. On the day of the accident, about five minutes past four o'clock, I was crossing that bridge, and could see the signal at the Stratford station quite plainly—I mean the signal on the down side that stops the passenger-trains there—when I first saw it, it was quite down as this model is now—I heard a passenger-train coming up, I waited about a minute, and there was one fan pulled up—the train passed the signal-post, and immediately the fan was let down again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a guard in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On the 18th July, I was guard of the one o'clock train coming up from Ipswich—the time at London was ten minutes after four, and at Stratford fifty-six minutes past three—we left Ipswich at one o'clock—we got to Romford at forty-six minutes past three, that was thirty-four minutes after the time—while we were there, I saw an engine on the down line—the prisoner was on it—I do not know that he could well avoid seeing my train go up, because we nearly touched—we passed him there, and left him behind us—our next stoppage was at Ilford—we got there at fifty-seven minutes past three—we gained two minutes between Romford and Ilford—we are allowed nine minutes in doing that space—we did it in ten—we left there at fifty-eight minutes past three—we did not stop again till we got to Stratford—before getting there was a signal made—that signal denotes danger when all the fans are down—we must not approach it then—when we passed it, three fans were down—that indicated that we were to approach cautiously, to take great care—we did so—we always prepare for that signal at Stratford, particularly on Saturday, because of there being so much cattle there un<lb></lb>loading—I suppose that was known to the persons employed about the Strat<lb></lb>ford station—having arrived at the station, we stopped, and were taking in water—the engineer takes in water there when he requires it—sometimes we take in water there, and sometimes not—after we had been there about two minutes, there was a collision—the prisoner was driving the engine that came into the hinder carriages—I knew his person, but not his name—the collision was principally with the last carriage which had been put on at Brentwood—that is the station beyond Romford, eighteen miles from London—there were a great many passengers at Brentwood—the stoppage to put on the carriage occasioned some delay there.</p>

I am superintendent of the Eastern Counties Railway and store<lb></lb>keeper at the Stratford station—in Nov. last Clare was engine-driver in the company's employ—he continued in that capacity about three months after I came into the service of the company, as far as I could judge, he was thoroughly competent to drive an engine—I have seen him drive fee. quently—I remember the day of the accident, my attention was called to the Fire—fly three hours and a half after the accident—it was then removed from its position—the smoke—box was damaged a little—Captain Coddington saw it on the Tuesday following—it was then in the same condition—nothing wai done to it, as far as I know—it was kept at the Stratford station.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you from the Satur<lb></lb>day till the Tuesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Stratford, not where this engine was, but at a different part of the line—nothing was done to the engine to my knowledge—I did not take it to pieces to see whether the reversing engines were in order, or whether a piece of string was tied to the regulator—I knew Clare—he had Been working on the Cambridge line when I came on the Eastern Counties line—he was theu driving an engine—I do not know whether he was hired ai a fitter or not—after he had been working on the Cambridge line he applied to me to appoint him to drive a passenger-train—I refused him—I assigned as a reason that he only had one eye—there would not be much difference between a man with one eye driving a passenger—train and a man with one eye driving a truck-train—I should have no hesitation in putting him on a goods train—I advised him not to take it at the time, on account of his having but one eye—I refused him a passenger-train—I gave him an offer of a goods train that goes slower than a passenger-train—a man with a slow train has a better chance of seeing—goods-trains ought not to exceed fifteen miles an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that one part of the regulations is not that they should not go more than twenty-five miles an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From fifteen to twenty miles an hour—he knew this train ought to have been a slow one—there was no specific order given that it should be slow, but it is perfectly well known among the men—there is a regulation put up in the shed, that fit<lb></lb>ters should not drive—I have seen it—I am not aware that there is an order that no engine-fitter should drive an engine—there is an order that no fitter should bring an engine out of the shed—there are two or three fitters on the line as drivers at the present time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But there is something about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is an order to prevent the fitters bringing the engines on to the line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what is the difficulty or the necessity for more sci<lb></lb>ence in bringing an engine out of the warehouse on to the line or in driving aa ejigine on the line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is to prevent men who are not accustomed to working engines taking them on to the line—I believe the terms of the No<lb></lb>tice are that no fitter shall do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the Stratford signal, some time before this accident, reported to you as. being unfit in its position? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well I cannot recollect that exactly—the matter had been talked over, and the new signal was in the course of being fixed, and was nearly fixed on the Cambridge line when this accident happened—I will not say that the drivers on the line have not reported</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210081"></xptr>
               <p>that signal as "being dangerous—I will not swear but what it has been spoken about—I should say there are a great many drivers on the line who have not to reported it—I cannot say whether there have been a dozen—I will not swear it—it is usual and necessary for the drivers of engines to have a copy of the rules and regulations given them—I cannot say of my own knowledge that this man had not one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the resident engineer on the Eastern Counties Railway. I prepared this plan—it is a correct representation of the part of the line where this accident happened—it was prepared under my direction, to show the working of the signals—it does not show the curve—it was made to a scale—there are two bridges before leaving the Stratford station—this signal (<hi rend="italic">looking at the plan</hi>) was about 259 yards from the hindmost—carriage at the station where the train stopped—it can be seen by the engine-driver, if he keeps a proper look-out, at a distance of 479 yards—more than a quarter of a mile—the point A in the plan is the spot from which you can first see the iighal, that is, at a distance of 220 yards from the signal; and from B, where the signal is, to-C, where the station is, is 259 yards—you can see the signal from the windlass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARXSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sore of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have tried it since the accident—I was not quite certain before—there is a curve between the signal and the windlass of a radius of about a mile, and there are two bridges intervening—the white part shows itself to the man at the windlass—he could only see from the form of the fan whether all the fens were down or not—he could not possibly mistake one fan being down for two—the signal has never been out of order since I have been there—I have been there since the 1st of Jan.—I believe the windlass is not above ten yards from the station, but I cannot speak positively; 1 have never measured it—it has never been reported to me that the drivers have made complaints of the signals at Stratford being dangerous—if it was a subject-matter of com<lb></lb>plaint to Mr. Scott, he never communicated it to me—I do not consider it a dangerous part of the line? not a bit more dangerous than any other part—I do not consider it safe for a train of trucks to go without a guard, or without a hind break—it may be safe without, because many trains do go so, and no accident occurs; but, in my judgment, I believe that it is inconsistent with safety, or rather, that we run a risk in tending out a train without a bind break.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will a break on an empty truck at the end have much effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have very little effect in stopping the train—the effect of a break depends a good deal or mainly dh the weight of the carriages—the weight naturally increasing the friction—two of these trucks contained some iron.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not measure; I cannot tell—they were in the centre of the train when I saw it—I should consider it running a risk to send out a tram, either full or empty, without a hind break—this model is a twelfth part of the real size—the Forest—gate station was not completed when this accident happened—I am not aware that it was opened long before it was completed—it may have been open to the public</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210082"></xptr>
               <p>about two months before the accident, but I cannot speak to that—I do not know that I swore so before the Magistrate or Coroner—I gave it as a matter of opinion, I rather think—the Forest-gate station was provided with the usual white, red, and green flags—there was, I believe, a man appointed to use them—the station—master has the charge of the station—it is a very unimportant station—the station—master ought to be able to do his duty wholly without the signals—it is so small a station that he would be able to do without, but he has flags—if he bad used his flags on this occasion it ought to have prevented the accident—it would have made it tenfold less likely—if the man at Forest-gate station, when he saw the Ipswich train pass, had held out his flag, he might have prevented this train coming—if there are no signals exhibited at the station, it is reasonably inferred that the line is clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that is the case with respect to a special train, a train that is not expected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With respect to any train, I should say it would—if there was no danger signal shown I should think the driver would imagine the line was clear, if he had not seen the train previously at Ilferi, which he had—it would show the line was clear till he came to a danger signal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not the signal at the Stratford station been re<lb></lb>moved? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has not—there has been another placed in another position—the old one remains, but is not used now—it was the intention of the directors to do so before the accident—they considered it better to have a uniform signal than to have a variety—that was the only reason—I was not in Coart when Scott was examined—I do not know that the alteration of signals has been on account of the repeated complaints of the drivers—I consider tke position on this side safer than the other—the signals are the same as 01 other lines—some railways have adopted the same signals, and some have not—it is becoming pretty general—men from any other line would understand the signals—it is one arm, a semi—colon—we had three different sets of sigoalt including this—that is enough, if they are perfectly understood—I do not know any mode by which a man may understand them, if he has only beea on the line twice before, and had no book of rules and regulations given him—the driver of an engine would be discharged if he did not obey orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make a train exactly similar to what the prisoner was driving, for the purpose of Captain Coddington trying the ex<lb></lb>periment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We used the same train and the same engine, with the trucks exactly in the same condition—the signals at Forest-gate station apply to any stoppage by that station—this signal applies to any stoppage by the Stratford station—there are signals down the line at all the stations—it is the duty of the engine—driver to look out for the signals as he approaches each station—in my opinion, if he had had the opportunity of seeing this signal being down, and stopped his engine, this accident would have been prevented—I cannot say whether there were two horse-boxes next to the binder carriage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain in the engineers, and am attached to the railway department of the Board of Trade—on the Tuesday after this ac<lb></lb>cident I went down to Ilford, and took the engine and train—I first examined the station and signal at the Stratford station—the windlass which works the signal is within a few yards of the station—that is the correct mode of work<lb></lb>ing it—the signal can be seen from the windlass—I did not take the measui ments myself, but I had them taken at the time and reported to me—tto measurements given in evidence are correct—the signals on the Ilford lio be perfectly seen for 200 yards—it was with a view of testing whether a sufficient distance to enable a person of competent skill to stop the train</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210083"></xptr>
               <p>that I went with the train—I went with the "Fire-fly," and I understand the same trucks, that had been used on the Saturday—I rode down to Ilford station on the opposite side of the rails, and then I tried the train on the up line, and gave the engine-driver his directions, as we were going under a bridge, to proceed without any previous concert—I directed him suddenly to stop the train—at that time we were going at the rate of twenty-fire miles an hour, as near as I can judge—I noticed the point at the time I gave the direction because it was while passing under a bridge, and I measured the distance from the bridge to the point when the engine came to a final rest—it was 445 yards from the bridge—the inclination was rather descending—it waa unfavourable for stopping—it was done simply by applying the break—I then proceeded on my journey—I had stationed a man with a red flag, as a mark for myself—at the time we approached him, we were going at the rate of about thirty miles an hour—when I got opposite the man, I shut off the steam again, and gave the engine—driver directions to stop the train—I stopped it by the break alone—at the time the steam was shut off, we were descending slightly; but before the engine came to a final rest we were ascending slightly—we stopped at a distance of 468 yards, then returned to Ilford, and came on from Ilford towards London at the rate of not less than thirty miles an hour—rather ex ceeding that when we came near Stratford—I saw the Stratford signal, and knew exactly the distance I was coming, and stationed a man—we did the last half mile in fifty—eight seconds—on seeing the signal, I shut off the steam, stopped the engines, reversed it also—it stopped from ten to twelve yards short of the station—we were then going at the rate of upwards of thirty miles an hour—I was going at full speed at the time I saw the signal—we stopped twenty or thirty yards before coming to the Angel-lane-bridge—we stopped within a yard or two of the same place we stopped at before—the engine stopped directly under the bridge—the inclination is ascending at the Stratford station—we were going a little faster then than the last time we stopped, and a shower of rain came on in the interval, which gave less adhe<lb></lb>sion to the rails—I believe the exact inclination is I in 330—it is a slight inclination—the curve slightly favours the stopping—when I applied the break I watched its effect on the wheels, to ascertain whether it was acting properly—it was sufficiently powerful to lock four of the wheels out of the ten, and the other six were revolving very slowly—the four were at a dead lock—on the last of these occasions I reversed the engine—the reversing gear acted—I watched to see while the driver's head was turned in an opposite direction, and it did act at once, and applied instantly—I am sufficiently an engi<lb></lb>neer to draw an inference from a plain fact—I am acquainted with the acting of locomotives, and the arrangements of railways—I have been two years an inspector of the Board of Trade, and was sent down for the purpose of making this examination—if the train had been going at fifteen or twenty miles an hour it would have stopped in a very much shorter space—the signal cannot be seen farther than 240 yards—it makes its appearance under the bridge—it is hidden by the masonry I think that an unfavourable circumstance—the line curves round.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210084"></xptr>
               <p>up to ray face, and then I saw it unxter the briflge—it was on the left hand side—I had to look to the left side of the line, not exactly straight before me—I think a break is of use in stopping a train—I have seen many other ling—it depends on the extent of the train whether they send out one or two guards—I think the competency of a driver ought to be ascertained—when a man is sent on a strange line I think they ought to send a competent engineer or fireman with him—he should have the assistance of a competent person until he becomes acquainted with it—I should not expect a man to he acquainted with a line 100 miles long in three drives—I should not be afraid to go on a line of twenty miles length after three times—I should not like ta undertake to drive an engine at all—it is not my business—a great many lines have figures as signals of danger, and also fans—they are to be put into the hands of the engine-drivers—there should be a book, not only with written instructions, but with coloured representations of the signals—that is quite necessary for safety—they have hand signals to use in case of danger—they ought to be used at every intermediate station if a train has just gone by—they are generally used as supplementary signals—if they have no othei means of communication, they should present the hand signals to the ap<lb></lb>proaching train to stop it for five or ten minutes, according to the Company's regulation—I afterwards went to Forest-gate station—it is a mile from Strat<lb></lb>ford—if the man at the Forest—gate station had presented the green flag wben he saw the truck train coming I do not see that it would have prevented the accident—I think the man at the Forest—gate station neglected his duty in not throwing out a signal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Is it a matter of economy to go slower? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is, and for Ail reason, upon railways where they do not want to go fast for passenger-trains, they go slow—an increase of speed is a considerable increase of cost to the company—thirty miles an hour would be much dearer to the company thai fifteen—it is a general practice among companies not to adopt great sped when it is not wanted.</p>

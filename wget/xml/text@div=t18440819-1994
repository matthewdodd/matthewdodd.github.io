                  </hi>. I carry on business as a grocer and tea-dealer, at No. 52, Red Lion-street. About the middle of March last the prisoner waited on me—I showed him into my parlour, and he asked to see the accounts of a person named Kemp, with whom I had dealings—I refused at that time—he said he was building 80 houses at Dalston, where he had 120 men at work—he expressed himself fatigued, and said he had been buying a row of houses in the New-road, he was going to have shop fronts put in them, and said he had a freehold in Westmoreland, and a mill—he impressed me with the idea that he was a man of property—he came again the next day—I again showed him into the parlour, and while I was there with him my shopman, Hanson, came to the parlour and spoke to me, in consequence of which I came out of the parlour—the prisoner rose up, and said, as he saw I was busy, he would not detain me, but would take an early opportunity of calling upon me again, and he rose to go away—he went into the shop, as if to leave, and the other defendant, Atkins, was at the counter, where he had given an order—ai White passed into the shop, Atkins took off his hat to him in a very respect<lb></lb>ful manner, and White distantly returned it—in consequence of that I was induced to ask White to step back, and when I got him into the parlour again, I said, "Seeing you know the person in the shop, what do you know of him, as he wants credit"—(that was the result of what my shopman had told me)—White said he knew a little of him, that he had not seen him for some years, but he believed he was a very respectable man—that he had been a tenant of his formerly, and had paid his rent uncommonly well—the pri<lb></lb>soner then went away, and after he had left, Atkins said, "Good God, is not that old White?"—I said, "Yes, his name is White "—Atkins said, "What an extraordinary thing that I should happen to meet him here, I have not seen him before for four years"—he said, "Nobody would take him to be a rich man, by the look of him"—I said he did not appear like that—Atkins said he was one of the richest men in London, and he had got houses all over London—Atkins said that he himself was going to open a grocer's shop at Fulham, and he gave this order (referring to the order he had given to my young man) to stock his shop—I told him, if he wanted credit, he must give some respectable references, or else I should require cash—he mentioned the name of Wilkins, in the City-road—I went, but did not find him, and wrote to Atkins, declining the order—I afterwards saw White again, and mentioned to him that I had declined Atkins's order—White said it was a pity he should go to ruin for such a trifle as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; (which I had told him was the amount), and said he would be guarantee to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; for him—it</p>

               <p>was arranged that a guarantee should be drawn up for White to sign—Atkins's order was made up, and the goods sent to Fulham—White called again the same day, and pulled a letter out of his pocket—he said he had received that letter from his sister that morning, to send her down an order of groceries to Westmoreland, to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had such orders two or three times a-year, and he had been in the habit of dealing with Twinings', but he thought I should serve him as well—I executed that order, and sent it by his direction—after that he gave me another order, for his own use, to the amount of about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I sent that to his own house, in Queen-street—he said he would call the next day, and give me a check for these orders, and sign the guarantee—I had seen the order delivered in Queen-street—I did not see White then, but the order was left—I afterwards went to Queen-street—I did not find White, the great builder, but a man was in possession—I afterwards went to Fulham—I found the shop—it was not closed, but Atkins was not there—I never received one farthing of money—I went with Inspector Penny to the Leaping-bar public-house, to take White—Penny went into the house—while he was in the house White came up, and was going in, but he saw me, and ran away down Old-street, and escaped.</p>

I have not seen him before for three or four years"—he said he was a very large builder, and nearly the richest man in Lon<lb></lb>don; that he was building a great many houses at Queen's-row, Dalston—Mr. Dear told Atkins that he would have no objection to supply him if he could give a reference, and he referred to a man named Wilkins—Wilkins afterwards called, but Mr. Dear declined the order—I saw White there again the following day—he and my master were in conversation—I heard White say he would be bound for Atkins for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, I cannot say which—upon that Mr. Dear ordered me to put up the goods, which I did, and they were sent the following day to Fulham, according to Atkins's order—I delivered them to Hunt, the carman—White called again the day after the goods were sent—he saw Mr. Dear, and I saw an order entered for about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; worth of goods for Mr. White—White came again, and ordered some more goods, to nearly the same amount, to be sent to Queen-street, and said he would call and leave a check on the Saturday morning, when he would sign the guarantee—I never saw him afterwards.</p>

I am a labourer at Ewsley—there is a bridge over the Grand Junction Canal called Ewsley Bridge—I live near that bridge—on the Friday evening that the children were found in the canal, I saw the prisoner near Ewsley Bridge, about half past 6 o'clock—I was on the bridge—the prisoner had two children with her—she was about half way up into the road from the water side, I mean from the towing path—she was coming from the towing path—the towing path comes under the bridge—she was coming from the towing path up into the road—she went down the road on the same side as she came up—that road leads into the Uxbridge road—I did not speak to her then—I saw her again about three minutes afterwards—she came back on the same bridge—both the children were with her—she came back, and asked me if I could tell her where Mr. Turton, the shoemaker, lived, and I told her—he lives in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood, on the Uxbridge-road—she then went as if she was going in the direction for Mr. Turton's that is, away from the canal—I afterwards saw her again on Colham Bridge—that was about half past 7 o'clock—she was then alone—there were no children with her—she was then going down towards Mr. Tollitt's towards Dray ton station—there was some one stand<lb></lb>ing on the bridge with me at that time—the prisoner crossed the bridge—she afterwards came back with a baby in her arms—that was two or three minutes afterwards—I was still on the bridge—she asked me if I was speaking to her—I was speaking to a young woman who was along with me—that young woman answered the prisoner, and said, "No"—nothing else passed—the prisoner crossed the bridge, and went right straight along the Uxbridge-road—I saw her again that evening, in the lane that leads from Ewsley Bridge to the Uxbridge-road, about half way in the lane—I think that was about 8 o'clock—she then had her baby in her arms—she was then coming back into the Uxbridge-road from Ewsley Bridge—I did not see anything more of her after that—I afterwards saw the bodies of the children that evening, lying on the bank of the canal, after they had been pulled out of the water—they were close to Ewaley Bridge—that was close to the place where I had first seen the prisoner with the two children that evening—the bodies of the children were afterwards taken to Mr. Rumble's, at the Anglers' Arms.</p>

               <p>Hillingdon station house. I searched the prisoner when she was brought into that station house on this charge, on Friday, 15th Feb., about a quarter to 10 o'clock—while I was searching her, I said to her, "Oh, dear! oh dear! are you aware what you have been doing of?"—she said, "I am per<lb></lb>fectly aware what I have been doing of"—some time after, in the course of the same evening, the wife of the inspector of police came into the room and she said to me, "I wonder she had not served the other child the same," and the prisoner said, "This one has a father, and the others have not"—I found on her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a pair of scissors, and some letters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector, at Hillingdon. I was at the station house there on Friday night, 15th Feb., when the prisoner wag brought there—I took the charge—before I took the charge, I said to her, "You are charged with a very serious offence, and if you say anything it will be told to the Magistrate"—I then proceeded to take the charge—I asked her her name—she said, "Elisabeth Harris"—I said, "Where do you live?"—she said, "I left the Union this morning"—I said, "Then you have no home?—she said, "I was going to see for a home, and I could not leave my children behind me"—that was all she said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any one present at the time you entered the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Mr. Cousins, and the witness Taylor—when prisoners make a short statement, I always trust to my memory to recollect it, but if it is a long one, I put it in writing—this being a short statement, I trusted to my memory.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 199). I remember the night when the prisoner was brought into custody to Hillingdon station house on this charge—I was on duty there that night—I was in the room where the prisoner was—she addressed an observation to me—I cautioned her—I told her that whatever she said would be repeated again—after that she said she wished I her baby was in heaven too—the infant was not with her at that time, it had been sent to the Union—she said she had no wish to live, she had seen too much trouble lately to have any wish to live—she said, "I hope those letters taken from me will not be shown in Court, they are from the father of my last child; he had no knowledge of what I was going to do with the children; he is at Portsmouth, he has sent for me to go to him, but I could not take the children with me, and I would sooner see them drowned than left in the care of others"—"poor things," she said, "they were both afflicted; I took them down by the canal, and under the bridge; they neither I screamed nor cried, either of them; I left my sister's little girl at Tollitt's, and told her I was going to take the other two children to put them to bed—she then asked me if a person would not sink when in the water—I said I did not know, for I never witnessed a case of the kind—she said, "They</p>

               <p>did not; if they had, they would not have been found; they did not sink when I put them in, but I did not stay to look at them more than a minute"—this was not all given to me as I have stated it now, it was given in different sentences—I did not make a memorandum of it at the time—I made a written statement of it a few days after, and gave it to the inspector—I was in attendance when the Magistrates were taking the examination of the prisoner—I was stationed at the door of the court on duty—I was not examined before the Magistrates—the examination was on the Saturday, the next day—there was only one examination, she was at once committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the examination before the Magistrates held before, or subsequently to, the inquest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Before—I attended at the inquest—I first went into the room in which the prisoner was confined about 10 o'clock at night—Mrs. Smith was in the room when I first went in—I was in and out of the room, I did not stop constantly in the room, for the first half hour; I lighted a fire, and Mrs. Smith stopped with her while I was doing that—half an hour elapsed before Mrs. Smith left the room—no conversation had taken place between me and the prisoner before Mrs. Smith left the room—this statement of the prisoner's was made in different sentences—it was all made within the space of half an hour—some of it was while Mrs. Smith was in the room; that part about the letters, saying she hoped they would not be shown in Court, as they were from the father of her last child, and he had no kriowlege of what she was going to do with the children—that was the commencement of what she said to me—I cautioned her as soon as she commenced speaking—the first thing she said to me was, that she wished her baby was in heaven too—Mrs. Smith was not present then—I cannot say exactly how long Mrs. Smith had been out of the room when the prisoner said that; she was in and out of the room all the early part of the night—I did not tell her that the prisoner had said something to me about wishing her baby in heaven, nor that I had cautioned her as to. what she might say—I did not ask Mrs. Smith to come in and listen to any part of this conversation—I have been in the police force nearly thirteen years, and have been twelve years in that same district—I had known the prisoner for several years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When this poor creature said she wished her baby was in heaven too, did you say to her "You can easily have another"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, nothing of the kind—I did not make any communication to Mrs. Smith during any portion of the night, touching that which the prisoner had communicated to me, nor to any other person during the night—the inspector was not on duty there after 1 o'clock—I was in the room with the prisoner all night, and Mrs. Smith also, from 1 o'clock, or shortly after—the inspector came in just before 1 o'clock—I did not make any statement then to him as to what the prisoner had said to me—I made a statement to the inspector next morning—I repeated to him that which the prisoner had said to me during the night—I attended at the police court that day—I did not offer myself as a witness—it was either on the Monday or Tuesday that I gave the written statement to the inspector—it was the day before the inquest was held.</p>

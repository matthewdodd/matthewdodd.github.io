             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton-garden: On Wednesday, the 2d of May, I heard that the two prisoners at the bar offered two horses for sale in John's Mews, Bedford-row.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the two boys before? - A. Yes, I went to them, and took them into custody; one of the prisoners had hold of one of the horses by the bridle.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the prisoners? - A. Ivory; he had hold of the brown mare, I think it was the brown mare; I did not see Turner with the other horse, his father had locked him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is a mistake that you found the two prisoners with the horses, because you only found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160004"></xptr>one prisoner with the brown mare, and the other locked up? - A. Yes, I did not see Turner till his father unlocked the door; he was let out, and given into my custody and the other officers.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the other horse? - A. They were both in the Mews, the horse and the mare; Ivory had the mare, and the horse was tied up close by the stable-door close by the other; I took them to the Office with the other officers; Ivory said, going down to the Office -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise any thing to him before he said this? - A. I did not; he said, he had been persuaded by Turner to go to Hendon to steal them, the horse and the mare; he said, he rode the horse up to town, they took the mare from off the Common near Hendon, and put the bridle on her in Golder's-green, and brought her up to town to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said this, was Turner near him? - A. No, he was not.</p>

             sworn. - On the 2d instant, I was in company with White and Wood, from an information that we received that two boys were selling two horses in John's Mews, Bedford-row; when we arrived there, the prisoner, Ivory, stood at the head of one of the horses; I then enquired where the other boy was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the horse or the mare that Ivory stood near? - A. I think that Ivory stood at the head of the mare, I am not quite positive, there was a number of people standing about; they said, that Turner's father had secured him, till some officers came, over the stable; I went up stairs, and took him into custody; I brought him down stairs, and took him to the Office, and White went away with Ivory, the other boy, and Wood led the horses down to the Office; then Turner told me there had been another boy riding one of the horses; I asked him what they were riding him for; he said, to sell; there were three horse-dealers looking at them; thinking he might be a witness, I asked him to shew me him, he could not find him; going to the Office, he told me that Ivory and he went to Hendon together with intent to steal lambs, fowls, ducks, geese, or horses, if they could see any; they broke a barn open at Hendon, they stole the horse from the barn, and returning back to town they stole the mare in question off the green from among some others that were there; they charged one another with the same thing backwards and forwards, one laid it to one, and the other laid it to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever offer any of these to sell? - A. From information that I received, they did; the person is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say they had offered the mare to sell? - A. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lilly.) Did you see the mare? - A. Yes, tied up in the stable; it is my mare.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the mare that you had stole? - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mare worth? - A. I gave four pounds for her.</p>

               <p>Turner. My son's master told me he was a good boy to him, and minded his business exceeding well; he told me if I could find him, he would take him back; on Wednesday, the 2d of May, about two o'clock, I catched him on this poney at the bottom of Horn's-alley, Liquorpond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he got it? - A.He said he took the bridle from his master, and this bridle being on the poney, I asked him whose horse it was that he was upon; he made answer, that it belonged to his master; I made him dismount the poney, and hold her by the bridle; I drove him and the horse before me to the Mews; I then said, is there any body here that will run for an officer; immediately a person went, and the officers came in the course of ten minutes.</p>

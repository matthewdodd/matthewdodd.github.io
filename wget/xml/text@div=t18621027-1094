I am clerk to George Seymour and others, shipbrokers, at 116, Fenchurch-street—they were the agents for the barque <hi rend="italic">Ambrosine</hi>—the prisoner came to us on 13th October, and presented this order—I do not think he handed it to me—he brought it to the office—he handed it to one of the clerks at the counter, and it was brought to me at the further end of the office—I paid him the money on the presentation of this order—nothing passed at all—it was for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—when I paid him, he signed his name Richard Cotter, at the bottom, I believe—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "October 13th, 1862, Richard Cotter to Captain Locke, master of the barque <hi rend="italic">Ambro<lb></lb>sine</hi>, lying at the south side of the West India Export Dock, for putting on board two hundred tons of chalk at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per ton; 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Wallace and Edwards, 9, George-yard, shipbrokers—we employed Daniel Buckley to load the <hi rend="italic">Ambrosine</hi> with ballast—we were not shipbrokers for the <hi rend="italic">Ambrosine</hi>—we merely sold the chalk to Messrs. Seymour, Peacock, and Co. and we sent Buckley down to load it—I never saw the prisoner before, till the other day at the Mansion House—he had no authority whatever from us to go to Seymour, Peacock, and Co. to receive money—we never knew anything about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Buckley is the man you employed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—whether Buckley hired the prisoner to do the work, I do not know—we received positive instructions from Seymour Peacock and Co. to send out stevedore down.</p>

I am a stevedore, living at Brown Bear-alley—I was employed to load the <hi rend="italic">Ambrosine</hi> with chalk ballast, on 7th October, by the last witness—I employed the prisoner and six others to put the chalk aboard, and paid them—I gave the prisoner my gear to go down and work—I paid him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for his share—I did not authorize him to go to Seymour and Co. to get payment for the loading of that ballast—I received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from Mr. Griffiths, at Messrs.

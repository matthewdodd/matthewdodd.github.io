                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 63). On Thursday, 14th April, about half-past 1 in the morning, I was on duty, and saw the prisoners in front of Mr. Sherman's shop, who keeps a post-office at 32, Alexander-street, and deals in spirits—Warren was lighting his pipe with a piece of paper—they said something together which I could not hear, and then moved to the letter-box—Warren was about to put a piece of lighted paper in, when Albert said, "What the devil is the use of that? it is not half long enough"—Albert then lit a much longer piece from the piece held by Warren—then they dropped both pieces into the box—I then saw a flame come from the mouth of the letter-box, and the prisoners ran away—as soon as they had passed where I was standing, I jumped over a low wall, and ran down the middle of the road after them—I saw them turn into the gateway at the corner of Alexander-street and Alexander-terrace—immediately I saw them stop, I stopped running, and asked them if they could oblige me with a match—they felt in their pockets, and while so engaged I got close up to them—I laid hold of both of them and said, "I shall take you in custody for throwing lighted paper into a letter-box"—Albert said, "For God's sake do not look me up; I am only an errand. boy"—Warren said, "I was never near the spot"—I took him back to Mr. Sharman's, and rang him up—he opened the door, and we went into the shop—he took out the letter-box, and placed it on the counter—I then saw a number of letters more or less burnt, and on the top of the letters two pieces of paper, one burnt partly, and the other entirely (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched the prisoners, and on Albert I found this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which exactly corresponds with the piece in the letter-box.</p>

I keep the post-office at 32, Alexander-street, West<lb></lb>bourne-park, in the parish of Paddington—I also deal in wines and spirits, which are stored in a cellar just below the letter-box—there were 300 gallons there at that time—on the constable calling me up, I got my key, went to the letter-box, and found that these twenty-one letters had been burned (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the fire was just dying away—I found this newspaper on top of them just mouldering away, and there was a strong smell of smoke in the place.</p>

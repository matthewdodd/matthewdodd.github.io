                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Mr. Nicholson, the official assignee, I have attended to the matter of Avery's bankruptcy—I hare taken charge of the books, and examined the accounts—I have here a duplicate original of the bankrupt's balance sheet; it is from Jan., 1854, to 30th June, 1855—the deficiency at that time was 4419<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bankrupt petitioned for an arrangement, but it was not carried out—the adjudication is dated 30th June, 1855—the balance sheet does not show when he stopped payment—he appears by this to have been deficient on 1st Jan., 1854, to the extent of 2,5861. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the bankrupt either immediately after or before filing this duplicate balance sheet, and asked him several questions as to the purport of the figures in it, and he made a statement—I made a memoran<lb></lb>dum on the back, of the answers that he gave.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What statement did he make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These are the words which I took down: "Commenced business about '45 or '46, in part<lb></lb>nership with John Hooper; had no capital of his own, but borrowed, in conjunction with Hooper, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Hooper's father, which 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was after<lb></lb>wards repaid; this partnership was dissolved about '47 or '48; a rough statement was taken then, showing a large deficiency; this statement was not preserved; the deficiency was nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Mr. Avery took this defi<lb></lb>ciency upon himself, and continued the business, but he has never taken stock since the dissolution, or made a statement of account showing how he stood"—My object in putting that question was to see whether he had made a balance sheet—those are the exact words he said—I took them down from his lips—I do not know what other questions I may have asked, I took no more down—I have examined the defendant's cash book—there were a number of books, ledger, trade book, journal, &amp;c.—I have ex<lb></lb>amined those books (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) to see whether the figures in the balance, sheet were supported by them—the ledger was not written up for nearly two years—this is it—it commences in January, 1854, the time his balance sheet commences, and has been written up since the bankruptcy from sub<lb></lb>sidiary books—the cash book was written up—I believe only the journal, besides the ledger, has been written up since—the contract book appears to be an original book, with daily entries, and is written up fully to the time of the bankruptcy, also the bills of parcels book, and cash book—there are a number of other subsidiary books, of no importance—the cash book ap<lb></lb>pears to have been balanced daily, I think, without exception—it sometimes shows a balance in hand, at other times overpaid—in the month of April, 1855, I should think there were more balances in hand than overpaid—there are a number of entries of exchanged cheques at that time—here is one on 23rd April, "G. Clark; exchange 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and then, on the other side of the cash book, showing the repayment of it on 24th April, is, "G.

               <p>cheques, for I have in some cases found the cheque entered in the banker's I book—I asked the bankrupt about the word "exchange," and he told me that it meant the exchange of cheques—the total amount of such entries in April is 1,840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and in May about 2,070<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not included loans in that—there are entries of loans to the bankrupt—I have not taken out the amount of loans during April and May—on 2nd June the amount in the cash book balances, by bringing to the debit of the cash book the amount overdrawn from the banker's, 405<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the entry is on 31st May—there are other entries on 2nd June, which do not interfere with the balance—on the same day (30th June) there is a previous balance struck of 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. overpaid, and on the same day again another balance is struck of 544<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. overpaid—that represents a deficiency in cash to that extent—there is a balance on 29th May of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find from the books that he sometimes sold goods at a profit, and sometimes at an amount less than the cost—during the three months before his bankruptcy he sold about 200 or 220 parcels of goods, some at a profit, others at a loss—I have here a detail of the goods account, filed by order of the court—the gross profit during the three months is 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is upon transac<lb></lb>tions amounting to 19,363<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no statement showing what the expenses were during that time—the balance sheet is for a year and six months, not for the three months only—about forty parcels of goods out of 220 were sold under the cost price—I cannot tell how soon after the pur<lb></lb>chase those sales were effected, not without tracing them through all the books—he appears in some cases to have bought on credit, and sold for ready money, but I have not traced sufficiently to give instances—the assets returned in the balance sheet as unencumbered, amount to 707<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they have produced up to the present time 365<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—those are the net assets, including the sale of the furniture—there are some debts yet out<lb></lb>standing; we may make more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, in Rufford's-buildings, Islington. About March or April, I purchased thirty bags of Mauritius sugar from the defendant—they were delivered on 1st June—I sent my carman to Mr. Avery <hi rend="italic">far</hi> the warrant; he told me I should have it—I sent for it on two occasions, first on 30th May—I cannot say when I had seen Avery previously, it was some time previous—I had had large dealings with him—he does not owe me any money—I paid him for these sugars before I had the warrant—I have the cheque here by which I paid him; the carman took the cheque at the same time he went for the warrant—the cheque has been paid—21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid, and the balance, 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was paid when I had the warrant.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk to the prisoner between three and four years—I had a sort of general management of the business—I sent this cheque of Messrs. Mayhew and Mann's by one of the clerks—Mr. Avery signed it and I filled it up—I filled it up after he signed it—he did not see it afterwards—he did not know what it was for—I got the warrants upon it—they were two warrants for Mauritius sugar; I handed one of them to the carman of Mr. Charles Barber; not by any person's direction, it was in the usual course of business—Mr. Avery did not know of it—the other war<lb></lb>rant I sent by one of our clerks to Messrs. Rickett and Co.—the prisoner did not know of that to my knowledge—there was a cheque for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Barber; I handed that to Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Avery's solicitor, on the following morning, by Mr. Avery's direction, because he found, I believe, on taking the advice of his solicitor, that it would be advisable to stop pay<lb></lb>ment; that was on 2nd June—I handed this cheque over to the solicitor in the morning of 2nd June (<hi rend="italic">referring to the cash book</hi>)—on 21st April, I received another cheque from Barber and Son for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was brought in to the account, it was paid in to Messrs.

               <p>that Mr. Avery had given Mr. Wagner a cheque dated 2nd June, and one to Messrs.

Avery, payable to Messrs. Trindle and Bingham; it says, "Refer to the drawer"—I recollect this cheque being returned, and its being taken up at the Royal British Bank, that bank not having the privilege of the clearing house—when I sent one of the clerks in the afternoon to pay in some cash at Messrs. Spooners', they told him they had paid in that cheque, I therefore sent the cash to the Bri<lb></lb>tish Bank, and took up the cheque, as I might a bill—that was on 28th May—these two cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced by Mr. Clark</hi>) are for 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 26th May, and 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 28th May—they say "Refer to the drawer"—that means dishonoured; it means that the bankers decline pay<lb></lb>ing—the prisoner has not told me what amount of cheques were dishonoured—he did not tell me that cheques to the amount of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been dis<lb></lb>honoured between 28th May and the morning of 2nd June—he did not tell me any amount, nor mention any cheques—I knew before to<lb></lb>day that these two cheques were dishonoured—I knew it from Mr. Clark, not from Mr. Avery, Mr. Clark came to the counting-house the day they were returned, and told me they had been dishonoured—of course I told Mr. Avery of it, as soon as I saw him—I should say Mr. Clark brought them both at the same time, but I cannot positively recollect—I told Mr. Avery of it at the time, and Mr. Clark saw him—I cannot recollect whether these are the only cheques that I mentioned to Mr. Avery as dishonoured in the course of that week; it is more than twelve months ago—if a cheque was returned, I immediately informed Mr. Avery—I told him of all the cheques that had been returned, as soon as they were returned—I cannot exactly recollect what amount I told him was returned before the 2nd June—I recollect there were two cheques, one to Cook and one to Scott, which I told Mr. Avery of; I think one was for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I drew bank notes for those two amounts, and went and took up the cheques, by permission of Messrs. Spooner, on the morning after we were informed of it; I got the bank notes by an open cheque, that is, an uncrossed cheque, on Messrs. Spooners, which was honoured, and I got the cash—I knew what the state of the banking account was at Messrs. Spooners' at that time—Mr. Avery knew it—the cheque to Scott is dated 28th May, and that to Cook 29th—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say for certain whether I had paid any money in to Messrs. Spooner between the dishonour of these cheques, and the drawing of the open one; I paid some money in to the bankers that day, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Chapman and Son, from Whitehead 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Granger, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., G. Clark, 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have only four amounts down as paid in, making 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not obtained by loans, it was for goods—not goods bought on credit and sold for ready money; it was money arising from sales—the sale to Chapman and Son was fifty-three bags of sugar on the 17th, and this pay<lb></lb>ment was made on the 29th—the other sums were on goods bought pre<lb></lb>viously, and the warrants obtained on the day the cheques were taken up—there were other amounts paid that day, besides those—on 28th May, we bought of Fairey and Co., goods amounting to 278<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were bought at two months' credit—they were sold the same day for 276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say what was done with the money—the money was not received the same day; that parcel of goods was sold to nine different persons—some of the money was received afterwards, and paid in to the official assignee; some of it was paid in to Messrs. Spooners—there was more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Mr. Hewitt—I do not know what Mr. Hewitt paid to the official assignee.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent at the Com<lb></lb>mercial Sale Rooms, Mincing-lane. On 30th May, 1856, the defendant followed me out of the public sale room, and asked me if I could give him any money, any assistance—I told him I had got a country cheque on the Clonmel bank for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked me to give it to him, and be would give me one on his own bank in exchange, explaining that his bank would pass it to his credit as immediate cash—I gave him the cheque—I have not seen it again—I took his cheque for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Henderson, solicitor for the prosecution, proved the service of a notice to produce this cheque; it was not produced</hi>)—I expected the cheque would be paid—I thought it was good for the amount—he told me it would be all right; he sent his clerk with it—it was dishonoured—I have never got my money since—I had had a good many dealings with him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing partner in the firm of Spooner, Attwood, and Co. The prisoner was a customer of ours—he had no autho<lb></lb>rity to overdraw his account without a specific application—743<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was tin largest amount overdrawn in April—he had frequently applied for a loan for some temporary purpose, which we generally granted him; it was mostly for a fortnight—we never took security, but he sometimes brought it, and proposed it—I do not recollect anything particular connected with that 743<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—when he did overdraw to any amount, he always applied for our authority first—at the latter end of May he had overdrawn to the amount of 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that arose in this way: on 17th April we had granted him a loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a fortnight, and as we then found him getting very troublesome, we told him we could not make him any advance after that—I most likely saw him myself; I think there is little doubt of it—I cannot say that I have any distinct recollection of this particular transaction—I am quite sore that I saw him after 17th April; I bad spoken to him about his account—I am quite positive that I told him personally on 17th April that we should not grant him another loan—after that he came to us two or three times, very late in the day, saying that he was very much disappointed, and would we let him have sufficient to meet his cheques, he would pay it in next day certainly—I perceive that on 26th May we let him have 304<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he paid it in next day, and with regard to this 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th May, Mr. Daven<lb></lb>port, my clerk, who kept his account, had several cheques lying by him that day which he was about to return; Mr. Avery came very late in the even<lb></lb>ing, quite at the close of the day, saying that the same thing had occurred to him that day; he was again disappointed; that he could rely on money being paid in the next day, if we would pay his cheques: I was then just on the point of leaving the office, and I told the clerk he might pass his cheques, for he would pay in in the morning—I should certainly not have paid to that amount, but the clerk tells me that I told him to pay them, and did not say to what amount; I did not know the amount at the moment; finding he did not pay it in next day, but only reduced it to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we immediately wrote to him to provide for his cheques—this is the letter—</p>

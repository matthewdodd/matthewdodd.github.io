               <p>in New North-street, Finsbury. A little before five o'clock in the evening of the 24th of April, I was passing down King-street, near London Bridge—I saw the two prisoners, and I think, another, walking close behind Captain Corbyn—Connor put his hand into his pocket—Roberts looked back to see if they were watched—they went on to the corner of Cannon-street—they stood there—the prosecutor went down the street—they ran after him—Connor put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and took out a handkerchief—he turned and went up towards the Mansion-house—Roberts stood looking about, and then went after Connor—I went and told the prosecutor—I then saw the two prisoners in conversation, and told the policeman—they ran after another gentleman, and the officer secured them—the handkerchief was found on Connor, which he said was his own—I found two other handkerchiefs on Roberts.</p>

On the 24th of April I was walking down King William-street, and was accosted by Kennedy—in consequence of what he stated I put my hand into my coat pocket, and missed my handkerchief—this is it—I know it by its being a particular old one, and by its pattern, and being darned—I have bad it many years.</p>

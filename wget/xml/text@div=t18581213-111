                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 336). On 1st December I was in Warner-street, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner by the post—I saw him stop a child about three years old and speak to it—I watched him and saw a piece of coin as I thought in his hand—I approached him—I was in plain clothes, but he knew me and took to his heels—I followed him and stopped him about twenty yards off—he had his two hands in his trousers pockets—I asked him what he had in his hand,"—he said, "Nothing"—I told him to pull his hands out of his pockets; he refused—I threw him down, pulled his hands out of his pockets, and in one hand I found four florins, one loose and three in a paper—I asked him how he came by them—he said first that he picked them up in the street—I asked him where; and he said, "The fact is, they have been given me by a man in the street"—I asked who the man was; he said he did not know—I took him in custody.</p>

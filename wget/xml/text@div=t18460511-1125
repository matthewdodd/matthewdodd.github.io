                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Barking-side, in Essex—Scarborough was my carman—I sent him to town on the 28th of April with a load of straw, he was to take it to the salesman in Whitechapel-market, and bring back the cart with manure in it—I did not supply him with any hay, and he was not entitled to take any—I allowed him to take hay when he went at night, but not in the morning—I saw him start on the 28th of April, and I did not see that he had any hay with him—I afterwards saw a truss of hay at the police-court—I believe it was mine—I could not swear to it, but it was like mine—Scarborough had been fourteen years in my service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ—I saw Scarborough fetch a bundle of hay from the stack that morning—he put it beside the cart and pulled a piece of the hay out and gave it to the horse in the shafts—I did not see what became of the rest.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 381.) I saw Scarborough drive his cart into the yard of the Plough Inn in the Mile-end-road, at a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 28th of April—he had a truss of hay on the fore ladder of his cart, partly covered with horse-cloths—he fed the hones from the nose-bags—Aldridge is ostler there—Scarhorough and him had some conversation—Aldridge then went away—Scarborough took down the hay and placed it against the stable-door—Aldridge then came up—some conversation passed between them, and Aldridge unlocked the stable-door, put the hay in, locked the door again, and came to Scarborough—some more con<lb></lb>versation passed, and Aldridge took something from his pocket, and gave it to Scarborough—I and my brother officer went up and told them we wanted them, on suspicion of stealing that truss of hay—Aldridge said, "I put it in the stable, Scarborough told me to put it there for the horse"—Scarborough said it was his master's hay, and that his master gave it him—Aldridge went into the Plough and beckoned his master—he then tried to get into a door in the back place—he then ran to another door—I told him it would not do, he must come with me.</p>

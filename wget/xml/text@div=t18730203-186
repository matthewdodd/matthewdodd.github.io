               <p>about 6.30 in the morning, I saw Wheeler and Hart standing beside a barrow with a large case upon it—they spoke to each other and separated, Wheeler going across the road into a public-house, and Hart down the street—I got the assistance of three other officers—I saw Wheeler come back from the direction of Moorfields with Cocklin, and point to a barrow—Cooklin then went and wheeled the barrow away towards Finsbury, Wheeler following a distance behind—when they got to Ropemaker Street, Cocklin stopped, and Wheeler then went across to him and spoke to him—with the assistance of Outram, another officer, I took Cooklin into custody; prisoner Wheeler ran away—I took Cooklin to the station, searched him and found upon him a large key, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a purse—Wheeler was brought to the station a few minutes after—at 3 o'clock on the 12th instant I saw Hart, and I identified him as the man I saw in company of Wheeler—he was charged, and in answer he said "About half-past 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon I got my barrow out of the Green Yard, I went over the water with the barrow for some empty cases, and took them to Snelling's &amp; Co., in Hounsditoh, and sold them. I took my barrow afterwards to the Swan, in Upper Thames Street, and there I lost it; that was about 7 o'clock, 7.30, or it might be 6.30"—this is the ticket I found on the case—I took it off and traced the owner through it.</p>

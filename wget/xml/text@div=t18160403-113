               <p>SECOND COUNT. Charging him with uttering the same with the like intent.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HARWOOD. I clean shoes, and run of messages, from No. 6, Cock-pit-alley, Drury-lane. While I was cleaning shoes on the 15th of July, the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I knew any person who went of messages, I told him I did; and he told me to go to Iurnival's-inn with a note, and inquire for one Mrs. Hawkins, at No. 15, 1.c told me she lived up three pair of stairs. I went up two pair of stairs, and there saw Mr. Williams, and afterwards he took me to Hatton Garden before the justice; then we went back to Mr. Williams's chambers, and they gave me a great coat and an umbrella, and Mr. Read and Mr. Williams went with me to a liquor shop in Drury-lane, where the prisoner told me he would wait until I came back; but he was not there.</p>

             JAMES ECCLESTON. I know Mr. Williams's hand-writing. I look at this order, and know that it is not his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>THE COURT. In charging the Jury, told them that the order in question appeared to be addressed to a Mrs. Hankins; when in fact it had not appeared that such a person was in existence.</p>

               <p>The Jury therefore found the prisoner</p>

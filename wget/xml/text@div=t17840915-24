               <p>Who gave you that intelligence? - A window woman said, a person called on such a kind of horse, and had a glass of gin; I then had very strong intelligence from the turnpike men, I went on the road from Reading to Oxford, I heard of her at Hounslow, I got a man to assist me and examine the town, and we came on and got intelligence at several different places; when we came to Smallborough-green, we heard the mare was sold, and the man that sold her was gone back to Hounslow, and inquired for a place to buy him some clothes; upon that we found the prisoner at a little private house at Hounslow, it was in the afternoon, I cannot say the time, he was laying upon the bed, some of his clothes were off and some on; I knew the prisoner before, he worked for me the day before, he had worked for me on and off, for about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Had you discharged him? - Yes, I had, my work was done.</p>
               <p>Did you search him? - No, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Do you know what money he had when he left you? - I cannot say to two or three shillings, I believe he had four shillings, or four and sixpence.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - I paid him, he denied knowing anything about it, but afterwards as we went along in the post-chaise, I asked him for what reason he did it, and he confessed it.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I asked him the price for what he sold it, I said, I heard he sold it for three guineas, he said it was only two; he said, he took it out of the field, and put the bridle and saddle upon it and rode it away; he owned it, before that I asked him, if he did it for real want or no.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would be of service to him? - No, I do not recollect I did, but I believe the other men said the best he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150068"></xptr> could do, would be to own it, if he had sold it, and upon that he said, he had sold it for two guineas; we then came on for town, and we found the mare on Snow-hill, I did not go myself for her, we found her in the possession of one

               <p>On the 25th of August, Mr. Taylor came to me, and informed me he had lost a mare, I directly set out along with him, and found the mare was disposed of at Smallbury-green turnpike; I came there and was informed that the prisoner was returned to Hounslow, I went back and found him upon a bed asleep, I waked him and told him my business, and he acknowledged the taking the mare, bridle, and saddle.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you, before he acknowledged the taking the mare, bridle, and saddle, say any thing to him, to induce him to make that confession? - Not at all, he told me, that as he was coming over the heath, the man that purchased it, asked him if it was to sell, and he said yes, it was, for ten pounds, and that Malone said, let me try her, and if she is a good one, I will give you six guineas for her, and when he came to Hounslow, he said, I will give you but four guineas, you have stole this mare, and when he came to Smallborough-green, he would give him but two guineas, or else he would take him up on suspicion of stealing the mare; he told me all this in the chaise, as we were coming from Hounslow to London; I have been hunting after Malone, but I cannot find him.</p>

               <p>I am an extraordinary constable belonging to Marlborough-street office. On the 28th of April, Sunday night, I was coming down Bow-street, Bloomsbury, one side of the way, and the woman on the other going up, hearing the iron square drop, it was nigh twelve o'clock at night; I just saw the shadow of somebody passing as I was on one side of the way, and she on the other, I did not know what it was till I went over, I picked it up and said, what are you at now? she made me answer directly, says she, I don't know; what is it? it is dropped from the window by somebody or other; I made answer all the people must be in bed at that time of the night; I put my hand on one side of her and I found something hard, but I could not tell what it was till I searched her, and then in searching her I found all the tools I have brought here now; I took them from her and took her to the watch-house; I have kept them ever since.</p>

               <p>I am a coach spring maker; I work for Mr. Taylor and Mr. Richardson; I made this one pair of pincers; I made these two steel plates; I made this iron hammer; I made both these hooks, one is not quite finished.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the square? - I know it belongs to my master; I can swear that I made these things in their employment.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had been at York, should you have known them to be your own work? - I should know them particularly; I should know this hook, the pattern of the hook, and the two plates, the pincers, and the hammer.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Taylor. How far distant is your house from where this woman was found? - I live at <placeName id="t17930529-34-crimeloc183">No. 107, Drury-lane</placeName>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290075"></xptr>Q. Did you then examine to see if they were missing? - The man, the last witness, asked me if I knew where they were? he examined every place, hole and corner, and could not find them; I believe all the other articles to be mine; I cannot swear to them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not made so much observation as the man that made them? - Not so much, but I know them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no money to pay my lodgings, I have been used to sleep on board a ship; I went to sleep on one of the bulks in Covent-garden; I picked up these things on one of the bulks; I took them away with me, thinking they would fetch me a trifle in the morning and going along Drury-lane Mr. Grimes laid hold of me; I have been nine years on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. Whereabouts were these things kept? - In my work shop in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did she get these things from your place? - I really don't know; the door of the shop is kept bolted, and on Monday morning we found it unbolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communications to your work shop exclusive of the dwelling house? - There is a passage through my own house, but that door we generally make a point of shutting at eleven o'clock but that night it might be left open, sometimes it is.</p>

On the 14th of August, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I took a chariot at Shoreditch church stand, to go to Clerkenwell-green; the prisoner rode on the box with the driver - I had seen him many times before about that stand. The coach drove me to <placeName id="t18260914-3-crimeloc14">Chapel-street, Pentonville</placeName>

I directly went to the stand, but could not find him. I did not know the coachman. The watch came out easily, without resistance.</p>

            . I am waterman at the stand, and let Hughes into the coach - the prisoner then got on the box with the coachman. I have known him some years about Shoreditch; he was once a coach-master; he drove off with Alger, the coachman: the order was to drive to Clerkenwell; I cannot say whether the prisoner heard that. Hughes' seals hung out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday morning, the 15th of August, in consequence of what Hughes told me, I went to a house at the back of Shoreditch, and apprehended the prisoner, who was asleep. I said, "I want you for a watch, Jack - you will get into trouble if you don't leave this off;" he was in liquor, and said, "I can't help it, I am pretty well tired of it."</p>

            . The coachman did not ask me for his fare - I do not know the number of it; it drove off when my watch was taken, and was full thirty yards off when I saw it - it drove off at a great rate when the prisoner got on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you in liquor when you got into the coach? A. I had been drinking, but was as sensible as I am now; I had drank about three pints of beer since breakfast - I had very little in the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning after the robbery he came to my apartment, and asked my wife if I was at home, as he wanted to see me particularly; she said if he would leave his message she would tell me when I came in; he said, "Last night I took a coach, and your husband, being continually among the coachmen, might give me intelligence of my watch, which I lost last night - if he can I will leave a sovereign." When I got home I was tired, and went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to ROBERT HUGHES. Q. What did you state at Brown's, the farrier, the morning after the robbery? A. I was in his shop on the morning of the 15th of August - I did not say I was very much in liquor, and did not know whether I lost the watch in the coach, or out of it. I said Norton stripped me of my watch; I did not say I was drunk or in for it, nor that I would leave a sovereign at Bingley's, if I could get information about it; there were two or three persons at Brown's.</p>

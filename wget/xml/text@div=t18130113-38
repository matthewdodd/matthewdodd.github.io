            . I am a butcher. The prisoner had dealt with me for a long period, and after long importuning on his part for a job, I gave him a pair of shoes and boots to mend. The boots, he said, were not worth mending. He said, he could make me a pair of shoes of them, for eight shillings. When the prosecutor came to me, my man was disatisfied with the shoes he made for him. I brought the shoes down, and shewed him them. The prosecutor claimed them. I am sure these are the shoes I had of the prisoner. The prisoner acknowledgd to having stolen them, and wished me to intercede with his master. I told the prisoner the only way for him was, candidly to tell every thing he had done. I have not a doubt both pair are Mr. Hemsley's property.</p>

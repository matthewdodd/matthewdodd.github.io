On the 29th of November he went out about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and returned about half-past eight - I had the officer ready, and gave him in custody; he went with me to search his premises, in Woodstock-street, Bond-street; we found in his box a silver top smelling-bottle, and an instantaneous fire-box; he said he bought that of Mr. Jones, during the first three months of his being with me; and the smelling-bottle he had had before he came into my service - he had been two years and eight months with me.</p>

            . I took the prisoner, and went with him to his lodgings, in Woodstock-street - we found this fire-box, this smelling bottle, and a volume of Fairy Tales.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAY. I know this smelling-bottle to be mine -I took stock in August, and it was then on my premises; it has my mark on the inside of it - this fire-box is mine; it had been injured, and I had that and two others taken out for the purpose of being repaired - this book is mine: I have the fellow volume to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever give the prisoner leave to take that volume to read? A. Never; it has broken my set - this smelling-bottle is empty, and it has my mark on it - we generally rub the marks out when we sell them, and always sell them full - this has never been filled; I know this fire-box by the cap being injured - I only owe the prisoner a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Gray asked me if I was fond of reading - I said Yes, and she lent me that book.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAY. I believe he cannot read well enough to read a book; I paid for his learning to read.</p>

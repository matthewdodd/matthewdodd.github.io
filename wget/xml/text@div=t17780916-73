Madders came and hired a grey mare for a week; he brought it home again the same night about a quarter after twelve; it was beat about the head, and the knees were broke; the head had a swelling on it as big as my knee; he called me and said he had met the gentleman he was going to see who lived a hundred miles off, and therefore he had brought my horse home; when I came down he had left the horse and was gone; I never received any thing for the hire of the horse; nor for the damage they did it.</p>

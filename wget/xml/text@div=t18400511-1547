                  </hi>. I am a sailor belonging to the schooner <hi rend="italic">Sprightly</hi>—I was cook and seaman'—in April last she was coming from St. Michael's to Falmouth—I was at the helm on the night of the 20th of April, and saw the prisoner—he came aft to me when I took the helm at eight o'clock at night, and asked me where I had laid the axe, when I had done chopping wood—I told him I had left it under the windlass—I saw him go forward and take the axe, and stand it in the galley—the captain was on deck at that time, and the prisoner and him entered into conversation till about ten o'clock—that was about two hours—they were talking together the whole time—the captain then went below—I heard what passed—they were talking about the lights on the coast—it was friendly conversation—we were expecting to make the Scilly Lights about three o'clock—the captain and the prisoner went below at the same time, about ten o'clock—the cap<lb></lb>tain returned on deck three or four minutes after, and the prisoner came on deck about ten minutes after the captain—I saw him come up—the cap<lb></lb>tain then went forward, and had not been forward long, before I heard him cry out, "Murder, I am a dead man"—the prisoner had been forward all the time—he had never come aft—I then saw the prisoner come running aft to me with a knife and an axe in his hand—I was at the wheel—he had the axe in both hands, and the knife in his right-hand against the handle of the axe—he said in a low voice if I spoke I was a dead man—I said to him, "Good God, Sam, is it you?"—with that he made a blow at my head with the axe—here is the mark of it on the side of my head—I had a <hi rend="italic">south<lb></lb>wester</hi> on my head, which is a hat covered with canvas—I could not see what part of the axe he struck me with—it cut through the <hi rend="italic">south-wester</hi>—</p>

               <p>I then laid hold of the axe, and he cut away at me with the knife, and cut my hand, and he tried to get at my throat with the knife, but he could not, and he cut me under the eye with it—I then <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out "Murder, murder, for God's sake come up here Mr. Bowles"—that is the mate—he came up, and the prisoner was secured after making a blow at the mate—this is the axe and the knife—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was dark—he says he saw me get the axe, and put it in the galley—now the galley is four feet high, and there was a boat between him and the wheel—it is impossible he could see me put it in the galley unless he left the helm.</p>

                  </hi>. In April last I was mate of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Sprightly</hi>—the prisoner was on board the vessel—he was taken on board at St. Mi<lb></lb>chael's as a prisoner, for desertion from her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Cambridge,</hi> to be delivered up to the first Justice of the Peace, or to any of her Majesty's ships we might meet with. On Monday night, the 20th of April, I heard an alarm between ten and eleven o'clock, as near as I can guess—I was in my bed cabin—I got up, went on deck, and saw the prisoner striking at Combes with the axe—Combes was all over blood—I assisted in securing the prisoner—I went forward after I secured him, and found the forescuttle fastened with a nail—that would keep the men below—this is the knife and the axe—there was one prisoner in the fore part of the vessel, and one man and a boy belonging to the vessel, besides that there was me and Combes and the master, and there was another man on deck at the Captain's watch—there were three people on deck at the time—the other man was forward looking out—he was afraid to come aft in the scuffle—the captain was cut, and his skull broken in—he it not able to be removed at present—Combes was much hurt.</p>

                  </hi>, the younger. I am the son of Mr. Samuel Cart—wright, a dentist, and live in Burlington-street. The prisoner was a sort of confidential servant and butler upwards of eight years—he had fifty guineas a year—he lived in the house in the day time, but slept out, being a married man—my father placed every confidence in him—my father dis<lb></lb>charged him about a fortnight ago—about the 10th of October some articles of plate were missed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I believe this letter to be the prisoner's writing—I received it myself, and caused him to be taken into custody—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>.)</p>

               <p>"18th October, 1838.</p>
               <p>"Sir,—In my present distracted state of mind, I scarcely know how to address you; I can only implore you in my fallen condition to look on me with mercy and compassion. It is not for myself I ask this, but for my dear wife and children; they are at present strangers to my disgrace, and how shall I look upon them when they do become acquainted with it? I have got my account-book, but my mind has been too distracted to com<lb></lb>plete it. I have not tasted food since I left your house, neither have I closed my eyes—I have nothing to look forward to in this world but shame and misery. My home, once peaceful and happy, must for over beareproach to me; and the other branches of my family, although poor, vir<lb></lb>tuous, and respectable, will never again look on me. To pass the rest of my days in slavery and bondage in some foreign clime, would be happiness in comparison with the misery I have to look forward to. You kindly and most humanely interceded with the Government for one unfortunate wretch, and restored him to his country and friends; do interest yourself for another, and get him out of his country in some humble capacity, and the after part of his life shall be worthy of your kind consideration. I must now confess that I have appropriated to my own use six forks, three table spoons, and two dessert spoons—they shall all be restored to-mor<lb></lb>row—I cannot to-day, for I have not the duplicates in my possession—they are sealed up in a packet, in the possession of a friend, and he is from home for the day. I must also give you the most solemn assurance, in the face of my God, that no creature but myself knew anything of this matter, and that I never removed the soup ladle and fish slice, which it seem I was suspected of doing; indeed it was this very circumstance, with King's carelessness (nothing else) that suggested the means of raising money, and saving my furniture from the hands of the broker, who had a man in pos<lb></lb>session. I will make every reparation by confessing everything when I am sufficiently collected to write more; at present my hand trembles, and my mind is bewildered; I can only again express my gratitude for every kind<lb></lb>ness, and subscribe myself, your once faithful, but now disgraceful,</p>

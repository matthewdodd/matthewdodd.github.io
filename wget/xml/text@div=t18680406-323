                  </hi>. I live at 3, Bishop's Road, Davey's Lane, Fulham—the prisoner is husband to my niece—on the evening of 2nd March, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner was in the garden with Thomas Marchant, my nephew—Marchant said to him, "What is it you want, Bill?"—I saw no struggle between them till I saw Pearce fall down—he jumped up again—he had a knife in his hand—Marchant closed on him to take it away, and they both fell—Marchant said he was stabbed—I went up to him, put my hands to his side, and they were covered with blood—I then ran to get assistance—I returned in two minutes with some men, who came and lifted him up—he was still on the ground, and the prisoner on the top of him—I tried to pull him off—in doing that I got under them twice, but by what means I don't know; it was in the struggle to get them apart—as soon as the prisoner got up he ran away—they were both very tipsy—before he went into the garden I heard him say he would have his revenge; he did not say upon whom—he and Marchant had been on good terms previously.</p>

On Sunday evening, 10th July, I was on the Old Shades pier, and saw the prisoner—he had just come off the boat, <hi rend="italic">Moss Rose</hi>—I saw him return to another boat, about an hour and a half afterwards—I next saw him about 7 o'clock in the evening; I was on the top of the landing place, and saw him come off the <hi rend="italic">Moss Rose</hi>—I ran round to the pay place, came up underneath the stage, and saw him put his hand into Esther Foulger's pocket—I ran after her, and asked her if she had lost anything, and then ran after the prisoner—he ran away—I captured him at the halfpenny boat pier, but before that I saw him counting some money on the Iron-boat Wharf—he caught sight of me and ran away—when I caught him I told him I wanted him for robbing a lady—he said he had not robbed anybody, the money he had got was his own—I took him to the Swan pier—he gave me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from his trowsers pocket, and threw this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) down by his side; another party picked it up and gave it to me—there was money in it—this is the money (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a half crown, two sixpences, seven shillings, two pence, and four halfpence—I took him to Bow-lane station, searched him, and found on him this watch key (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—he gave me his name Thompson, 37, Bedfordbury—I went there, and to several other places, but he was not known—his true name is Gardner—I went to his brother afterwards, where he told me he lived, and saw his brother.</p>

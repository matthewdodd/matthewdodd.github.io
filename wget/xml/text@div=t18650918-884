                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of No. 1, Norton Folgate—about half-put six, on the evening of 28th August, I was called to No. 6, Little Pearl-street, Spitalfields—I went to the front room, first floor—the door was fastened, how I do not know—I pushed it open and went in, and found a child lying on the bed—it was apparently about eighteen days old—its face was covered over with a coverlid—it was apparently in a dying state—there was no one else in the room—the only sign of life I saw about it was when I took hold of its hand, there was a slight contraction, of the fingers—it had a night-dress on—I remained in the room from five to ten minutes—when I left it was still alive—I did not leave until I saw the parents, some one went for them—I saw the male prisoner come in; he was the worse for liquor—I asked him if any medical man had been in attendance on the child—he said, "No, not since the day after its birth"—I told him I could not give him a certificate of the cause of death, the child was in a dying state, I could do nothing for it—I heard some one muttering behind me, and he "aid, "I beg your pardon, sir, take no notice; of her, she is the worse for drink"—I supposed it to be his wife, but I did not turn round to look—I then left—on the following afternoon I received an order from the coroner, and on the Wednesday morning, the 30th, I went to the same room about half-past seven o'clock—I there found the same child lying dead; the two prisoners were also in the room and three other children—I desired them to leave while I made the examination—they did so—the male prisoner regained and one of the children, a young child who could take no notice—I then proceeded to make a post-mortem, examination, Mr. Dukes assisted me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186509180054"></xptr>
               <p>—it was very much emaciated—on opening the body I found all the organs in a perfect state of health; the stomach and intestines were perfectly empty—the large intestines were very much contracted, showing that they had been empty for some considerable time; the bladder was also empty—the kidneys were healthy, but imperfectly developed—the mesenteric glands were slightly enlarged—from all I observed my opinion was that the child died from inanition, from want of food—I saw no sign whatever of any disease that would account for death—I should say the child had not received any food for two or three days at least—it was a full-grown child, of the full period—on the 1st of September, that was two days afterwards, I examined the mother's breast, and found the presence of milk in a small quantity—there was sufficient to show that milk bad been present, indications of there having been milk previously—if a child is not suckled the milk will disappear—there are other sorts of food that might be administered to a child of that age—I found no disease about the woman, or anything to prevent her suckling the child—the weight of a full-grown child of that age, healthy and properly nourished, would be from nine to ten pounds—I weighed this child by order of the coroner, and it weighed exactly three pounds, with its night-dress—there were no marks of violence upon it of any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of a room was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A large, airy room with two windows—there was not much furniture; it presented an appearance of poverty, not very great poverty; not more than is usual in the neighbourhood; it is a poor neighbourhood—when I first went into the room there was a thin coverlid over the child's face—that would not affect life in any way—I did not take the child up in my arms, I merely examined it—I touched its hand and it moved—I was there two or three minutes examining it, sufficient to satisfy me—I took no steps to prolong its life, because it was impossible in my opinion to have done so—I left it there—there were several other persons in the room besides the prisoners when I left, several came in—I thought it impossible it could recover—I took no steps to save its life, because it was just dead; as nearly dead as possible; no power whatever could have restored it—the movement of its hand was the only sign of life—I give it as my opinion that no food had been given to the child for two or three days—if it had a small quantity of food and thrown it up again, that would account for none being found in the stomach; from my examination I should say none had passed into the stomach; I do not say none had been given—there was not the slightest evidence of any having been there—a child in a weakly state would be likely to throw up food, if it disagreed with him—it is a fact that some weakly children refuse the breast—other food would then have to be supplied—farinaceous food would have to be supplied—there are a variety of preparations, corn flour and other things—they require to be carefully prepared.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But to make arrowroot even, requires some care and skill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It requires a little care, it does not require skill—it does not always follow that a child, born of parents who are given to drink, would be weakly, nor generally; it does occasionally—in all probability, if the parent was an habitual drinker of gin, it would make the child more weakly than it otherwise would be—the average weight of a child of that age, would be about nine or ten pounds—this child was eighteen days old—some healthy days old—some healthy</p>

               <p>children weigh less and some a great deal more—I have never, myself, weighed a child of that age and found it less—I did not attend the mother when the child was bora, nor see it before at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the kidneys were imperfectly developed, was that from disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the kidneys are very often imperfectly developed in a child of that age—Rawley came for me—I can't say how the room door was fastened—I did not break it open, I merely put my hand and pushed it open—if a child is examined very shortly after it has taken food, and thrown it up again, you would find some traces of it; it is never all entirely thrown up—I think I should find traces of it four or five hours afterwards—the child is said to have died at 10 o'clock, that same evening—the covering over its face was just carelessly thrown on, as it is generally put over little children that are dead—it was laid in bed, with its head on the pillow, and the clothes just put over it, as you will generally find when babies are put to bed; not in a careless, negligent way, as if they did not care what became of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Seeing that the child lived three hours and a half after you saw it, do you not think, if some food or stimulant had been given to it, it might have recovered or revived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there no modes of introducing food into the system, although the child may not be strong enough to suckle? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tea, there are modes, but when a child is in articulo mortis, nothing can be done for it—at the time I saw this child, there was nothing that could have been done for it to restore it—it was, in my opinion, an utterly hopeless case—it was clean, kept as a child of that age should be—when I say traces of food would be found five or six hours afterwards, that is only an opinion—I have not made a great many post-mortem examinations; I have made many where there has been no occasion to look to that—the milk of an habitual drunkard might produce irritation and so cause the stomach to reject it—it would be very bad milk to sustain and nourish a child—many children die from the corrupt and vitiated milk of drunken mothers—from what I saw of the child it must have been much too weak to extract milk from the breast, for some few days—it was weaker than most children are that are just born.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 182, Brick-lane, Spitalfields—on Wednesday, 30th August, I assisted Mr. Allenson in making the post mortem examination—I should say it was a full period child—it was very emaciated—there were no external marks of violence—there were marks of fleas all over it—internally all the organs were healthy; there was some little malformation about the kidneys—I should say the child died from ex<lb></lb>haustion from want of food—there was no trace of any about the stomach or intestines—the intestines were also very much contracted, showing the absence and want of food—I think it had been without food some days—I saw nothing in the appearance of any of the organs to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you think it possible, that to an inexperienced eye, the child might, through weakness, present the appearance of being dead, some hours before it really was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I should think so—I have seen some children in so very low a state, as to be to all appearance dead for some hours before death—there was no trace of food at all—if it rejected food there would be very little trace of it—the intestines being contracted in the way they were, led me to believe that the child had been without food some days—I mean that no food had passed into the intestines—I can't say it had not received food on the day it died—I can only say none</p>

               <p>had passed into the intestines—a weakly child will constantly throw up its food—if unable to take the breast, and other food be administered, it will very often throw it up, but with experienced attendance that can generally be alleviated and relieved—I think, as a medical man, I could relieve it—the malformation of the kidneys had nothing whatever to do with the state of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the ordinary course of things, the mother's milk and nothing else, would be food enough for a child of that age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite sufficient; the best food it could have—it might be so vitiated by habitual drunkenness, that the child would derive no nourishment from it, and regularly throw a great quantity of it up—in all probability the child was born weakly, the mother being given to drink, and it would be supplied with the worst possible milk for its growth and strength—if milk is thrown up you can generally trace it within two or three hours—you might, or might not, trace it within six hours; I think it is doubtful; it would depend a good deal on the quality of the milk—as a rule it would leave some slight trace—I can't form an opinion, as to how many days it had been without food.</p>

I live at 6, Little Pearl-street—the prisoners have lived there for about eight or nine months—they had One room on the first floor—the man is a shoemaker—I don't know that the female does anything—I remember the baby being born—Mr. Stack came to me that morning, and asked me to come up, and I was of there for about half am hour—I saw the baby born, and covered it over till the nurse came—I did not go Up again afterwards, until the day it was reported dead—that was on Monday, 28th August—my little girl Catherine came down, and said, "Baby an't dead mother"—I went up to look and-found it alive—I asked my husband to come up, and he went for the doctor—the child looked very weak, but was alive—while my husband was gone for the doctor, Mrs. Stack tame to my window—I said, "Mrs. Stack, the baby ain't dead"—she rather took angry, and I went indoors—I did not understand what she said—she does not speak very plain, but she snapped at me like—she had bed something to drink—she was not very drunk—I am always at work—I have seen Mr. Stack pass in and out many times, but I have not met Mrs. Stack more than a time or two—she was sober then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many rooms are there in this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About sixteen—in some rooms there are more than one family living—the house was rather in a crowded condition at that time—I could not say how many persons were living there; there was a very large number—I heard that there were a few cases of fever round the corner; it it rather an unhealthy neighbourhood; the people in the house all seemed healthy—I think it Was about an hour after I saw the baby that the doctor came—I did not stay in the room all that time; we went down—the door was fastended after We went down—I stood by when the baby was born, but I gave no assistance in delivering the woman—I only covered the baby over until the woman came; a Mrs. Aldridge, who lived in the next room, released it, and tied the cord—she is not here.</p>

I am married, and live at 27 1/2, Great Pearl-street—I know the prisoners—I think they are Irish—I remember the child being born—the male prisoner asked me to come to his house and see his wife, as the child had come unexpectedly, he did not think she would be confined until coming on Christmas—I went and found Mrs. Stack in bed, with the baby in her arms—I stayed with her very nearly an hour—Mr. Stack was there at the time—the female said, "The little baby has nothing to put on it, only the other child's things," and Mr. Stack and I went down to the workhouse and got a petticoat, a shirt, and a frock for the baby, also some arrowroot and sugar, and gruel and meal—I saw Mrs. Stack again once or twice, and I saw her once suckling the baby—I think that was about four or five days before I heard it was dying—I saw her on the Monday on which the baby died, from 12 to 1 o'clock in the morning, I think it was—I went there to see how the baby was—she was not sober then nor yet drank—the baby was alive at that time; she had it in her arms—she gave it the breast, and the baby shut its month against it—I think it was convulsed—there was a little foaming at the mouth—Mrs. Stack's little boy was crying at the time—it was a sickly child, and she put the baby into the bed to take the other child—that is a child of about four years old—I took the baby up in my arms, and sat with it next the fire, and I said, "I think Mrs. Stack the little baby is dying"—I saw a rattle come up in its throat—Mr. Stack said. "The child has been convulsed since 6 o'clock in the morning"—I then went home with my husband—we went to have a pint of beer first—the prisoners were then at home—I said to my husband, "There</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The statements of the prisoners before the magistrate were read as follow: Edward Stack says</hi>, "It is the first time I have ever been in a court or prison in my life. I left the mother indoors in charge of the child, when I went to have a glass of ale with a party. I did not think I was in duty bound to take care of the child at all, being so young." <hi rend="italic">Honora Stack says</hi>, "When the child first was born, he never cared about drink<lb></lb>ing from the breast I put it in his mouth, and he would give one such, and leave it out of his mouth again; the nurse or the doctor never ordered me any castor-oil for the child. I gave it castor-oil; a tea-spoon full at a time, as far as it wanted. Likewise I used to give it a little drop of my own gruel at night, and then I got a little biscuit in boiling water, milk, and sugar, beat them up very fine, and give it to him, and then the nurse told me it was a seven-month child, and she never came to see the child. She said she would send the doctor. The doctor came on the Friday, found me in the bed, and he said, 'That little child will not live; it is over a seven-month child; between seven and eight months;' then the nurse never came till the Sunday to look after the child, and I told the doctor I had to wash it myself as the nurse did not come. The doctor said,' It is too soon for you to put your hands in water.' I told the doctor I did not open the child at all, but washed its legs down, to keep its legs clean till the nurse came. I tried as well as I could, and every day I went out I washed the child and cleaned him, and did not open him at all. I went out for my husband for fear of his taking a drop to drink too much. The child she some victuals on the Sunday morning, and then the Sunday evening he did not take anything, only drink. On the Monday he closed his lips entirely against drinking or taking anything from me."</p>

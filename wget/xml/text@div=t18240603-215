I told him I had a search-warrant; he asked for what; I told him some brass cocks; his wife said she would produce them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Why do you call this a marine store shop - A. Because they sell those things. I believe he is chiefly at work, and his wife minds the shop; I do not know that there are persons who go about the streets with these brass articles to sell for sixpence a-piece.</p>

They were discovered on the 20th of May; I had seen them all eight or ten days before, except one lock, which I had four days before; I had been missing things from the window continually; I locked it up, and put the key in a private part of the shop, and told

            . I live with Messrs. Tozer, and am their errand-boy - I know the prisoner; I took an old cock to his shop about a month or five weeks ago, and a day or two afterwards I took seven new ones; I took them from the glass window of the shop in Drury-lane - I opened it with the key, which hung on a nail - I sometimes found the prisoner in the shop, and sometimes a woman; he was sometimes filing in the shop - when I first took this old cock he stood in the shop - he did say any thing, but looked at it - the woman bought it - I found him at home when I took some of the new ones - I took them one or two at a time from the glass-case; when I found the prisoner at home he did not say any thing; but when I asked 1 s. for them he said 6 d. was plenty - his wife gave me 6 d. a-piece; they never asked who I came from; I saw the man about four times; I sold the tea-tray for three halfpence.</p>

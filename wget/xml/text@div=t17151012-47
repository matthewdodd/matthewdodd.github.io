Clifton swore he went into the Prisoner's House to drink a Dish of Coffee, and in a little time the Prisoner came in, who kept the House, sate down by him, and ask'd him if he would drink any Brandy; to which he consented, and drank 3 Quarterns , and paid for 'em; after which she ask'd him to go up Stairs, where he drank 6 or 7 more, and then fell asleep upon the Bed; but in half an Hour's time she wak'd him, and he call'd for more Brandy, but feeling in his Pocket, he found all his Silver, about 21 s. gone , and the Guineas mention'd in the Indictment taken out of his Fobb: Upon this he told the Prisoner she had rob'd him, who denied it; but bid him go down along with her, and she would make him easy; which he did, and afterwards the Prisoner, and her Maid went out, and he follow'd them, but being very near sighted , he lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171510120005"></xptr> them, and return'd to the House, where he found the Prisoner, who told him he was drunk, and had never been there. Upon this he was ask'd if he could be sure the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person that took away his Money; and thereupon going close to the Bar, he look'd her in the Face about a Minute before he answer'd she was the same Person. The Prisoner, in her Defence, deny'd his drinking in her House at all; but said he came into it very drunk with a Woman, and ask'd for a private Room; and she not having any Mind to oblige him, turn'd him out; and some time after, he came again, and said she pickt his Pocket. Her Maid confirm'd the same, and the Constable swore, the Prisoner's House was of no ill Repute as he knew of; tho' he was a Neighbour.

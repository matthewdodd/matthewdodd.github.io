                  </hi>. I live in Fox-court, City-road. On Monday evening, 25th Sept., I was returning from work—I was passing Richmond-road—I saw the prisoner and another man—I was behind them, walking towards Copenhagen-street—I heard the other man say to the prisoner, "Let this one go past; he is an Irishman, let him go past"—the prisoner said, "No, I shall see whether he is an Irishman or not—he asked me whether I was an Irishman—I told him I wanted to go home—he said he should make me say whether I was an Irishman, and with that he struck me a violent blow in the mouth with his fist—I told him I should give him into custody—he said he should give me something to give him in charge for, and he struck me another blow, and ran away down Payne-street—I followed him—he ran into a house—I placed myself in a position opposite the house—I said I should wait till he came out—I saw him again; he ran out of the house with a knife in his hand, and as he came out he said, "You b—r, I shall give you something to give me in charge for",—he ran across the road to me, and as he ran towards me the knife was raised in his right hand—I put up my hand, and he ran with it against me, and the knife cut me in the thumb ball of the left hand; and he struck me at the same time with his fist in my breast, and knocked me down—when he had the knife raised, he came up to me on the run-my thumb bled very much, too much for me—the prisoner then ran into another house—I believe it was No. 34, Payne-street—I placed myself opposite, and in about ten minutes I saw him come out, and saw him come down the steps with a woman—he had not the same dress on that he had when he went into the house—when he went in he had a jacket, and when he came out he had a white smock frock—I followed him till I saw a policeman, and I gave him information—the prisoner saw me speak to the policeman, and ran away—I saw him taken into custody—my thumb was dressed by a surgeon—the prisoner is the same man who came out with the frock, and the same man who struck me with the knife—I am sure of it—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock; near upon 7—it was just dusk—there was plenty of light to see who it was—the prisoner was three parts drank—they were lighting the lamps.</p>

I saw the prosecutor—as near as I can say it was from 5 to 10 minutes past 5 o'clock in the evening, when he gave me some information—he pointed to somebody, and I looked in that direction—the person to whom he pointed ran away as soon as he saw him speak to me—I pursued and took him—it was the pri<lb></lb>soner—the prosecutor was quite sober—the prisoner had been drinking—I know Payne-street; it is inhabited by both Irish and English—I told the prisoner the charge; he said he knew nothing about it, he had never seen the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

E. Davis" on the back of it; I wrote that to indentify it as the cheque I had received from the prisoner; I always do it the moment I receive it; I will not say I did it in his presence, but it must have been before he left the office; the cheque was sent to Gosling's, the bankers of our establishment; it was returned from Gosling's on the following day dishonoured (looking at a cheque,) this is the cheque - it was my endorsement on it; John James Lawson is one of the firm of the office; there are others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLHUS. Q. Your's is an office of great business? A. It is - my department is the publishing, which is separate from where the public came; we have one other customer named Davis; I am certain the prisoner is the person who gave me the cheque, and that he said he came from Davis - by W. E. I mean West-end Davis, to distinguish him from the other, who lives in the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are the Christian names of the other Mr. Davis? A. We do not know their Christian names - they go with us by the names of West-end and City Davis; I know the prisoner acted for the West-end Davis - he came regularly from him, and took a very different quantity of papers to the other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you the books of the firm here? A. No; my knowledge is derived from those books, there is no other criterion - but I have not only to examine the various accounts, but to go through every account, and if there is any default, I report it to my employers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does your knowledge merely arise from the inspection of the books, or from your knowledge of the business of the house? A. From the ledgers; I generally go through the accounts every evening, and my habit of checking the accounts enables me to say no such customer was authorised to draw on the house on the 26th of August.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am a newspaper-agent, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles': the prisoner was in my employ. I have purchesed newspapers from the Times for these nine years, to the amount of 75l. a week; I always sent down a cheque on the Monday morning for the week's papers in advance; I send it by different boys, sometimes by the prisoner, and sometimes by others; I did not owe them a halfpenny on the 25th of August - not to my knowledge: the prisoner lived three years and three quarters with me - I am well acquainted with his hand-writing (looking at the cheque) - I will swear this is the hand-writing of the prisoner - I am confident the whole of the cheque is in his writing; but this on the back, and W. E. Davis is not his.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of August had you sent him to the Times office? A. I saw him on the Sunday, and his business was to go to fetch the papers without further orders; he comes every morning at six o'clock - I saw him on Monday, he brought the papers; I did not see him on the Tuesday, nor afterwards, till he was apprehended on my offering a reward of twenty guineas; he left me on the 25th of August, at nine o'clock in the evening - I did not see him again till the 8th of September, when he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see this cheque? A. On the Wednesday morning - Street sent me up a memorandum, and I saw the cheque - I had never seen it before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you so well acquainted with the prisoner's hand-writing, that you can swear the cheque is his? A. I am; it is disguised from what he generally writes; but I am confident it is his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In paying for your papers, would you deliver to the person who went for you a cheque on your own banker's? A. Yes; Messrs. Praeds, of Temple-bar, are my bankers - I never sent the Times a cheque on any body but my own banker's, as the amount was so much; I have no customer named Taylor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Overwhelmed with despair at the awful situation in which I am placed, and being called upon to say something in my defence, I will not trespass long upon your time but in as brief a manner as I can, will state the facts of how I came in possession of the cheque. My Lord, I stand before you for having forged a cheque, and afterwards uttering it, knowing it to be forged; I declare most solemnly that I am entirely innocent of either the one or the other. On Saturday, previous to the presentation of the bill, I was at a gambling-house near Temple-bar; by appointment I was to meet a person there on business: a young man, of a most gentlemanly appearance, took a pocket-book from his pocket - he opened it before me, it contained various papers - I saw him drop one; he having left the room, I picked it up unperceived by any one - on opening it, I found it to be a cheque for 64l. 10s.; I rejoiced at my seeming good fortune - put it in my pocket, and left the house; being embarrassed in my affairs, and not hearing any thing respecting the loss of the cheque, on the Monday following, I presented it to one Mr. Street, offering to pay him what I was indebted to him; Mr. Street took it, deducting his account, and gave me the balance. My Lord, in regard to my absconding, I answer, that knowing I had become possessed of the cheque in a clandestine manner, having received the balance from Mr. Street, who knew me well, and being convinced that should Mr. Street call upon me for the money which he had given me, I should not be able to reimburse him, I left the service of the best of masters. My Lord and Gentlemen, - I have been in the service of my prosecutor for the last four years; I call God to witness, at whose tribunal I must one day render an account, that I have never injured him in any one instance, but have in every thing served him faithfully, which my prosecutor will not deny. My Lord and Gentlemen, I have a wife and three helpless infants, destitute of bread, in consequence of my long confinement - and aged parents forlorn and distracted for my disgraceful and awful situation, trembling for the result. My Lord and Gentlemen, I have stated the whole truth of my unfortunate case; should you after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230046"></xptr>the above facts deem me guilty of the charge, I leave my life and all my future prospects in your hands, feeling assured, that whatever may be the decision against me, it will be given with due deliberation; and should the utmost penalty of the law be awarded me, I shall still be able to say with my last breath - I am innocent.</p>

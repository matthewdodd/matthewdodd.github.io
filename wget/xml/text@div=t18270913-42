            . I am a watchman of Cripplegate-within - my heat extends within two doors of Honey-lane-market. On the 1st of August, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, as I was standing on my duty, I heard a call of Stop thief! from Russia-row. I had not seen either the prisoner or the prosecutor - I then saw the prisoner run from Russia-row to Honey-lane-market; I am positive he was running; he might be about twenty-five yards from me, when I first saw him - I saw he was coming towards me and concealed myself in a door-way; when he got within two yards of me I ran out and seized him; he made a blow at me; I lowered my head, avoided the blow, and secured him; while he was struggling with me, he put his hand into his waistcoat or breeches pocket, and threw something into the middle of the road; I heard it fall and saw it go from his hand; I drew him to the place immediately, and picked it up; it was a watch, without any appendages. I took him to the watch-house, which is in Aldermanbury, about one hundred yards off; the prosecutor came to the watch-house about ten minutes after; his face was very much cut, and bleeding very much; so much so, that he could not speak plain, for the blood which flowed from his mouth; I showed him the watch - he said it was his - I asked what he knew it by - he said I could not open it with my finger only; I tried and could not - he said "Now, if you will take the point of a knife and try, it will open;" and it did so - he gave the same account of the transaction as he has now, and produced the ribbon, seal, and key, which he said belonged to the watch - the prisoner said nothing.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live at No. 139, London-wall. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; the prosecutor came in in a few minutes - his face was very bloody and was cut; his nose was cut across, and he had two black eyes; he gave the same account of the transaction as he has now; the watch was produced, he owned it by the number, and explained how it would open, as the watchman has stated; there was no seal or ribbon to it; he produced the seal, ribbon, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130049"></xptr>key, belonging to it: he had them in his hand.

            . This is my watch; the number is 5566. I cannot say whether I gave the number at the watch-house. I am certain I never looked to see the number; I have no doubt of it being mine. I bought it of Mr. Mills, Ludgatehill, eighteen months ago; and, in consequence of an accident, it will not open without a knife; the steel ring broke with my laying hold of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Cow-cross about half-past ten o'clock that night, and a lady asked me to carry a parcel for her to the Bull's-head Inn, Whitechapel - she gave me 1s. for my trouble; and as I returned I heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw three or four men run down the street; the watchman tried to stop two, but they passed him; I run behind and he laid hold of me. I was then taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>GEORGE MILLION. I am a Police-officer. On the morning of Wednesday, the 8th of February, I stopped the prisoner in Wilderness-row, carrying three deal boards; I asked where he got them - he said of Mr. King, in Henry-street, Back-road, Islington, one hour before; I took him to Bunhill-row station - I went to look for Mr. King, and no such person lived there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I had them of a Mr. King - he locked me in the station, and was not gone more than three quarters of an hour, and then he said he could not find him. Witness. I went to a Mr. King - he looked at the boards, and said they were not his; on the Friday I found Mr. Kewer, and he owned them.</p>

The boards are mine; I had not sold them- I had seen them safe in the morning of the 7th of February, before a house of mine in <placeName id="t18320216-260-crimeloc1478">Sackville-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to plain deal boards? A. They have been planed for a length of time, turned upside down, and used for scaffolding - I lost twelve of them from the same stack, and five on the Wednesday evening; they are the same length as mine, and have some cement on them - I have not a doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them of a young man named King for 8s. - I went up the Back-road, Islington, and we had some gin; I parted with him, and then, in mistake, I went straight on, instead of turning - when I got to St. John-square the officer stopped me.</p>

If the prisoner sold any articles it was his duty to account for the payment of them in a book which he took out - he took out this cheese on the 2d of February - he did not account for the money, but booked it to a credit-customer, Haslen, of Enfield; I had an order from Haslen's for cheese and butter; when I went down, I found they had not had the cheese.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You gave instructions to a constable to take this may up? A. Yes; I did send him word to keep out of the way till the morning, but not in hopes he would abscond - it was as much for my own convenience as his; if I had wanted to have arrested him I could have done it long before - my wife received his money but she is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this cheese destined for Mr. Haslen? A. No; he took out three or four - his money was to be handed in every night; it was about a week after that I found this out.</p>

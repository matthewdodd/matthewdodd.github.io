I met the prisoner on the 28th of March, in Walnut Tree-walk - he had got one of these pieces of lead on his shoulder, and the other piece behind him, in a bag - I told him I thought he had been stealing some lead - he said No, it was some old lead which a man had given him to carry, as his donkey-cart was not able to carry it; I peeped through the bag, and saw it was new lead - I then detained him.</p>

There are a great many houses building by Lord Kensington; I believe this to be the lead which came off the buildings, but I cannot swear to it - I missed seven pieces; the prisoner had worked there last year; he has worked on the adjoining premises - I missed lead of this description from the gutters - it was not fixed down at all.</p>

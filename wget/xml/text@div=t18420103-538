                  </hi>. I keep a broker's-shop in Gray's Inn-lane. On the morning of the 1st of January, a few minutes before nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner in front of my shop, which is open—he stood about half a minute, and then snatched a pair of pistols from a table inside the shop, and ran down Gray's Inn-lane—I followed, and lost sight of him for half a minute—he turned down Holborn into Brooke-street—I hallooed, "Stop thief" there—he immediately dropped something from under his coat, and got into White Hart-yard, which leads into Bell-court—two courts lead out of that, in different directions, into Gray's Inn-lane—he turned into Pheasant-court—a neighbour pointed to me to go into Pheasant-court, and I found the prisoner in the privy of a house there, in the back-yard—I am positive he is the person—his breeches were down in the privy—he seemed much agitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When he came into the water-closet he said, "Give me the pistols you stole from my shop"—I said, "I know nothing of it"—he said, "You have got them," and made me get up—he said, "I am pretty near certain it is you"—he looked about, and could not find them, and presently a boy brought them to him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said, "Halloa, I have got you now; what have you done with my pistols?" but I had seen him drop them in Brooke-street, as I thought; I know he dropped something.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the witness White with the pistols in his hand—I went through Fox-court—the prosecutor beckoned to me in Pheasant-court, where I found the prisoner.</p>

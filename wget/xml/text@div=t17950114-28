             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the pawnbroker; the prisoner pledged the gown with me on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before? - Not that I know of. I am sure it was her; she pawned it in the name of Ann Ponrey, for half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you know the prisoner before? - Never saw her before with my eyes, till I apprehended her in Carnaby-market. I have got a poor wife that is blind and cannot come, and got two fatherless children. The gown was hung on the nail of the mantle piece wet, and here is a bit that was left on the nail, when it was snatched off, that matches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at Westminster, No. 21, Charles-street, when he lost his property; at Mr. Jacques's. I went to receive my week's wages, and I was there about nine o'clock at night, at Mr. Jacques's, that I can take my oath of, and coming home I felt something under my feet and did not know what it was, and went back and picked it up, and it was this gown; (I never saw the man in my life, nor know where he lives) and I went and pawned it on Monday, for half a crown, and I never saw the man nor he never saw me before in his life; I don't know where his apartments are.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you find any other of the property? - Yes, a half shawl on her neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The shawl was put about the gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the shawl was left? - It was not on the gown, it was on another line.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I offered him two guineas to make it up at the justice's, and he would not take it.</p>
               <p>Court. He was very right not to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder living in the Woolwich-road, Charlton, and am in the employment of Mr. Nicholls—on Saturday night, 29th January, about 8 o'clock, I was coming home from my master's—I had just received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a sovereign, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay the wages of four boys and a man besides myself—I had it in my purse in my pocket—I had got about twenty yards from my master's door, when I was accosted by the prisoners—the woman rubbed me up, and said "Old gentleman, do you want a woman to-night"—I said no I did not—she thrust her hand into my pocket and took out my purse and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I called out, "This woman has robbed me of my purse and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I was directly knocked to the ground by two persons—I do not know whether I was struck with any weapon—I think it was a fist caught me in the eye—I do not know what it was caught me at the back of the head—I bled in consequence of the blow, and the blood ran down my cheek—The witness Anderson came to my assistance—he took my stick and went up the road after the parties, and I followed him—shortly afterwards I saw him with the prisoners—I knew them directly—I said, "Have you got them, Mr. Anderson?"—he said, "Yes"—I said. "That is them; that is the woman that robbed me of my money"—they made no reply—I do not know how near the man was to the woman at the time she robbed me, it was not very far. it was all done in such a little time—when they came up they were walking together side-by-side—he did not stop while she was putting her hand into my pocket, he walked on—the man afterwards said that the female was his lawful wife—next morning I found my purse in the middle of the road with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in it.</p>

Anti-Gallican public-house that Anderson stopped them—I did not hear the landlady of the public-house say, that the female prisoner was a respectable woman, and she did not believe she would do such a thing—they did not appear to be known at the public-house—I said they were the persons directly I got up to them—it was right under a lamp-post.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Charlton—I was going along the high road about a quarter to 8 on the night in question, and saw the prisoners running in the direction of Greenwich—I heard the male prisoner say to the female, "Come on, make haste"—I turned round and looked at them—I afterwards heard Mr. Hobbs call out, "That woman has robbed me of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I saw the blood streaming down his face—I waited till he came up to me—I then took his stick from him and ran in pursuit of them—I ran about a quarter of a mile on the road before I came up to them—I knew them when I came up to them again—I walked a few steps in advance until I came to a good light near the Roupel Arms, and there I got in front of them and stopped them—I asked if they had seen an old gentleman—they replied, "No"—I said, "You have; he has been robbed of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—the male prisoner said, "We know nothing about it, what the devil business have you to stop us on the high road, we are travellers"—I put myself in a defensive position, and said, "You shall stop until the old gentleman comes up"—he came up in about six or seven minutes—I kept them there until he came—he immediately recognized the woman and said, "That is the woman that robbed me"—he caught hold of her arm and held her—at the same time I ran into the public-house and fetched two or three parties, and they were taken into the public-house, and then I went and fetched a policeman.</p>

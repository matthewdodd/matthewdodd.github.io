                  </hi>. I live in Rochester-row, St. John's, West<lb></lb>minster—on Saturday night, the 14th March, about eleven o'clock, I was at supper in a room adjoining my shop—I heard a noise in the shop, went out, and saw the prisoner crossing the road, from the shop, towards Allen-street, with the looking-glass in his hand—I missed a glass, and went after him—I had seen the glass safe from a quarter to half an hour before—I pursued the prisoner along Vincent-square and Alfred-street—I kept him in sight till we got into the Vauxhall-road, and in turning the corner I missed him—there was nobody in the street—I turned round and saw him in the door-way of a house in Alfred-street, and secured him—he said, "Oh don't, pray don't," or words to that effect—I found the glass produced in a butcher's shop at the corner of Alfred-street—it is mine, and the one he was going away with.</p>

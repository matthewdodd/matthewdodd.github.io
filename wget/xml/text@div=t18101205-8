               <p>Q. When did you lose these rivets - A. On Monday the 5th of November they were taken out of the factory by the prisoner, he had the rivets about him when I saw him; from information I came to the prisoner, I found him laying on his face upon the ground, the constable was sent for, and before the constable arrived the prisoner dropped some rivets from his bosom. When the constable came the prisoner took some more from his bosom, and put them on the ground. The constable took him to his house, and before he came back with the constable he dropped a false key that unlocked our warehouse door.</p>

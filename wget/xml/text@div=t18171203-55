               <p>WILLIAM WINKFIELD. I keep the Long-acre Vine Vaults, in Long-acre, in the county of Middlesex. On the 29th of October last, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, Newman, came to my house in company with a man, whom I do not recollect - She asked for a quartern of liquor, which was fourpence, I served her; she asked me if I could change her a 1l. note - I told her I could, she produced one, and I gave her the change - I observed on the face of the note, "Mrs. Hughes, 6, Grub-street." I took the note, and she and the man went out immediately, together; Plank, the officer, came in directly to me, I shewed him the note which I had taken of them; in consequence of what he said I gave him the note, after endorsing my name on it. I had never parted with it (looks at it), that is the note she gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I had never seen her before. I will positively swear she is the person - I particularly noticed her dress and her person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the note when you received it - A. I put it in my till, there was more money there - I had noticed the name of Hughes on it. I am certain it is the same note.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The people are served at your bar - A. Yes. The female prisoner and the man came in and went out as companions.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I have known the prisoners ever since the 29th of October; on that day I saw them together in Bunhill-row - They went into a liquor shop-it was Tuesday; they then went into a house in Whitecross-street, and came out together - I saw them drink at the bar there; I then followed them into another liquor shop on Holborn-hill, they drank there also; they then went into two private houses in St. Gile's, the woman only went into the private houses, the man waited outside for her, and joined her when she came out. I then followed them to Winkfield's door, the woman looked at the name over the door, and both went in together; I looked through the window, and saw them both standing together at the bar, they came out and turned towards Drury-lane, I immediately went into Winkfield's - I had been in sight of the prisoners for about an hour and a half, and have not the least doubt of their being the persons. There was a disturbance in Holborn, where there is a gas light, they stopped there, which enabled me to notice them.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into Winkfield's - A. Yes, and gave him directions; I then came out, and found the prisoners about thirty yards off; I followed them to Smithfield, and then lost them. Winkfield produced a note, I desired him to mark it, which I saw him do - I had it in my hand (looks at it), it is the same that I saw in his possession; the prisoners walked arm-in-arm together, except where a crowd separated them. When I took them I returned to Winkfield's, he produced a note to me, I cannot say whether it is the same that he shewed me at first; he gave it to me, and I put my endorsement on it when I received it of him; it has my endorsement on it now. I had never seen the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them again - A.On Saturday, the 1st of November, I saw them together in Bunhill-row,

             was with me, we followed them to the same liquor shop in Whitecross-street; from there to another liquor shop on Holborn-hill-they had something to drink; from there I followed them to St. Giles's, until they came opposite the shop of Mr. Bartlett, a shoemaker, at the corner of Denmark-street; they spoke together-the woman crossed over and went into the shop, the man crossed also and placed himself at the window, on the High-street side of the shop, the woman went out of the shop into a room - I was in the street, watching Mansfield, he immediately shifted his place, and went to the Denmark-street side of the shop, which commanded a view of the back room where the woman was sitting, I immediately took him into custody, and Jeffries took him away. I went into the shop and said something to Mr. Bartlett - I saw the woman sitting in a chair, trying some shoes on-she approved of them; I was in the shop, Mr. Bartlett came from her and gave me a 1l. note - I did not see her give it to him - He marked it, and returned it to me; I immediately took her into custody, and slightly searched her, I only found some change upon her; I asked her where she got the note which she had given for change; she said she was an unfortunate woman, and she had received it that morning from a gentleman in a coach. I asked her where she lived, she said, at Westminster, but she would not say where there, as her father laid dead, and her mother was in a great deal of trouble. I asked her if she had been in company with a man at the door of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030023"></xptr>the shop, she said she had not-it was about eight o'clock in the evening, or rather later. I took her to the watchhouse, and there searched her particularly, and found a key upon her, which she said was the key of the street-door where she lived. I asked her what part of Westminster she lived at, she said she would not tell; I asked her if she had given that address at the shoemaker's, she said she had not. Mansfield was in the same place, but not in the same room; I found a similar key on him to the one she had given me - He said it was the key of the house where he lived; he was asked where that was, he said he would not tell, as his wife was near the time of her lying-in, and he would not alarm her. About 22s. in good silver, was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen him originally in Bonhill-row, did you see him come out of any house - A. I had seen him come out of a coal-shed, at No. 52, Bunhill-row; I have seen him carry coals out from there. I went with Foy and Jeffries to No. 52, we took the two keys there, they both fitted and opened the street - door, we went up stairs to the first-floor back room-Mrs. Goodman keeps the house-she gave us the key of the room, and I opened the door, we went in and searched, and on the top of the looking glass, which hung against the wainscot, we found a bladder, which contained twenty-eight 2l. notes - I marked them, and gave them to Foy; we also found some letters and wearing apparel there; and in Mrs. Goodman's room, below, we found a jacket, which I had seen Mansfield wear. I was present at the second examination of the prisoners, with Jeffries; as we were going to the office, Newman asked me what things I had taken out of her room, I told her there was two or three gowns, and some letters. She asked me if I had seen her marriage certificate - I told her there was one. She said there some duplicates with a pocket-book, and a 3s. piece in it; I told her I saw them there, and believed Foy had them; she said she hoped we would return them - I told her we would.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing shewn to Mansfield - A. At the third examination some things were produced that we had taken from the room, Newman claimed the gowns, and he claimed the jacket, and gave it to his mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not know them before. I saw them in the evening; I followed them for sometime - I did not wish them to know that I was following them; I avoided their noticing me, and did not go very near to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take them into custody after they went to Winkfield's - A. I was not sure that the note was a forgery, and could not take them myself, any person might be looking into Mr. Bartlett's shop, to see the shoes. I did not know Newman to be an unfortunate girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the female prisoner say that the other prisoner was innocent - A. She told him they could not touch him as he never uttered me - He shook his head.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN LEES. I am an inspector of bank notes,(looks at the note, No. 27, 810), it is a forged note in every respect, both paper, plate, and signature.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARTLETT. I am a shoemaker, and reside at the corner of Denmark-street. On the 1st of November, in the evening, the prisoner, Newman, came to my shop, she went into the ladies' room, and asked for a pair of half-boots-while my wife was serving her, Plank came in and gave me a caution; I went into the room, she gave my wife a 1l. note, my wife asked her name, she gave the name of"Brown, Brownlow-street;" which I wrote on the note - I heard her say so, and wrote it in her presence (looking at it), that is the note I saw her give to my wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Plank called me aside. She was giving my wife the note when I went into the room after seeing him.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Penny, who keeps a wine-vaults, at No. 123, Drury-lane. I know the prisoner, Newman. On the 13th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he came to the shop, in company with a woman whom I did not know. They came to the bar together, and had two glasses of liquor. One gave the order. Newman paid for it with a 1l. note; she asked me to change it. I gave her 17s. in silver, and asked her name-the liquor came to 4d.; I gave her the rest in copper. I generally give 5s. in copper. She gave me the name of "Mrs. Brown, King-street." I said,"King-street, Golden-square?" - She said "No, King-street, here"-which I concluded was Drury-lane. I marked the note (looking at one) that is it-it is marked"13th of the 10th month, Mrs. Brown, King-street." They went away together. I do not know who took the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had seen her six or seven years before. We do not change without giving copper.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SOUL. I keep the Bull's Head, in Carnaby-market. I know the prisoner, Newman. On the 25th of October, I saw her in my parlour - I did not see her come in-it was about nine o'clock in the evening; she asked for a quartern and a half of gin, which came to 6d., and a pot of beer-she gave me a 1l. note to pay for it. There were other people drinking with her; while she was in the house Jeffries came in, and gave me some information. She gave me a 1l. note - I took it over to the butcher to borrow the change, Jeffries having desired me to do so. I came back and found her still in the parlour. I brought the note back to her, desiring her to write her name on it - She did so. She had given me her address before, at No. 10, Silver-street. I do not know whether she gave me any name. She wrote on the note, "Mrs. Brown, No. 5, Pulteney-street." I gave it to Jeffries, after writing my own name on it (looks at it)-this is it. I made no observation to her about giving me another address.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I know the prisoners. The first time that I saw them was on the 25th of October, in Bunhill-row together, at a little after seven o'clock in the evening. I followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030024"></xptr>them down Chiswell-street. The man sometimes walked before the woman, and sometimes the woman before the man. When they came to Holborn-hill she took his arm. They went into a wine-vaults opposite St. Andrew's church; they came out, and walked arm-in-arm to St. Giles's; they parted, and the woman walked first down Oxford-street and Wardour-street. I followed them into Silver-street, and saw them both go into No. 37 there - They came out in twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour, in company with another woman; I then followed all three into Soul's public-house-the man went in first, and the woman stopped on the opposite side; the man came out again, they crossed to him, and all three went in together - I followed them in, and saw them, through a small pane of glass, sitting in the parlour - I told Soul something, and waited at the door; in a short time he came out and shewed me a note; we went to the opposite house, and saw that they had not marked it. I told him to take it back, and get it marked, which he did, and immediately returned to me with it-we both indorsed it (looks at it)-this it; it is No. 29057. I then waited a short time, and the two prisoners and the other woman came out together-the other woman left them at the door, and the prisoners went together into the market; the man then left the woman. She walked into Broad-street, Golden-square, where she waited for about ten minutes, and finding he did not come, she went down Bennet-street; he came soon after, and appeared to be looking for her. After this, I saw Newman talking to two women in Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you see them together that evening - A. About two hours and a half. On Saturday, the 1st of November, I was watching them with Plank, about seven o'clock in the evening, and saw them in Bunhill-row - We followed them into a house together in White-cross-street, it was a public-house at the corner - She had a basket. They came out, and went into a public-house in Holborn; we followed them from there, up Holborn, until they came opposite Mr. Bartlett's. She crossed the way, and went into the shop, leaving the man on the opposite side; he crossed over, and looked in at the window-it is a corner-shop-he went away from that window to the other, which commanded a view of the room where the woman was. Plank and I took him into custody, and conveyed him to the watch-house. On searching him I found 22s. 6d. in silver on him and a latch-key. We asked him his name? he said it was

I said, "What, no woman!" he said, "None at all." He said, the key belonged to the street-door where he lived, and that his wife being pregnaut, he would not give his address. When the woman was brought in we asked her her name? she said it was

               <p>Q.What was said to her-A, She was asked if she had been in company with any man that evening? she said,"No, not a soul." She said, she was an unfortunate woman, and that the note was given to her that morning by a gentlemen, in a coach. I afterwards tried the key to the door of No. 52, Bunhill-row, which it opened.

            . I am an officer. I was with Plank when the room at No. 52, Bunhill-row, was searched, and saw the notes found in a bladder over the looking-glass. I asked Mrs. Goodman for the key of the room-she gave me one.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CLAYTON. I lodge at No. 52, Bunhill-row, in the front room on the first-floor; the prisoner, Newman, lived in the back room in November last until she was taken into custody, and for four or five months before.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you know him - A. Yes; his father keeps the house, and employs him to carry out the coals; he is always there in the day-time, but does not sleep there. I always thought him a single man - I never heard of his having a wife.</p>
               <p>SARAH GOODMAN. I live at No. 52, Bunhill-row; I gave the officer the key of the room; I received it of the prisoner, Newman, she always left it with me when she went out - She had given it to me that day, she left it on the table; it was never out of my custody until I gave it to the officers-no person could have got it.</p>

             re-examined (looks at the notes), No. 16074, uttered to Avis; No. 29057, to Soul, and No. 27815, to Bartlett; all of them are forged in every respect; the four appear to be of two different plates, but the signatures appear to be of the same hand-writing. The twentyeight 2l. notes are all forged, and the signature appears to be the same hand-writing as the other four.</p>

             re-examined. Q, You showed the note to the officer, was that the time that he returned it to you, that you saw the name of "Hughes, Grub-street," on it - A. I observed it the moment I took it of them, before I put it in my till. I have not the least doubt of its being the same - I put it at the top of my till, Plank came in immediately. It is impossible that it could have mixed with any others.</p>

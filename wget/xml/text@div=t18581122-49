                  </hi>. I am assistant to one of the messengers of the Court of Bankruptcy. On the 8th May, 1857, I accompanied Mr. Walker to the prisoner's premises in Exmouth-street—he left me there in posses<lb></lb>sion—it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I remember the summons being affixed to the walls—I saw the prisoner about 7 in the evening, and I took the summons down and gave it to him himself. I remained on the premises that night, and up to about half-past 4 the following morning—I never saw him after that—I remained on the premises three or four weeks—we made inquiry from the prisoner about his books—we found some books and papers—they were delivered to his assignees. I asked the prisoner if he had any more books or papers than what we had collected and sent away—he said he had, and that his solicitors, Messrs. Lewis &amp; Lewis, of Ely-place, were in possession of them, and if we made application there, no doubt they would give them up.</p>

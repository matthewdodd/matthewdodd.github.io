                  </hi>. I am potman, at the Cobham's Head, Bagnigge Wells-road. The prisoners are very much like some parties who brought a box to our house covered with dark cloth, and a cord, on 22nd June, but I cannot swear to one of them—it was not a cover like this one, but dark green—I cannot say that I ever saw the prisoners—I fancy Jones came to my master's on 22nd, but I will not swear to him—there were three men came into the tap room and rang the bell—two of them had the box, and they put it on the table—to the best of my belief I have seen Willis and Wright before, but I cannot say when—I said one of the men was rather tall, and two of them short—I do not know what time they left the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of police at the Great Western Railway. On Wednesday, 23rd June, I sent for Willis, and, asked him if he conveyed in his van a quantity of boxes to Pentonville the previous day, and whether any one rode with him—he said he had delivered forty-five packages there, and that a man named Jones asked him, when he was in the South Wharf-road (which is just outside the station gates) to allow him to ride with him, and that he rode with him to Mr. Fletcher's, in Buckingham-street, where he delivered the forty-five packages, and that Jones assisted him to unload, for which he gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some beer, that they stopped nowhere on the road between Paddington and Buckingham-street, and after delivering the goods there they proceeded to Covent-garden, to collect the empty hampers and boxes, to bring them</p>

               <p>back to the station, that Jones left him in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, and he went on to Covent-garden—St. John-street would not be in the road from Buckingham-street to Covent-garden, the direct road would be by King's-cross and Judd-street—I asked him whether there were not forty-six packages in his van—he said he would swear there were not—on the second examina<lb></lb>tion, at Guildhall, Willis requested to see me in the cell, and by the permission of the sitting Alderman I went to him, and he told me he was anxious to tell me all about it—I told him he must be careful if he did so, because whatever he told me I should have to repeat again before the Magistrate—he then told me that he took Jones up into his van in South Wharf-road, proceeded to Buckingham-street, delivered the goods there, and then they discovered that they had a forty-sixth box, which he was not aware was there—I asked him whether anybody saw it, and he told me Mr. Fletcher saw it, that they then left and rode together to Aldersgate-street, where they had some conversation about the box, and it was arranged that Jones should take it, as it had been previously directed to the Royal Hotel, Bridge-street, Black friars; and for the sake of allowing him to earn 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he consented that Jones should do so, and believing he would deliver it, he let him take it—on the first occasion Willis had positively denied the box being there at all, he said he knew nothing about the box—Aldersgate-street would not be in the way from Buckingham-street to Covent-garden—I have seen Jones about the station, employed by Younghusband and Son—he had no business to be at the goods' shed—no one could have taken the box out without a pass—it is impossible for Jones to have taken it out.</p>

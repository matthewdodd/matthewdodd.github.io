On the 16th of July, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, I was engaged in the back part of the shop with a gentleman. The three prisoners came in altogether. I saw my young man shewing them some cottons, and after they had been in the shop about ten minutes, they bought a yard; it came to half a crown. They all went out of the shop together. They had not been long gone before one of my neighbours came in and said they were taken up and were in the watch-house, and some goods were found upon them. I went up to look at them, and found it to be my property. I never missed it at all; the goods were not put away. I did not wait upon them myself, my young man waited upon them.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Terrington. On Thursday, the 16th of July, near nine o'clock in the evening, the three prisoners came into the shop, they wished to look at some prints; upon which I showed them a good mans, at last they fixed on one, and had a yard, and paid half a crown for it, and then they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect them - A. No, I had no suspicion whatever. In about ten minutes a linen draper came in, and said they were in the watch-house, and there were some property found on them. I saw them the next day when they were brought to the Mansion-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. From an information of an inhabitant that there were three shop lifters, I watched them, seeing them in Mr. Terrington's shop. Forrester was along with me. I saw the three prisoners come out of the shop, and I and Forrester watched them until we came between the five lamps at Aldgate. I stood just by Duke's-place. They all three made a stop, and had a little conversation together. We stood on the opposite side of the way looking at them. Forrester said to me, it will do. I saw Mrs. Palmer hand over to Mrs. Turner, something bulky and heavy from under her silk pelisse, and Mr. Palmer put something into Mrs. Turner's lap. Forrester secured Turner, and I secured Palmer and Swan. We then took them to the watch-house, and in Mrs. Turner's lap we found these two pieces belonging to Mr. Terrington. Nothing was found on Swan nor Palmer, except some bank-notes.</p>

            . I received information, and traced the three prisoners to Mr. Terrington's shop. Kinnersley and I stopped opposite, and saw them come out. We followed them near to the five lamps at Aldgate, where they all three stopped and had some conversation together. Mrs. Palmer put her hand under her pelisse. The two pieces of muslin hanged under her pelisse longways. Mrs. Turner stood in the front of her, held up her gown and received the two pieces of muslin. Mrs. Palmer and Mrs. Swan walked away towards Whitechapel, and Mrs. Turner went towards the city. I told Kinnersley to go and secure them while I went after the woman that had the property. Kinnersley secured Palmer and Swan, and I secured Turner with the property in her lap. I produce the property.</p>

               <p>Turner and Palmer said nothing in their defence. Called two witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>
               <p>Swan called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

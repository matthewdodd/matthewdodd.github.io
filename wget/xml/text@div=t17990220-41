             sworn. - I am a tin-plate worker, No. 18, Tottenham-court-road: On the 17th of January, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop; and asked me if I bought lead; I told him I did; he brought this piece to me, he said, it weighed eight pounds; I took his word, and gave him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200038"></xptr>three halfpence per pound, which made one shilling; on the evening following he brought these two pieces; I had a suspicion of their being stolen; I asked him where he brought them from; he told me a young man gave them to him to sell for him; I asked him where the young man was; he informed me in Warren-street; I desired him to fetch the young man to me, and I would ask him a few questions concerning the metal, and he went out of the shop as I supposed to fetch the young man, but never returned till the 24th, when I asked him where the young man was, he told me the young man was gone away two shillings in his wife's debt for washing for him; I then asked the prisoner where he lived; he told me, by the waterside; I asked him his master's name, he would not inform me; I then had a suspicion that he had stolen the metal himself; I sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody; in going down to the office, the officer had questioned him where he lived, and he had informed him he lived with Mr. Braithwaite; when I found he worked with Mr. Braithwaite, the officer, myself, and Mr. Braithwaite, went to his wife's room, No. 8, Fitzroy-place, and examined it; we did not find any thing material, except three pint pots that were hid in a closet.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that, lead or solder? - A. I do not know; I have asked a great number of people who deal in metals, and they cannot tell; for my own part, I think it is lead.</p>
               <p>Q. That large piece is a pig, is it not? - A. Yes, and that gave me the suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that lead or solder? - A. I cannot say whether it is lead or any other metal.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street; I took the prisoner into custody, and as I took him down to the office, he told me he worked for Mr. Braithwaite; at first he told me he worked by the water-side; I had asked him if he did not work for Mr. Braithwaite, as I thought I had seen his face about that quarter, and he denied it; then he begged of me to go to his wife, and inform her where he was.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Braithwaite). Look at that lead? - A. The two small pieces I know nothing about, but the large piece I missed; it stood by four or five pieces of the same kind.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call it? - A. A pig of solder, or an ingot of solder, it does not signify which.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular mark upon it? - A. I knew it as I should the features of one person's face from another.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not all these pieces cast in the same mould? - A. They are cast in an open sand.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the common shape and figure of your pigs of solder? - A. They were of the same form, but the rest were all larger; I am certain this is the one I missed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there besides? - A. Four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. If you do not know whether it was four or five, how do you know you missed one? - A. I am not certain whether there were four or five that were along with these, but I can swear to this as being taken from my shop; the others were all of a size, and as big again as this.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were these cast? - A. At St. Alban's; I bought them about a week or eight days before of a plumber's son, whose father died a few weeks before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. We never went away from work till seven o'clock, and the gate was always shut, and a man at the gate to see who went in and out; it would have been impossible for me to have taken out such a piece.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The gate is never locked; I have sixty men, and they can go in and out without any body attending at the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are your partners? - A.

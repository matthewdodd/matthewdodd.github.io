                  </hi>. I am potman to Mr. Ward, who keeps the Hoop and Grapes, 112, St. George's-street, Whitechapel—on 9th April, between 10 and half-past, some comic singing was going on in the large room—the prisoner was there with two companions, and I bad two young men with me, friends of mine—two Germans went up to the stage, to give the players some money, and the prisoner malted some of the company—Mr. Ward, my master, asked me to put him and his two companions out, which I proceeded to do with Mr. Ward at my elbow—I persuaded them to go, and they went quietly till they got to the threshold of the door, when the prisoner made a blow and a kick at me—I prevented the blow, but received the kick on the shin<lb></lb>bone—I went over the threshold, and asked him what he meant by kicking me—he stepped into the road, and struck me a deliberate blow—I tried to save it with my left arm—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand, but I received a very heavy blow at the top of the muscle of the left shoulder—I found I was wounded, by the blood pouring out—I staggered to the kerb, and then ran after him as well as I could—he had a belt round him like mine, like a sailor—I could not see whether there was any sheath to it, but I afterwards saw the policeman with it—a constable stopped him at the corner of Pennington-street, 200 or 500 yards from the house—I re<lb></lb>mained in the hospital ten or twelve days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 112, St. George's-street—I was in the concert-room—the prisoner was there with three friends—a disturbance took place, and Mr. Ward asked the last witness to put the prisoner and two of his friends out—I told them to go quietly—they made a blow and a kick at Lucas at the door—he said, "What did you do that for?"—the prisoner put his hand behind him, and I saw Lucas receive a blow on the shoulder—</p>

               <p>he cried out, "I am stabbed!"—I saw no weapon in the prisoner's hand—he ran off very fast, and the people after him—he was brought back by a policeman, and charged at the station with stabbing the potman—they found a belt and an empty sheath on him, and he said he had got a b—y sheath, but no knife—he appeared sober—the knife is usually worn behind, on the right hip.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner stopped by a policeman at the corner of Old Gravel-lane—I afterwards picked up this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at that place—it is 200 or 300 yards from the public-house—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there fainting from loss of blood, and bleeding a little, but his wound had been temporarily dressed by a surgeon—it was on the upper part of the arm, at it's junction with the shoulder—it was two inches long and one inch broad—it must have been a violent blow—this is just the sort of knife which would have produced it—I should say that the blow had been aimed at the front part of the body, and warded off by the arm, because the mouth of the wound was the lowest part of it; had it gone into the chest, it would have been very dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> There were some performers on a bit of a stage at this public-house, and a foreigner wanted to give then some money to buy bread and cheese. One of my companions felt affronted, and wanted to fight. I said, "Let us go;" and, as I passed by the prosecutor, he said, "You can't <hi rend="italic">shine</hi> here." I said, "I do not want to <hi rend="italic">shine."</hi> I turned round to see if my companions were there, and the potboy struck me in the mouth, and knocked my cap off. I picked it up, walked to the middle of the room, and heard somebody say, "Let him have it." I retreated several paces; the potboy still followed me up; a policeman stopped me, and the potboy gave me in charge for stabbing him, but I had no knife; I lost it at sea before I came to London. The men who were with me have gone to sea; they were struck also. I had a scar when I was first locked up, and my mouth was swelled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter—carrier, employed by the Post—office, at the Charing—cross branch. It is part of my duty to sort letters previous to their being delivered—the prisoner was also a letter—carrier at the same branch office—his stand for sorting was next to me, on my right—hand—he delivered letters on the Golden-square district—on Monday evening, the 17th of Nov., about half—past seven, I was on duty at the office, sorting letters—the prisoner was in his place, on my right—hand, also engaged in sorting—when the letters are sorted from the sorting—table, there are boxes in which to place them for the different walks—a letter for West Strand would not be in any portion of the Golden—square district—before the letters were all sorted that evening, I saw the prisoner take the letters out of the Golden—square box, right up to the top with his left—hand—he left the sorting—desk—his back was then towards me, and I saw him put a letter with his right—hand into his right—hand trow<lb></lb>ser's pocket—I mentioned the circumstance to Mr. Smither, the inspector—the prisoner went to his own desk, and waited there for a moment—he then returned to the sorting—table, but did not stop at it a minute—he walked round, and went back to his own desk again—I there saw him making away for the inner office, which leads to the water-closet—I told Mr. Smither he was going to the water-closet—we immediately followed him—the water—closet is divided off without any cover, and by rising on two or three steps, you can see down into it—it is open to the ceiling—there is a passage leading from the inner office, and on the left—hand side a door opens into the water-closet—I did not observe Mr. Smither try the door of the water-closet—when I came</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector at the Charing-cross branch-office of the Post-office, I was there on the evening of the 17th of Nov. About half-past seven Abbott made a communication to me respecting the prisoner, while the sorting was going on, in consequence of which I directed my atten<lb></lb>tion to the prisoner—I watched him to his place for a moment, and from that to the adjoining room leading to the water-closet, to which I immediately followed him—when I got to the door I found it fastened from the inside—the top of the water-closet is open—I ascended some steps that we have there to turn the gas cut—the steps were not fixtures—it took me less than half a minute to get up—when I looked down I saw the prisoner sitting on the seat of the water-closet—I did not see what state his clothes were in—there was not sufficient light for me to see—I distinctly saw him with a letter in his hand—I could not tell whether it was open or shut—the letter was on his lap and his two hands were on the letter—t was a folded letter—I could not see whether it was sealed or not—it was in the form of a folded letter—I either said "Gord, what are you doing?" or "what are you about with that letter?"—I spoke to him from above—he said, "Nothing, sir"—I desired him to open the door—he did so immediately—I did not then notice the state of his clothes—I should have noticed if they had been unbuttoned—he had a letter in his hand—he appeared to be in the act of coming out—I held out my hand and he put the letter into it—this is the letter—it was in a crumpled state—it was sealed—near the seal I noticed the fracture of the paper, which is here now—it might have been merely accidental—I sent for an officer and gave him in charge, and in the presence of the officer I asked where he got the letter from; he said he did not know—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, Nothing"—the envelope of the letter has the stamp of the Post-office on it, eight o'clock at night, on the 17th—I cannot see where it was posted—there is no receiving-house stamp upon it—the "eight o'clock" denotes the time such a letter wuuld be sent out for delivery that evening—such a letter would</p>

               <p>be in our office about half—past seven—it is not addressed to any place within his walk—he would have nothing to do with such a letter—in the course of sorting he might probably have it, but not for the purpose of delivery—all those who are sorting may take up any letter—they are tied in large bundles and sent to our office indiscriminately—they must take hold of them in order to sort them into several walks, and as they sort them they put them into the different sorting—boxes, which are large pigeon—holes—there are two divisions—the prisoner would have no right to take any letters out of the Strand walk—if this letter came into his possession in the sorting, it would have been his duty to put it immediately into the Strand box—after he had been taken into custody, in consequence of some message given to me I went to the prisoner—I found him in custody of the officer, in a small adjoining office—I said, "I believe you called me?"—he said, "Yes, I had no bad intention with that letter, it was a mis—sordletter; I am a sorter, and it came to our walk"—I then told him though he might say what be pleased, it might be used against him—as he made no reply to that, I said, "I understand you to say that, you had no bad intention, &amp;c." repeating his own words—he said, "Yes," and I then left.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Millbrook, eighty-five miles from London. On the 17th of Sept, after eight o'clock at night, I saw my mare in a field close to my house—there was only one gate to the field, and that was locked—I missed her about five o'clock in the morning—the gate was still locked—she could not have strayed, from the state of the fence—I saw her again last Monday fortnight in Mr. Day's stable, at Kensington, and was certain of her, although her tail was cut off and her back discoloured—she was worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Kensington Gravel-pits, I saw the prisoner on the 22nd of Sept. at the Swan, near my house—he said he had a mare for sale—he showed it to me in the stable, and asked me eight sovereigns for it—I thought it too much, and said I had a black mare, which I gave with two sovereigns for her—Mr. Knell afterwards claimed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At noon—Horwood, an omnibus owner, had told me the prisoner had her for sale—six or more people came round to look at her—the prisoner got on her and rode her, to show</p>

               <p>how she would go, in Church-lane, which is a public place—my mare was worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the full value of this mare—I offered her for sale at Smithfield for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said at once at the office that he sold her to me, and that he bought her of a man in Edgeware-road on Wednesday; (I bought her on Friday;) that he made a chap of her with another horse and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the Magistrate admitted him to bail, and he was at large from Saturday till Tuesday—he gave his address in Bell-lane, Edgeware-road, and said he was a horse-dealer—after I had made the bargain, I said I should put her in harness, and asked how she would go—he said the man he bought her of said she would not go in harness—I put her into a cart, and she kicked—after she was taken out, he said she had been docked a day or two before, and that was enough not to make her go—he did not say she had been docked before he had her, to my recollection—I did not pay particular attention to what passed between him and the police—she appeared to have been recently docked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable.</hi>) I was in Smithfield on the 29th of September, and saw the mare in Day's possession—he went with me, and pointed out the prisoner—I asked if he knew anything about the mare—he said he sold her to Day—some questions were put to him at the station by Lambert—while I was stating my suspicions by the mare being recently docked, he said he docked her himself.</p>

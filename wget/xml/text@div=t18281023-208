One Monday in September, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me to give her a breakfast, which I did; I was called out, and returned at eleven o'clock - she was then gone; she had been in the habit of coming to the house to assist me in washing; she came again on the Friday, and asked if she should come to wash - I said No; but she came on the Saturday, and brought a cap which I had lent her; she sat down, and I saw her move something under her clothes, and when she was gone I found this flannel petticoat - I had missed it that Saturday morning, before she came, and a shirt likewise, from a tub under the bed in my back-room; I afterwards took her in Newgate-street.</p>

            . I have a baby's shirt, which the prisoner left at my lodging, where she had lived; I found it when the prosecutrix came to look after her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutrix had given her leave to pawn one shirt.</p>
               <p>MARY PERRY re-examined. Q. Did she tell you she had taken the shirt? A. No; she had the Saturday before, asked for leave to go out, and I missed a child's seal-skin hat; I had stopped a shilling from her, because I had lent it for a time, and she said I could take the shilling; she did not tell me of this other shirt, which she had pawned - I did not say I would go as far against her as the law would allow, or say I should get well paid for my time.</p>

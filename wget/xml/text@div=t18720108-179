                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at London Street, Deptford—on Sunday night, 24th December, about 11 o'clock, I saw a disturbance at the top of Russell Street, Rotherhithe, amongst some foreigners—I saw some knives—as I went past the prisoner came to me, and stabbed me in the head—he did not say anything—I fell, I got up again, and he stabbed me in the hand—he ran away, and I followed him with a witness, Daniels—I called out when I was stabbed, and he ran over and caught hold of the prisoner—he got away, and then we both followed—he turned round, and made a stab at my neck, but it did not reach me—I saw the knife in his hand at that time—we caught him on the bridge—he had not got the knife then—he was held till a policeman came—I was sober—the prisoner appeared drunk—my head was dressed at the station—I feel the effect of the wounds now—my hand and head are both bound up now—I examined the scarf which I was wearing, and there were four or five cuts through the folds, and there was a scratch on my neck—there was also a hole through the collar of my coat.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at Lower Queen Street, Rotherhithe—I was in Russell Street—I saw the prisoner run across the road with a knife in his hand, and stab. Daily on the back of the head—I ran over and seized him—he got away from me, and ran down Russell Street—I caught him on the bridge, near the Commercial Dock—he had not got a knife then—it was just after 11 o'clock—when the blow was struck Daily fell on his knees, and that was when I seized the prisoner.</p>

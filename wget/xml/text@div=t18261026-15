            . I am servant to Mr. John Davenport, of Fleet-street - he has other partners. The prisoner came into their service about twelve months ago. In consequence of something that passed between master and myself, I noticed two jugs in the window of Mr. Reeve, of Snow-hill, and knew them to be our maufacture - I went into the shop; they described a person to me, in consequence of which I got an officer, who apprehended the prisoner; he was still in our employ - Reeve saw him at Guildhall, and recognised him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How many such jugs has your master manufactured? A. Perhaps some hundreds. Reeve said he had only those two - it is stone china, and marked with masters' name at the bottom.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Reeve, pawnbroker, of Snow-hill. On the 20th of September the prisoner came to the shop, with two small jugs, and offered them for sale, for 2s. 6d., but took 1s. 6d. for the two; they are here, and have Davenport's name at the bottom of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain of his person? A. Yes. I never bought any others of him; it was on the 20th of September - I have entered it in our books; they are not here - I looked at them this morning.</p>

            . These jugs are masters' manufacture, and have their name on them - they are ironstone; it is not customary to sell goods to servants; the selling price is 3s. for the pair - the trade price is 2s.; ninepence each is less than the manufactured price. The prisoner had the care of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your masters might sell goods to their servants, though it is not customary? A. They might. The prisoner never bought them from our house - I do not think it possible he could have bought them to sell at 9d. - if he bought them of other persons they must have stolen them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I certainly have bought goods, which can be proved by their books.</p>

            . I keep the books; I believe he has bought goods, but not such as these; he bought a few cups and saucers, and sold them to a friend; I have searched the books through - there are no jugs entered. - I swear he never bought these, or they would be entered; if he bought goods he might pay for them on Saturday night, out of his wages, but it would be entered in the books; if he had bought these he could not have sold them for 9d.</p>

            When had you last seen your mo ney? - When I gave the half crown t the press gang man, not five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that accompanied you from the rendezvous house? - He was a seaman, he belonged to the press gang. I met, the man the next morning about six o'clock, he asked me how I come on the last night? I said, I lost my money; he said, if that be the case I will bring you to the same house where you was, and he did, and nobody would give an answer, in the mean time one George Forrester came up, and he asked me what was the matter, what I wanted with the house? I told him I was robbed the night before of my money, and Forrester knocked, and he got no answer; then the officer got in at the window, and he opened the door, then we came in, and she was sitting on the floor without her cap, but all her clothes on; and the officer said, I must over haul I your pockets, and he did, and he could find no more than a guinea and a half in gold, and half a guinea in silver, making altogether two guineas; and then he asked her for the rest of my money; she said, that the man that brought me in that night had got two guineas of it; well, says he, that is not all, where is the rest? and she said, I gave it to another woman, and she named her, but I don't know her name, Mr. Forreiter he knows her, and he said, where is that woman? and Mr. Forrester sent out to look for the woman and the neighbours said that she had gone to Portsmouth that same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the guinea and a half that this woman had in her pocket? - She told Mr. Forrester that the took it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her put her hand into your pocket and take the money from you? - No, I did not, if I had done that she should not have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what pocket was your money? - In my right pocket and she was sitting on my left knee. she left me three or four times, sometimes she sat on my right knee, and sometimes she sat on my left knee.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Could you swear to my taking your money? you sat along side of me on the bed and you asked me for some salmon? and you asked me if I would have any thing to drink, and you said what will you drink? and I said, if I drink any thing it shall be a drop of porter. There was another woman in the room, and I left them together while I went for the salmon.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you quitted the house did you miss your money? - I missed it before ever I started on my legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was in the house besides her and the man? - Nobody but us three. I was there half an hour or three quarters, no more altogether.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FORRESTER sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday the 9th, as I was coming up Gravel-lane, between six and seven in the morning, I saw this man and one of the press gang that he mentions, standing opposite a window of the prisoner's lodging room.</p>
               <p>Court to Swan. Had you ever been there before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Forrester. This man, the prosecutor, did not know me, but the press gang man did, and he said to him, here is an officer, you give charge to search the house; I went up to the room, and I knocked, and could not get in, and we got in by the window first, and then opened the door; and we found the prisoner in the house, with all her clothes on, but without a cap; this man that was along with him, says, that is the woman; pointing to her; accordingly I says to her, what have you done with this man's money? she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160087"></xptr>said, she knew nothing at all about it. I searched her; in one pocket I found about half a crowns worth of halfpence, and in the next pocket I found a guinea and a half, and eight shillings in silver; she did then begin to cry, and I asked her what became of the rest? and she said, that the other woman that was along with her, told her that the press gang chap, had two guineas of the money, and the remains of it

             had got, and gone to Portsmouth. The press gang man was along with me at this time; he denied all charge of it, for he attended up at the justice's with this woman, I brought her to the justice; she said, she found eight and thirty shillings on the bed; and the justice ordered me to deliver four shillings to the prisoner; which I did.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was you quite sober? - I cannot say that I was, but I was solid, and knew what I did, or else I should not have found my way home again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am very innocent of the money, I know nothing of it; I left him and the other woman in the house, and that man; I cannot tell what they did the while; and when I came in with the last pot of ale, he was gone out, and the other woman with him; I picked that money up from off the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 13th of September, about two o'clock at night, I was at No. 13, Newcastle-street, Strand—there was a dispute between Caroline Atkins and the prisoner about a young man—the prisoner struck first—Atkins struck her again—they were both very much in liquor—Lloyd struck Atkins again, and knocked her down, kicked her several times in the passage, and when she began to rise up, the prisoner took knife, and struck her across the right eye with the sharp part of it—I work at the house, and am sometimes there till three o'clock—the eye bled very much—the passage was soaking, and all her things were covered</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She took up the knife, and cut my right hand in two places, <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am certain the prisoner took it herself off the table—Atkins went away on Monday night, and has not been seen since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She took the knife to me first; you were down stairs at the time we were quarrelling, in the parlour. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was not—Atkins had just had her supper with the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon at King's College Hospital. A woman was brought to the hospital on Wednesday, I do not know whom by—she gave the name of Atkins—the policeman was with her—she had a wound just below her right eye, not severe—it might be done by accident in a struggle—it appeared to be cut with a knife.</p>

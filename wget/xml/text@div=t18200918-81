On Friday morning the 14th of July, I went to Billingsgate about five o'clock, leaving my wife and two children in bed; I returned home at seven o'clock, and in about a quarter of an hour missed my wife's clothes off the back of a chair at the foot of the bed, also her pocket, which contained a pocket-book with some duplicates in it. I had left the door on the latch. I saw the prisoner the same morning at a clothes-shop in Rosemary-lane, laid hold of him, and said I understood it was him who took my property. He denied it, and attempted to get from me - I held him and delivered him to the officer. He pulled the duplicates and pocket-book from his bosom when I took him. I am sure I shut the door.</p>

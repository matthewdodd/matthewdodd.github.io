                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Toby, a shoe-manufacturer, in St. Thomas's-place, Great Dover-road. The prisoner came into our service on the 1st of June—on the 14th of September she came up to my bed-room door, about seven o'clock in the evening, and told me she was very sorry to be going to leave me at a moment's notice, but she had seen her uncle that afternoon, and he wished her to come home—I said I thought it was very strange, as I had been given to understand from her sister that her uncle and her had not been friends for twelve months—she said it was the case—she had her bonnet and shawl on, and when I went down stairs she was gone—that day and the day before we had been packing some shoes up for a foreign order—I missed three or four pairs on the 13th, and five pairs on the 14th, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250180"></xptr>
               <p>I had not the least suspicion of the prisoner till the 7th of this month—I then accompanied the officer to her lodging at Lewisham—I had had their address from her sister—I saw her there, and saw a box which she had had when in my house—the prisoner produced a key, and opened it herself, and in it I found a crape handkerchief, which I had lost from a drawer, but I did not miss it, and could not tell how long it had been lost—I am quite certain it was mine—nothing more was taken out of the box then—next day we went again, and found some more things in the box, which must have been placed there since the first search, as they were not there then—I also found my thimble in a work-basket on the table, and an apron of mine in a drawer down stairs—the prisoner's sister lived in the same house, and she was frequently in the habit of coming to my premises—a pair of shoes were found on the prisoner's feet at the station-house, which was one of the foreign pair.</p>

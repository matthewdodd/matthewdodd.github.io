               <p>Q. Have you the dwelling-house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this happen - A. On the 17th of last December, at the hour of near two at night. My wife awoke me, and I was some time insensible. I was between sleeping and awaking. She said, she heard a noise as though some one was breaking in; being market morning I gave no credit to what she said. I believed it to be the horns of the cattle, which struck against the shutter bar. I was going to sleep again. She prevailed upon me to rise. In about a quarter of an hour she heard a crack in the shop. I arose in bed, and saw a light in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your bed then - A. In the back parlour. I coughed, thinking it might alarm whoever it was, had the light, I expected, would be put out in consequence, and my wife coughed. The light was not extinguished by our coughing, as I supposed it would be. I thought it not prudent to go out, on account I did not know how many there might be there, therefore I drove my fist through the window, in the frame of the parlour. The light, by that alarm, was extinguished, and I immediately went through the parlour door, towards the shop door, and on opening the street door I brushed the prisoner's clothes near the door. I took hold of the prisoner by my right hand by his left collar, and not knowing whether there were any others in the shop I believe I went out first, dragging the prisoner with me. We were struggling together between five and ten minutes; I calling watch. We got just on the entrance of Smithfield when the watchman came up. I gave the prisoner into custody of two officers, who are here, who conveyed him back into the shop, and on searching the premises no one else was found. We looked to see where he got in. He got in under the window, where we put the shutters in day time. It is wood work where he got in; the outside is a small door, a bolt at the top and bottom, and a lock in the middle. He forced it by punching back the lock. He by that means contrived to secret himself in the cavity, between that door and the other door. My wife thought she heard him for three quarters of an hour. When I got out of bed I was quite naked, except my shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house down Long-lane - A. I believe it to be five or six houses.</p>

            . I was night constable. On the 7th of December, the prisoner was brought in by the watchman and the prosecutor. I took the charge, and put him in the Compter. I went back to the house, and saw the place where he broke into. The outer door had a lock in the middle, and a bolt at the top and bottom. He had forced the wood work all away.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going round my beat, a quarter before two. In coming through the close I had a pair of gates to open, to let myself into Smithfield. I heard the cry of, watch. The cattle being on the pavement. I made the best of my way to Long-lane, and at the end of Long-lane, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner. The prisoner was endeavoring to get away. I catched hold of the prisoner. I conveyed him back to the premises he had broken in. I searched the place. He broke in underneath the window, where they put the shutters in the day time, in a kind of a box, There is a kind of a door to it outside. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130014"></xptr>forced open the door, and got into the shop by forcing the partition right off. I detained him in the shop until the prosecutor dressed himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been taken in the shop - A. Nothing had been taken. Then I conveyed him to the watchhouse, and gave him into the charge of the constable</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming past there between one and two o'clock, going to Smithfield-market. The prosecutor was at the door: as I went past he catched hold of me. I know nothing more about it.</p>

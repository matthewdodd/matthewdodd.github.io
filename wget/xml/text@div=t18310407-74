            . I am a Police-constable. On Sunday, the 13th of March, I was on duty in Kingsland-road - I saw Buckley with a bundle; I spoke to him; he said he had a bottle and a sheet in the bundle - I told him to open it; he put it into my hands; I found in it an empty bottle and a sheet - I have the sheet, but he threw the bottle into the road, and broke it - he said he got the bottle from a person named Waters, in Church-street, Newington, but the sheet was his own, and he had lent it to a person - I asked if there were any marks on it; he said he did not know; I looked, and found a W. on it - I asked his name; he said Buckley; I said that did not correspond with his name, and I should take him - he ran off, but I pursued, and took him; he said he had a wife over at Walworth, and she knew whether there was a mark on the sheet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Did not he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070050"></xptr>say his wife knew more about the linen than he did? A. Yes; he did not object to my seeing the bundle - he told me to open it; I inquired at Church-street, Newington, and could not find such a person.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. In consequence of information I went to Mason-street, Lambeth, on the 22nd of March - I did not find Cox that day; but I went to a house in the same street the next day, and found her concealed in a closet; I said I had a charge against her for stealing a sheet belonging to her employer, and I told her she was charged with being concerned with a person named Buckley; she said she did not know any thing about the sheet, or of such a person; I asked if her name was Esther Cox - she said it was not; I took her to the station-house, and on the way she said if I would not say any thing, she would tell; I cautioned her not to say any thing to me, for I should have to tell that before the Magistrate - she then said she had been led astray, and had taken the sheet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was she concealed? A. In a cupboard, in the further end of it, and the door was shut - I had not been at that house the day before, but I had been close to it, and inquired in the neighbourhood.</p>

             - we live in Church-street, Newington; Cox was eight months in my service - my property was in her care, and she kept some trifling accounts of money for me. This sheet is my husband's, and is worth 4s. or 5s.; I gave Cox leave to go out on the 18th of March, but I did not miss this sheet till the officer came.</p>

Carter, Wood, &amp; Co., of the Ar<lb></lb>tillery Brewery, Victoria Street, Westminster—the prisoner was lessee and occupier of the Greyhound Tavern, Streatham Common—on 10th April he was adjudicated a bankrupt, and on the 28th of the same month I was ap<lb></lb>pointed trustee and receiver of the estate—William Ward and George Rae were the inspectors—the next day, or the day after, I went to the tavern to take possession of the property—I saw the prisoner and his wife, and they asked to be allowed to remain there—I said that I would consent to their doing so, but that I must place a barman there as my representative, to conduct the business—in the month of June the prisoner signed a memo<lb></lb>randum, agreeing to give up peaceable possession of the premises, and to with draw when desired to do so—on the 7th August, from what I heard, I sent a man named Perkins to watch the premises, and in consequence of a notice,</p>

Burchell, solicitors, Mr. Brett, an accountant, Mr. Powell, and others—I saw the prisoner, and read to him the notice I had received, which ordered me to insist on his im<lb></lb>mediate withdrawal from the tavern, and to take such measures as I should think fit it to effect it—the prisoner was in the bar-parlour on the ground floor, and asked me to wait until to-morrow—I appealed to the clerk, and he said it was necessary that the prisoner should leave at once—I said he could have half an hour, or an hour, to pack up his things, and if he would give me an address I would send the remainder to him—he said that he had only few shillings—I replied that he should not go away penniless, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and promised to pay him weekly the cum which the Court of Bankruptcy might allow—he then said he would go, and proceeded up stairs, followed by Brett—I went in about half an hour to see where he was, and I found him in a little sitting-room on the left hand side of the stairs—I asked him when he was going—he hummd and had for some time, and then went to his bedroom, and I followed him, there about two minutes afterwards, and saw him standing by the mantelpiece, on the oppo<lb></lb>site side—there was a case like a pistol case before him—shortly afterwards a friend of mine, Mr. Jamieson, entered the room—he had spoken to the prisoner previously, and had appealed to him masonically to leave the pro<lb></lb>mises in a peaceable manner—the prisoner went into the bedroom for a certain purpose, and shut the door—the pistol-case, was open, and the prisoner took a revolver from it—in a moment he turned round, and pointed it at me—I jumped back, and slammed the door to hard as I could—Mr. Jamieson, was at the head of the door, said in front of me—we both made down stairs as last as possible—the prisoner rushed out of his bed-room, and fired at us—I had descended alert seventh stairs, when I heard a cap snap—I was turning a part of the stairs; when he fired again, and a bullet passe'd about 3 or 4 in. from my head—in a moment or so the prisoner fired a third time, and the bullet entered the wainscotting—it would have gone through me if I had kept straight down the stairs—it lodged in a part of the wall, about 6 in. above my head—Mr. Perkins, and two policemen, rushed up, secured the prisoner, and took the revolver from him.</p>

I have known the prisoner for about six years—I remember his taking the Castle public-house, in Chapel Street, Westminster—that was in 1859 or 1860—I never heard say, at that time, that he had been in America, and had received a sunstroke when there—I never entered into the details of his past life—I do not remember his having an apoplectic fit whilst living at the Castle—I have heard that a Mr. Bryant has been his solicitor of late—I did not advise the prisoner as to taking the Greyhound—he was out of business for some time before he did so—I saw him probably once a week, whilst he lived there—I used to go there as a collector for my firm—I never observed that a small quantity of alcoholic drink had an effect upon him—Messrs. Wood have a' mortgage upon a certain sum of money, secured on the house at Streatham—I think when the prisoner entered it, he paid 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the premium—the ground rent was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—the prisoner had money of his own, to the amount of 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., find borrowed, I believe, 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Messrs.

               <p>of a little <hi rend="italic">brush</hi> or two, till the present year—I was not aware that he signed bills for the accommodation of other persons—I knew of his being involved in a Chancery suit—Mr. Wood, at the wish of the prisoner, was the petitioning creditor in bankruptcy, and I was appointed receiver of the estate—Mr. Bryant was the solicitor—it was a business and not a friendly bankruptcy—Mr. Brett is an accountant, employed by Carter, Wood, &amp; Co.—Mr. Ward was the previous tenant of the Greyhound, and he acted on behalf of Messrs. Tickers, the distillers—I did not undertake that the prisoner and his family should not be turned out of the house—the memo<lb></lb>randum as to the withdrawal was obtained, because I wished the transaction to be conducted as orderly as possible—I think the Chancery suit was tried this year—I went to his house about once a week after the bankruptcy proceedings were commenced—I placed a barman there, to take the money, because, after the first week, the prisoner did not bring to me sufficient cash for what I believed he had sold—I put in two men with authority—I had some rough men on the common, on the 9th August, to net if force was required to eject the prisoner—Mr. Jamieson was there accidentally—he saw my cab at the door, came in, and offered to mediate between us—I never have been engaged in any forcible expulsion of a tenant—I heard on the 5th August that the prisoner was much incensed against me—ho was, in fact, bound over to keep the peace—on the 8th August I had occasion to go to the Police Court, in consequence of his violent conduct and demeanour—I was led to suppose that he had firearms about him, and I watched him—Mr. Cooper had told me that he had walked about with a revolver in his pocket, and had threatened to shoot anyone who interfered with him—I went into his bedroom simply because I had a duty to perform, and was determined to do it—I knew he had piles, but he did not go to his bedroom for the purpose that has been stated—he went there certainly, and I followed in about three or four minutes—I had a presentiment that he meant to do something wrong—when I heard Jamieson cry out that the prisoner had a pistol, I ran down stairs as fast as I could—when I got to the bottom of the stairs, I turned sharply to the right, and the second bullet missed my head—I had told the prisoner that I was prepared to use violence if it was necessary—Mrs. Mills left after the shooting—no money was given <hi rend="italic">to</hi> her, because she had the takings of three or four days—more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. certainly—the prisoner had threatened the men in possession with violence, and they were afraid of him, and complained of his conduct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, living at East Briston—on the 9th of August, I reached the Greyhound Inn, on my way from Croydon Assizes, and from something which I heard, I went up stairs, and saw Mr. Estall on the kinding of the first-floor—he explained to me the position in which he stood, and pushed at a bedroom door, and opened it—the prisoner was inside, and Mr. Estall introduced me to him—I told him that Mr. Estall had informed me that he was trustee under the bankruptcy, and that as he (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) would have to leave his house sooner or later, I hoped he would take my advice, and go quietly, for then Messrs. Carter, Wood &amp; Co., might get him a smaller house, and place him in business again—I told him also that Mr. Estall had offered to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I would <hi rend="italic">use</hi> my persuasive powers to get him another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said that he wanted to perform an act of nature, and that he was suffering from piles—he</p>

               <p>had a night commode in the room, and then I closed the door and left—I met Mr. Estnll on the landing, and told him what had occurred, when he said that he did not believe the prisoner, and would see what he was doing—he looked through the crack of the door, and saw Mills capping his pistol—as Mr. Estall stood at the door, the prisoner presented the revolver at his head, and I exclaimed "Good heaven, he is going to fire!"—I jumped down the first flight of stairs as quickly as I could, and was followed by Mr. Estall—as I turned round the landing, the prisoner appeared at the door of his room, took a dead level at us, and fired the cap, but the barrel did not explode—had it done so, the bullet might have gone through my head, so close was I to the man at the time—when half way down the second landing, I heard a bullet whiz close by my head, and it lodged in the: wainscoting, about a foot above my right eye—when I reached the bottom, and was looking for the nearest way to escape, I heard a second explosion, and another bullet passed close by Mr. Estall, and lodged in the door frame—the prisoner was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had nothing whatever to do with the public-house—I have valued the property of publicans—this was the firth occasion of my being in a public-house when the landlord was to be turned out—I re<lb></lb>member the case to which you allude—you withdrew from the prosecution, one of the prisoners pleaded guilty—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me—I had not the slightest idea, when I called at the Greyhound, that Mr. Estall would be there was not told there was to be a spree at the house—I should not consider it a spree, but as a serious piece Of business—I did net see the roughs collect, but there was a very full bar—I told the police all that occurred, whilst the facts were fresh in my memory—I said a good many things at the Court which dire not in my deposition—they said they were not material to the case—I told the Magistrate about the prisoner cappingrthe pistot; that does not appear in my deposition—two barrels only were discharged—I advised the prisoner to leave without making a dis<lb></lb>turbance, as it would be better for him afterwards.</p>

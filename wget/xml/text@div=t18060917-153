               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, he brought the first piece of copper, on Tuesday morning, August the 12th, he came with Richards, the porter, himself, he brought this very piece (witness putting his hand on one pig of copper); my wife was with me, he asked me fourteen pence a pound fer it, I said that is too much, I offered him a shilling a pound for it; he let me have it for a shilling a pound, he told me there was ninety three pounds; I borrowed five pounds, I gave him four pounds thirteen shillings. I went down stairs to the public house, we had a quartern of rum together, with that the prisoner at the bar said to me, do not carry it into Hounsditch; with that my heart sell at my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You then began to entertain suspicions. - A. Yes, I thought my liberty would be taken away if I had been taken with it, perhaps he would not have owned that he had sold it me; I kept it from the Tuesday till Wednesday evening, I was very surprised, I could not do any business; the Thursday morning I met Mr. Crab and Hart, two constables, in Petticoat-lane, I told them what I had done with that man, that I had bought some pigs of copper of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree together that Crab should be at your house the next time the prisoner came. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed with the prisoner on the first time when he should come again. - A. No, I delivered the first piece to Mr. Crab. On Thursday evening the prisoner came to my house again, he told me he could not bring it till between nine and ten o'clock in the evening; at that time the prisoner and Richards came together, he brought another pig in his little basket, he told me that weighed one hundred pounds, I do not know whether he meant the short or the long hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy it. - A. No, upon his coming my wife went and called Mr. Crab and Mr. Hart, and they came up stairs, Mr. Crab said, I suspect you have got some stolen copper in your house, he laid hold of this basket; the prisoner was there, but the porter had just gone down stairs to the public house; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, it did not belong to him; the porter owned that he had brought these two pieces of copper at different times, he first denied it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170088"></xptr>then he owned that he brought it from the prisoner's house; they were both taken into custody.</p>

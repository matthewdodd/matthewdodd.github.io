                  </hi>. I am commercial traveller to Messrs. Crosier &amp; Co.—I only knew the prisoner a few days previous to my employing him as a lad to carry samples—on 11th February I gave him charge of some packages, containing nine Paisley shawls, patterns of Manchester goods, and other things, and told him to take them to 118, Wood Street—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody, about a fortnight or three weeks after; I offered a reward for his apprehension—he was brought to me on 2nd March—I asked him what he did with the property, and why he had not put in an appearance—he said he had gone to a public-house to get some beer, that he left the parcels outside, and when he came out they were gone, and he was afraid to come back and tell me—the value of the goods was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a driver to a commercial traveller—I know the prisoner—I saw that a reward was offered for him—I met him in March last, in Shoreditch—I took hold of him, and told him he was wanted for stealing some goods—he said he had left them outside a public-house, and they were gone when he came out—I said if he went quietly I would take him, if not I should give him in charge to a policeman—he did go quietly.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The first of my making application to Maycock for the mare, I went to him and spoke to him several times; Maycock was always complaining Mr. Clapstone had taken him in, and that she was not worth near the money; he had given twelve guineas for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maycock. I have the receipt in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That she was not worth the money, and that he had no objection to part with her, provided he could get enough for her; and one afternoon more particular, I believe when I was up at his house, Mr. Clapstone put the question to him, said if you are tired of your mare I believe Mr. Newby can get you a customer for it; Clapstone lodged at Maycock's house at the time he was very ill.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he lodge there at the time this affair happened? - No, before that a week or a fortnight, Maycock was saying he was taken in, and Mr. Clapston said, I believe if you will give Newby a guinea or something to that purpose, he can get you a customer for her; I do not recollect positively, whether he at that time said he would part with her, but he had said he would part with her, for he had her to let out; as to all the evidence that had been given, I must admit of with respect to Maycock and also Landin, only whether Maycock does not recollect that I hired the mare, and Mr. Clapstone would prove that I certainly made application to Landin knowing the mare, and he very well knew that Maycock had been taken in; that she was not worth near the money; in consequence of that, I went and got the mare in the way that has been described, by hiring it; I was to give three shillings for the hire; she was so lame I dropped in at Landin's house, and told him I had bought the mare; I believe I might say so.</p>
               <p>Court. But this is exactly the same story that the witnesses tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is my Lord, I believe if I had made a return of the money, Maycock would have been satisfied.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go off with the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My intention was to make a return, if it had not been for serving a friend, to whom I lent a part of it; I expected to be tried last night.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is your master Mr. Clapstone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not believe he is here; I believe I have made him an enemy on some business upon which the court was moved, and I made affidavit which I wish I had not done.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot see any reason to distinguish this case from a similar case decided by the judges,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250017"></xptr>and acted upon ever since, which was a case of a person professing to him a horse, pretending to get that horse for the purpose of going to a certain place, to return that horse, and immediately going to sell the horse, without going to the place for which he had hired it; the jury found that prisoner guilty; upon which it was left to the judges, to say whether they were of opinion under the evidence, that he got possession of the horse merely for the purpose of converting it to his own use, under pretence of hiring it, and with a felonious intention to get possession of it, and the judges were unanimously of opinion, that in point of law, that was a felonious taking, although the delivery had been obtained from the proprietor: upon the authority therefore of that case; if you, gentlemen, are of opinion that this young man applied to Maydock for no other purpose but to get the mare into his possession, in order to sell her afterwards for money, and convert that money to his own use; upon that law which governs this case, it is my duty to tell you, that if that is your opinion on the evidence, the prisoner is guilty of the felony laid to his charge, in point of law; the question is, whether the evidence said before you, clearly satisfies your minds that the pains which this young man used to get Maycock to entrust the ward to his possession, under the pretence of going to Turnham-green to serve a subpoena, was a mere pretence, without any such intention in his mind at that time, and only made on purpose to get possession of the mare, in order to obtain the money by selling her; upon that the evidence to be sure is very strong, for in this case, the evidence of Landin proves an intention in the prisoner to sell the mare, before the first time of wanting to hire her to go to Haunshaw; and on the very same day he was applying to Maycock for the mare, on this very same day he was treating with Landin for the sale of her; one cannot help observing the extreme folly of the fact, for this unfortunate young man was known to both the persons with whom he was practising; he know he was personally known to Maycock; he knew he was personally known to Landin; they lived near each other, they knew each other; he told Landin it was Maycock's mare, therefore it was impossible he could have escaped detection, and he seems to have committed the fact with his eyes open in very uncommon degree; he made use of no false pretences to escape Landin; Landin knew the mare before, so that the utmost he could obtain by this, was the temporary possession of this money, at the risk of his life, and the chance of keeping out of the way; that extreme folly, to be sure, makes the story less probable, and renders stronger evidence necessary; but on consideration of the whole of the case, however foolish, and absurd, and mad the conduct of this young man has been, if it is sufficiently proved to your satisfaction, that the facts are true, the law must follow on those facts.</p>

               <p>The Jury retired for a short time, and returned with a verdict.</p>

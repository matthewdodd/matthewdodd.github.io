                  </hi>. I am assistant to Francis Soames, pawnbroker, Bethnal-green. An alarm was given on the 20th of July, about twelve o'clock—I pursued two men with Blanch—I secured the prisoner in Globe-lane, in the arch of the railway—Blanch produced four silk handkerchiefs which be<lb></lb>longed to my master—I gave the prisoner in charge—I had seen the handker<lb></lb>chiefs hanging inside the door a few minutes before twelve.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather cutter—I live in Green-street, Bethnal-green. I was standing in my shop, which is opposite the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner make two or three tugs at a bundle of handkerchiefs, get them down and make off with them—I sent my son over to give information while I ran after him—he had another man in his company, apparently—the prisoner got over a high fence—I lost sight of him for a moment—he came over the fence a little further on, and I secured him—I saw the handkerchiefs in, his hand.</p>

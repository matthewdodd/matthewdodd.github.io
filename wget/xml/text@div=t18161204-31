I lost the cotton on Saturday, the 23rd of November, about two o'clock in the afternoon; they were taken from within the shop; they were lying on the shutters. I was watching the prisoner about an hour before; he took the two pieces on his arm and was in the act of giving them to another person, who was with him; he reached over into the shop, he did not step in; the other man ran off, and I sent for an officer.</p>

I was going down the Minories, and seeing some handkerchiefs hanging by the door; I stopped to look at them; the gown-pieces were hanging by them; I lifted them up to look at them; the shopman ran out, and I knocked them down just as I was going to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040019"></xptr>ask the price; he laid hold of me, and gave me in charge.

                  </hi>I am an officer of the Mendicity Society. On the 27th of May, I saw the prisoner in company with three others—I watched them—I saw them attempt to pick different pockets, both ladies and gentlemen—I did not know him before—after having watched nearly in hour, I sent for assistance to take them for attempting to pick pockets—I searched the prisoner at Vine-street station-house, and in his right<lb></lb>hand pocket I found the pencil-case, compasses, and knife—I said, "Whose are these? "—he said, "My own, I bought them yesterday"—I made fur<lb></lb>ther search, and found the pocket-book in his coat pocket—he said he bought that yesterday—I then found four cards in the name of "Protheroe, " and then I went and asked him if he knew the name in the book—he said, "No, " he had had it given him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Did you take the others into custody? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, they were remanded and discharged—I saw the three persons—they all tried the pockets—there were six or seven people present at the station<lb></lb>house—if I saw a person commit a robbery I should take him.</p>

About half-past six o'clock, on the evening of the robbery, in consequence of an alarm given by Felstead, I went with him to Brooks's house - it was quite dark; the outer door was on the latch only. We entered the house, and saw two men standing at the foot of the stairs - one had a light in his hand; I immediately seized the poker, and they ran up stairs. I said they were going out at the window.

He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't take me." I secured him, and gave him to an officer. I do not know the other man - we were the first that entered the house,</p>

            . I live in Harford-street, Shoreditch, and am a turner. I was passing Brooks's house between six and seven o'clock in the evening; Chowns said somebody was robbing the house. I went and called Hedges; we went to the house and found the door ajar. - I pushed it open, went in, and Hedges followed. As soon as I got in, two men came down stairs - one had a light in his hand; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here they are!" The prisoners immediately hurried up stairs; Hedges got the poker - the window was pushed up. He opened the door, went out, and I followed him; we pursued Elliott. and as I was following him Sermon turned back, and passed us - the place is no thoroughfare; he was running. I pursued him, crying Stop him! When he got to the top of the gardens, a man with a gun in his hand met him, and he fell down; he recovered himself, and made his way across Kingsland-road; I, with assistance, secured him there. I never lost sight of him after he ran by me; we took him into the King's Head, public-house - he said he had been rascally ill-used, and had lost a hat, and a silk handkerchief, and he would seek his recompence. I first saw him about twenty yards from the house. They ran down the gardens, which are no thoroughfare.</p>

On the 17th of January I was returning from shooting, with a gun in my hand, and as I passed the end of Wilmore-gardens I heard the cry of Stop him! and saw a man running up.

Felstead and others secured him immediately; I assisted in taking him to the King's Head, public-house - it was Sermon. I got a light, returned to the spot where he fell, in less than ten minutes, and found a printed agreement with Brooks's name to it; a boy picked it up in my presence - I saw it given to Attfield.

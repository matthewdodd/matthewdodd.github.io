                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, and live at Denton-street, St. Pancras. At the end of Nov., in consequence of an advertisement, I went to 447, Oxford-street, and there saw Wright, who engaged me as his clerk—I was to make a deposit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for money that had to pass through my hands—I deposited 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day, and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the second—I believe that was 24th Nov.—my salary was to commence from 1st Dec.—the first day I went, I was sent a long way out to look at houses, and when I came back I was told I had nothing to do—the next day I went to another part of the town at a distance—when the week was out, I applied for my salary, and did not get any—Wright's card was "Wright and Co.," and "Wright and Co." was over the door—he told me James, Sparks and Campbell were his partners—after I had paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I was out with him, and we met James in New Oxfords street, and Wright said, "This is Mr. James my partner"—James heard that—Wright gave him two sovereigns, and said, "It is the two out of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have received of Davies; that will be your share"—James took it, and they went away together—I have seen James and Wright, and applied to them for my money—I have not been able to get it.</p>

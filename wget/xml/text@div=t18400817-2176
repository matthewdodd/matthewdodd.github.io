               <p>—I carry on business at Deptford, in Kent. The prisoner Wolledge had been in my service about two years—he was empowered to sell wood, and to receive the money—in consequence of something that had been said, I gave him directions to trust nobody, to sell only for money—he accounted for the wood sold by entering it down on a slate—I have here the slate on which he wrote on the 7th of July, and when he came in with it I asked him twice if that was all he had sold, whether on credit or otherwise—here is the slate—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"July 7—Whitewood, three feet of board, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—this is his handwriting—I asked him if that was all Whitewood had had, and if that was all he sold, whether on credit or otherwise, and he said it was—the value of three feet is 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4 feet is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him again about an hour after if he had given credit to any body, and he said he had not—his wages were 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—they had been at first 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I advanced them to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. without his asking me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's foreman of the blacksmiths. In consequence of something I told Mr. Ive, he told me to watch the pro<lb></lb>ceedings of Wolledge—on the 7th of July Whitewood's cart came into the yard—I watched and saw Wolledge put four feet of wood into the cart—Whitewood and Miller were at the grindstone, which was sixty or seventy feet from where the wood was loaded, but Whitewood had gone first and seen the wood measured in the frame—he saw four feet measured, and that was afterwards put into his cart—a foot of wood signifies a pile of pieces of wood of about eighteen inches long, and the pieces are piled in a frame six feet wide and six feet deep—I am not prepared to state how many pieces it will take to fill up one of these feet—I never examined them, but I should suppose about eighty—Mr. Ive asked Wolledge if he</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Ive. I was present, on the 7th of July, when the wood was put into White wood's cart—I helped to frame it—there were four feet put into the cart while Whitewood was at the grindstone grinding his hatchet—he did not see what was done, nor order that it should be done—I helped to load the four feet of wood into the cart—Wolledge asked me to do it—I said, "Let the man see the wood put in," and Wolledge said, "Never mind"—he said, "If Mr. Ive comes, say only three feet have gone in the cart"—he said <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> would stand a drop of beer if he let him have it—I loaded four feet into the frame, two feet six inches from one frame, and eighteen inches from the other.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I produce twenty dozen rules, five dozen dinner knives, and a quantity of other tools mentioned in this list—I got them from 98, London Road, where the prisoner Moore lives—I re<lb></lb>ceived them from Moore on 16th and 20th June—on 12th June I went to Messrs. Ross's warehouse in Houndsditch—I saw Fletcher there, and had a conversation with him—some time afterwards Moore came in—Fletcher said "I sold you one dozen of rules and a two dozen of rules, they are in packets"—Moore said "You did not"—Fletcher reminded him of the time, and he said "I did buy them"—I went over to Moore's house, and he gave up the goods—I had been trying to find goods be<lb></lb>longing to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Magistrate—I said then that Moore denied at first, but afterwards he said he had had the goods—I believe Mrs. Ross was present at the time—she declined to give Moore into custody till Mr. Ross arrived from Sheffield—Moore was ex<lb></lb>amined before the Magistrate as a witness.</p>

I am a customer of Mr. Ross's, and have known the prisoner for two or three years as his shopman; the goods which I delivered up on the 20th I gave to Mr. Ross because I believed a good many of them were his property, and I let him take them all. I can't say which of those goods I bought of the prisoner; I can't say that I bought any of them from him; I did not say to Mr. Ross, or to the officer, that I had bought the goods of the prisoner, or that that was the reason I gave them up. I would rather have given all the goods in my house than get into trouble. I travel the country as a hawker, and I sometimes sell in the country as a cheap jack."

                  </hi>. I am a tool manufacturer, and carry on business in Houndsditch—I went with Fluister on the 16th and also on 20th June to Moore's shop, and saw the property delivered up by Moore—the first lot delivered was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the last, on the 20th, about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something of that kind—Moore looked over his stock, and selected the goods he had received from Fletcher, which he considered belonged to me, and he picked out from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—we received information that there were other goods conveyed to Moore's house, and I went again with Fluister, and Moore then took me to his own residence, where he had con<lb></lb>veyed the goods, and fetched them from under the bed—that was on the 20th—I believe it was his sister's house—he brought down two or three hampers of goods, which we put into a cart and returned to Moore's house—it is my custom always to give invoices when goods are sold—Moore has been a customer of mine for many years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was my wish that invoices should be given in every case—Fletcher was a shopman of mine—he sold goods—it is quite possible that he sold goods without an invoice, but it would be contrary to the rules of the establishment if he did so—the house Moore took us to belonged to his sister—I am quite aware that he does not carry on business in any par<lb></lb>ticular place, but he moves about with his goods to various places; a kind of hawker—I had no intention of prosecution as regards Moore—he has been in my place since, and I have trusted him since, as late as Monday last, to the amount of a couple of pounds.</p>

            . I am a haberdasher, and live in Trump-street. On the 9th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in and asked me to give him large change for small; he was quite a stranger; he produced a shilling and a sixpence; he said he was intoxicated, and had met with an accident; I looked at the money and said it was bad; he made no answer. Smith came in immediately and took him.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in Honey-lane, Market. On the 9th of August, at nine o'clock in the morning, I took the prisoner in Wood's shop; I saw him go in and produce money, he had taken it up, and was coming out. I searched him and found one bad shilling, one bad sixpence, two good shillings, one good sixpence, and thirteen pence three farthings in copper on him. As I was taking him to the Compter I saw his hand in his jacket pocket, he drew it out, and I saw a piece of paper in it. When I got to the Compter, I took his hand out of his pocket; he then struck me in the mouth; I knocked him down, and took six sixpences, and two shillings from him him, all bad; I found some yellow soap and fat on him.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. The sixpences found in his hand are all bad, and of the same die, and appear not to have been in circulation; the two shillings are also bad, and from the same die, one of them has been rubbed with fat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had changed a sovereign, that he stumbled in the street, and his money fell from his pockets, he picked up two shillings, and a Jew picked up the rest and gave him.</p>

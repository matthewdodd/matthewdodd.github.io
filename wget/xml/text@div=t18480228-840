                  </hi> I am book-keeper to Esther Bisney, a butcher. The prisoner was in her employ—in consequence of something, I marked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and cooper, and put in into a box, which was fastened in a sitting-room—there were some half-crowns amongst it—it was opened by Mrs. Bisney on 15th feb., and I missed 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner was called into the room, and charged with taking some money—she took some from her pocket, and laid it on the table—it made up the money that was lost—she said it was part of her wages—the money was examined, and I found the marks on it which I had made.</p>

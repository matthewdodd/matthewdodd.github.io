                  </hi>. I manage the Britannia public house, in Britannia street, St. Pancras. On 22nd Jan. the prisoner came; I served him with a pint or half a pint of porter—he gave me in payment a shilling—I gave him change, and put the shilling into the till—there were only two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces and one 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the till; no other shilling—when I gave him the change he went out—I opened the till within a minute afterwards, and observed the shilling was dark; I looked at it, and found it was bad—I marked it, and locked it up—on the following day, Wednesday, I was still at the Britannia—the policeman came; I showed him the shilling I had taken the day before—while I was doing that Mark Mahony came in—he wanted change for a shilling—he gave the shilling to me—I' said, "This is a bad one, where did you get it from?"—he told me something, and in consequence of what he said, the constable went outside with him—(the constable was in plain clothes) he returned, and brought the prisoner with him—I recog<lb></lb>nized him, and I said, "That is the man that passed the shilling last night"—he said he was not in the house—I gave the constable the two shillings.</p>

On Wednesday, 23rd Jan., I was coming home from school, the prisoner stopped me in Britannia-street—he asked me to go across the road and get him change for a shilling—he pointed to the Britannia, I took the shilling, and gave it to Mr. Barnett—I told him who I got it from—the police constable went with me, I pointed the prisoner out to him—the prisoner was then at the other end of the street—I went to him; the prisoner asked me for the change—I told him it was a bad shilling—the constable took him—I had left the shilling with Mr. Barnett.</p>

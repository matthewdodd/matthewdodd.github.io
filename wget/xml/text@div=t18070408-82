While I was off my horse four persons came up to me: a tall man went by me within a yard of me, I put my glove on; at the time he was going by, I had my foot on the stirrup and the other going over the horse, when I was pulled down by the men; the tall one came up, they did not ask me any thing at all, they all rifled my pockets; I was standing with my back to the horse, they searched all my pockets and took every thing they could; I stood quiet, I had no power to do any thing, they said not a word to me; when they all four had rifled my pockets, I said to them, gentlemen I hope you will not use me ill; I was then standing, and they all four around me; the tall man knocked me down directly; the blow cut me very much under my eye.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not know whether it was his first or with a weapon. - A. I do not. Then after he had knocked me down they began thrashing of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Are you quite sure it was the tall man that knocked you down. - A. Yes; I was laying on the ground when they thrashed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take from you all the money and notes - A. Yes, the money notes and all I had about me I had about a dozen little errands for my family in my pockets. I received many blows from them on my body; they beat me with sticks. They all went away; the tall man went away about three yards he came back, he said old man you have got a good great coat, he pulled it off; I was laying on the ground at the time. I was not able to get up, I saw him put it on, he turned back to me again, and put a pistol to my head, and said you rascal if you follow us a yard, we will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen a pistol before. - A. Yes, in the tall man's hand; he jobbed the pistol to the side of my head, and went away; they went towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were you able to get up and get on your horse again. - A. I suppose in the space of five or ten minutes; when I go on my horse I went after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080045"></xptr> Q. Now during the time the men were robbing of you, did you or did you not look in their faces. - A. Yes; the tall man was dressed in a blue jacket and trowsers, like a sailor, with round nobby buttons, and a blue handkerchief round his neck; two of the others were in light brown, one a drab cloth, and the other a Bath coating; they had nothing over their faces.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether either of them are the men that robbed you. - Q. Yes, they are the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them do you describe as the tallest. - A. Hayes, in the blue jacket; he came back and took my coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you equally sure of them all. - A. I am equally as sure of one as I am of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see them again - A. In about ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went after them to London, did you get sight of them again. - A. No; I met two friends on the road, it was light enough to see their faces. I saw four men at Shadwell office, and the three prisoners were among them; I knew them directly. Hayes was not dressed on the first examination as he was when he robbed me; the second and third examination he was dressed the same as when he robbed me. I had no doubt of their being three of the persons that robbed me. I knew them on the second examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have never been fortunate enough to recover your property. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never known these persons in your life before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the only opportunity that you had of observing their persons was, at the time they were robbing of you. - Q. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you were a good deal alarmed at four persons coming up to you. - A. I was not frightened, I was rather alarmed; I looked at them very much before they knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. How much time might it take up while they were robbing of you. - A. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been of the same opinion that you were equally sure with respect to all of them. - A. On the third examination I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not certain at the first examination. - A. I was, but I did not mark them out; I only marked out Hayes and Merrit.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Shadwell office, had you given information to Bow-street office. - A. I did as well as I could on the Monday after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe their dress then as you have now. - A. I cannot tell, I was very ill, I described them as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You have now said the tall man was dressed in a blue coat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you have ever said he was dressed in a dark great coat that must be a mistake of your's. Are you quite correct when you stated to my learned friend just now, that at the time of the robbery, that the tall man put on the great coat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you have ever said the short man put on the great coat that is a mistake too. - A. I never said so to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it is put down in the book so at Bow-street office there is a mistake somewhere. - A. There is a mistake somewhere, I never said so in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - A. It was moon light. I am certain as to their persons.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. You are a police officer of Shadwell. - A. I am; I apprehended the prisoner Hayes, in company with Mr. Brown. On Saturday the 21st of March we took him in bed, at a place called Chiswell Hill, Ratcliffe Highway; there was laying by the bed a large great coat, such as riggers wear; he had a jacket which he put on under that, he had blue trowsers, there was a blue silk handkerchief laying by them. Brown and I apprehended Merrit in Essex-street, Whitechapel, commonly called Catherine Wheel-alley; he was in bed at the time. The coat which was joined to the rest of his clothes was a drab coloured coat. We took Roach on the Saturday following; he was in bed at a house in Parish-street, in the Borough; we took him to the office. Hayes was examined in a dark drab coat; on the second examination, Hayes was dressed in a blue jacket, without the long coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor came the first time, did he speak to any of them. - A. He pointed out Hayes and Merrit. On the second examination he pointed out the same men; he looked at Roach, but said he would take time to consider of him. On the third examination he swore positively to the three.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course, being an officer, you know there is a forty pound reward. - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been able to discover any of the property. - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Hayes' Defence. I solemnly declare my innocence before God, and this court; I had no hand in the act, or part in it, nor was I ever on the road since I came in the world.</p>

You must understand that my wife's birth day was on the 17th; I can give you another instance, which will satisfy you further; there was a woman in the house, she asked Merrick to treat her with a glass of liquor, he denied it, he said he had a guinea in his pocket, it was as much as he could do to pay his way; Mrs. Merrick came in, and there was a little bit of jealously, Merrick struck his wife, she was turned out, and she broke one of the windows, and it is not mended yet.

               <p>Q. At what hour. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not she ask you whether you recollected shaving him any particular hour. - A. Not at that time, she did about three days afterwards; she then asked me what hour her husband was in my shop, told her about my supper hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you subpoenaed. - A. Last Friday night, by an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the public house, can you tell me how many persons were there. - A. There were great many, Lane and Lane's wife was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing. - A. They were drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were drinking. - A. I thought they were drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they drinking or dancing, as you was there you can tell me. - A. They were drinking, Cohen was in the same tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Merrit sitting and drinking with. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord there. - A. I saw a man there they called Davey. The landlady's sister served me, the landlady was laying in, she is not expected to live; she was sick a bed, and is now; I just looked in to see if any of my customers that had been in my shop were there.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought you would have looked in to see whether any of your customers that had not been in your house were there, that is most likely; give me a reason for your looking in to see if any of your customers that were shaved were in there; is it your habit to go there and see if any of your customer are in that house. - A. On Saturday night when the shop is vacant I go in, if I see any of my customers I tell them the shop is vacant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You told me you were looking after customers that were shaved, you took my hint very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You shave a great many persons resident in that neighbourhood. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday night you go there for your beer, to see if any one wants shaving - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What is there makes you recollect his shaving late on that Saturday. - A. Because I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no reason; have you any reason for saying so; is there any circumstance that fixes it on your mind, that that man was shaved late rather than early, if there is no circumstance you will say so. - A. None sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing was quiet when you went in the public house. - A. Yes, there were girls of the town there; I recollect a noise in the public house, like making a fight; after I got my supper beer, they said this Merrick was fighting his wife; I understood the next day there was a pane of glass broke; the young woman told me Merrick shoved his wife against it, and broke it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it mended. - A. I cannot tell, it was mended within a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is mended. - A. I think so, I am sure it is, I saw the panes of glass were all right.</p>

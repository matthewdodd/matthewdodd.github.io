It is usual with me to go with my servants of a night, to see my horses racked up; I did so on the 16th of November, at about eight o'clock, and then went in as usual to supper; after supper I saw all the family in bed.</p>
               <p>About what time did you see all the family to bed? - About nine o'clock; I then went down into the kitchen and saw the kitchen window was fast; I went into the hall and saw the hall door fast; I went out and made water under the parlour window, and saw it was shut, but I did not go into the parlour, to see if it was fast; I locked the parlour door and went up to bed.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080030"></xptr>Was the parlour the place where the burglary was committed? - It was; I was in my chamber when the clock struck nine; I had just got up. It is the usual way for my servants who mind the horses to get up at five o'clock; I came down about six the next morning and went into the stable to see after my horses; coming back to my house I saw the parlour window open, that was about a quarter after six, the shutters are seldom shut there is a wall round my house; it has formerly been a kind of fort; it is a sash window.</p>
               <p>Was there any screw in the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The shutters were shut? - No, the shutters are seldom shut, the sash was.</p>
               <p>Was it daylight then? - No, it was not. I halloo'd immediately to

            , to know if he had been near the house; he said no; I bid him come then for I was afraid there was some body in the house.</p>
               <p>How many had you in family? - My wife, myself, two girls, two boys and a man. the housekeeper was sick. The boys are always first up. I went into the room and found the parlour door locked as I left it.</p>
               <p>You left the key in the parlour door when you went to bed? - Yes; there is a staircase in the parlour that leads into the cellar; opposite this staircase there is a light twelve inches wide and eighteen inches high, that light was pulled out of its frame and broke to pieces. I missed two tea-chests, one of them a plain one, that stood on the sideboard which had been used at seven o'clock the night before. I missed china cups and saucers, which I breakfast with every morning; they stood on the mahogany breakfast table like a sideboard, with the plain tea-chest; I had used them the morning before; and a china slop-bason. There was a clothes-press in the room; the maid said there was a table-cloth taken out of that.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing lost out of the cellar? - They had broke a hole through the wainscot into the wine cellar; I missed some Lisbon wine, and some Mountain. I went to a pawnbroker's at the end of Hounslow, where they sell china, to see if I could find my china.</p>
               <p>Did you find any china? - No; but the girl said there had been a woman there with some, and she gave me a description of the woman and her mother advised me to go on to Brentford. Just at the end of Hounslow, I saw the prisoner on the Maidenhead coach; she was mussled up, I could not see whether it was her or no.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was this? - Between eight and nine o'clock, a little after eight. The prisoner had lived a servant with me about a twelve-month before. I was on the off side of the coach, then I went on the near side, and saw it was her, and said Maria, where are you going; she made no answer. I asked the coachman where he took her up; he said at Colnbrook. I desired the coachman to stop, that I had a strong suspicion of his passenger; he was very morose and would not stop, but drove on suriously; I then rode on to Mr. Polliant, a constable, at Brentford, and got the coach stopped; the coachman would not let the constable take her off the coach till I had paid her fair, which I did, and which was one shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you search her? - The constable asked for her bundles; she said she had none. Polliant said she had; the coachman then got down and put two bundles out of the coach; as soon as I saw them I knew they were my things; there were the two tea-chests tied up in the table-cloth.</p>
               <p>Did you find the china there? - Yes. We took her to the King's Arms, and then to Mr. Drinkwater the justice.</p>
               <p>Did she own her bundles? - I cannot say that she did, I did not ask her.</p>
               <p>Did she at any time after? - I do not know that she did.</p>
               <p>Was she committed? - Yes, on suspicion of the burglary.</p>
               <p>- POLLIANT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I know nothing of the matter but only taking the woman off the coach; the coachman delivered the bundles out.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner acknowledge they were her bundles? - No, not positively, I believe.</p>

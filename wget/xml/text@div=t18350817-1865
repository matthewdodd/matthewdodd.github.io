                  </hi>. I am a labour, and live with my father, Theo<lb></lb>philus Sunman, in Wick-lane, Old Ford, in the parish of St. Mary Stratford-le-bow. On the 12th of August, I went out, and padlocked the house—my mother had the key—she gave me the key about oneo'clock in the day time, and I went to the house—it is a lone house—I found the padlock had been opened, and hanging on the chain—I went in, and heard somebody coming down stairs—I said nothing, but the moment he opened the door, I caught him by the collar—he was a stranger—he struggled with me, and gave me a blow which knocked me down—I had a long scuffle with him, and at last he got away, leaving his coat and hat behind—he ran across the fields—I pursued, and lost sight of him for a short time; but he was soon taken—it was the prisoner—I know he is the same person he was taken without a coat or hat—on going into the room, I foud three silk hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs, and a pair of trowsers of mine removed, and ten shillings and sixpence taken out of the pockets of the trowsers—they were not carried out of the house—the three silk handkerchiefs were brought down stairs, out of my box—the money was found in the prisoner's coat pocket—I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

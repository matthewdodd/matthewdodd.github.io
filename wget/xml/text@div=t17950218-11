               <p>I am an officer belonging to Whitechapel public office. On the 22d of January, Thursday, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw this boy, Nash, with something in a kind of nail bag that the cooper's carry their tools in, and I see Jones following at a little distance, it was in King-street, Tower-hill; I suspected something, I went up to Nash -</p>
               <p>Q. In what direction were they going? - Towards East-smithfield. I asked him what he had got there? he said he did not know; he said, the cooper was behind who would tell me, I turned round and I observed Jones run up the corner of another street as sharp as possible; as soon as I said hold of the boy there happened to be a person just by, I gave Nash in charge of him and went after Jones, I went up to him and I said, now you have got the boy into a hobble you are going to leave him; he said, what boy? I don't know of any boy; on which I said to him, come with me down to him. I brought him back to the boy, and I asked the boy if that was the man? he said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing and presence of Jones? - It was as close as they stand now. I asked him what tho boy had got? he said, it was a little dirty grease that somebody had given to him, the scrapings of some casks; I examined it but I did not know it was oil myself, it was so froze and in such a congealed state.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy Nash say any thing more about it? - He persisted he did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180019"></xptr>know what it was; I asked him where he had it from? he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that in the hearing of Jones? - No, he did not; I took Nash with me down into Thames-street, to shew me the warehouse where he had it from.</p>
               <p>Q. What warehouse did you go to? - On Chester Key, he said, that was the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you learned whose warehouse that is since? - I have seen Mr. Batley's clerk since that, and he says it is their warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see any of Mr. Batley's servants on that spot afterwards? Did you ever see Mr. Batley there? - No, I have not, I have seen his clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the magistrate was any thing said either by Jones or the boy? - Jones confessed it all before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken in writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it was taken in writing did any body tell him it would be better for him to confess? - No, there was nothing said of it in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of the property since? - It has been locked up in one of our places ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. It is now in a liquid state? - No, it is froze again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the care of it ever since? - The property has been in my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the property yourself from the prisoner? - Yes, from Nash.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Follitt? - I apprehended Wager, and he told of Follitt.</p>

About what time of the day was it that Follitt put it into the apron of a man that came with Nash, and they went away? - About the middle of the day, I cannot say particularly when; on the return of Nash and this man, they brought a pot of purl, they said they had sold it in East Smithfield for eighteen-pence, at an iron shop; and when this Jones had done his work (he worked piece work) he said he knew two people in Petticoat-lane to fell the oil to.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were present then? - There were two, Follitt I think was one, I cannot say to the other; I was not there after that; I went with a jack to fill up at a different part of the Key, at my employment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear it said by any body, what was to be done with this oil that was put into the bag? - Jones was going to carry it to Petticoat-lane, to two places where he knew where to fell it at; at that night when he returned, we were to meet at the Ipswich Arms, in Lower Thames-street, these three and me, Follitt, Jones, and Nash.</p>

            Did they come? - No; after that me and Follitt went over the water, to Jones's house, to see whether he had not been home; he had not been home; then we went from there to a public house the corner of Bermondsey-street, the Shipwright's Arms, we did not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you gave this account of your share in the transaction? - How came you to tell of this matter? - I thought it was the best way to tell of it when I was taken up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you tell your master, or Mr. Ailwyn? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to have a slice of it, a part of the booty, and you went to Jones's house afterwards; it was very unlucky not to find him at home; so then your share, how much was it to be? - I did not know what he was going to sell it for.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to have for your share? - An equal part.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a very unlucky thing that you did not get your share of it; and the moment you got before a magistrate, out you came with this story, and not before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you save yourself from being tried at this bar by giving your evidence? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in custody ever since, and brought down in custody to the court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Ailwyn. What quantity is there now produced? - About four gallons, it is worth four shillings and eleven pence a gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sort of oil that Mr. Batley had the charge of? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones to Wager. You say I was present on the Key when that man took the oil away in his apron; I was not within a hundred yards; I was at the bottom of the key. - It is false.</p>

               <p>Q. He says he see me and the boy go down with the oil; I went a different way. - He was behind the boy, when the boy got to the top of the gateway he was in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. He says, I said, I knew two people that would buy the oil, I never said such a word. - He said he knew two men in Petticoat-lane that he knew would buy the oil.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Nash. That man says, that how I took oil into the cellar, and put it into a bag, it is a false thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Wager. Do you say it is true on your oath, what you said before? - It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Nash. I am a hard working man, and being out of constant employ, I went down to the Key to see if I could earn a sixpence; and I walked down the Key, and was returning back again, finding no work to do, and as I was returning I see a fire; I went to the fire to warm my hands, and there Follitt asked me to carry a load, and directed me down into this cellar along with Jones, and one of them desired me to go to Petticoat-lane with it, with Jones, and when I came to Petticoat-lane, Jones sent me into a public house to call for a pint of beer; I went into the public house and called for a pint of beer, and Jones went to see if he could find this man that he was directed to with this oil, he could not, and he came back to me, and told me he would take the oil from whence it came; as I was coming back with it, one of the officers stopped me, and asked me what I had got there?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180023"></xptr>I told him I did not know what it was, the man behind would tell him what it was; Jones as soon as he see I was stopped, turned round the corner, and went away from me; the officer followed him, and brought him up to me; he then denied he knew me; the officer asked me if that was the man, and I said. yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. On Thusday, the 22d of January, I was at work for Mr. Batley, on Brewer's Key; Mr. Batley sent for me three days before to do this job, out of charity, as I had no work to do. I have got a wife and three small children. So I finished this job about half past two o'clock, and I said to Wager, I am going; says Wager, you shall not go till we are done this job, and Wager d-ned his eyes, and said, I should not stir from the place till they had done; at last I consented, and lent them a hand to fill up the oil for about an hour; this bag was filled while I was filling the cask up, and I was ordered to go with it, by Wager's orders, and I went to the man that I was directed to, and the man was not at home, and the woman would not take it in, and so I agreed to take it back again, not knowing what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Follitt. I leave all it to my counsel.</p>

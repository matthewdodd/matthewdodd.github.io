                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Buist, of 3, Julia Street, Kentish Town—on 19th or 20th February I served the prisoner with some sugar, mustard, and other articles—she gave me a half-crown, and I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I saw it was bad, but did not tell her so—I placed it on the side of the desk, and my husband took possession of it in the even<lb></lb>ing—on 7th May my assistant Arney called me into the shop and gave me a bad florin—the prisoner was there, and I said to her., "Are you aware this is a bad two-shilling piece"—she said "If it is, my husband gave it to me"—I said "You are the person who passed a bad half-crown on the 19th or 20th February, and gave her in custody with the florin and half-crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Although I knew the half crown was bad I gave her the full change, making no remark, though she remained ten minutes talking about the cat, which I thought was to draw off my attention—I am not quite sure that I saw her in my shop before February 19th, but I am certain I have seen her face either in the shop or in the neighbourhood—I did not see her between February and May—I think it was light when she came on 7th May—there was no gas alight.</p>

               <p>CATHERINE WILLER. I am a widow, and live at Poplar; I have two single men lodge with me, nobody else. On Tuesday, the 6th of October, I left home about six o'clock in the evening, and left nobody at home-the door has a spring lock. I left the lock on the spring-the house was made quite fast. One of the lodgers had a key of the door. I returned home about ten minutes after seven o'clock, and found the street - door opened, apparently with a false key. I missed a gown out of the room, and a carpet off the floor-neither of my lodgers had returned. About half-past eight o'clock, the lodger who had the key came home, he is a locker-up at the West India Docks-it was his usual time for coming home.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live in Cable-street, Whitechapel; I know both the prisoners; Fligan has bought and sold me things. I have seen them about for the last six months. On Tuesday, the 6th of October, between seven and eight o'clock, or rather nearer eight, both the prisoners came to my shop. The man had the carpet under his arm, and asked me to buy it. I refused - They left. I afterwards heard of the robbery at Poplar. On Thursday, the man brought me the duplicate of the carpet, and asked me to buy it. I gave information to Freeman, who took him. Freeman gave me two keys, which I tried with the prosecutrix's door-one of them opened it with ease.</p>

            . I am an officer. Lewis gave me information, and I apprehended Fligan at his shop. He said he would shew me where he lived, and took me to a court up one pair of stairs - I found Stephens there.

I took him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280011"></xptr>office, returned, and found part of a gown in the room, and two keys in the table-drawer. The prisoners cohabited together.</p>

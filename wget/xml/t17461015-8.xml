               <p>Constable. On the 16th of September last the City Marshal said he had a Warrant to take up Lake the Prisoner , and ask'd me if I would serve it; I asked him where he (Lake) was; he said in Wood-Street Compter for a Quarrel in Bartholomew-Fair ; he said he could not let him go, except the Lord Mayor would discharge him, and he did discharge him. When he was in the Coach, he reflected much upon Collet, and said, Men are easily frightned ; I would as soon be D - d as to do any such Thing. The Prisoner said, my Friends would have had me have done this six Weeks ago; I said what; he said, turn Evidence, but he would as soon be D - d as do any such Thing, for Men are frightned , said he, at their own Shadow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that Collet and he were well acquainted?</p>
               <p>Constable. Yes.</p>

               <p>Lake. I am the unfortunate Mother of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Give an Account of what you know of your Son's coming home, and how long he kept the House.</p>
               <p>Lake. He came home the 8th of May; he was taken ill when he came home, and it prov'd to be the Itch; he did not go out from the 8th to the 22d, I won't say he kept one Room, because he might go out of one into another.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so particular to the 22d of May.</p>
               <p>Lake. I'll give you a very good Reason for it; for my Husband and this Lad of mine was at Maidstone Fair the 1st of May.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he never lay out of Nights?</p>
               <p>Lake. To the best of my Knowledge he never lay out, except it was when he was at a Fair.</p>

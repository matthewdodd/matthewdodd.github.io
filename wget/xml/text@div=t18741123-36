                  </hi>. I live at 19, Lombard Street, Mile End New Town, and am a stableman—the prisoner had been lodging with me, and was so still, up to the 26th October last—that night my wife, self, and children went to bed at about 11 o'clock, at which time all was safe and right—about midnight I was aroused, and found my sitting-room on fire; the Venetian blind and work-table were burning—the sitting-room was the ground floor back—there was a wainscot partition between the passage and the back room—we put the fire out with the help of two young men—the prisoner's room was at the top, and when we went there we found the sheet, bed, and everything burnt—the prisoner was not then in the house—he did not sleep there that night—we worked at the same place—I have heard since that there was some ill-feeling between the prisoner and my wife—she is here—the prisoner had a key, and could let himself in at once <hi rend="italic"></hi>; there was a candle in his room upstairs—there were no matches up there—the prisoner would have to pass the partition in coming into the house.</p>

At about 7.30 on the morning of the 27th October the prisoner was given into my custody on the charge of setting this house on fire—I told him what he was given into oustody for, and he said "Quite right, I have done it"—he made some statement to the Inspector at the time, that whatever came into his mind at the lime it was bound to occur—the Inspector asked him if he did it by accident or wilfully, and he said he could not swear—I examined the house, and discovered two distinct fires, one in the bed-room and the other in the sitting-room.</p>

I was called on the 27th October, about 1.25 in the morning, to go to Lombard Street, Mile End New Town—I went, and found a fire had been put out in the house, No. 19—I examined the premises, and found there had been fire outside and inside the partition between the passage and the parlour—I went into the bedroom on the first floor, and found a hole burnt in the back of the bedstead, two distinct fires—there was plaster on one side of the partition on the ground floor, and sacking and paper on the other—it had been fired on both sides—the plaster was next the parlour, and the other side next the passage—the paper on the inside of the plaster was burning—it was plastered and then papered—you could see through it; the hole was burnt through.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was some kind of linen hanging from the bed that had been burnt—your statement made at the police-station was that it was one of your own shirts—I could not say whether the place was set on fire wilfully or by accident—my first impression was, that some one had jumped out of bed hurriedly and set it on fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I believe the statement made was that the fire broke out at 12.30. At 12.30 I was outside a public-house, talking to my brother; the public-house was closed. I had been sitting in the public-house with my brother, and I could not have been indoors.</p>

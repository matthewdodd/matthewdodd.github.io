I took one to one Compter, and the other to the other; there was nothing found on the other but a brass castor, which does not belong to this prosecutor; I asked the prisoner Richards where his father-in-law lived, he told me in Blue-court, Saffron-hill; he did not lodge there; I heard him say to Butler, let my father know, and he said he lodged in Long-lane, his name is Dennison, a taylor; I went and searched there, and under the table I found all the property which is in the indictment, they were in a bag, and I divided them for each of the owners to own their property; they are the same that were found in the apartments, (the things produced and deposed to) belonging to the prosecutor.</p>

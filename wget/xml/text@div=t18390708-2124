                  </hi>. I live at Broomfield-house, Clapham. I arrived at Ascot-heath from Oxford, on the last day of May—I had a carpet-bag with me—it was removed to my mother's carriage—it contained a dress<lb></lb>ing-case and some shirts, which I had brought from Oxford—the dressing-case contained some silver fittings, a brush-handle, and Some bottle-tops—they were marked with a crest—I lost the bag and its contents.</p>

On the 11th of June, in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I was in the Borough, and followed Margaret Daley about twenty yards—I saw her join the prisoner—I went tip, and took from the prisoner's hand these pieces of silver, which I produce—I asked them both where they got it—Daley said she knew nothing about it, but came with her to sell it, and the prisoner said she found them two years</p>

               <p>before in some dust in Ireland—I took them both into custody, and on the second examination I returned the pieces of silver to the prisoner, as no owner came forward—I afterwards apprehended her at No. 22, James-place—I asked her where the silver was that she had last week—she said her husband had sold it, and she did not know where—I remained in the house for half an hour, when a man named Rawlins came in, and brought the silver—he said the prisoner had brought it to him for sale—these are the brush-handle and bottle-tops—I know they are the same that I took from her hand, in the Borough—here is a crest on them, which has been attempted to be erased—I assisted to search the house, and found two shirts in a box.</p>

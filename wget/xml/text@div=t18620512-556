                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Charles Buss, tailor, of 34, Holborn-hill—on 14th April, a little before 7 in the evening, our shopman and lad were both oat, so I went into the shop to attend to a customer, and whilst doing so I saw the prisoner come in with three bundles of wadding, apparently to sell, which is a usual thing in our trade for such men—I saw him very rapidly takes a coat off the nest, in which some coats were kept, and conceal it under the wadding—I was then standing on a chair, getting some goods to show to the customer—I jumped down, placed myself between the door and the prisoner, and said, "What do you want?"—he said, pointing to the wadding, "Do you want any wadding?"—I said, "You have taken a coat off that nest"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have, you have stolen a coat"—he attempted to get away—I seized him by the collar, and called our young man, who was at the back; the prisoner struggled hard with me, and I with him; I clung to him, and he got me out on to the pavement some eight or nine yards—I kept hold of him—I saw this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) drop from him in the shop—it was afterwards found in the lobby, where no coat ought to be—it was taken to the station—it is my master's property—it cost us 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

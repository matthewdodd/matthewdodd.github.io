                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 19th of August I belonged to the Metropolitan Police force—about ten o'clock, on the night of that day, I was on duty in Long-acre, and saw a great crowd of persons, and observed a policeman with a person in custody—the crowd were fol<lb></lb>lowing them down Bow-street, crying out, "Knock him down, don't let him take the prisoner"—I was coming up to the constable's assistance, and received a blow from a stone or brick on the left side of the head—I was then within nine or ten yards of the constable who had the man in custody</p>

               <p>—the stone came from the middle of the street—I did not see the person who threw the stone—it struck me with considerable force, and cut my hat right through—I fell down, and received a great bruise on the shoulder, and another on the breast—I fell in consequence of the blow—I got up—I do not know whether by assistance or without, and got to the station in Bow-street—the surgeon saw my wound—I have been laid up from then to the present time—the shoulder is very bad at present—I suffered very much from the wound on the head for a fortnight.</p>

On the 19th Of August, between eleven and saw a mob coming from Lincolin's-inn<lb></lb>Fields towards longs-arce—I went to the station to give information—I was returning back up Bow-street, and met Hibbs, F 85, with a prisoner in his custody, followed by the mob, who were hissing and shouting at the police—the prisoner was pointed out to me by a gentleman—he was hiss<lb></lb>ing and yelling—I took him into custody—he resisted, and struck me a violent blow across the mouth—I succeeded in getting him to the station after some time.</p>

Warren—it was after ten o'clock—I do not think it was half-past—the street was not pretty full of police all the evening—there was a reserve at the station—I have, resigned my situation.</p>

I heard a disturbance in the neighbourhood on this night, and went into Bow-street to see what it was—I saw a man in custody of a policeman, and a crowd of persons assembled—I saw Sweeney knocked down by something thrown at him—I was standing by the side of the person who threw it—the prisoner is the man—I said it was a shame and others of the mob began to get round me—I pointed out the prisoner to Woolf—I did not lose sight of him till the policeman came up, not till Woolf took him—he slipped behind one or two men directly after he threw the stone, when I called out it was a shame—I did not lose sight of him recognised him afterwards at the station.</p>

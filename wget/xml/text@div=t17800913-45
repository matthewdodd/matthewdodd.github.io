I followed her; I stopped her and found she had the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) in her apron; when I stopped her I asked her if she had any thing to sell? She pulled out a silver mug, and then a silver milk pot; I stopped the plate, and took her to Justice Sherwood's office. He took the plate and said he would advertise it. I am sure these things are my master's property. She said she bought the plate of a Jew; she did not deny taking these things.</p>

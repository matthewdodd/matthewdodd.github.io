                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman and live at 3, Cross Street—on 2nd August I was in Thomas Street, Hackney Road, about 12.15 with my brother—we met' the prisoner and another man—the prisoner pushed me forcibly into the road—I said "Why did you do that?"—they both spoke and said "What are you making a row about—the man with the prisoner said "Well, I will fight this man," meaning my brother—I put out my hand to signify that no fighting was required, as I could not <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out because I was labouring under great hoarseness, and the prisoner struck me over the eye which staggered me for a time, and when I recovered myself) saw my brother sitting in the road with his left hand behind him and his right arm raised saying "Don't, don't," and bleeding from his mouth and nose—the prisoner was in front of him making a kick at his chest—there were six of them altogether, and two were holding my brother down while the prisoner kicked him—I threw myself on top of my brother right in front of the prisoner to save him from the kick, and received a kick in the seat from the prisoner—I then had a struggle with two or three of them, and put my back against the railings for protection—another man came up and forced me against the railings, and while I was pressed there the prisoner struck me three times, and hit me once on my head and once on my face—he then ran away—I then missed my watch from my waistcoat pocket, and I believe the man who forced me against the railings took it—I went into the Hackney Road and</p>

This was after midnight—we had been to See bright Street to a private house—I had had, it may have been, a pint of mild ale—my brother was with me from 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but I had been sleeping after 3 o'clock as I work during the night—we only went into one public-house—I said at the police court that when I recovered I saw my brother held down by three men, also that another man was holding me against the railings, and while the other man was taking my watch the prisoner struck at me three times, two of which hit me—I cannot say whether that was read over to me in my depositions—I was not knocked down, but I was sent reeling.</p>

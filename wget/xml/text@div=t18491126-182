                  </hi>. I keep a shoe-warehouse, in Crown-street, Fins-bury. In the beginning of July, the prisoner called and gave an order to my brother, who is my partner, to send some boots and shoes to 34, Lisle-street, Kent-road—we said we could not send them unless he paid or lefts deposit—he promised that he would call again in the afternoon, but he did not—in a fortnight afterwards he called again, and gave us a fresh order, and we were to send the goods next day—he left ten shillings deposit—we sent them, and desired the porter not to leave them without the balance of the money—we did not consider the deposit as part payment—we did not like to send the goods at all—we gave the porter directions several times not to leave them without the money; and when he was gone, 1 sent after him to say so.</p>

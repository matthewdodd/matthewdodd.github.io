On Thursday morning, the 17th of February, about eleven o'clock, I went into Houndsditch, to Mr. Davis; I got twelve pair of stuff for twelve pair of shoes; going home with them (it was a cold morning) I went into a public-house, and called for half a pint of beer, and while I was taking my half pint of beer and warming myself, the prisoner came and took the bag and the leather off the table. I did not take any notice of the man when he came in, only I saw him brush off with it. I pursued him, and took him at the end of Colchester-street, by Church-lane. I took hold of the man and the property. I brought him back to the house. He was very unwilling to give it up. I got it from him, and gave him in charge of an officer.</p>

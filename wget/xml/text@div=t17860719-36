               <p>I am a waterman at the King's-head, Broad-street, Bloomsbury; I took the horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190063"></xptr> and the mare both in; we have a livery stable at the King's-head; I took it in at four minutes past half an hour after two in the morning; when I went in to get the key of the gate, I looked at the dial; it was on the Wednesday morning the 28th, I took her in from the prisoner, he brought them both in his hand, and said, they belonged to one Mr. Hamilton; they were neither of them saddled, the prisoner was on foot, he desired me to take particular care of them, and give them what corn they would eat, and about six the same morning he should come for the horse; it was light enough to distinguish the person of the prisoner; there are lamps near the door, and they were lighted; I never saw the prisoner before at the house to my knowledge, and I have been there nine years.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with certainty as to his being the person? - I can with a very clear conscience; in the morning he came for the horse, and left the mare, it was not three o'clock when he went away, and when he came back again it was about a quarter past six; I saw him come up the ride the second time, and Mr. Wood delivered out the horses; I am sure he was the same man that came before, for I had the horse in my hand when he came up.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he demanded the horse? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he did demand the horse? Not to my knowledge; when I saw him at the office I was sure he was the same man.</p>

               <p>I am an hostler to Mr. Bishop, at the King's-head in St. Giles's, that night we were so full of horses, we were forced to take out three into the ride, we had a brown gelding we were obliged to tie out upon the ride; it belonged to a man, the corner of Great Earle-street, when I came in the morning to help the hackney coachmen, I said, I will be d - nd if I have not lost a horse off the ride; and the coachman said, if you have lost one never mind, Dickey has found two; I went into the six stall stable and there I saw the brown gelding and the chesnut mare tied against two other horses; I said, whose are they, he said, they belonged to one Mr. Hamilton, I said where is the bridles and the saddles, he said, there was none come, and says he, d - n the mare jumped over the bar, and had like to have jumped over me; I answered him, I will be d - nd if they are not stolen horses; I was going down the ride, and the prisoner came up and said, have you taken care of them horses that came in this morning, have you fed them, I told him I had not, he said, I want the brown horse to fit a bit on to go to Bath; I said, I will give him another feed of corn, and while I am rubbing him down he will eat it, as he is come off a journey, he said d - n him he is as hard as brass; he pulled a snaffle bridle out of his pocket, I asked him who it belonged to, he said it was a young mare a favourite, and belonged to Mr. Hamilton, and I must be sure to take care of it, and he said he would come at ten to see the mare fed the same morning; I delivered him the horse, he took it away at a quarter after six.</p>

               <p>Did you see him afterwards? - Yes, about three in the afternoon I was going out, he came in, and I was rather cross, says I, d - n it, you never come to your time, I have fed the mare, and watered her; he said nothing to me about the mare, only that it was very well; I saw no more of him, I went over to my mistress, and asked her his direction, but he was not present; I was with Knight at the office, this is the mare that was at the office, Mr . Blacketer came and detained the mare the next morning; when I had this conversation with the prisoner, he was at the stable door, the mare stood facing him, he told me to take care of her, that it was a young mare, and a very great favourite; she is a chesnut mare, with a blood tail, and a star in her forehead, she has one white foot, she has no more white about her legs.</p>

               <p>Are you sure she had only one white foot? - Yes, a white fetlock joint.</p>
               <p>Did you examine her accurately? - Yes, and to the best of my knowledge it is the off leg behind; I had the mare in my care; I saw Mr. Walker at the office, as soon as he saw the mare, he said it was Mr. Dowse's property; I can swear that three legs have no white about them.</p>

               <p>I belong to the office in Litchfield-street, the prisoner was in my custody, I found the chesnut mare at the King's Head in Broad Saint Giles's with a blaze on her face; that was the mare that Mr. Walker saw; I believe it was between seven and eight on the Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Did any of the witnesses that are now in court, and have given evidence, tell you who brought this mare to them? - The hostler, whose name I have forgot, I told him to stop her, and let nobody have her; I know he was advertised, I observed her one night, I think she has a little white on one of her heels, she is a pretty looking mare, a very fine looking mare, Mr. Walker said he knew the mare to be Mr. Dowse's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who gave you the first intimation of that mare being in the stable? - The prisoner told me then he lodged all night at the King's Head in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you then charged him with stealing this mare? - No, my Lord, he said before the Justice, he had lodged all night at the King's Head in Tottenham-court-road, and they sent me up there to know if he had been there, I enquired about him, and they knew nothing at all of any such person, so I went to New-prison, and I told the prisoner, you stole this horse, and you had better tell who was concerned with you.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him it would be better for him? - There was no owner to this horse then, my conversation was about the other; he said he would tell me by and by; I said I would not believe him, as he sent me on a wrong message before, and told me lies; the conversation I had was about the other horse; he told me she was Lord Mansfield's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walker. I thought there was some little white upon two or three of her legs? - I am sure there was white on one of her feet, I cannot speak with certainty to the rest.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Blacketer. You know of the reward? - I saw it in the paper.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Walker. You know of this advertisement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Knight. Have you seen this advertisement? - I saw it after I was at the justice's, but I never looked after it at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Wood. Did you see this advertisement? - I heard of it at the Justices, not till then.</p>
               <p>Did you know what the sum was? - No.</p>
               <p>To Knight. Did you? - Yes, five guineas.</p>

               <p>The horse and the mare were given to me in Tottenham-court-road, about one o'clock, or rather after, on Wednesday morning by two men; one of them called himself Hamilton; I was coming to town that morning about one, and I called at the King's head, it was so full of hay-makers, I could not get a lodging, and two men came with their two horses, and I asked them where they were going, they said not much farther, I told them I should be much obliged to them to tell me where I could get a lodging, one of them said yes, come with us my lad, take hold of that horse, and we will get you a lodging; they took me into a public house, I cannot tell the name of it, and asked me what I would drink, I told them I was very thirsty, they gave me a pot of porter, and they asked me to take these two horses down to the King's Head livery stables in Saint Giles's, and put them in there till the next morning, I told them I would, one of them came out with me to the door, and gave me the horses, and came with me almost to the place, for I am an intire stranger in town; I found this waterman at the stable door, and asked him for the hostler, he said he would call him up, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190065"></xptr> did not awake him, he took the horses, but the stables were all locked up; the man who gave me the horses desired they might take particular care of the mare, for she was a favourite of Mr. Hamilton's; in the morning when I came at six, I found the horses in the yard, one of the men's name was Hamilton, the other I do not know; I have no witnesses.</p>

               <p>Court to Walker. Is Mr. Dowse here? - No.</p>
               <p>What may the value of this mare be? - I think she is very cheap at twenty guineas.</p>

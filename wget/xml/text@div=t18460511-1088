                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Edgecombe. On the 1st of April I was at my daughter's, who keeps a tobacconist's shop at Bays-water—the prisoner came there for a pennyworth of tobacco—I served her—she laid down a bad shilling on the counter—I took it up, and said, "This is a bad one"—she said she had just taken it at the Black Lion, which is</p>

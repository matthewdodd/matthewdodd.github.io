I saw the prisoner at our shop three weeks ago, and served him with some tobacco, which came to seven farthings - he gave me a sovereign; I went into the parlour for change - my mistress came into the shop, and gave it to him: he then said he wanted 10s. worth of halfpence - she said she had not got it; he gave the silver back, and said it was of no use without, and paid for the tobacco in halfpence; my mistress put the silver on the counter, and when he was gone we missed 3s. On the 23d he came again for half an ounce of tobacco, and again gave me a sovereign; I went in and told my mistress I thought he was the man who took the 3s.; she then gave me six half-crowns and five shillings, which I took to him; he said,"It is of no use unless you can give me 10s. in halfpence- I told you so," but he had not; he put the silver back into my hand, and was putting his hand into his waistcoat pocket, for money to pay for his tobacco; I looked at the silver, and missed a half-crown; I said, "You have got half a crown" - he said he had not; my master came out of the room, and laid hold of him - he dropped the half-crown, and a shilling which I had not missed.</p>

I had been drinking, but was not at all intoxicated. I had about me, at that time, one 20 l., one 10 l., three 5 l., and six 1 l. bank notes in my left hand breeches pocket. They asked me to go with them, but I refused. I thought they intended to rob me of my watch, and put my hand to my fob to hold it. My left hand was up and my right on my fob. I pushed them and endeavoured to get away, but they kept fast hold of me until I got near to an alley. I endeavoured to get away, and dragged them with me. I had spoke to no other woman that night. They drew me up the alley by force. A little way up, I found the hand of one of them (I do not know which) in that pocket which contained the notes. I put my hand down to prevent her, and said,</p>
               <p>"You wretches, you have robbed me;" they then dropped part of the notes. I picked them up, put them into my pocket, and caught hold of them; they began swearing, and endeavoured to get away. They tore my coat, shirt, and handkerchief. A watchman was coming, and I told him to take them in custody. He took them to the watch-house. When I got there, I desired a gentleman, whom I knew, and who came, seeing the bustle, to examine the notes. The 20 l. note was gone. I had given him the particulars of them. I returned to the alley, but could not find it there. Payment was stopped at the Bank. The number of the note was 15,968, and dated 31st of July, 1818.</p>
               <p>LAWSON. Q. When you was at the watch-house, did you not say you had lost a 10 l. and a 20 l. note - A. No.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 12th of November, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was on my beat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020044"></xptr>and heard a noise. I came up, and found the prisoners had got hold of the prosecutor - other persons were standing round. I rescued him from them, and he said they had robbed him of bank-notes, but he could not tell to what amount. He appeared quite sober. I took them to the watch-house. When we got there, he described what notes he had, and gave them to a gentleman to examine, whom he knew. He said there were 51 l. in all. There were 20 l. missing. We went to see for it, but without success. They were searched, but nothing found on them belonging to Cheesman.</p>
               <p>LAWSON. Q. Did Cheesman have hold of us, or we of him - A. You had hold of him.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I heard Cheesman say he had 51 l. about him. We searched the women, but found nothing on them. They said they were innocent, and did not fear, for they had done nothing. We could not find the notes.</p>
               <p>LAWSON'S Defence. We were going home and met the prosecutor, who was intoxicated. He pushed us up the court. He instantly stooped and picked up something. He said we had robbed him. I called the watchman. The reason his coat was torn was, he wanted to run away when the watchman came, and I endeavoured to keep him. He then charged us with robbing him.</p>
               <p>BARLOW'S Defence. He was intoxicated, and pushed us up the alley. He said he had been with other girls. We would not speak to him. Nothing was found on us.</p>

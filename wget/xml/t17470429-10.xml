               <p>Barrack. On the 10th Day of February, about eight o'Clock in the Evening, I saw two Women running along the Strand, with each of them a Hoop-petticoat under their Arm, and they went up Helmet-Court, next Door to my House; I told my Daughter I believed they had stole two Hoop-petticoats, for there was none in that Court that wore such. When I went up the Court, they were rolling of them up; when I came to them, I took hold of each Hoop-petticoat , I told them I believed they had stole them; upon that one of them says to the other, take my Hoop-petticoat , and I will go and call my Mistress that will tell how I came by them.

I sent for the Constable when she would not own who they belonged to, so I went for the Constable, which is now in Court, and we had her before Justice Burdus , and she confessed that

               <p>- Mason, Constable. About eight o'Clock at Night , the 10th of February, Mr Barrack sent to my House, and desired I would come to his House , for he had stopped a Thief ; I carried her before Justice Burdus, the Justice ordered me to lock her up that Night, and bring her the next Day to be examined. As I saw a great many Hoops in Mrs Jones's Shop, I asked her whether she had lost any Hoops, she said she could not tell whether she had or no; I told her about ten o'Clock a Person would be before the Justice, and she might see two Hoops.</p>

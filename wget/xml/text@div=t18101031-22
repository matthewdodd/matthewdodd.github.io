On the 19th of September last, at the bottom of Southampton-street in the Strand, seeing a mob there I went, Mr. Marshall gave me charge of the prisoner for attempting to give him bad money; I went to search the prisoner, she refused letting me search her; I then told her if she would walk peaceably to the office I would search her there; when we got to the Brown Bear tap room I searched her, in her left hand was a paper containing five sixpences and two shillings, she had an apron tied up in the same hand; I searched her pocket, I found two pence three farthings good money, three skains of thread wrapped up in paper. These are the same shillings and sixpences.</p>

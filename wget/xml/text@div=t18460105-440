                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at Wapping-wall. On the 3rd of Jan. I was in the street in New Gravel-lane—my wife came to me with her mouth bleeding—she showed me the prisoner, but he was not near enough to hear what she said—I went up to the prisoner, and shook him—he struck me in the breast with his fist—he then ran on the other side of the road—we had a scuffle, and in the scufflle he ran a knife into me—I did not take notice of the knife till I received it in my thigh—I know it was him that did it, as there was no one else near but him and I—the knife was in his hand when he cut me with it—I did not see it till it was in the officer's charge—I called, "Po<lb></lb>lice!"—I saw no more of the prisoner till the policeman had him—I was wounded in the left thigh—Dr. Croucher saw the wound, but he did not dress it—I got the strapping from him—my wife strapped it—the doctor did not see the wound again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 339.) My attention was drawn by a cry of "Stop thief!"—I stopped the prisoner—Margaret Henney said he had a knife about him—I found this knife in the leg of his trowsers—I saw the wound in the prosecutor's thigh—it appeared as if made by a knife of this description—there was some dry blood on the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Cheeseman, of Upper-street, Fitzroy-square, and keep a mangle. I had a basket of linen brought from Mrs. Welters on the 15th of October—the prisoner came to me and said she had come from No. 28, over the way, for the things—I asked her if it was the broker's things, she said, "Yes, the broker at the corner," which is Mr. Welters', and said, were they done, could she have them directly—I said they were not done, and she must come at eight o'clock—she left, returned in a quarter of an hour, and said they could not wait, they must have them immediately—I said I would do them in an hour and a half—she came again in three-quarters of an hour—they were not done—I said she should have them in half-an-hour—she waited for them, and I delivered them to her, believing she came from Mrs. Welters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Welters, a broker, in Hertford-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 15th of October I sent the linen stated in the indictment, to be mangled—in the afternoon of the same day the prisoner came to my house and said, "Will you please to tell me your name?"—I said, "What for?"—she said, "It is the broker's name I want"—I said, "What do you want it for?"—she said, "Mistress's clock don't go well"—I said, "She did not buy it here"—she said, "Yes, she did"—she persisted in it—I did not tell her my name, but the name is over the door—I did not send her to Mrs. Cheeseman's—she never brought the linen to my house—the basket and linen wore my husband's.</p>

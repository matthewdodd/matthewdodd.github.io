               <p>I know the prosecutor, he lost some Ostrich feathers from a hearse which had been at a funeral.</p>

               <p>Court. What was the worth of them? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How do you know the prisoner took them? - It was slippery weather and I got down to walk, and I saw the door move, I had tied the two pins in fast with a cord, I called to the man to stop, and just then I saw a person at the hearse door, appearing to me to come out of the hearse; I saw his legs just before they came to the ground; he was pulling at the feathers, and these three he pulled out.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know who that person was? - I believe it was the prisoner, after he had got them into his hands I called stop thief! he saw me a coming and he ran, he took them a little distance from the hearse, and he dropped them, I ran after him, and he was rather to quick for me but I saw him fall, he ran into James-street, on the dark side of the street, there was no lamps; then the next witness caught the prisoner, and said, here he is; I had ran past him, I believe a yard or two yards, I did not see him, it being in the dark; I look upon the prisoner to all appearance as to his size and apparel, to be the same man that took the feathers.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you keep him in your sight till he was taken? - No, till the time he fell.</p>

Stop thief! I looked about and saw the prisoner run from the hearse, he fell down, he got up again and ran into James-street, and I after him; he found I was pursuing him so close and was going to catch hold of him, and about twenty yards off he stopped against the wall and began to run back again, I stopped myself immediately, and went and took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you him in your sight from the time of his falling down to the time of your laying hold of him? - I had my Lord, I called out here he is, he asked me if that was the man that fell down, I answered, yes, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whereabouts was you when you heard the cry of stop thief? - In the street, about forty or fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lose sight of me? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose you take upon yourself to swear that I am the identical person? - No, I do not, I swear you was the person that fell down.</p>

               <p>I had the care of the feathers, I was upon the hearse and heard the cry of stop thief; the others being younger men than me got down first; I was the last that got down, I saw the others run after the prisoner, I did not see the prisoner fall.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the worth of those feathers? - About twenty shillings.</p>

               <p>Be so kind as to examine the gentleman that has an impediment in his speech.</p>
               <p>Court. He cannot speak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He swore before the Justice that he pursued me with the feathers in my hand, from the corner of James-street to the corner of Panton-street, and that gentleman says he picked up the feathers near to the hearse: my Lord I was going from a friend's house in Windmill-street, and going down James-street, I was walking very quietly, and this gentleman caught hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140016"></xptr> me; I had not got into the Hay-market, and they were going to put me into the hearse, and I was committed; the next morning Mr. Downes came to me and told me he had lost a pall and hearse cloths, and some other things, and said if I would be the means of his getting his property again, he would give me five guineas and do any thing for me; I told him I was innocent, I advised him to advertise them, he said he would; when I went up on Wednesday for further examination; Mr. Downes said he had not lost any pall he only lost six velvets; on the Sunday he sent one Mr. Green who said he had got this gentleman's property back again: now I leave you to think whether I took the things. I have no witnesses.</p>

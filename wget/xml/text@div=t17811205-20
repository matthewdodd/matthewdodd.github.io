            , Esq. near Walthamstow. Last October, five quarters and three bushels of wheat were taken out of his barn. It was in sacks.</p>
               <p>How many? - Eleven.</p>
               <p>How long had it been in the barn? - A week or better. It was taken away on the 31st of October.</p>
               <p>How long before that time did you see it? - I saw it the night before. I found it at Smith's the day following, the first day of September. I gave the key to Smith in the morning to go into the barn, he came back immediately and told me the wheat was gone. I went immediately to see how much was gone. I went to the barn to look, and I found gone five quarters, three bushels taken away in sacks, in a cart. I sent the men after it to seek it and follow the cart, as far as they could find any track of it. I was not along with it, they went to find it.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of this man before? - No; I cannot say I ever saw him before. I saw him turn from the gate belonging to the farm yard, the Wednesday before the robbery.</p>

               <p>Who was that other person? - I really can't say; it was not very light, nor very dark; I can't be positive.</p>
               <p>What said Lardner? - He asked where my husband was; he said he had got something in the cart for my husband; and I said my husband would have nothing to do with him.</p>

             told me in the afternoon he had a parcel of wheat, if I would go along with him; accordingly I went along with him to Walthamstow; we took a cart and horses, and went to Walthamstow, where we loaded eleven sacks of corn.</p>
               <p>Where did you go at Walthamstow? - I went to a barn, but I can't say the place; to a barn, no house nigh it; we drawed the staple of the door.</p>
               <p>When you had eleven sacks in the cart, what did you do with it? - We came away, and went round by Poplar; by Bromley and Poplar. When I came to Poplar, I called Mrs. Stone up, and asked where her husband was; she said he was abed.</p>
               <p>Where was Wells at that time? - With the cart.</p>
               <p>Where from thence did you go? - After that I went to Mr. Smith, and told him what we got, and if he was agreeable to take it in; he was, and he got a light, and took it in.</p>
               <p>Where was this wheat left? - In the wash-house.</p>
               <p>What became of Wells? - I can't tell; I left him there.</p>

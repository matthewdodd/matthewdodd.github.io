            's Room together; as soon as they got in, Isaacs took the Breeches from under Hurst's Head, and Waters took the Money out of them. When I came into my own Ward, Waters told the Money, and there was 11 d. in Half-pence, and for that we had two Pots of Gin and Small-Beer. - I thought the Door stood upon the jar - I did not see any Hurt done to Mrs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140011"></xptr> Hurst, but she complained that her Hand was cut. - I am sure it was Hurst's Money, because I saw Waters take it out of his Pocket, and did not put his Hand into his own Pocket 'till he told the Money.</p>

            . On the 29th of December I lay in Hurst's Room. I was undressed, and she was almost undressed. The Prisoners came to the Door, and were half an Hour, or three quarters, striving to open it with a Poker. The Door had a Hasp, and was fastened with a Pad-lock. The first Man that came in was Isaacs, and the next Waters. Friday came no farther than the Door. Says Isaacs, Let us see what Prime Hurst has got: And he took from under his Head a Pair of Leather Breeches, and gave them to Waters, and he blew out the Candle, and took the Money out. - I did not see the Money in his Hand, but I saw his Hand in his Pocket; he stabbed Mrs Hurst in the Hand with a Knife. -</p>

               <p>Isaacs. How could you see what was doing there, when you must go the length of the Hall to get a Candle?</p>

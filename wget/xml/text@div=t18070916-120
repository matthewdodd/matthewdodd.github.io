When I arrived at Sheerness, I received 47 l. four 10 l. notes and seven ones; they were Bank of England notes; the prisoner was with me, and saw me receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he receive. - A.Between three and four pounds. We came together in one boat to town, and we lived together at the Dundee Arms; then from there we went to Mrs. Hill's, <placeName id="t18070916-120-crimeloc643">123, Wapping</placeName>

               <p>Q. When you arrived there, had you these four ten pound notes and seven ones in your waistcoat pocket. - A. Yes, I felt them when I was in bed, about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160072"></xptr>o'clock I had my dinner, they were all safe, then I fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you been drinking. - A. No, I had only one pint of porter after my breakfast. Between four and five o'clock I awoke, I observed a letter that was wrapped round my money, and my invaliding ticket, they were laying on the bed; the handkerchiefs that I had in my pocket were both taken out, all my cloaths were scattered about, and my money was taken out of my pocket; the wool was taken out of my wooden leg to see if there was any thing there.</p>
               <p>Q.What money had you in your pocket. - A. Five or six shillings, and some half-pence; in short, they left me nothing. When I had found every thing was gone, Mrs. Hill brought me up some tea, I told her of the robbery, she told me not to alarm myself. Presently after I saw the prisoner; he was charged with the robbery; he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or any body tell him it would be better for him to confess. - A. Not that night; he went out, and stopped out all night; he came the next morning, and was put in the charge of the police officer; then he denied it; he desired Mrs. Hill to give me 30 l. she did not, as it was a robbery done in her house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do, and I know the prosecutor. On the 28th of July, the prosecutor went to bed immediately after breakfast, he was very ill. The prisoner and another black man were together; I asked them whether they had any money, the prisoner replied he had but 8 l. and he was capable of taking care of it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time receive any sum of money from the prisoner before the prosecutor got up. - A. In the afternoon I received 40 l. in notes, I put my mark on them, I cannot read nor write; I received half a guinea, a Spanish dollar, a shilling, and eight-pence halfpenny in copper; he told me to take care of it, till he called for it. I asked him at the time where he got it from, he said in Scotland; I said, the money grows, you said in the morning you had only got 8 l. He brought me the money shivering and shaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a Scotch-woman. - A. No, indeed, my Lord, I am not; yet I am an Irishwoman. When I went up to the prosecutor with his tea he said he had been robbed.</p>

            . Q. You are clerk at the Thames Police Office. - A. Yes. The first account that the prisoner gave, which was voluntary, was, that he received three 10 l. notes of a captain of a vessel at Cork in Ireland for his wages in last December. He was asked by the magistrate, whether the notes then produced were those identical notes that he received of the captain, he said they were; on examining the notes it appeared that one was dated subsequent in April. On another examination, he gave the account to the magistrate of 15 l. he had received of a captain of a ship, and a pig, for his wages; he afterwards said that he received the money in Scotland; this was at three different examinations.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I cannot speak good English, if I could I could speak what I please; well, I was with my captain, sir, three voyages, and I never had a copper of him. This last voyage I came to Scotland, I was going to the West Indies, I scalded my leg, I was sick, the captain turned me on shore in Ireland; what little money I brought on shore, I spent it all. When signal was making for the ship to sail, I wrote a letter to my captain; he came to me; I said, Captain, I want some money, I am very bad with the rheumatism; I said I had been three voyages with him, twenty-one months. Do you know what I am indebted to you? No, I says; he took out ten notes, he said it was 20 l. I told him I did not understand these notes, I wanted change; he said if he gave me all silver I should spend it all, these were better. I took the notes of the captain; he said, I am indebted to you 17 l. and I owe you 3 l. for a pig, and you owe me for blue trowsers, jacket, shoes, and handkerchief; he gave me one single note, that made eleven. I was on board the Trident, guard ship, three months; from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160073"></xptr>there I went on board another ship; I receive three notes at Sheerness. I do not understand the notes.</p>

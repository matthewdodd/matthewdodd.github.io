                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Camper, Escombe, and Lawson—we are stockbrokers, carrying on business at 4, Adam Street, Old Broad Street—I know the defendant; he was managing director of the Joint Stock Discount Company Limited—from time to time in the years 1864 and 1865 our firm was engaged in buying and selling shares on his behalf personally, at intervals throughout the years 1864 and 1865—he has from time to time made payments on those accounts—some time in August, 1865, we had purchased for him 520 shares in the Joint Stock Discount Company—they were purchased for the account on the 16th August—on that day we were only able to deliver 377 shares—including the price of the 520 shares, the balance owing by the defendant to us on the 16th August was 5016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the price of the 520 shares taken together was 4257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the rest of the 5016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made up of a sum of 705<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the balance of an old account; that balance included a sum of about 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on loans on Hudson's Bay shares; I don't know the exact figures; it was about that amount—on the 16th August, 1865, I sent our clerk, Mr. Ram<lb></lb>say, to the defendant, for the purpose of getting a cheque for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he returned without any cheque, and I went over to the com<lb></lb>pany's office in Nicholas Lane, and saw the defendant in his private room—I said I required a cheque, and I must have the money, because I had</p>

               <p>paid the money away, and I must have it that afternoon—I said I must have a cheque for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I had not paid the whole away—he told me that he could not pay the money that afternoon, as he had to get the money from another person—I told him I must have it—he then said he would give me a cheque of the company for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which cheque I consented to allow him to pass through our account—he said, "I will give you a cheque for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the Joint Stock Discount Company, and repay it when I get the money from the third party"—I consented to that, on condition that he should repay the 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and no interest should be charged to us, and no security given—I told him I had 377 shares to deliver him that day—those were the ones I had paid for (I delivered the 143 on the 28th August)—I told him I would deliver them as soon as I got them—I then left, and said I would send my clerk over for the cheque—I did so, and he got it and paid it into our bankers, and we were credited with it—our bankers were the Agra and Masterman's—the defendant's company also banked there—on that day, the 16th August, I delivered the 377 shares—the transfers were made out in the ordinary way; they were transferred to Mr. Megaw—we had Mr. Wilkinson's order to that effect—on the 28th August we delivered the remaining 143 shares—the transfers of those shares were also made out to Mr. Megaw—when those remaining shares were delivered the balance to be paid to us was 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the remain<lb></lb>ing 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a dividend that had accrued on the 520 shares; we credited Mr. Wilkinson with that—I can't say whether I saw him with regard to the payment of the balance, 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 28th August; I do not remember—I received this cheque for 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the afternoon of the 28th August—I cannot say from whom I received it; it passed through my hands—I re<lb></lb>ceived it as the balance of that account—I know Mr. Wilkinson's writing this is his signature (<hi rend="italic">this was dated the 28th August, 1865, for </hi>860<hi rend="italic">l., payable to 7660.

               <p>shares upon which that profit or loss accrued—those differences were from time to time settled between Mr. Wilkinson and us—money passed be<lb></lb>tween us on both sides—on 16th August we had 377 shares in our pos<lb></lb>session—they were delivered on that day—they had been bought for him at different times—I can't say whether the number of shares we were carrying over for him had remained at 200 for a considerable number of months—I don't remember, our bookkeeper can state that—upon my oath I do not remember—I can't say that they ever stood actually at 200, I know that the total number of shares was 520—I do not know whether they stood at 200 for many months—I won't say they did not—I won't say they did not stand at 200 from November till June, I don't know—whatever shares there were were carried over from time to time—I had 377 shares delivered to me on 16th August—none were actually bought that day, they were paid for on that day—up to 16th August 520 were bought—I don't know how many I had bought within a fortnight of 16th August—I cannot give you the least notion—I should think it would not be the difference between 200 and 520, but I am not certain—I think the price of the 520 shares was 4257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—some of that was paid on 16th August, and some was paid before that, and the difference of the carrying over, and some of it was paid up to 28th August, as the shares were delivered—the shares may have been delivered in tens, twenties, fifties, or anyhow—it was all paid before 28th August—the 4257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not paid on 26th July—I cannot tell what was owing from the defendant to us on 26th July—doubtless something was, I don't know what—I cannot say that I saw Mr. Wilkinson myself on the subject of these 520 shares before 16th August—the first time I saw him that day was after I had sent Ramsay for a cheque and he had come back without one—I think no one was present when I saw him, I am sure there was not—it was in his own private room at the company's office in Nicholas Lane, in the afternoon I think between twelve and four, I can't give you the time nearer than that—I made no note of it at the time, the interview did not last long—I don't think I ever spoke to Mr. Wilkinson again on the subject—we afterwards had a notice to the effect that the company claimed the sum of 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from us—I never communicated with Mr. Wilkinson on the subject, we simply sent the account back to the company when we received it—I can't give you the date, I have no idea of it, I only know we sent it back directly it was received—I did not send it back myself, Mr. Capper, my partner, did—I never communicated with Mr. Wilkinson about it after that—I was not examined before the Liqui<lb></lb>dator about this matter, Mr. Capper was—I did not then communicate with Mr. Wilkinson—we had had loans from the company from time to time—we always paid interest—I mean to swear that we never had a loan from the company that we did not pay interest for—we had frequent loans, considerable sums, 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., perhaps more, I dare say 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I dare say in the course of a year there have been loans to the amount of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not in single loans—we might have had 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one time—we never had a loan of any kind upon which we did not pay interest—I don't know that we ever had a loan that we repaid on the very day we got it—I should think that would be an exceptional case—I do not remember any such case—we have not had loans without giving security for them—we never had a loan but what we gave security for, stock or shares—I assert positively that on no occasion did we ever receive a loan, great or small, without giving some security besides our own personal security—I under<lb></lb>stood the business of the Discount Company to be immense, to the extent of</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>these contract notes, or of our charging him for carrying over shares not actually in our hands—carrying over shares is a familiar practice on the Stock Exchange, without actually having the shares in your possession at the moment—we could tell by reference to our books when the 520 shares were paid for—it would take a very long time—they were all paid for before 28th August—we paid for the 377 when we got possession of them on 16th August—I do not know what the total amount of the 377 shares was—the demand for the 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent back the moment it was received—from that time until the official liquidator asked us for it again, we had no further demand for it, as far as I know—one of our clerks, the book-keeper, took back the notice—the claim was originally made in 1866—I don't know the date.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the whole of your business come under your attention, or do you leave parts of it to your partners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I may safely say nearly the whole—when we are instructed to buy particular shares we make a bargain with a jobber or broker; there is no written contract between us, it is merely a bargain by word of mouth—I go first to a jobber, if I cannot buy of him at the price I seek among other brokers to see if I can find a seller amongst them; he does it through a jobber; we do not necessarily resort to a jobber, a broker sells without a jobber—we sometimes contract with a broker without a jobber, and never with a contract note, we enter it in our respective books And what we call check the bargain next morning by our clerks reading over what we have done—no document exists between us and the seller; we cannot tell whether he is in possession of the shares at the time we buy, he may or may not be, we don't assume it; very often we know he has them, it is not our business to assume anything—on settling days we are looked to to produce the money, we are bound to pay the differences, and to pay the value of the shares if the seller demands it—it depends upon your credit whether the seller calls upon you to take up the shares; I have never been asked to do so—it is not on those days that we require loans, we may have principals to look to to pay the differences; that is always the case I hope—we never have such black accounts as to require loans I am thankful to say—we have required loans on securities sometimes for principals—that has sometimes been on settling days, not always—we have to make loans of course, it is part of our business on those occasions to borrow money at one price and try and lend it at a higher price, but that is not to pay differences; of course we cannot tell where each sovereign goes; it is very rarely applied to that purpose, it is sometimes—I have seen Mr. Wilkinson several times, and conversed with him upon business transactions—I used to go and see him very nearly every morning—I have seen other persons there—I have seen Mr. Hill sometimes on matters of business and sometimes for chat—I have received cheques from Mr. Wilkinson, I cannot remember whether I have done so individually—I cannot say whether I have or not.</p>

Capper, Escombe, and Lawson being brought to my attention by Mr. Wilkinson, or of 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or any sum at all—this cheque for 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is signed by me—I have no recollection of the matter to which it refers—I was not at all aware that it was to pay a private debt of Mr. Wilkinson's—I also signed this cheque of 19th September—I know nothing of that transaction—I signed it in the ordinary course of business—it was some transaction entered into by Mr. Wilkinson, and the cheque was brought to me to sign—I was told what it was for and I signed it—I cannot remember it especially—I was not told it would be paid to the credit of our own company—when the clerk brought cheques for signature he always told me for what purpose they were drawn, for loans or repayment, or whatever it might be—I do not remember what I was told about these cheques—the cash-book was kept by one clerk and this by another—I have not the slightest idea of their names—I believe one clerk kept the whole of it—the entries were very numerous—it might require more than one clerk to</p>

COLERIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there were a number of clerks in the office who each had their appointed duty to perform? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and as far as I know they performed it—I did not interfere in the matter—Mr. Wilkinson often gave instruction to the clerks in special matters—by the memorandum of association he was to be the managing director of the company, and to have the management of the discounting business thereof, subject to the resolutions of the board of directors—he was to give his whole time and attention to the business of the company, and not engage himself or be concerned in any other business than that of the company—in special matters reference would he had to him—if a loan was applied for, a cheque would be drawn, which would be entered in one book, and from that to another, each clerk performing his ordinary and proper duty in reference to the transaction in the books of the company—the cheque itself would not shew whether it was for a loan or not—the counterfoil would always show it—I believe it was generally nearly always written, "Paid to" such a name, "loan," "discount," "repay<lb></lb>ment," or whatever it was—the clerk would take the counterfoil and make the necessary entry, and that would be followed by clerk after clerk in the ordinary course—the transactions of the company were very numerous indeed and very large, sometimes many hundred thousand pounds a day—the aggregate of the dealings of the company during the time it was in operation would be hundreds of millions—at times there was a very great stress on Mr. Wilkinson's time and energies—he from time to time asked for assistance and aid in his work, on the ground that it was too much for him—as far as I know his time was fully occupied with the affairs of the company—he was very seldom absent—he was not always there—Mr. Hill then signed cheques for him—I don't recollect a Mr. Sutton having authority to sign cheques—he was in the office—he was the cashier—before any cheque arrived in the board-room to be signed it always bore the initials of two clerks as well as the signature of the managing director—that was to show that it had passed properly through the office—there was a special regulation to that effect made by directors of the board some short time after the company began business—the two cheques I have looked at are both initialed by two clerks—Mr. Wilkinson was originally a discount broker—we bought his business—that appears from the articles of association—he had the financial operations of the company under his control—his judgment was referred to upon the subject of making advances—that was the main object for which he was looked to—the sum of 800,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid up—there were from time to time periods of difficulty and pressure upon the company, which they bided through till the final smash came—they had large loans from bankers from time to time—there were very large transactions with Mr. Kleman—I am not aware that he was from time to time largely in advance to the company—he used to get bills discounted for us in the market, in the ordinary capacity of a broker—he was largely used by us to get our paper discounted—he was our broker—we had an accountant in the office, a bookkeeper who acted as an accountant—he controlled the general system of bookkeeping, and arranged what books should contain what sort of items—he had nothing to do with the items—I forget his name.</p>

               <p>about two years before the company stopped payment, in March, 1866—his duties were to keep the general accounts of the company—he did not keep all the books himself, he had to superintend it—I don't know whether he made any original entries—he had nothing to do with the entry of cash payments and receipts; that was done by a clerk in the lower office; he was in an upper room and had the books entirely under his control (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Brand called</hi>)—I recognise that gentleman as a clerk in the office—I do not refer to him especially—there was a bookkeeper, who he was I do not know—I don't know what his business was; he had to render a balance-sheet—I know that the duties of bookkeeper and accountant were per<lb></lb>formed, but I never was brought into immediate contact with the person and cannot tell which gentleman it was that did it—his duties as accountant and bookkeeper were the ordinary duties of that particular occupation—he rendered a general balance of account<lb></lb>ant the end of the year; that is all I know about it—so far as I know he had nothing to do with the entry of a particular item on a particular day—I think I said that the loans or discounts usually would appear on the counterfoils of the cheques—it does not appear upon any one of these on the first page; there are four cheques on each page—none appear on the second page; there are in some places; I was under the impression that they were always there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Merchant Bank—I am on the register for 520 Joint Stock Discount shares and on the contributory list under the winding-up of the company—I became pos<lb></lb>sessed of those shares I think on the 30th of August, 1865—I think I had them all together on that date—I had them from a party with whom we had some transactions; I do not know that I should disclose the name of one of the customers of the bank; it was Mr. Kleman, he asked me, as manager of the bank, to make an advance to him upon certain securities, and amongst them were these shares—I did so, and I have the shares (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—there are the 520 spoken of—I signed my name as the transferee to all of them—I received no other shares of the Joint Stock Discount Company in August—I have no doubt I sent them down for registration—I advanced 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Kleman upon these and the other securities which he deposited on or about the 30th August; the amount was afterwards reduced by 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the following February—I should say Kleman had made the application for the loan within a week or ten days prior to the advance—I knew nothing whatever of Mr. Wilkinson in the transaction, I never heard his name mentioned in the matter—I still hold part of those securities—I do not know when I last saw Mr. Kleman, I should think not for six months—I have not the slightest idea what has become of him—I do not know whether he is to be found at his ordinary place of business—I have not looked for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Straith, bill broker—I was for<lb></lb>merly in the service of the Joint Stock Discount Company—I entered their employment on the 18th September, 1865—I was a cashier—there is an entry here in the cash-book in my writing, on the 19th September—this "16th August" is not my writing; that is the writing of a clerk of the name of Sherrar—I don't know what has become of him—there is no writing of mine on that same line—there are several entries in that page in my writing—there is a folio in my writing on the line you speak of, to show that I had posted it into the ledger; that is on the right hand side of the page—some of this entry on the left side of the page, the tenth entry from the bottom, is in my writing—I do not remember anything about it—there is the word "repaid" in my writing, but I do not remember putting it—I have no specific remembrance of that item at all—I do not remember writing it at ail—at the time I wrote it I should say the date in Sherrar's writing was there—it does not look as if it was put in afterwards—I can see clearly that what I wrote was written since the other was written—I should not have written it without directions—I should say I had directions about it—I should not have made an entry without—there were two persons from whom I might have received directions—I do not remember having instructions from anybody, but the only two persons I could have had instructions from would have been Mr. Hill and Mr. Sutton, the two clerks between myself and Mr. Wilkinson—Mr. Sutton has gone abroad I have heard—I may occasionally hare received directions from Mr. Wilkinson, but I very seldom had communication with him—occasionally I may have asked him if such a thing was right—I certainly did occasionally get instructions from him—I have asked him perhaps when I took a cheque to him to sign whether it was to go to such an account, and he would say "Yes"—I never consulted him with reference to entries in the books that I kept; I referred to Mr. Hill and Mr. Sutton, if necessary, on that subject—they were assistant managers—I have frequently seen them with Mr. Wilkinson, I was not presen't to hear in respect of what matters—I have seen them receive instructions, I can't say what instructions—I never saw Mr. Wilkinson give directions to either of them about the books—there is nothing in the fifth entry on the right hand page that is in my writing except the folio, the reference to</p>

               <p>the ledger—the date here is August 16—the word "folio" is not here, only the figure "10"—I put that on the day that I posted the whole of these entries, that would be a few days after the 19th September—as far as I can remember the page was in the same condition it is now when I posted it up—I think the erasure was there when I posted it—the date August 16 was there, as far as I can remember; I have no proof before me, my belief is that it was there as it is now—I have now before me the advance ledger—the whole of the posting is in my writing, and written at the time it purports to bear date—the entry of the 19th September is my writing—the entry is on the 19th September in the cash-book, and I must have omitted It—it has August 16 written against it—I must have missed it entirely in the cash-book at first, and posted up this account until I arrived at the 19th October, and then, finding this entry was missed, I could not interpolate it, so I entered it here, 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," with the date of the 19th September against it—I argue from what I see here; I have no distinct recollection of it; I can't say that I have any recollection of it—I did not enter this by any one's direction, it was simply copied from the cash-book—I bring this 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the cash-book—the cash-book bears the date of August.</p>

Capper's office—I had no instructions from any one to write it—I made out the whole of the interest account; it was my duty to do it regularly—Messrs. Capper repudiated the account—upon hearing that I did not apply to any one in our office for instructions—I wrote this of my own accord, without any instructions—there is no date to it; I wrote it shortly before the company stopped, about the end of December, 1865—I have no recollection of showing it to any one in the office—I thought it was only an entry made to Capper's account by mistake, that should have belonged to some other account—I never saw Mr. Wil<lb></lb>kinson on the subject of this account of Messrs. Capper's, never to my recollection certainly—if I required instructions in the course of my duty I referred to Mr. Hill and Mr. Sutton—I do not remember referring to either of them when Messrs. Capper repudiated this account, I should say I certainly did not, nor to Mr. Wilkinson—as well as I can remember anything, I never spoke a word to Mr. Wilkinson about it—this is the account, there was no other; it is my writing—the account was not tendered, because this 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in dispute—I never made any fresh claim upon them for it, I left it in the hands of Mr. Ball, that was after the company stopped—I did not send in any further account than this.</p>

Deposition of James Freeling Wilkinson, called on behalf of the liquidators; sworn the 17th October, 1866; filed 12th November, 1866: states:—I was the managing director of the Joint Stock Discount Company Limited in January, 1866. In the latter part of the month I resigned my office of managing director. In that month there had been rumours of the financial position of the company, and Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and Co. had been occupied in investigating the accounts of the company. The general meeting of the company was held on the 31st of January, 1866. I was present. A committee of investigation was appointed at that meeting, and after their appointment the committee had daily meetings, and so had the board I believe. Johann Gustaf Carl Pontus Kleman was a customer of the company, upon a loan and discount account, which account commenced soon after the company was formed. The nature of our dealings with him was that he would bring bills to us for discount like an ordinary merchant. The company debited him with the cash advanced by the company on bills or otherwise, and credited him with the bills when received, or any cash he might pay. On the 31st of December, 1865, the company was in advance to Eleman to the extent of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This was a balance unsecured and carried on to the next year. At the end of January, 1866, that balance had increased to the sum of 108,789<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was un<lb></lb>secured. None of the advances made to Kleman after the 3rd of February, 1866, were, I believe, brought specifically to the notice of the directors. The advances appear iu the loan ledger, marked T4, and in the advance ledger, marked T5. The advances which had been made to Kleman between the 1st of January and the 1st of February, 1866, which increased the balance to his debit to the sum of 108,789<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were not specifi<lb></lb>cally brought before the board of directors, nor were any advances gene<lb></lb>rally speaking brought before the board, but there was a book which contained every cheque which was drawn, and for whom it was drawn, always upon the board table; in other words, every director who signed a cheque could know for whom it was signed. The directors were in the habit of leaving-cheques signed in blank, that is to say, without any num<lb></lb>ber or amount being filled in, and without the name of any payee being put on the counterfoil. Ordinarily the director who was in the weekly rota for signing cheques when he came to the office would go upstairs and sign a lot of cheques, and then go away. I believe that the cheques for the advances which appear to Kleman's debit in the loan ledger were signed in the above manuer. I refer to the account of Messrs. Capper, Escombe, and Lawson, at page 226 of the loan ledger, and as to the item on the debit side under date 28th August, 1865, I say that sum must have been advanced to them with my knowledge and authority, but I do not recollect for what purpose the advance was made. I had no account with them personally, but I had done business with them as brokers. I can't recollect that I was personally indebted to them in the year 1865. The loan ledger was not nor were any books kept under my superintendence. On the 28th August, 1865, a cheque for 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by the company's bankers out of its funds. Looking at the counterfoil of the cheque No. 7660 at the bankers' pass book, marked 5 L, and the account of Capper, Escombe, and Lawson in the loan ledger, I have no doubt the sum of 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Messrs. Capper, Escombe, and Co. by the company on the 28th August,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070039"></xptr>
               <p>1865, as a loan. I should say, generally speaking, that persons applying to the company for a loan would see me before the loan was made. Capper, Escombe, and Co. have applied to me for loans. I have no doubt that Capper, Escombe, and Co. were debtors to the company on the 7th March, 1866, in the balance which appears to their debit in the loan ledger, being 959<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in respect of the before-mentioned loan of 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and interest from the time of the advance." <hi rend="italic">Further examined on the</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st of October</hi>:—"I do not know what the company got from Mr. Kleman for the 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced to him on 3rd February, 1866. I cannot tell whether he could have received the money without its passing through my hands, until I see the cheque. No one ought to draw a cheque on the company's funds without authority. I should certainly say that all the cheques drawn in behalf of the company while I was managing director were not drawn by my authority. In practice all the proposals for loans or advances to customers of the company or discount of bills were submitted to me, and were not entertained without my approval. I cannot recollect any single instance of an advance or loan or discount of bills being made by the company to a customer which had not been approved by me. While I was in the office I believe that every advance made to Mr. Kleman by the company was made with my authority. I was away from the office a week in the month of September, and a week or ten days in January, 1866. During my absence I think Mr. Hill performed my duties, but I should not like to say. I believe that advances and discounts were made just the same in my absence as while I was there. During my absence I do not remember that I had correspondence on the affairs of the company. I was at the office in the first week of February, 1866. I have no doubt thai the advance to Kleman of 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 3rd February, 1866, was made with my authority. The security which the company would get for the 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be bills or cheques. It was perfectly well known to the directors that advances were being made to Kleman, and that there was a large balance due from him on the 31st December, 1865, amounting to over 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was not aware that the balance due from Kleman had increased between the 31st December, 1865, and the 31st January, 1866, to over 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so I never commun<lb></lb>icated to the directors. I do not know whether the company had any security for the balance of 108,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from Kleman, nor do I know of any book of the company from which that information can be derived. Kleman was a large commission agent. I had an account with him per<lb></lb>sonally. He does not owe me anything. There is an open account between us. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you received any money from Kleman? (<hi rend="italic">The witness objected to answer this and other questions, as relating to private trans<lb></lb>actions between himself and Mr. Kleman.</hi>) I have not kept any books since January, 1866. I can't recollect where I recorded my private transactions with Mr. Kleman. They amounted to 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can't say from what materials I could make out an account between myself and Mr. Kleman or check his account. I have not in my possession any materials, memoranda, or papers from which I could make out an account with Mr. Kleman of any transactions. I have no letters in my possession from Mr. Kleman, and I think I never had to the best of my recollection. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you keep a banking account at the present time? (<hi rend="italic">The witness declined to answer.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you kept a banking account since the 1st of January, 1866? (<hi rend="italic">The witness declined to answer.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Kleman made advances to you from time to time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has rendered an account. I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070040"></xptr>
               <p>know where Kleman is now. I saw him about two or three months ago in London. I do not know whether any portion of the balance of 108,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from Kleman on the 31st January, 1866, has been paid. I look at the advance ledger, marked T6. I do not know what was the balance due from Kleman on the 3rd March, 1866. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any reason to doubt that the entry to the debit of Kleman at page 12 of Exhibit T6 of 184,838<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is correct, and that that sum was on that day due from him to the company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing about it. It formed no part of my duty as managing director of the company to receive moneys on account of the company, and I have received no moneys from Mr. Kleman on account of the company since the 31st January, 1866. I decline to answer the question so far as it relates to private transactions between me and Mr. Kleman, inasmuch as there are important questions pending between us relative thereto. I protest against your right to ask a question as to my banking account, but I state that I have had no private banking account since the stoppage of the company. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What date do you refer to when you speak of the stoppage of the company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can give on other answer. I look at the minute book of the company, market T I was present at the meeting of the 1st March, 1866. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the company then stopped payment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you a banking account on that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By that answer do you mean that you don't know or that you decline to say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't recollect. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who were your private bankers before that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Bar-nett, Hoare, and Co. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you drawn out all the money that stood to your credit with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I decline to answer. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where are your old pass books with Barnett, Hoare, and Co. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have them in my possession. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the counterfoils of the cheques you drew upon them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I may or may not have them. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you, to your knowledge or belief, destroyed any counterfoils of cheques drawn by you on Barnett, Hoare, and Co. since the 1st June, 1866? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge or belief. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if not destroyed, they would necessarily be in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I have no doubt they are."</p>

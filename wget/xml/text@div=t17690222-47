On the 17th of September last, a little after one o'clock, the prisoner and another man came into my kitchen booted, and whips in their hands. There were several of my neighbours drinking and they asked most of them how they did by their names: Most of them were housekeepers. There were some steakes on the fire; they asked if they could have such; a butcher that was there said they could; they ordered a pound and a half, he fetched them, and my servant dressed them. They asked how my family did, and said they were sorry my wife was sick. The prisoner said they had some drafts, and desired I would change them. Then they fell into discourse with a cheese-monger; the prisoner and the other man calling themselves cheese and butter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220031"></xptr> factors from Nottingham. They were I believe half an hour in the house before the prisoner offered me this draft again. (Producing one.) I said, Are you sure this Smith is a good man; the prisoner said yes. I took it of him, and carried it up stairs, and brought down 15 guineas, and delivered them to him.</p>

            . That is a very remarkable man; he has a very great dent in his chin. I really thought that some cheesemonger had been paying them a bill. They said they had a great way to go, and it would save them an hour if I would change it. I went on the Wednesday following to Mess. Fullers, and presented the bill for payment; they said it was good for nothing, and hoped I had not paid the money for it. I said indeed I had. I brought it away, and have had it ever since. That man was certainly Richard Smith that was with the prisoner.</p>

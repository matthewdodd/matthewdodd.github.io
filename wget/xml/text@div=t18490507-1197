                  </hi> I am publishing clerk at the <hi rend="italic">Watchman</hi> office. The prisoner occasionally brought advertisements to that paper, and we allowed him 20 per cent, upon them—we gave him that before we received the money—he was not authorized to receive money—I have told him several times that he was never to get any money—he has never paid over these sums.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it always your custom to pay the commission before the account is paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the prisoner always received it so—I generally paid him on the Thursday—he has collected advertisements eight or nine months, and has brought money to me once or twice, I have then received the money—I remember his receiving 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of a person named Dixon. in Oct. 1848; he retained that for a fortnight—he brought the money and the advertisement together—he has borrowed money of me and paid me out of the commission he has received—I have sometimes had two I. O. U.'s of his at a time—I did not always pay him beforehand—sometimes he brought advertisements at the beginning of the week, and Thursday was the pay-day—he never mentioned these matters to me—Mr. Gawtress, the editor, is not here, but he told the prisoner in my presence that he was not to collect any money.</p>

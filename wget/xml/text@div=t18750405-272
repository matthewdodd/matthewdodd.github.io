                  </hi>. I am a cattle salesman, and live at Stonebridge House, Tottenham—there is a house next door which is also my property—it was empty in the early part of February, and had been empty for some time—it was locked up and the shutters fastened—on the evening of the 3rd Feb<lb></lb>ruary, when I returned home from the city, my servants told me they sus<lb></lb>pected there had been thieves—my gardener, Warner, went into the house, I did not go myself—I was getting up about 6.45 on the morning of the 4th, when my partner, who stays with me, said something to me, and I looked out of the window and saw three men coming into the garden next door—I hurriedly dressed myself and went out, taking a revolver with me—I went to the next house, and just outside the door I found a coster<lb></lb>monger's truck with some sacking on it—I drew that out in the front court, and went out into the road to look for a policeman—I could not see one, but George Wake, a gardener of a friend of mine, came along, and he came and assisted me—we went to the house, and by that time Warner, my own gardener, had come—we went to the back of the house—my gardener heard something and rushed to the front, and then I heard a noise, so I ran round to the front, and then I saw the prisoner Martin run across the road, and by the side of the road—I have no doubt at all about his identity—I said "Stay, or I shall shoot you"—he said "Shoot!" and he kept on running away—I did not shoot—my gardener followed him up, and I did not see any more of him till he was in custody—I went into the house and found that the copper had been taken from the scullery, several of the gas fittings were cut, and the lead removed from the top of the house, all ready for re<lb></lb>moval—it was about 9 o'clock when I went into the house on the morning of the 4th—I had not been in for a week before that, but my gardener had looked after it—I did not see the other prisoner at all, only coming into the gate—I believe he was one of the three that came into the gate.</p>

I am gardener to Mr. Honck, and live at Stonebridge House, Tottenham—I went into this house on the evening of the 3rd Feb<lb></lb>ruary—I saw that the house had been broken into, and the copper was re<lb></lb>moved from the kitchen—I went to the top of the house and found the trap door leading to the roof broken, and lead had been stripped off the roof—I took away the ladder that led up to the roof, and brought it away with me—I went then and gave information to the police—on the early morning of the 4th I went round to the house and saw my master there about a few minutes to 7 o'clock—I went to the back and found they had got in a window there—I then went round to the front and saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners coming out of the area—I have not the slightest doubt about them—I called out "Here they are "to my master, and they both came down with their hands clenched in a fighting attitude, and said "I am ready for you"—Martin had something in his hand, but I can't say what it was—I can't say that Coaffee had anything—I made a catch at them, and I missed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050057"></xptr>
               <p>my hold—Coaffee went over a brick wall, and I missed him; I turned after Martin then—he ran away and I followed him—he went through a brook twice and me after him—I saw him throw something into the brook, but what it was I can't swear—there was 2 or 3 feet of mud at the bottom—he turned round several times and shook a stick at me, and said "You b----if you come near me"—ultimately he got into a coal siding belonging to Messrs. Lea &amp; Co., and I called for help there—he had got a stick in his hand, which he would not throw away until a man came up with a dog and threatened to set the dog at him if he did not, and then we apprehended him—he said he would go with me—I said "No, I shall call on these other three men to go with me"—they got him to the station house—I had seen the house all safe, and the things in the right place on the Saturday before Thursday the 4th—I found that a gas fitting had been removed on the 4th which had not been removed on the 3rd—I saw that up myself on the night of the 3rd in the front room.</p>

            . I once lodged in the prisoner's house. She has been reduced. She came into my house promiscuously. Being destitute of a servant, I took her for her victuals and drink, She had been at my house the Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. She never lay in my house. Last Monday there was a few words among the people in the tap room. She went out of the house at that time. After that I saw a woman with one of my handkerchiefs on; I knew it by the mark. I took her to justice Welch. She said, she bought it of the prisoner at the bar. I took up the prisoner: she owned the fact upon being charged with the things mentioned in the indictment. She had the other handkerchief in her pocket, and the apron on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

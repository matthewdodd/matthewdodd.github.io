When I went away with the carriage, I gave him the key of the stable door, and desired him to take care of it, which he promised he would. My box was just come out of the country; in my absence he took out of it two pair of corderoy breeches, a pair of leather breeches, a coat, four waistcoats, a great coat, three shirts, marked C. T. and a pair of buttons. About four in the afternoon I returned with the coach, and found the stable door about half open, my box opened, and every thing took out but one shirt and two pair of stockings. I suspected the prisoner, and had him taken up. I saw my cloaths again at Guildhall.</p>

            . About 10 o'clock in the evening, when I came home, I saw a sack in my room; I asked my man what it was? he said a man left it until called for; my curiosity led me to open it, when I found a great many things in it. Soon after the prisoner came into the tap-room, where the sack was, and said he wanted the sack he had left there a little time before, I asked him if the things contained in it were his own? he said they were his own cloaths, and if I would let him try them on, every one in the sack would fit him. I told him I would stop him till he had taken an oath before a magistrate that they were his, which he said he would do. We went to justice Whiteworth, who would not permit him to take the oath, but ordered him to go and bring some voucher to his character. He went away, and I sent a man to watch him; he went into the Black Horse in the Borough: among the things in the sack I found a letter directed to

He told me that he had pawned a pair of knee buckles at a pawnbroker's at London Wall. (The buckles were produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor, who said they were in the knees of the black corderoy breeches.)</p>

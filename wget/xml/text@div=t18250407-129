On the 26th of February I sent him to take a coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, to Mr. Smith, in Holloway-row; he returned about eleven o'clock, and said there was no message; he brought back the handkerchief which the clothes were in; he went out on the Sunday morning but did not return; I saw the clothes at the office, I think, on the Friday afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Had there been any difference between him and you before? A. Yes, he had absconded from me under atrocious circumstances; I was accused of not teaching him the business; the Magistrate compelled me to take him back.</p>

I am a salesman, and live in Broad-street; the prisoner brought some clothes to my shop on Saturday night, the 5th of March; he asked 50 s. for them; I said I would give him two guineas; he said his father was going to send them home, and it was rather too late, and therefore he wanted to sell them; I bought them and put them on my shelf; his father came to me on the Tuesday morning afterwards, and asked if I had the suit of clothes. I said I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they left with you to be taken away the next day? A. No, they were to be sold by me; I sold them to his father for 2 l. 7 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate make you return the 2 l. 7 s.? A. Yes.</p>

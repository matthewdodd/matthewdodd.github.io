On the 16th of November, I went up stairs, and on coming down I saw the prisoner in the shop, looking at some caps; she approved of one, but thought the price too much, and that one with less work would be more suitable. She said she was in no hurry, and would look in again; she went out, and my daughter told me that she missed a cap. I went out and saw her crossing the road, about thirty-five yards off, and turning round, as if undecided which way to go. I beckoned to her - she turned, and went in an opposite direction, quickening her pace. I went and told her to come back to my shop. She said "You cant want me." I said "My daughter wants to speak to you." I then saw something compressed in her hand; she then gave the cap to me, and said "This, I suppose, is what you want."</p>

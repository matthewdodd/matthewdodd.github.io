My wife asked me if it was a good shilling, while I examined it the prisoner went out, it was a crooked one, I found it to be a very bad one, it was the same shilling the prisoner gave me, I have no doubt, I put the shilling in my pocket, I kept the shilling in my pocket with two or three others, but I made sufficient observation to know it again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you put any particular mark on the shilling so as to know it again? - Yes, I cut it on the edge?</p>

               <p>I was present on the 22d, I saw the prisoner tender the shilling; and have a glass of gin, he called for a pint of been, but before it was drawn he went out; he returned in about ten minutes; I then asked my husband if he had examined the shilling? on his return he called for a glass of gin and bitters, he laid down half a crown, I looked at it, I tried it with aqua fortis, he tendered me a shilling, that was also bad; I called my husband, I asked him to look at the shilling he had taken before. I asked him what he had done with the change which he received of us for a bad shilling? he said he had been among a pack of whores. The constable was called, who took him into custody.</p>

I am a dairyman, of 82, Shoe-lane—on 28th July, about 8 in the evening, the prisoner came for three pennyworth of eggs—my wife served him—he gave half a crown—my wife looked at it—the prisoner said, "Don't you like it? if you don't, give it me back;" and put his hand over the counter to take it—I stepped forward, and took it—I found it was bad—I asked the prisoner where he got it—he said from his master in Tottenham-court-road—I asked his address, and he gave it, at the White Horse, Fetter-lane—I was in the act of taking it down, and he said, "Not at the White Horse, Fetter-lane; at Albion Chambers, Castle-street, Holborn"—I was not satisfied with the address, and said, "I must detain you, and give you in charge"—he attempted to leave the shop—I followed him outside—a constable came up, and I gave him in charge with the half-crown.</p>

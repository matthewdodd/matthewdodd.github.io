On the 6th of March the prisoner called on me and bought a tea-caddy, which came to 9l., and asked the price of some card-tables. He asked me if I objected to take a bill? I told him I did not, if the parties were respectable. He ordered the tea-caddy to be finished by Wednesday the 11th of March - He went away, and returned on Wednesday, it was ready for him; he said it suited him. He said he had brought the bill, and produced it. He said he should like some card-tables very well, but he thought them too dear. He paid me the bill, and gave me an order for a loo-table. The card-tables were delivered to him with the loo-table-(looks at the bill)-this is it. I never received the money for it-it is noted. It was due on Saturday, the 25th of April. On that day I met him at the corner of Lower Northampton-street, and told him the bill was due that day; he said it was, but he had got a letter from the party in the country, and they were not exactly prepared to take it up, and he wished to have it renewed. I told him it would certainly be presented that day.</p>

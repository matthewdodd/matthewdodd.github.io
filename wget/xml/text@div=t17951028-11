               <p>Q. Are you a pawnbroker? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the things? - The prisoner at the bar. She went with me From my shop to the office; I went with her and took the goods, a table cloth, five shirts, and five napkins, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring them as her own? - Yes. I had been out the same evening, I came home about seven o'clock; she was in the shop, my servant was asking her some questions concerning them being her property, and I came into the shop and asked her several questions myself; she said they were her own.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped her? - I did. Then she said they belonged to her husband, and afterwards to her brother; I said she should go before a magistrate. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Had she lived in your service? - Yes, three months, as house maid; she had left it on the 25th of September, on that day; they have every appearance of being mine, I did not know that there were such things lost till I had seen the advertisement, and had seen the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You only judge from the appearance that they were similar, to some that you have? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say being on your oath you will not say positively. I believe with respect to the woman at the bar, you had a very excellent character with her? - Yes, a very good one, and she behaved extremely well in my service.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you don't mark your linen yourself, it is done by somebody else.</p>

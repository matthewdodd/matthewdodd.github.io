               <p>Q. Do you mean the prisoner? - A. No, she asked me if she might take another woman in with her, as both their husbands were in Ireland, to help to pay her rent; they paid me one week, and in about three weeks I missed the sheet and the blanket off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Bell hire this blanket and sheet with the room? - A. It was my furniture; I heard that Mr. Bell was gone to Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner pay Mrs. Bell for the use of the room, and of the furniture? - A. I dare say she did, but I do not know; I saw the property afterwards at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>(William Chamberlayne, the pawnbroker, produced the property, and deposed, that he had them of the prisoner, on the 8th of November).</p>
               <p>JOHN MARSDEN sworn. - I am an officer, I found the duplicate upon the prisoner, that is all I know of it. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Chamberlayne. This is the duplicate I gave the prisoner.</p>

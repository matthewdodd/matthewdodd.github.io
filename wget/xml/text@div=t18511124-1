In the early part of Nov., last year, Mr. Stafford was acting as my solicitor—I went with him on 5th Nov., in consequence of an appointment, to the prisoner's residence—some conversation took place between the prisoner and Mr. Stafford on the subject of an advance of 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to receive security for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I was to receive back, the additional 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being a bonus for advancing the money—a declaration was read over in my presence, and the prisoner's—the negotiation was not com<lb></lb>pleted, as my solicitor did not get there in time to meet me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Buckingham-street, Strand. Mr. Thomas Holt is a client of mine—I have known the prisoner twenty-five years, but not to be on terms of communication—on 31st Oct., last year, he applied to me to know if I could raise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture and household effects of a gentleman of first-rate standing—after some little debate, I told him I had no doubt I could—he then said, "Then it is for your humble servant"—I made some little hesitation, but he had got his carriage at my door, and urged me to go over and look at the property—I went with him in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240006"></xptr>
               <p>his carriage to Holly-house, New Kent-road—I was shown the furniture, and from my previous knowledge of the prisoner, I was perfectly staggered to see him in such a position of life—it was a large house, elegantly furnished—he said it contained twenty-two rooms—I did not go over them all—I agreed that 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be advanced—I in point of fact agreed that the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be advanced, but he was to produce his plate first—he made a communication to me the following day, saying that 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would answer his purpose; and, as I had no doubt about the value of the furniture, I assented—I told him that as this must be a matter strictly conducted on principles of business, I should require him to make a solemn declaration, under the Act of Parliament, that the property was not in any way encum<lb></lb>bered—(on my first going to his house, I asked him if the property was not settled on his wife—he said, "Oh! no, my dear fellow, I have been doing excellently, I have been getting 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the last three years")—he appointed to call at my office, in Buckingham-street, on the Tuesday morning prior to the appointment to make the declaration at the Bow-street police-office—he did not call—he agreed to make the declaration—it was prepared, and he was to have sent me the inventory of the furniture—on the Tuesday morning, instead of calling on me, he sent his carriage for me, and I took the declaration and other papers with me to his house, and found him there waiting, Mr. Holt had not arrived—he arrived afterwards, and in his presence I read the declaration over to the prisoner, who had gone out in the mean-time between my arrival and Mr. Holt's, to declare to it at the Southwark police-office—I had read it over to him first—he brought it back to me—I said, "We can't complete the business to-day, you never sent me the inven<lb></lb>tory of the furniture"—he said he had sent it by a friend of his, and he concluded that I should come with the securities perfect—I did not go with him to the Southwark police-court—he returned with the declaration, and said he had been—he said, "Here is the declaration"—I examined it, and it appeared to have been perfectly made—after Mr. Holt arrived, it was read over again in his presence and the prisoner's—320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced on that day on the urgent application of the prisoner, he giving me his assurance that the deed should be executed as soon as the inventory was attached to it—this is the bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not got a farthing of the money back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Southwark police-court. This declaration was made there when I was acting as clerk—this is Mr. A'Beckett's signature—he is one of the metropolitan police Magistrates, acting for that district, and in that court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>tours are from 10 to 5—I make no note if the Magistrate goes away for two or three hours, but if he went to take an examination I should have the examination itself.</p>

A. B.," and this "G. A. B." is in my writing—I do not generally put the Magistrate's initials myself, but my attention was called to it a few minutes after the declaration was made—Mr. A'Beckett was absent for a few minutes, and I changed the county from Middlesex to Surrey, and put the initials, but he disapproved of it afterwards—these other two are in the Magistrate's writing, and this is mine—sometimes declarations are brought signed, the Magistrate then asks the party if it is his signature, and certifies to it on its being admitted.</p>

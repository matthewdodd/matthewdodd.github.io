                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and carry on business at 10, St. George's Circus, Southwark—I know the prisoner by sight—I had never seen him before 22nd May—on that day he came into my shop and offered this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had received a list of articles from the police which I was not to take in pledge—I compared the watch with that des<lb></lb>cription—I asked him where he had got it; he said he had had it seven years, he had had it in India—I pointed out to him that it corresponded with the number on my list and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective M</hi>). I received the prisoner into custody with this watch—I asked him how he came in possession of it; he said, "I bought it in the East Indies five years ago; if you say it is untrue you will say a rum thing"—at the station he made the same statement—his brother came to see him at the station, and asked him how he came possessed of it, he had better speak the truth—the prisoner said, "I received it from a prostitute in the borough and this is the chain"—he said he could not give any description of her, her name, nor address—he said he was very sorry he had made a false statement before the police magistrate.</p>

I am a merchant, carrying on business at 8, Bennett's Place, Gracechurch Street—this is my watch, not the chain—I lost the watch the day the Czar visited the City—there was a great crowd—my coat was buttoned up; when I got out of the crowd the watch was gone and the chain hanging down—I gave a description of it to the police.</p>

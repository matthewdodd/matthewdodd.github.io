            . On the 19th of November about Eight at Night, as I was returning from Kingston Market , I was met between <placeName id="t17401204-2-crimeloc9">Brentford</placeName>

They took me off my Horse into a-Field, pick'd my Pocket of my Money, and put a Groat into my Bag again. I can't say which in particular took my Money, for they were all together. When they had robb'd me, I went a little Way on the Road to Richard Hall's, to get Assistance to take them, and when we came back, they were in the Field, and fir'd at me directly. The Prisoner attempted to get over a Hedge, and was taken with a cock'd Pistol in his Hand; he said he would yield, and that it was the first Fact, and that he should be hang'd for turning his Coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were several Men in the Field, and I did not know but they might be Rogues; so I cock'd the Pistol in my own Defence.</p>
               <p>Richard Hall. The Prosecutor told me he had been robb'd, so I charg'd a couple of Guns, and I and my Man went to the Field where this Robbery had been committed. I saw three Men in the Field, and the Prosecutor was immediately wounded in the Neck by one of them. The Prisoner was taken as he was getting over a Hedge with a Pistol cock'd in his Hand, his Coat turn'd, and his Wig in his Pocket. We found a Bayonet, and two Hats in the Place, one of which the Prisoner own'd to be his.</p>

            . I was desir'd by the Prosecutor to assist in taking the Prisoner. I took another Man with me, and we went one Way into the Field, and Collier and Hall another; as soon as they got past the Gate, the Prisoner fired at Collier and wounded him: I saw the Fire fly, and immediately heard a crackling in the Hedge; I jump'd thro', and took the Prisoner with a Pistol leven'd at my Head.</p>

             . I assisted the last Witness, and when Hall and Collier came through the Gate, a Pistol was fir'd, and presently we heard the Hedge crack; we immediately got through the Hedge, and Wood presented his Gun at the Prisoner, and swore if he did not surrender, he would blow his Brains out, he then yielded to us and we took this Pistol out of his Hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Intention was to go to Thistleworth , to see a Friend, and I was weary, so I enter'd this Field to rest myself, and just at that Moment this unhappy Affair happened. I was alone, and carried the Pistol for my own Defence. <rs id="t17401204-2-verdict11" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am an officer. In consequence of the directions I received, I went to search the prisoner's house, in Burton-crescent, Lambeth-road, on the 26th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon - there was no appearance of a sadler's shop outside. His wife came down, and denied him to me; I went into the back room on the same floor, and saw him; he denied having three sets of harness and seven collars; which I was sent to search for. Parker went with me, and found the harness produced, in different parts of his shop, just in the same state as now - the collars hung up; he was behind the door which, being shut, concealed him. He then asked me to let him put on a clean shirt; I told him I must go with him; he then said he would be d - d if I did - I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was a small room, and looked like a harness shop; he never told me who sold it him, nor did he refer me to any house in Whitechapel-road.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PARKER. There is an addition to the materials which was not there when stolen. The harness which was found in the prisoner's house was cut in pieces - they were nearly new when I lost them - they wanted no repairs - Wilford made them for my master. They were two sets of harness stolen, and part of another which are now made three.</p>

They were in pieces when I bought them. I made them up, and sold them to Smith, a servant of Mr. Dixon's, which I should not have done, had I known them to be stolen.</p>

            . In November last I worked for the prisoner - I took work home to do. One Monday morning I saw a man come for money for harness, which then laid about the room; he asked for 5 l., which was paid in my presence; he was a short dark man - I was employed to make them into sets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you present when it was bought - A. No; it is nearly two mile from his house to mine - I often go three or four times a day. I then came for materials to complete a back-band - I then saw the man - I wanted nothing else. I stopped half an hour, but sometimes I stopped an hour - my master had nothing to do but to give it me. The man was there when I got in - he only wanted the 5 l. - I cannot tell what kept him. He signed in my master's book for 5 l., having previously signed in it for 1 l. I saw him put his mark in my master's book - I should know his mark - I have never seen the book since. I never attended his examination, but should if I had been required. I did attend, but was not called.</p>

I have not been there, because I thought nothing of it; I cannot say whether my master keeps one book or more; it was a long narrow book - my work was not entered there. I lived at No. 23, Upper Marsh, Lambeth, then, and live there still, I did not observe the leather in pieces, nor whether they were good or bad. The leather put to it was nearly as good as the original part, I do not think it was quite so good. I was there half an hour, and saw the money paid - he came for it; all this passed, while I was there.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Clark, and keep an oil-shop in Shadwell. Brown came, on the 22nd of August, to my shop, and asked the price of white paint—no one was with her—I did not miss any thing then—Mr. Jackson, an opposite neighbour, came and told me something—I then looked, and missed five brushes—these are mine, they are marked A. C.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Shadwell. I was standing at my door about half-past one o'clock this day, and saw the two prisoners near Mr. Clark's—they passed two or three times, looking into the shop, apparently intending to rob it—after passing the third time Brown went in and Coleman waited outside, and as Brown was going in Coleman took off these five brushes from the side of the door, put them under her cloak and went up the street—I went after her, and she was taken—I went to the shop and told what I had seen—as Brown was going in she covered the other while she took them off the nail—they were four or five feet inside the door.</p>

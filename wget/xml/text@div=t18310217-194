I have known him since May last - he wanted to buy a pair of shoes of me, but I said I wanted them myself; I went out about two o'clock, on the 29th of December, and when I returned, he had gone out with my shoes - I met him on the the 25th of January, with them on his feet, and gave him in charge; I had never lent them to him - he <rs id="t18310217-194-deflabel1166" type="occupation">works for the parish, at watering the streets in summer time, and at other times he sings ballads</rs>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked him to let me have them, and he refused - I was much in want of them, and when he was going out, I asked him to lend them to me; I thought he said Yes - there were five or six persons in the room when I put them on, and I left my own under the table.</p>

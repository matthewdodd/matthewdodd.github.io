            . On the 21st of June I was standing at my door, which is opposite Jewin-street, in Aldersgate-street - I heard the cry of Stop thief! saw a crowd, and the prisoner running before them. I went into the middle of the road; as he came down the street he ran between the coaches, with some difficulty I seized him, and held him until Burt came up, and said he had stolen her necklace. He denied it - she persisted in it. He began to cry, and said he had thrown it among some rubbish - he took me to the spot where it laid. I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge.</p>

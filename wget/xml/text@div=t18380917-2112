                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Wilson, who keeps the Hand and Shears, in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great. On the 3rd of September, I was alarmed from one to two o'clock in the night—I was up in the house, but the doors were shut—all the company were gone that had been taking liquor in the house, but some musicians were having their suppers, and likewise the waiters who had been assisting in the house—in consequence of something I heard, I went up stairs, and found the bed-room door open, and the first drawer, going into the room, was open—that lad been locked, and the room door had been shut and latched—my ser<lb></lb>vant had gone to bed shortly before, and done it—I did not see it shut myself—there was nothing kept in the drawer but clean towels—I found nothing disturbed in the room, but that drawer—I came down stairs imme<lb></lb>diately, and laid hold of the prisoner Smith, at the bottom of the stairs, and led him till assistance came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's niece. About two o'clock in the morning of the 3rd of September, as I was going up to bed, I found the two prisoners coming down the stairs—they both passed me—one rushed out at the door—I heard my uncle call "Stop thief," and I caught hold of the other, who was Smith—I had no light in my hand, hut my sister-in-law was before me, with a light—I could not discern Wilson's face to swear to him—I had not seen him in the house that night—I had been serving at the bar, and did not see either of the prisoners there—I laid hold of Smith, and brought him down to my aunt at the bar—she held him till the watchman came—the men were coming down the second pair of stairs, from her bed-room—I met them half-way down the second stairs, between the first and second floors—her room is on the second floor—there are five rooms above stairs, where the lodgers and the pot-boy sleep—my aunt sleeps in one—I and the servant in another, and a coachman and pot<lb></lb>boy in another—my sister-in-law does not live there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

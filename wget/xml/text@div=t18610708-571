                  </hi>. My husband is an artist's colourman, and keeps a shop at 49, Dorset-street, Marylebone—on 8th June, the female prisoner came about a quarter to 5 o'clock, and asked for sixpenny worth of moulding wax—I told her I had it, but my husband was out, and I did not know where it was—she said she would call on Monday for it—she asked for threepennyworth of burnt umber, dry—we had none dry—I told her we had it in oil colours and in tubes—she said, "You have threepenny sticks of Indian ink?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "I will take one"—I gave her one—she tendered a half-crown—I thought it looked very bad when she put it down; I tried it, and it bent—I told her it was bad, and she said, "I suppose I have taken it in change at Epsom"—I asked her if she was the person that gave Mr. Eatwell a bad two shilling piece three weeks before—she said she had not been in the shop for five months—I said, "Very well, a person has been passing bad money, and I shall send for a policeman"—I knocked, and in the course of a few minutes one of our men came to the door, and I sent him for a policeman—the prisoner said, would not my neighbours fetch me a policeman; should she fetch one herself—I told her to be so good as to keep her seat—she said yes, she would walk into my parlour—by that time the policeman came—I told him I had served her with a threepenny stick, and that she had given a bad half-crown, and if he thought she was guilty I would give her in charge—he said he could not tell without trying—he asked her where she lived—she said in Berwick-street, Soho—I told her it was a long way for her to come for a threepenny stick of Indian ink—she said she had friends living by—I gave her in charge, and gave the policeman the half-crown and the two shilling piece that was given to my husband on 10th May—I was not present on 10th May—it was the two shilling piece that was marked by Sergeant White on 10th May.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, D</hi> 16). Early in the month of May I saw the two prisoners in High-street, Marylebone, standing together in con<lb></lb>versation—I saw Palmer take a packet from his pocket, break it open, and give the female prisoner a coin—after that he left her, and went to Mr. Ensoll's shop, a draper, in High-street, and was looking in at the window—the woman followed, and went into the shop—I watched until she came out—she was there about eight or nine minutes—when she came out she returned the same way that she had come; down High-street, towards South-street—the man stopped at the window for about a minute and a half after she came out, and then followed her and joined her at the corner of South-street and High-street—I kept them in sight till they got to Win<lb></lb>chester-street—they stopped in the middle of the street in conversation, and I passed them, and saw the man give the woman another coin in her hand—they parted, and when at the corner of Dorset-street and East-street the male prisoner made a nod with his head, and the female prisoner went into Mr. Eat well's shop—she was there about five minutes—upon her coming out I went in and saw this counterfeit florin, which I marked—when I came out of there I looked for the two prisoners, but could not find them—I believe that was about 10th May—on 8th June I saw them together in High-street, Marylebone, about half-past 4 o'clock—I was not able to follow them then—about a quarter to 6 o'clock, that same afternoon, I was going to the station-house, and saw the male prisoner smoking a pipe about fifty yards from the station—I had heard of a woman being in custody, and a descri<lb></lb>ption was given—on nearing the station I saw the male prisoner walking up and down smoking a pipe in Wigmore-street, about fifty yards from the station door—I went across to him, took hold of both his hands, which were in his pockets, told him I was a police-sergeant, and was going to take him in custody—he asked me what for—I said for being concerned with a woman who was at the station, whom he knew, with uttering counterfeit coin—he said, "I will not go, I am a respectable man, and I will make you pay for it"—he resisted greatly—after some trouble I got him into the station-house—upon searching him, I found thirteen sovereigns, one crown piece, nine half-crowns, one florin, one shilling, one sixpence, threepence farthing in copper, good money, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—that was found in sundry pockets—ten sovereigns in one pocket, three sovereigns in a pocket-book, and the silver and coppers in another pocket—I searched his coat pockets, where I found a railway guide, two handkerchiefs, a boy's leather belt, a piece of calico, a piece of black net, a cotton stay lace, a stay hook, two skeins of cotton, a small new piece of Turkey sponge, six steel pens, a knife, tobacco and pouch, three pencils, a mackerel, some fennel, two mutton chops in separate papers, a rasher of him, three papers of gooseberries, and a quantity of memorandums—all his pockets were full of the things—I asked</p>

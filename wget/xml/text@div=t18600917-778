                  </hi>. I keep the Radnor Arms, King Henry's-walk, Islington—I live there—some time ago the prisoner was in my service as potman for five or six months—he has left me nearly a twelvemonth—about 12 o'clock on the night of 30th August, I was sitting in my back parlour—in conse<lb></lb>quence of hearing a noise I went to the top of the staircase that leads down to the cellar and opened the door—I heard a little more noise, and I directly returned to the upper kitchen and took the kitchen poker—I had a candle in my hand—I then went down the stairs, directly opposite the cellar door, that I should have had to unlock to turn the gas off—I was holding the candle to look in the coal-house, and the prisoner rushed in front of the door with both hands up, and struct me a violent blow on the forehead which knocked me against the opposite wall—it was not with his fist, it was with something heavy—the candle fell and was burning on the floor—there was a dim light—I saw him coming from the coal-hole and I met him with the poker, and struck him as hard as I could—I struck at his head—he then rushed at me—we had a struggle—I gave him what we call in wrestling a buttock, and fell heavily upon him—we struggled a consi<lb></lb>derable time—he held my head down on his chest, and I lost my poker—when I found it I called out, I was swinging it at the back of me, fancying there might be some more of them, and I gave him a punch on the bead with the other eud of the poker—he then called out, "Hold hard, Mr. Horner, don't murder me; it's George—I am alone"—I recognised the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186009170062"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner perfectly by his voice—I then got my elbow across his throat, and forced myself from him and said, "Oh! it's you, is it?" and I gave him another good one with the poker—it was quite dark—I then rushed upstairs to see if any one there had taken the cash—I got a brace of pistols and then came down again—the prisoner was then gone—I then looked to see where he could have come in or gone out—the doors were bolted, but there was a square of glass broken just below the catch of the window, leading into the back-kitchen, and the upper sash was thrown down—I examined the premises outside the window and found a small ladder, or steps, of mine that would lead into the area and the back yard—any person could get over the wall into the street through the garden—I had a glimpse of the man before the candle went out—I have no doubt, whatever, that the prisoner is the man; I will swear to him—he had his coat done up, but from his size, stature, and general appearance, I belive him to be the man—the doors were all bolted—no one could get out of my house except by the window that was broken—the lower sash was screwed down.</p>

I am potman in the prosecutor's employ—I used the back kitchen as a pothouse, and clean the pots there—On the evening before this took plave I was in there at 8 o'clock—the window, that was afterwards broken, was all fastened at 8 o'clock—I had seen the prisoner on the same Thursday, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in the Back-road, Kingsland—that is about two minutes' walk from my master's place—he asked me if I was going to stand anything to drink, and we went and had a glass of ale together, and during that time he asked if the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> was out for a holi<lb></lb>day; and I said, "No;" he then asked if we had the little dog yet—I said, "No; we had lost it about six weeks"—he said, "Have you?"

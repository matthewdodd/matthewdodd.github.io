On the 28th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I suspected him, and as he was going out of the shop I stopped him, and saw some numbers, consisting of ninety-six sheets found upon him, and some copper-plate engravings of the work - it would make sixteen shilling numbers. I asked how he could be such a villain as to rob me; he made no answer.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Saunders. On the 28th of August, I was at work in the warehouse - the prisoner came up, walked about, and went into the front ware room, where this work was, and I saw him let some numbers drop on the floor, and when I looked he was picking them up, and putting them into his pocket - he went down stairs very quick; I followed and overtook him before he got to the bottom, and asked where he was going - he said he was going away; I asked what numbers he had in his hand - he said nothing that I could understand. I took him up into Mr. Saunders's room, and took the numbers out of his pocket - he said he had bought them. I said I was positive that he took them out of the shop; he had said nothing to me about buying them before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not between the stairs and Mr. Saunders's room - A. No. he was below the room.</p>

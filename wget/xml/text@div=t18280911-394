I asked to look at the corn in the bin, and told him I had seen the same thing done before, but he denied it; I went to the corn-binn - two men were sitting there; they got up, and the corn-bin was full of the same description of corn as this; I called my brother-officer to take charge of the sack and the prisoner Pratt - I went into the tap-room; Gigg and Ball were taking some refreshment. with two other men, who had come before; I said, "Who drove up the two last carts?" they said they did - I said, "The ostler is in custody, and I shall take you;" Gigg said he hoped I should overlook it this time, and it should never happen again; Ball said, "You never saw me." The sack was brought to the Police-office, and Mr. Dean saw it there.</p>

            . I am servant to James Scott and his son - they are in partnership; Gigg and Ball were in their service. I saw a sack with corn in it, which was in every respect like that belonging to Messrs. Scott's - there were oats, beans, clover and chaff in each; Gigg and Ball had their corn measured out to them every week, and they mix it themselves - it is not mixed in the bulk; each of them keeps his own corn, and each takes out corn to give his horses in the day: Gigg has been in the employ eight years, and had a good character.</p>

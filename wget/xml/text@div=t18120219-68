            . I am a brass-turner; I am an apprentice to Mr. Harris. The prisoner came to our house on the 18th of January and enquired for a person of the name of Nash; this was at three o'clock; I requested him to come in; I called Nash down, he came and spoke to them; they went out together; Nash returned in about three quarters of an hour; the prisoner came again about a quarter to seven, and enquired for Nash; I asked him to come in and shut the door; I called Nash and lit my lamp to give light to the parcel. I returned with Nash; the street-door was open and the lamp blown out; the parcel was gone when I came down.</p>

The prisoner came to my house on the 18th of January, at half past seven o'clock in the evening, he asked me if my husband was within; I told him he was not; he went out, and returned again in about five minutes; he asked me if he should leave the bundle; I looked at him, and said, yes, if he liked.</p>

I never saw him to my knowledge in my life; he left me the bundle; he asked me if I would lend him a pound on it, I innocently let him ten shillings in halfpence, and ten shillings in silver, and he went away, and then on the Monday following he sent for four shillings more, I refused him. The officer came afterwards and claimed the bundle; Townshend and Perry came and claimed the bundle.</p>

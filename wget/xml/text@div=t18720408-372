                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Henry Williams, and carry on business as Benjamin Edgington, tarpaulin manufacturers, at 2, Duke Street, London Bridge—in April or May, last year, I saw the prisoner; my partner had seen him twice previously—he spoke about purchasing rick-cloths, and stated that he had a large farm in the neighbourhood of Reigate, and had suffered a good deal in previous years from loss of hay, from not having rick-cloths, and he was determined to have some—he said he was an old friend of the late Mr. Edgington, and had known him—he also stated that he was a member of the Fishmonger's Company—he said his waggons were generally in London every week, and his man should call and fetch the cloths away—he ordered two rick-cloths of the value of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on that occasion I did not hear the name given definitely, it was entered first of all as Tisson or Tissen—on searching the books we could not find any such name, and we wrote to the prisoner and asked him for a reference—I copied the name from the signature to a letter I had received. (<hi rend="italic">This was a letter dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th May to Lyson, Mead Vale, Reigate, enclosing an invoice for the two cloths and asking for a cheque for the amount, or a London reference, signed "Bedgington.</hi>") The prisoner called after that letter was written, and I then asked him what his name really was—I had the Directory before me, and we had found Mr. George Tyser, a gentleman living at Reigate, in the Directory—I said if so we should not trouble him for a reference, as we knew him to be a respectable man—he said "Yes, I have had dealings with you before"—I think the address of Mr. Tyser was Parkside, Reigate—I said that I knew Mr. Tyser as a customer—he said "Oh, I have had goods of you before; it is quite right" I found that Mead Vale was a district, and so I did not think there was anything wrong with the address—believing that he was Mr. Tyser, of Parkside, Reigate, I sent off the things—they were sent down to Reigate, addressed to Mr. Tyser, by the South Eastern Railway—I gave instructions that the name in the order-book should be altered from Tyssen to Tyser, and it was altered—I have not seen anything of the cloths since nor of the money—I sent my collector down to Reigate, but he is not in London at present—I was afterwards sent for by Mr. Williams, and I saw the prisoner in a cab at London Bridge—that was the 22nd January—I had not seen or heard of him between May and January—I gave him into custody—the constable refused to detain him, because it was only a mis<lb></lb>demeanour—he was not detained; but he promised to surrender at the Police Court the next morning—I went there, but he did not make his appearance—I got a warrant, and he was afterwards taken into custody.</p>

               <p>my partner—I did not address the letter which was written myself—it was copied from the memorandum which the prisoner had written—it appeared to be Tyser or Lysen—it did not look like Tyser—on the last occasion I said that Mr. Tyser was a respectable man, and he did say "I have had things from you before," but he also said that he was Mr. Tyser—he said "I am the same man, and have I had things before"—Mr. Tyler's name was not in our books—it appears that he had been into our place, making inquiries about goods, and I was under the impression that his name was in the books, but on subsequent inquiry, I found I was wrong—I found Mr. Tyser's name in the Directory, and I had my hand on it at the time I spoke to the prisoner—I did not take his address down then, it had been given previously as "Mead Vale, Reigate"—Mr. Tyser's address was Parkside——the prisoner did not mention Parkside—that is the name of Mr. Tyser's house as it appears in the Directory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman at Reigate Town station—on 26th May three packages of rick-cloths came to the station from the London Receiving House, addressed to Tysen, or Tyson—I have copied it in my book as Tysor—the address was Reigate—they remained at the station till 10th June—I know the prisoner by the name of Tyson—he came to the station two or three days after the goods had been lying there—he tore the old labels off; and re-labelled them "To Dorking station, till called for," in the name of Tyson—they were sent to Dorking station on 10th June, with other packages—when he came he walked up to the goods and said "These are my goods here," and he compared the labels with some writing he took from his pocket—he then said he wanted them all sent to Dorking—he paid the carriage that was due from London to Reigate, and I forwarded the charges on them to Dorking—my book shows from what station I received them, but not from whom—I did not get the labels, the prisoner took charge of them—I don't know where they came from, but I know that they were rick-cloths.</p>

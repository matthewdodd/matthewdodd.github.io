               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Do two or three nutmegs form a sample and no more? A. They would form a sample for a man in this line; but a merchant might take a sample of a pound weight, not more - he would not weigh them - he would be helped to them, and not take them himself - they would not be weighed, and might be more or less than a pound - William had served him with the ginger that he bought.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned a bag; was your bag lying on the counter? A. The linen bag the nutmegs were taken from was ours; but he put them into a blue bag, which was his own - he brought it into the warehouse; I saw it in his hand after he came in - he placed the bag down by the side of our goods - when he asked for William, he had the bag in his hand - it was hid when he put the nutmegs into it - he did not conceal it before - he placed it on a bag by the side of a box near the door - it was impossible for anybody, if they had not been very sharp, to have seen him do it - if the door had been open, it would have hid the bag, but the door was shut, I could see the bag.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do merchants take samples when nobody is present? A. They do not help themselves - he had said nothing about nutmegs that morning - I think he had forty-seven nutmegs in his pocket.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors - on the previous evening I had directed the last witness to have his eye on the prisoner; and on the morning in question he came to me - I went to the warehouse and said to the prisoner, "You have been taking some nutmegs" - he denied it - I cannot recollect his exact words - I think it was, "I have done no such thing" - I then felt his blue bag which he had in his hand, and found there were nutmegs in it- I said, "That is sufficient for me," and went out for an officer, leaving Brooke with him - the officer came - he was taken into the counting-house and searched - ninety-eight nutmegs were found in the blue bag, weighing more than a pound, and forty-seven in his pockets, weighing about half a pound - I had given him leave to take no nutmegs - he had not dealt with us for nutmegs - he is what we call a jobber about town, selling spices in small quantities.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long has he dealt with you? A. About two months - he has not bought large quantities of spice at our house - he may have bought of other houses - the nutmegs found in his pocket were a different sort to those in the bag - the precise words he used were, "I have taken no nutmegs" - I will not swear I did not say, "You have been stealing some nutmegs" - when the officer came I had taken the bag from him, and put it into the counting-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suppose you had said, "You have been stealing nutmegs;" did he make for answer, "No, I have not: I have taken a few for a sample?" A. No; he said nothing about a sample till it was discovered he had them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it in your presence he said anything about the sample? A. Yes, after I returned with the officer - they were not taken from his pocket till the officer came.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I was sent for to the prosecutors' warehouse on the 15th of February- I searched the prisoner, and in his left hand coat pocket, and in his right hand trousers pocket, I found forty-seven nutmegs - I mixed them - I suppose fifteen were in his trousers pocket - there were ninety-eight in the blue bag - when I had emptied his coat and trousers pockets, and put them on the desk, he said he had taken the forty-seven for a sample - he confined his observations to the forty-seven, as I had not then found the ninety-eight - he said nothing about them till he was going to the Compter - he then said he had bought arrow-root of the prosecutor, which turned out not so well as he expected, and he had taken these ninety-eight to get the money back, which he had lost by the arrow-root.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the prisoner a foreigner? A. I should think he is: he appears so.</p>

             re-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Do you know of any transactions about the arrow-root? A. Yes; he had bought, I believe, two or three qualities of arrow-root, and desired our warehouseman to mix them together, as he had sold them at one price - he sold them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200092"></xptr>to a customer of his, and I suppose had them returned on his hands - he brought the box back to us, and wanted us to exchange it, which we refused to do - he said he had not the opportunity of selling it - it was spoiled for us, because it was mixed - he had selected the qualities himself - it is not customary to take goods back - the value is about 30s., the nutmegs are worth 15s.; but he has had a portion of the arrow-root back since he left it at the warehouse - he could have the rest at any time.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the arrow-root his, though in your warehouse? A. Certainly - he did not ask me for leave to take nutmegs to make amends for the bad arrow-root - Mr. Mayor's partner's name is

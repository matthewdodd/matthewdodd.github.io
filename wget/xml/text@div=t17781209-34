               <p>I was going by the waggon to Bristol. I was to meet the waggon at the Swan, in Holborn; these men, as soon as I laid my bundle down, said, are you going with our waggon to night; that was at the Swan, in Holborn; I was at the Swan, it was about nine o'clock; the waggon, they said, was to set out between five and six. Taylor sat in another seat there. I came and laid my bundle down; I laid my bag down with my child; and a person came with a letter to me; my child is ten years old. Taylor came over and said,</p>
               <p>"Are you going out with our waggon to night?" I said, yes sir, I hope so. I said I must call for a letter in St. Giles's before I go, how long will it be before the waggon goes out? Taylor said it would be above an hour. Then said I, I will go to St. Giles's, and call for the letter I was to carry to my brother at Bristol. I took my bundle with me; he took my bag to the waggon end, in Holborn, and gave it to Figges, to carry till we came to St. Giles's; coming up <placeName id="t17781209-34-crimeloc216">Holborn</placeName>

When we came to a publick house, which is the last Coach and Horses but one in Holborn, towards St. Giles's, he said that was the house he was to take up a parcel in; said he to me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090043"></xptr> come in; he called for six-penny worth of gin and water, and asked me to drink with him; he came back to Figges in the seat, and said lend me half a guinea; he asked me to lend him half a guinea, and my passage down should cost me but six-shillings for me and my child, and that he would save me nineshillings; with that I gave Taylor the half-guinea; Taylor said to Figges, go out Thomas, and see if the parcel is ready, in such a place. Figges went out and staid a quarter of an hour; I said, come along, I am afraid the waggon will be gone; d - n the waggon, says he, it dare not stir an inch without me, for I have the books at the White Horse-cellar . Figges came in soon after, with two tarts for my child; I asked what they cost, I would pay for them out of the change of my half-guinea. No, he said, he was the father of children, and loved to look upon a child; we came away, Figges gave my bundle to Taylor to carry; when we came to St. Giles's I asked for my bag, they would not deliver it to me; Taylor said he would go with me to my friends, and tell them I had not money enough to pay my journey, and I might perhaps get some money from them; and Taylor told my friend that I had but ten shillings to pay my passage. I said I with you would be kind enough to hold your tongue, I don't want to encroach upon my friends for any thing, I will do as well as I can. After I had called upon my relation, Figges delivered the bundles back again to me; I had asked for them before, and he had refused to deliver them to me; and we were going to the waggon; just as I got into Monmouth street, Taylor knocked me down, and dragged the bags from under my arm, and said to Figges, halloo Tom! here, take this.</p>
               <p>What hour was it? - It was between six and seven o'clock, it rained very fast; there was not a person standing any where; I lay some minutes before I could recover myself, and my child was screaming; the parcel contained the things mentioned in the indictment. (repeating them). I did not think the prisoners were bad people when I went with them .</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What time in the night was it when you first came to the Swan Inn? - Between four and five, because the waggon is appointed to go out at five.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking before you got there? - Not a drop, but a farthing's worth of small beer at dinner.</p>
               <p>What did you drink after dinner? - A pint of beer, when Taylor came and told me he was clerk to the waggon.</p>
               <p>They all drank at the Swan Inn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you drink after? - Only a draught out of a pot of beer at my friend's where I called for the letter.</p>
               <p>Had you no gin? - No; when they called for gin and water in Holborn, they asked me to drink, but I would not.</p>
               <p>I thought you said, that after you was knocked down, or fell down, that you did not think they were bad people? - I thought they had ran on before me.</p>
               <p>Whether any bargain was made between you and Taylor to spend the evening together? - No, none in the world; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any conversation where the bundle was to be left for you that night, at a public house in Holborn? - No; I don't know where it was to be left, but Taylor told him to carry that away?</p>
               <p>Can you remember whether there was any such conversation? - I know no further conversation than I told you.</p>
               <p>What was the crime that you charged them with before the justice? - With knocking me down, and robbing me in the street.</p>
               <p>What did you say the first time you was before the justice? - I was called into the room, and asked if any of these men were concerned in it; by-and-by these men were brought in. I was called again, and asked if I knew any thing of these men; I said yes; there is Taylor that knocked me down and robbed me; and there is Figges, which is the man he gave my parcel to.</p>
               <p>After you had told the justice that they knocked you down and robbed you, did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090044"></xptr> say that you thought them bad men? - I thought at first within myself, may be they were only gone in a hurry with the parcel to the waggon.</p>
               <p>Don't you recollect that there was an agreement that this bundle should be left at the Cock and Hoop ale house for you the next morning? - No; Figges next morning said the bundle was at the end of Gray's-Inn Lane, Holborn; he went with one of the men; the bag was produced; I said that is my bag, but it was tied with a red garter; yes, said Figges, so it was.</p>
               <p>Was you knocked down with any degree of violence? - I lay some minutes before I could speak a word.</p>
               <p>If they knocked you down with any degree of violence, how could you think that they meant this harmlesly, and were only gone before to meet the waggon? - It was because I was foolish.</p>

               <p>On Monday morning, the 16th of November, the waggoner at the Swan Inn, Holborn-Bridge, came to Sir John Fielding's Office, and asked me if I knew one Taylor; I said I knew his name, but did not know his person; he said that Taylor and another person, shorter than himself, had taken a woman from the Inn, knocked her down, and ran away with her bundle; he said a person informed him at the Inn, that he was to meet the driver of the Andover waggon in Piccadilly; I went to Piccadilly, and there I took the two prisoners; it was about ten o'clock on Monday morning. I searched them, and found a little flat iron, and this tin box. (producing it) I found it in Taylor's pocket; and there was an indenture which I took out of Figges's pocket. The landlady of the house said a bundle had been just left; I took the bundle to the

I said, is this your bundle? she said no; it passed for tea, but upon opening it, it was found to be 8 half-pounds of sawdust. I asked Figges where the bundle was; he ingenuously told me that he had left it at the Cock, near Holborn Bars; he said it was not himself that had done it, but that it was Taylor had; I sent Carpmeal for it.</p>

            's. I found a flat iron in Taylor's pocket, which the prosecutrix said was her's; she picked the prisoners out from a dozen, I believe. Figges then said, if I would go along with him, he would tell me where the bundle was. Another man and I went with him to the Cock, a publick house in Gray's-Inn Lane, there we found the bundle.</p>
               <p>(The different articles that had been found were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>TAYLOR's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went down to the Swan, at Holborn Bridge, to know when my brot her-in-law would come up by the waggon. I had a pint of beer there; this woman knew me. She said Taylor are you here? I said yes. She said she had just booked herself to go down to Bristol; that she was sorry for it; but, says she, now you are come I will not go down before Wednesday; she said she had had one parcel booked. I borrowed three half-pence for her of Figges; she went down to the bookkeeper, and said she could not go till Wednesday, and she had her name scratched out again; the waggoner gave her half a guinea. The waggoner laughed and said, I know what you want. She took the bundle out, and away we came to the Cock and Hoop, the corner of Gray's-Inn Lane; there we had a glass of gin a piece at the door; she said she was going to carry a letter to Bristol, and would get a bottle of gin, for she had a bottle in her pocket. I said I must stop at the Coach and Horses, for I had some money to receive; there we had six-penny worth of gin and water; I asked the landlady to give me change for a guinea; she said she could not; but the prosecutrix said she would lend me half a guinea, for it made no odds between she and I. She lent me half a guinea directly; she said she should be too late, she was afraid, for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090045"></xptr> waggon; I said you are time enough; she did cannot you tell my friends I have got no money to pay for my carriage; and then I shall get some more; and I don't mind spending it all, if you and I shall lie together. She went and bought some gin, and then brought the flat iron and things, and asked me to put the flat iron and things into my pocket; we drank that pint bottle of gin out between us, and I had to do with her, that is the truth; then she began talking to the mob in that sort of way. I told her that she knew where to find her bundle, that it was left at the Cock and Hoop. I knew the prosecutrix down at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>FIGGES' DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>She and this man agreed to go to bed together that night; and they gave me the bundle to take care of, till next morning; I took the bundle home, and laid it under my head all night; when I got up in the morning, I was going down to the Cock and Hoop; I overtook Taylor; I asked him what had become of the woman; he said she was so drunk over night, he could not keep her company any longer; that they had spent most part of the money. I left the bundle in the morning with a lad, and told him to let a woman with a child have it; I was going to work at Kensington, for Mr. West; there I lit of them; I told them directly as they asked me, where the bundle was left; they went and enquired there, and they had it directly. I am a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutrix. Did you know Taylor before? - If I was to die this minute, I never set my eyes on him. I drank no gin, nor never was to bed nor board with him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Figges before? - I never saw one of them to my knowledge, all my days before; I never had the least acquaintance with them; I had never seen them before.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you an Irish woman? - Yes .</p>
               <p>Court. Was you in a private room with Taylor? - No. Before I saw him, I went to the book-keeper with a piece of new linen cloth; I said I had but half a guinea, I shall be short of money, take this linen, my passage will be paid when I come down. I said so to the book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Figges. Taylor called upon me on Sunday afternoon to go down to the inn with him.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I went to the inn to enquire whether my brother was come up by the Taunton waggon; I lay with her in the gateway, after we had drank the bottle of gin out.</p>

               <p>I am book-keeper to the Bristol waggon.</p>
               <p>Do you remember this woman coming to take a place on the 15th of November? - I remember it very well.</p>


               <p>What did she pay for it? - She paid nothing at all; she was to pay her passage at Bristol, for herself and child.</p>
               <p>She did not pay a half guinea then? - She paid nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she seem in liquor? - I did not perceive that she was at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. What time of day was it? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090046"></xptr>Did she give you a piece of linen to keep for her? - Yes; wrapped up in a cheque apron; she delivered it to me as security for the payment of her passage when she came to Bristol.</p>
               <p>Does this Taylor belong to your waggon at all? - I never saw him before that night. After I had entered the piece of linen in the book, she went up to the tap-house, to wait till the waggon was ready to go; and she came down again with Taylor, and said she had met her brother-in-law, with a letter from her husband, that required her staying in town a little longer, and she could not go till Wednesday night; she asked me to let her have the linen that I had charge of, out of the waggon; I told her I could not do that, but as she was going on Wednesday, it would make no difference. Taylor said he would be d - d if he did not have it, for if she paid me two-pence for booking it, he would compel me to let her have it. I said it was a thing we never did, after having taken charge of goods, to deliver them back again; as she was going to Bristol a few days after, it would make no difference, and I had given her a note for the delivery of the parcel at Bristol. Taylor said d - n the note, throw it down, and we will make him deliver it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they seem acquainted with one another? - I cannot say they seemed much acquainted; but she referred to Taylor, and said you see my brother-in-law give me a letter; and after she had been robbed she said that that story was what he had told her to say, as they were going to the waggon from the tap-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she come back to your inn that night? - I did not see her any more that night; she came back to the house, but I did not see her till the next morning. She lay at the inn.</p>
               <p>Did she, next morning, tell this story as she has told it now? - Yes. She said that her things were lost. I said that served you right; why did you hearken to that man. Said she, he told me that he had the management of the waggon at Piccadilly, and I should go for six shillings, and save nine-shillings; and she said he bid her tell me that she had received a letter from her husband.</p>
               <p>Court . Did she tell you the same story that she was knocked down, and had her bundle taken from her that night? - She did, when I saw her, which was the next morning.</p>
               <p>For Figges.</p>

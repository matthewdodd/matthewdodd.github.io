She came on the 16th of May; we lay together. I had half a guinea in a little box, with a pair of silver sleeve-buttons in my pocket, before we went to bed. A young man that was at my house (who is now gone to sea) wanting to know what o'clock it was, I opened a chest which was in my room, and took out my watch and told him; I put it into the till of the chest again, locked the chest, and put the key in my pocket. At going to bed, I laid my pocket on a table hard by. The prisoner lay along with me: in the morning I found my stockings, which I had taken off my legs over night, in the chest. I had not put them there. The prisoner was then putting on her things. In looking into the chest, I missed the watch out of the till: I said, Who has been here? She said, Have you lost any thing? I said, Yes, my watch. She said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176205260003"></xptr> the young man has taken it away. I said, No, I put it into the chest and locked it in; to be sure it must be you that has taken it. She stripped herself to her shift, and took a book from out of the window, and got upon her knees, and took an oath that she knew nothing of it. I was so affrighted, that I said very little more to her. She took her cloak and wrapp'd it about her, and said she must go do her business, and went down and went away. I went and told the person who recommended her to me of it. He went and found her, and brought her back to me. She had got herself dressed in other cloaths than what she had on before. She had on a black petticoat and a washing gown. I got a warrant, and took her before the Justice. The next day I found my watch at Mr. Andrew Popard's, a pawnbroker. My box with the half guinea and buttons were gone from out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been out of your room before you got up?</p>
               <p>M. Boyd. I cannot say she had; the door was bolted over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the prisoner's cloaths when she stripped herself?</p>
               <p>M. Boyd. No, I was so frighted I did not touch them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your money and buttons?</p>
               <p>M. Boyd. I opened the box about dusk in the morning, and I saw the money and buttons there then.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did you not make me and yourself drunk, and went to bed and left the door open?</p>
               <p>M. Boyd. I was not in liquor. She shamm'd drunk.</p>

               <p>There was a young man who came and took the watch out of the chest, and asked her what o'clock it was. She said either three or four. He came backwards and forwards in the room. She, he, and I went out and drank together: we drank gin, and they made me drink a good large glass. We had seven or eight glasses of brandy, then we went to see him on board. We had beer also: we came home and went to bed, and got up together. The door was wide open when we got up. When she charged me with the watch, I stripped myself naked: I had nothing. Then I bade her a good morrow, and went away. I told Mrs. Knox she had lost her watch as I came down. She said she did not believe her.</p>

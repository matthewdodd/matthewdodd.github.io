They sent for a full Pot of Beer, and called Sturges down; Stark immediately took him by the Collar, and said, G - d D - n you Sir, you are my Prisoner, and pull'd out his Bayonet, and stuck it into the Door Post. I then called Mrs. Crosley, and she said, there were 38 Men in the House, and if they were let out they could not make them good; but Stark said, that Sturges was a Deserter, and they would take a Deserter any where. I desired the Woman to go for the Deceased, or some Officer, they staid a good while, and the Deceased came; I told him that they wanted Sturges away; he then drew his Hanger and went in, and said, Gentlemen, what do you do here? He put his Hanger up before he came into the Prisoner's Sight, and bid me put them out of Doors. They all went away except Ozell, and the Deceased kept striking them with his Cane all the Way down the Steps, and as he was turning about to come in again, with his Cane under his Arm, Stark drew his Bayonet, and stabb'd him under the left Pap. The Deceased immediately said he was killed; he was carry'd in Doors, and died in about 10 Hours. I pursued the Prisoner Stark, and took him about 200 Yards from the House, and when I came back with him, Ozell was standing by the Fire Side, and did not offer to do or say any Thing. When the Deceased came first into the Room, they were all standing with their Backs to the Fire, and he bid them go along, they mutter'd something, and he then can'd them out.</p>
               <p>Stark. On Wednesday last I met with Champion, Ozell, and Price; they asked me to go and assist them to take a Deserter, I went with them, and thought it had been an Ale-House; Sturges came down and they seized him; I own I drew my Bayonet, but it was to keep the Deserter in the Room; we all sat down, and were very easy till the Deceased came in, and then he drew his Hanger, and struck me several Times; he came out of Doors and beat me, and I can't say but that I did take my Bayonet when his Blows came so fast, for I was afraid he would cleave me down.</p>

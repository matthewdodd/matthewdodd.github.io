                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Charles Nicholson and another, of Nos. 61 and 62, St. Paul's-churchyard—they deal in silk—there is an entrance to the shop at Nos. 58 and 59, Paternoster-row. On The afternoon, of 7th Dec., the prisoner came in a little after 3 o'clock, at the Paternoster-row entrance, for some calico which she had paid a deposit on a few days before—she received the parcel, paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and went away—in about a quarter of an hour she returned and wished to match the calico that she had just had—she looked at some and purchased a remnant, and also some lining, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—she said she would look at some alpaca, a piece was shown to her—she said that she had got a friend outside who was rather shabbily dressed, but would the young man who was serving her mind her coming in—he said, "Certainly not"—the prisoner went out, and we then missed a silk dress length, value five guineas and a half, which had been lying on a table—the prisoner returned in about half an hour, and came in at the Paternoster-row entrance—I then went behind a stand and watched her, without being seen, by looking between some ready made dresses—she was looking at a dress, and I saw her take up two dress lengths and place them tinder her shawl—I then "walked down to the bottom of the shop and told the young man to get a constable—I then asked her to look at some shawls, to detain her, but she would not, and I saw her drop these silks on her lap and then they fell under the table—I picked them up and gave her. in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was she sitting down at the time she dropped them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—while the young man was making out the bill for the alpaca, she took them—while he was gone for the bill, she got up, looked at a dress which was lying there, and took it to the light, and with her hand placed the dress lengths under her shawl, and sat down again—I went to her, said that I saw her drop them, and gave her in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How loose was she there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven or eight minutes from the time she came in the third time—she had been sitting there two or three minutes when she dropped the dresses—it is very large shop, and has a large crystal front—young men do not stand outside to show goods to customers—if there is a lady looking, we may invite her in, but we do not pay a young man for the purpose—there are sixteen or eighteen young men—we generally show the silks at the Paternoster-row end, because there is more light—the tally trade has not been carried on during the seven months I have been there—the young man had to go about ten yards for the bill head—he is not here—he had got back before the dresses were dropped—I am shop walker—my attention was to her, and not to him—he might have been coming back at the time she was seating herself—she paid the bill before she was taken into custody.</p>

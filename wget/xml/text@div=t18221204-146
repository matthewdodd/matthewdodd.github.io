On the 4th December, a little past five o'clock, the prisoner came into the tap-room; he had been in the house a quarter of an hour, then went along the passage into the yard, and could then easily get into the garden; he returned; I did not notice that he had any thing; he went again about five minutes after; and again returned. He was the only person who went into the yard. About five or six minutes after the gown was missed, I sent after him; the servant brought him over, with three or four persons who were with him. He denied taking it, I sent for a constable. The gown was produced, and he begged for mercy.</p>

            . I am servant at the house. I went after the prisoner about a quarter of a mile, and brought him back across the fields, having found him in a house in Bath-street. He denied all knowledge of it, and came with me and two more who were with him, and on turning the corner. I picked up the gown on the step of a door. We had passed close by these steps, I went that way, and must have seen it, had it lain there then. Nobody was near the house but himself and the two men. I gave the gown to my mistress, and told her where I found it. He said he hoped my master would forgive him.</p>

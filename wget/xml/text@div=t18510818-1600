                  </hi>. My real name is Esther Woolf. I live at 31, Buitesland-street, City-road, and am in the habit of walking about Cheapside—the prisoner walks there occasionally—she has used threats to me on several occasions—nine months ago, after her sister was fined and imprisoned for stabbing me on the forehead, the prisoner threatened that she would either stick a knife through my heart, or serve me as her sister had done—I was always in fear of her—on the week previous to this matter she said she would do for the b—y Jewess; she would go to prison for me, if she had a month for it—on 7th July, about half-past 11 o'clock at night, I was standing in Cheapside, talking to a gentleman; the prisoner passed me with another girl, who has been discharged—the gentleman wished me good-night, and walked in the same direction—five minutes afterwards the prisoner came up to me, and said, "Jewess, where are you going?"—I was in such a tremble and fear, that I said I was going home—she said I must come and have a drop of gin; I said I did not drink gin; she said, "You must come"—I looked for a policeman—I asked her to go to Mr. Smith's; she said she would not go, as he would turn her out—she took me to the Three Butts; I just put my foot on the threshold, and she poured me out a glass of gin; I said I would not drink it for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she gave it to the other woman, and gave me a glass of gin-and-water; I would not take it—she said, "Here goes, I want to be jolly drunk to night"—I am very near-sighted—I stood with my back to a warehouse, waiting for a policeman to come—I said, "You must excuse me, I must go"—she said, "Jewess, I have been greatly embittered against you, but may God strike me dead if I wish to do you any more harm"—I then saw something running down me like treacle, and said, "Oh heavens! what have you done?"—she ran away, and threw a basket, which the had on her arm, into the road, and I fell down—there was another party with her, but she stood away from me—my dress and three or four of my under-clothes were burnt through; if I had not had on seven or eight petti<lb></lb>coats, it must have gone through me—my bonnet-strings were burnt, and I was in dreadful pain—my back pained me three or four days.</p>

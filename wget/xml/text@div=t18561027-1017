About a quarter to 4 o'clock, on the morning of 2nd Oct., I saw the prisoners coming out at the side door of No. 43, Frith-street, Mr. Brown's—I was about fifty yards from the door—they walked away towards Soho-square—I went, and found the door three parts open, and a candle burning, just inside the door, up against the wall—I then went after the prisoners—they walked into Queen-street, and, seeing a sergeant, they ran, and they looked back, and saw me—I was then almost up to them—Sergeant Barton joined me at the corner of Queen-street—I sprang my rattle, ran after Billings, and stopped him in Greek-street, losing sight of him for a second while he was turning the corner—I took him back to the house, and then to the station, searched him, and found nothing on him—I asked his address—he said, No. 12, Bedford bury—I went there, and inquired of the lodgers, but could find no one belonging to him.</p>

On 2nd Oct., about a quarter to 6 o'clock in the morning, I heard a rattle, and a cry of "Stop thief?"—saw the prisoners run from Queen-street into Greek-street—I was about forty yards from them—they are the men, but I did not know who they were at the time—Harriss ran into the doorway of No, 55, Greek-street—I secured him there, took him back to No. 43, Frith-street, searched him partially, and found sixty-three silk handkerchiefs bound round his body under his shirt—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a portion of them—I took him to the</p>

               <p>station, and found on him two coats and a waistcoat of Mr. Brown's; four silk handkerchiefs round the calves of his legs, over his stockings, and under his trowsers, and one round his neck—I examined Mr. Brown's house, and found the socket which the lock of the street door shoots into, forced partly off, sufficient to let the bolt out—that had been done from the inside—the area grating fastens with a look and chain; and a hook, which went round the bar, had been forced by some instrument, so that they could let the bar fall, and then get down the area—the kitchen window looks into the area—the grating was down when I went, and the kitchen window open.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I was in Frith-street, and saw the prisoners where it crosses Queen street—I was on the opposite side, and saw Harriss coming along, and Billings about ten yards behind him—Elliott was some distance behind them, pursuing them—I spoke to him at the corner of Queen-street, where Frith-street crosses—I joined in the pur<lb></lb>suit, and the prisoners ran into Greek-street—I saw the same men taken—I am sure they are the men who I first saw in Frith-street—I saw no one else in Greek-street—I went to Kb. 43, Frith-street, and found this small piece of candle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) burning in the passage, and on the left of the passage a numberaf shawls tied up in this shawl, as many as it would con<lb></lb>tain—I found twenty-two handkerchiefs in the pockets of seme coats which were there, and which I was ordered not to bring here, and eight waistcoats and six coats on the floor—I found with the shawls a jacket, which I was ordered to give up to Harriss, he had asked for a jacket—I asked him which was his jacket, and he said, "This is" (I found it in the passage)—I said, "Do the keys belong to you that were in it f—he said that he knew nothing about them—there were four skeleton keys in the right pocket, and this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I believe that is the jacket which he has on—it has been a frock coat, and is altered, and is bound round the waist with worsted braid—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Ann, West<lb></lb>minster.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

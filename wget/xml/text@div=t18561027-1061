                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Taylor, of No. 21, Francis-street, Woolwich, a private in the Marines. The prisoner lives in the same house—on the 11th of this month, I saw her in the passage; she was not sober—she seemed to know what she was about—she came to the top of the stairs, and abused me—I told her to go away, and she laid hold of me by the hair of my head—she had a knife, and she dragged me into the pas<lb></lb>sage with the knife in her hand, and stabbed file ui the face twice—it was a common dinner knife—I had not had any quarrel with her at that time—my husband and her husband had a little grievance, they had been before a Magistrate—when she bad hold of me, I cried out for assistance—she spoke about my husband before she struck me—she said Mr. Green had paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that was a fine thing out of a private's pay—she cut me in my neck, and underneath my eye—Mr. Bull came and tried to take the knife from her.</p>

On the 19th of July, I missed a forty-pound note from my desk. I received it on the 10th of July, of Messrs. Drummonds, the bankers. Upon my missing it, I mentioned it to the prisoner that very night. On the 19th the prisoner appeared very much agitated, and said he had never seen a forty-pound note, he had, he said, been pressed for money lately, he was anxious to know if I knew the number, and offered to go to the Bank to shop it. I told him I did not know the number. I sent to Drummond's the following day, for the number. I sent for Foy on the 20th or 21st; in about ten days afterwards, Foy brought me a note from the Bank, of forty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no knowledge of the note, have you - A. No; I took no notice of it at the time. This is the note that Foy brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your desk locked - A. It was but I had a duplicate key; a new look had been put on the desk, and the old key opened the new lock also. I put the old key on the chimney piece, thinking it of no use; I did not know then that it would open the lock. I ought to have mentioned, that I sent the number and date of the note to the prisoner, the day after I missed it.</p>

In the morning, a person came to me about a forty-pound note, and said, they came from Mr. Barnard. He said, he had but thirty-three pound, if I could lend him the rest money to make it forty. I told him he was a stranger, I could do nothing of the kind. I took the thirty-three pound to Mr. Hepburn, the baker, of the opposite side. I gave him the thirty-three pound, and told him to keep it until the gentleman brought the rest of the money. The next day, or the day after, I saw the same gentleman; he gave me seven pound.

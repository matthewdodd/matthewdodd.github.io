             and I are partners, we live in Panton-street; about the 6th of Aug. I had weighed a parcel of cuttings of silver for the caster, which I delivered to another person to melt over again, not having enough for the caster; I laid it by till after dinner; I thought it not proper to leave it all in the scale; I found it weighed sixty ounces: I took the weights out of the scale, as if I had not weighed it; when I came to it again, I put in about 12 ounces. When I came back the prisoner was alone in the shop; then I weighed it, and found but sixty-six ounces: I had given the prisoner a cover of a coffee-pot to solder a button upon it; I sent him down to do it; I ran up stairs, and felt in his coat pocket; not finding any thing, I looked under the board where he worked, there I found a parcel of silver cuttings, which I thought were about the same quantity as were taken out of the scale; I put them into the place again where I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030011"></xptr> found them, and enquired about for a constable to have one at hand; I told Mr. Curry of it: I went and looked under the board again, when it was grown dark, they were gone: I let the prisoner go out; when he was gone about two or three doors from ours, I called him back; I told him there were some cuttings stole, and it was necessary to search all the workmen; the constable was not come, and during that time I imagine he slipped them out of his pocket into the sink, seeing him shuffling his right hand in his pocket; we went and found he had put them into the grinding-stone trough; I took them out; then he confessed the taking them, and said, it was the first time he had done it, and desired to be let go; I insisted on his being taken to the Round-house, while I got a search warrant to search his lodgings; in searching his lodgings the next morning, we found nine ounces; he has since owned he stole it, and owned he had stole silver before, and cast it into medals, and so disposed of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they weigh that were found in the trough of the grinding-stone?</p>
               <p>Ansell. They weighed about nine ounces.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he worked with you?</p>
               <p>Ansell. He has worked with me about five years; we found this mould in his room; (produced in court) it is for a large medal of King

            . I am journeyman to the prosecutors; Mr. Ansell sent the prisoner down to mend a spoon; then he told me he had seen some silver under the board; while he was mending the spoon, the silver was taken from the place; we all left off at seven o'clock; the prisoner went out, after which Mr. Ansell called him back, and told him he had lost some silver, and we were all to be searched; the prisoner wanted to go down stairs; I said, you shall not go without we all go; but he did go down, and we followed him; he went to the sink to make water, and at that time he slipped the silver out of his pocket into the grinding-stone trough; I was standing close by him, and saw him do it; he then confessed it, and said, it was the first time he had ever done so.</p>

On the morning of 13th July last, about ten minutes to two, I was on duty near 13, Eldon Road, Ken<lb></lb>sington—I saw the two prisoners get over the wall into the road and run away—I ran after them, overtook them, and asked Hall what he had—he said, "A present which my sister gave me"—I then asked what he had been doing at the back of a gentleman's house—he replied, "Nothing"—I then asked whereabouts the sister lived—he did not answer—I told him ho must go with me to the station—Francis said to Hall, "Stick to what you have in your hand; we will die before we go"—Hall said, "All right, we</p>

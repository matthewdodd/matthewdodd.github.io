                  </hi>. I live in New-road, Fitzroy-square, and am an engineer—I saw the boiler of a steam-engine which had been bunt on Messrs. Samuda's premises, at Blackwall, on the morning of the explosion—it was manufactured by Fair burn, of Milwall, Poplar—it was shown to me on the premises about an hour after the explosion—the amount of pres<lb></lb>sure that boiler was built for, I believe, was 20lbs.—I should say it was capable of sustaining a pressure of 40lbs. on the square inch, without the probability of bursting—the workable pressure was 20lbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there anything about an engine to inform the person the amount it is to be worked at? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The general strength of the plates and the form of the boiler—the overlapping will show the substance of the plates—a skilful person could judge of that—the amount of pressure ought to be marked outside, but was not—it was between a high and low pressure—it is difficult to tell now where high pressure begins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a safety valve to a boiler of this kind, if properly constructed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120028"></xptr>
               <p>let out the extra pressure in the boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, if properly con<lb></lb>structed and worked, it would allow the steam to escape so as to keep a proper pressure in the boiler—the valve is always so constructed—I made this plan of the boiler after the explosion—there was not sufficient left for me to say it is accurate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell the difference be<lb></lb>tween a high and low pressure boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say a low pressure boiler is constructed to bear steam at low pressure, and a high pressure at high—the extremes of the pressure are the only distinction—I cannot say where you would begin with high pressure, or leave off with low pressure—a tubular boiler may be applied to a high or low pressure engine—they are not all high pressure—there are several not high pressure—at present they are very much introduced in working low pressure engines, as they go into a smaller space—I have brought the original drawings made when the engine was made—I got them from Mr. Fairburn—I should say the plates of the shell of the boiler were not three-eighths of an inch thick—it is marked five-sixteenths on the plan—I should not wish to swear it was not three-eighths—I did not examine it accurately to ascertain the thickness—the boiler would, very likely, bear very considerable pressure of cold water—I do not say that it would bear 200lbs. to an inch—I do not say it would not—a vessel that would bear 200lbs. cold might be worked at 50lbs. hot water—I was not present the day before the accident—I have heard Messrs. Samuda are experienced gentlemen—I never saw the prisoner—I have heard they placed great confidence in him, and he has been with Na<lb></lb>piers, very considerable engineers—I have heard them speak of him as having very great ability—the upper row of tubes of the boiler were brass and the lower iron—I should think the expansive power of brass just dou<lb></lb>ble that of iron, but I have not gone into the calculation—it exceeds that of iron—some of the iron tubes were blown out at the ends by the explo<lb></lb>sion, and the brass ones were blown over the side, liberated at one end and blown over—it is unusual for the upper row to be brass—it is a very pro<lb></lb>per precaution—I have not seen it before—they are generally all of brass or all of iron—the prisoner could not know whether the whole tubes were brass or iron without being informed of it, unless he had gone into the boiler to see it, or been present at the manufacture—it would be his duty to obey the directions of his superiors—it is important that the tubes should be all of the same strength and power of expansion, capable of resisting the power applied—I have known engineers on railways refuse to use brass tubes made by different makers in the same boiler, as there are some very bad tubes and some very good ones—they should all be of the same power of expan<lb></lb>sion—all the engine makers and railway companies pay very great attention to the construction of their tubes—the question is not as to the quality of the tubes but the equality—if they were all of good quality, but of different powers, it would be dangerous—every portion of a tubular boiler should be equally strong or equally weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take this model in your hand, supposing it to be a faithful representation of that portion of the boiler, there is a piece of wood placed there, if a hook was attached, if the wood was made fast at the bottom, then the handle of the valve drawn down and the loop put into the hook, would that have the effect of opening the valve and keeping it open, instead of shutting it and keeping it shut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If drawn down and fastened to the hook it would keep it open—if the steam was coming</p>

               <p>out at the top it would show the valve was open—by lifting this lever the valve would open and the steam blow out—looking at the construction of the I valve I should say an obstruction of steam in the pipe might cause increased pressure of steam.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is tne reason of the tubes being partly iron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the event of the water being low in the boiler, the brass tubes, yielding to a lower pressure than the iron, they would melt first and prevent an accident—I should always make a boiler so—I do not think it would make any difference in the party working the engine, know<lb></lb>ing it was partly brass tubes and partly iron—in my opinion the explosion could not have taken place with 50lbs. pressure, or anything near it—it must be a much greater pressure—I should say above 100lbs. to a square inch would be the minimum—it is quite a matter of opinion—a 50lbs. pressure would not be a proper amount to apply to it—I think it excessive, and not safe. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could an engineer, acquainted with matters of this kind, be informed of that by observation of the boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The boiler had the appearance, by its form, of being very strong, and I do not know, unless his attention was called to it—he might be mistaken as to it, within 10lbs. or 15lbs. to a square inch—there is no use in this piece of wood in this model that I am aware of—it would be very improper to apply it to the boiler—if the safety valve had been open, It think the explosion could not have taken place—but there is one peculiarity in the construction of the valve, that although the steam might have been blowing off partly, there might have been too rapid a generation of steam—the relative dimensions of the valve-box are improperly constructed—al<lb></lb>though the valve might be open, the passage round the door of the box is not sufficient—the safety-valve is ill constructed, I think—if the valve was open, I think the explosion could not be of the nature I observed—not so great in extent, if open at all—part of the boiler was blown to a very great distance—except for closing the valve, I cannot see any use of that piece of wood—if it was placed in the position it is in this plan, with the Bail across it, it would close the valve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the safety-valve was not judiciously constructed; in what respect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The area of the safety-valve is twelve or fourteen square inches, and the passage would only allow an escape of three square inches—it should have been considerably more than equal to the area.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could it be steam<lb></lb>tight if more than the valve itself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would only allow the steam to escape when the valve was open—although the valve was open ever so wide, if the steam generated in the boiler to a great extent, I think it would produce danger—I do not think a person working the engine, uninformed of the construction, could perceive that the safety-valve was so improperly constructed—the accumulation of steam in a boiler is very rapid indeed—it is regulated by the heat by the fires below—any increase of heat produces a more rapid generation of steam—if the water gets rather low, there is a greater heat, and the water which remains generates steam more rapidly—that would be another cause—the heat of steam, when worked at a pressure of 50lbs., I believe would be nearly 300 degrees—that would increase the heat of the steam, as well as the pressure, and make it very apt to have a sudden increase, make the steam evolved more dangerous, and it would not be known to the person working the engine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would a person managing an engine be made acquainted with the degree of pressure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The general indication</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120030"></xptr>
               <p>is the diameter of the valve, the length of the lever, and the weight applied, in the absence of a mercurial guage, which I did not see to this engine—there ought to be one to every engine—the fulcrum of the lever is the extreme point—the number of square inches of the safety-valve would tell how many square inches there are—if the expanding place was only three, you ought to employ that—it was an improper construction alto<lb></lb>gether—by the construction of the outer box it would appear a very small valve, but in fact it was a very large one—that would not appear unless pointed out—he would know the pressure he was working at, but not the difficulty of getting rid of the over pressure, as the orifice has nothing to do with the amount of pressure—the means of letting out the steam might be dangerous and yet unknown to the engineer—it would be very difficult to know at what rate the steam was going off—he could not know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the iron rod lifted the weight, and regulated the pressure, and the steam was blowing off from the safety-valve, would he know what quantity of pressure there was on the boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not—by the limited space allowed there might be an increased pressure going On in the boiler—he could not know what proportion was escaping—if the cylinder worked sluggishly, it would indicate there was some obstruction in the steam-pipe from the boiler to the engine, or some valve or cock shut—I believe the cause of the accident was the difficulty created by the passage of the steam up the pipe—the cylinder working slowly would indicate that the steam was passing slowly—if the escape through the valve, or the other way, was stopped, it would increase the pressure—if the cylinder moved slowly, I should judge something intercepted the progress of the steam from the pipe to the engine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the action of the engine to indicate that little or no steam was proceeding through the pipe, what was the duty of the engineer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To have damped the fires, and see that the safety-valve was blowing off the steam.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed at Samuda's when this occurred. I had been there about six weeks—I saw the boiler when it came there—it had been there a fortnight when this happened—I saw it on the day of the accident, when the steam was up, a quarter or half an hour before the accident—Mr. Low was there, and he was the manager—there were other men in the engine-room—I then observed the steam blowing from the safety-valve—this model represents something like the safety-valve—by pulling this handle you can raise the valve—I saw a piece of wood, as it is here on the model, and a nail in it, lying against the side of the boiler—there was room for'it to work—the nail was not fastened to the handle when I saw it—it did not impede the motion of the handle in any way—it did not touch the nail when I saw it—it did not go past it—as I came by I did not know what the wood was for—I put my foot against it, and put it up—Mr. Low saw me, and told me to let it be, and he put it back, so as to let it play more freely—what I did to it made it more likely to interfere with the handle—I pushed it at the bottom accidentally with my foot, which raised it at the top—Burnand works there—he was not there just at the time—the explosion happened perhaps a quarter of an hour after I went out—this was Wednesday morning when I went into the yard after breakfast, before the explosion—I saw Mr. Low by the side of the boiler—I said, "This is a bad job, Mr. Low" (as the engine would not</p>

               <p>work fast enough) "we shall not get to work to-day"—he said, "Oh I do not know what is the reason the engine will not go, there is plenty of steam"—he said there was from 401bs. to 50lbs. of steam, and four or five men trying to turn the fly-wheel of the engine, and it was going but very easy, not near enough for us to work with—it never had gone fast enough all the morning—the explosion took place a quarter of an hour after this conversation—the engine works outside the place—I was in my own shop at the time—I could tell by the shaft in the workshop at what rate the engine was going, but I never saw it going faster than before.</p>

Q.</hi> Was there a space for play of between one and two inches between the nail and the safety-valve? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—his restoring what I had removed would enable the steam to escape from the valve—the steam was blowing off at the time—my pressing the wood up stopped it—on his removing it it went off again—I do not know whether the handle would catch against the boiler till that wood was placed there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live'in George-street, Bromley, and am a mill-wright; at the time of the accident I was in Messrs. Samuda's employ. I recollect the boiler in question coming on the premises—I was on the premises on the morning of the accident, and saw Mr. Low there, superintending about the place—I was working at the boiler the night before, attaching the steam pipes from the boiler to the engine, under Low's superintendence—I believe there was no obstruction unless there was water in the pipes—I consider there was water in the pipes—it was very cold, and snow and frost during the night—the bore of the pipe conveying the steam was about three inches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the pipes on a level, so that water would remain in them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the cold night might convert the water into ice—this was the 5th of March.</p>

               <p>what pressure there was on the boiler—the engine went by men <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> the fly-wheel round—I do not consider it went by the boiler—the pole being there would keep the valve entirely useless—there was a nail in it, with the point broken off—I put the nail in by Low's order—by propping the handle up it kept the valve shut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any play between the handle and nail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say what was the case at the time of the explosion, but when I put it there there was no play at all—the explosion was a quarter of an hour after—steam was blowing off rather violently while I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the prop kept the valve closed how could you account for the steam blowing off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The handle pressing the nail might make a space, and let it escape—I should say the valve was pretty well closed, but a pressure of steam forced it up—the higher the steam and smaller the vent, the more noise it makes—I cannot say whether Cockayne was there—I know I saw him on the premises—I went from the boiler to the engine-house directly I put the prop up—the explosion took place ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you had any quarrel with Mr. Low? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As to quarrel, I cannot say we had one, nothing at all; it is a great while ago—you very likely know what it was about better than I do—it was about a candle—I had some hammer-handles—he did not say I had no business with them—he asked what business I had with a candle in my drawer—it was not locked up—I had business with it—I know Charles Taylor—I did not tell him, when I came out of the Coroner's room, that I had done for the Scotch b----at the Town<lb></lb>hall, and would do for him again when I got to Newgate—I never said any such thing, I will swear—I do not believe I ever used such an expression, but Taylor met me one morning, and Cole, the foreman of the labourers, told me he knew nothing about it, and wanted to go up, and did not know what to swear to—I do not remember saying anything to Taylor, or seeing him when I came out from the Coroner—I will swear I had no conversation with him on that point—I do not believe he said, "How did you get on at the inquest?" but I will not swear it—I said I had spoken the truth, and would speak it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed at Messrs. Samuda's when the boiler came, and was close to it before it was fixed to the engine—it was in very good condition—according to its appearance I should not have</p>

               <p>liked to have been near it if worked above from thirty to forty pounds—I was there when the explosion took place—the fire was lighted before breakfast, early in the morning—I saw the prisoner afterwards there, a few minutes before the explosion—the boiler was in the open air—I was before it three or four minutes before the explosion, anjd about fifteen feet off at the time—the wood might have been moved afterwards, but at the time I passed it it wat similar to what it is here, leaning against the boiler—there was a nail in the wood—the handle of the valve was placid on the nail—it lodged on the nail driven into the wood, which would prevent the handle going down any lower—it might he from two to three minutes before the accident that I saw it in that state; I cannot speak to a mi<lb></lb>nute—the steam was blowing off from the safety-valve at that time but slightly—I judge of that by the sound of the steam—the noise was not much—I cannot say that I had heard the steam blowing off freely at all that morning—I had on Monday—it was not then attached to the engine, but the steam was up, and it blew off from the safety-valve—there was a pipe connected with the funnel—it made its escape up the funnel—it went by the side of the funnel, and then up the funnel—the noise I beard, when I saw the wood, sounded like the steam escaping; it made Us own peculiar noise—I went in front of the boiler about five minutes before the explosion, to thaw some ice in a small pipe attached to a can, and just before leaving the front of the boiler, Mr. Low came and stepped into the hollow in frost of the fire—I passed on, and in three or four minutes the explosion took place.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe the engine was just about to be stopped, to see the reason it did not work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> believe that was the case—the fires were very low—I cannot say whether before the wood was put there the iron handle was in the habit of getting connected with the rivet of the boiler, and making it fast—it was not my place to look after that—I had seen Low trying the piston-rod with his hand, and by that means I heard a greater escape of steam—I do not know who fixed the handle against the nail—there was plenty of water in the boiler, and very little fire—the engine had been tested the Monday before for about an hour—I cannot tell the power it had been working—there was no steam-gauge—I was nearly at the btek of the boiler at the time of the explosion—Mr. Low was very seriously injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brunswick-street, Blackwall I was in Messrs. Samuda's employ, and suffered from the explosion—I had the management of the fires and the engine too—the fires were lighted, between seven and eight o'clock—I saw the wood by the side of the boiler—I can<lb></lb>not say who put it there—I should say it was there merely to keep the valve partly closed, to keep up the pressure of the steam—I cannot say</p>

               <p>what pressure there was immediately before the accident—there was nothing to prove the pressure unless it was the weight of the valve—the steam did escape a little previous to the accident—I cannot say either way how the valve was at the time—I was in front of the boiler—Mr. Low was, to the best of my recollection, at the side of the boiler at which the wood was immediately before the accident—I was blown some distance—there was a box to the safety-valve—I do not know anything about the making of that—I saw the man placing it on, but it was not my place to inspect it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there as much as a shovel-full of coals on both fires? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not more in each fire—the engine was going to stop, to see what was the matter—it had stopped already, for it would not go—there was plenty of water—the gauge was up two inches and a half—it was no use to make up the fire after I saw it would not act—every<lb></lb>thing was thrown off—the engine had nothing but herself to drive, and would not drive that—the engine never went, from the time we set it off till the accident—we had to turn the fly-wheel round to make her go—we never got it fairly at work—the steam was no use to the engine—it had been tried on the Monday, and the engine had been exposed to a pressure of between 50lbs. and 60lbs. to a square inch—the valve acted on Monday the same as on Wednesday, when the steam was up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, and have been so eleven years. I have been eighteen years in the profession—on the Monday following the accident I examined the fragments of the boiler—they had been removed—some parts of it were driven a considerable distance, and some buried in brick work by the force of the explosion—judging from the appearance, I should have felt myself safe by the side of that boiler at a 25lbs. or 30lbs. pressure—I examined the safety valve—I believe the valve would not admit of sufficient space to relieve the boiler, if it had acted as freely as it could at the pressure the boiler was able to bear; but if it was able to sustain a greater pressure, a smaller valve would have done—there was only a sufficient escape of three inches—I cannot say whether when the explosion occurred the safety-valve was in action or not—when I saw the box of the valve, it had been blown some distance, and the lever was bent by being thrown against something—part of the valve was attached to the box—if the space round the valve had been acting freely, it could not have happened, but a three inch valve at the pressure the boiler was able to bear was not sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw the effect of the explosion; now, having regard to the imperfection, in point of size, of the valve, can you form a judgment whether an explosion of that intensity could have happened if the valve had been acting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, if the valve had been acting, I think not—I believe if the valve was high enough to admit of three inches to escape, it would have escaped—the explosion was so terrific, I should say it was impossible for the pressure to be less than 100lbs.—I never saw anything to equal it—the boiler was not capable of bearing that—if it had been, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120035"></xptr>
               <p>the valve was acting freely, it might have relieved itself—I consider it a low-pressure boiler; and it is the practice to put a safety-valve an inch in area, to every foot of fire-grate, every superficial foot of fire—this was rather below that, but I consider the valve quite big enough to admit of the escape—I infer from what I have stated, that the valve could not have been acting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the difference between a high and low-pressure boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the form—high-pressures are gener<lb></lb>ally made circular—it depends on the strength—a circular form is the strongest—the steam could not escape if the valve was down—I do not know how the witnesses could tell that the steam was blowing off freely—if there was no fire, the valve would let the steam off freely—it all de<lb></lb>pends on the heat of the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Messrs.

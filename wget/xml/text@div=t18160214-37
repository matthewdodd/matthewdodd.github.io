About nine or ten in the morning of the 15th of January, I had a bed quilt taken from me, out of a bed in our house. It was down stairs in a room adjoining to the bed room. I had not been in that room that day. It was not locked. The prisoner brought the bundle down stairs, and put it on the table. He was a lodger in my house for five nights. He slept in a two pair of stairs room adjoining the one from which the quilt was stolen. He asked me if I knew where he could get his jacket and trowsers mended; and I told him there was a woman next door who could mend them. One of my lodgers gave me some information about what the prisoner did at Mr. Lawson's, and in consequence of that I went there and saw my quilt.</p>

            . On the morning the prisoner took the property away from my landlady's, I went to Mr. Lawson's, the public house. I had not been there half an hour before the prisoner came in with a bundle, and I heard him request Mr. Lawson to take care of it. Mr. Lawson asked him what it was? and and I heard him mention the word quilt; and in conquence of this, I gave information to my landlady.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar came into my house between nine and ten o'clock, on the 15th of January, and asked me to let him leave a bundle there. I asked him what it contained? and he said a jacket and a quilt; a handkerchief was on the outside of the bundle. He said he was going to the Docks, and he would come and fetch it at four o'clock. I let him leave it. I sent the last witness down to the woman to let her know of it.</p>

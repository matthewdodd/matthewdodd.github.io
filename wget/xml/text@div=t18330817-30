            , he is a milkman, and lives at No. 2. Balls-pond-road; I know the prisoner by my serving Mr. Lucas with milk - I remember she called on me one evening in May, and asked me to go with her to buy a pair of earrings, which I did, she came to me again on the 12th of May - she came into my bed room and put a small bundle on the table, and asked me if I was ready, (she had before asked me to go with her to take tea with her sister, and I said, I would if I could, it all depended on my business) - on that day she came and asked if I was ready, and said she had purchased two flannel waistcoats for her father, who was troubled with the rheumatism, and she took from under them a small bit of paper with a sovereign and a shilling in; she asked me to put it into my pocket, as she had neither pocket nor purse; we then went out and walked to Shoreditch church; she then engaged a coach to go to Parker-street, Drury-lane - on the day following she came to my house again at half past two o'clock, and said she wanted change for a £10 note for her mistress - she appeared to come in a hurry - I took the note out of her hand, and said, I did not think I could, but I would send to see; I sent my girl with the note to her master, and told her to ask him for change for it - she returned in about ten minutes, but I did not see the change in the possession of the prisoner - I saw some gold on the back parlour mantel-piece; she then asked me to go with her to have a tooth out - I said, I could not; she then asked me to let the girl go; I said, she might; and the prisoner went out with her - the girl afterwards came back and said she came for another half sovereign; I took the gold off the mantel-piece, there were nine sovereigns and a half - I gave it into the girl's hand to take to the prisoner, and said, I did not wish to have anybody's money in my place but my own - I did not see her give the prisoner the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it rather extraordinary that she should leave the change behind her? A. No; I thought she left it while she went to have the tooth drawn - Mr. Lucas has since discontinued me as a milkwoman.</p>

            . I was, at the time in question, servant to Mrs. Gibson - I received the £10 note from my mistress, and took it to the barn to my master, he went and got change at Mrs. Wicks', at the King's-arms - I took it back, and gave nine sovereigns and two half-sovereigns into the prisoner's hand - she took it into the back parlour and asked my mistress to mind it - my mistress said, "No, mind it yourself" - she then pointed to the floor, and said she would throw it down - I said, "No, Mary, put it on the mantel-piece" - she put it on the mantel-piece, and took half a sovereign away, and I went with her to Mr. Bailey's, on Kingsland-green, where she had a tooth taken out, and changed the half sovereign.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not surprised at that? A. I cannot say I was - I then went with her to a comb-shop near the Bull, at Kingsland, where she bought some combs and other things, and she sent me back for another half sovereign as she had spent the first half sovereign, and had not money enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this excite your suspicion? A. No, sir; on the Sunday morning following Mr. Lucas asked my mistress if she had seen his servant girl, and said, she had taken two £10 notes from him, and my mistress told him I had got one changed.</p>

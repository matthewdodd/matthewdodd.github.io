               <p>I am a warehousekeeper at Leaden Hall, I was coming across the market, on Tuesday evening about seven, I saw a person in the market with a hyde on his head, I asked him who he belonged to; he said to the owner of the hydes; I asked him who that was; he said he did not know; I asked him where he was going to carry it; and he could not tell me; he then said the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250058"></xptr>person that employed him was at the Red Lion, I took him to the Red Lion, and I was advised to charge a constable with him, which I did; the hyde was afterwards put in Mr. Beale's warehouse; there were no other hydes in the public house; I saw the prisoner take it from the parcel of hydes, the parcel belonged to Mr. Halloway, but Mr. Beale takes care of them; Mr. Halloway carts them; I saw the name Halloway on the hyde, I did not then put any mark on it, it was rolled up and put in the warehouse, and the others remained where they were, there was no other rolled up in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>(The hyde produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>It is only the top hyde of the parcel that is marked, and I believe it to be the same hyde.</p>

               <p>I am a porter in the market, I saw the prisoner in the public house where my master, Mr. Beale, pays me; there were ten hydes in the market that day, and I moved them from the middle of the market to my master's door under cover, there was the name Halloway and ten marked on the top one; I then went to the Red Lion, and in about ten minutes Mr. Osborne brought the prisoner in, and said he had stole a hyde; I am sure the hyde was one of those that my master had under his care.</p>
               <p>Beale the younger. Merrick worked for us; I transact the business for my father, he receives the profit of it, we are paid for warehouse room, and for carrying the hydes home; I am sure we had a hyde that day marked Halloway, I saw it myself that day at six o'clock in the middle of the market, and afterwards, when it was removed to the warehouse door.</p>

               <p>I had been drinking a pint of beer with a shipmate, and I thought that was a place where I could case myself, and I was buttoning up my trowsers, and my head touched the ladder that was standing by the hydes, and they came and said I was going to steal the leather.</p>
               <p>Osborne. The hyde was on his head, and he threw it down.</p>

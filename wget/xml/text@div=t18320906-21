On the 24th of July I had been to a wedding, and returned home about eleven o'clock; I saw my purse about six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060028"></xptr>and did not miss it till next morning; I was the worse for liquor, but was more tired than in liquor - I had been to Hackney, and was brought home in a glass coach; Mrs. Collman and other friends were with me; I had been there in the morning, and returned home to see some patients; I then went there to dinner, and with the toasts "Three times three" I was exhausted and unconscious.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? A. You may call me drunk, if you like, I do not think I was - I believe it was more fatigue and exhaustion; I do not know whether my purse was in my possession when I came home; I saw it lost at six o'clock - it then contained the bill and money stated in the indictment; I found next morning, about half-past seven o'clock, that I had lost it - the prisoner was the only servant who slept in the house; my friends undressed me in my bed-room, and threw my trousers in the corner of the room - the purse was in the trousers pocket; my clothes were afterwards removed to my dressing-room, which joins my bed-room; I had no suspicion of the prisoner at first; I stopped payment of the notes at the Bank - she remained with me till the 3rd of August, when she was taken up; my brother-in-law and his brother undressed me - I got the notes from the Bank, and have them here; I have not found the bill of exchange.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He sent me to Hackney next morning to look for his watch, and his mother-in-law brought it to town. Witness. I sent her to Hackney for my watch, as my wife told me it was left there; a friend had taken it to take care of, but I did not know it; the lady of the house brought it while the prisoner was gone for it; I was never drunk before in my life.</p>

            . I was shopman to a linendraper. I heard of the prosecutor's loss in August, and about four days before that (I now forget the date) the prisoner came to our shop and bought a shawl and goods amounting to 2l. 12s., for which she paid me a 5l. note - she then bought goods which came to less than 1l., and paid me another 5l. note; I am quite certain of her person - I wrote on the notes the name of Mrs. Alley, Waltham-stow, who, she said, was her mistress; I went to my employer's house - he took me to the prosecutor's, where I saw the prisoner, and was confident she was the person -I paid the notes to our cashier - (looking at two) these are them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Collman's shopmen can prove I did not leave the house that night till after seven o'clock, but Mr. Collman has put them out of the way to prevent their coming. Witness. She paid me the notes between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; she said one note was her mistress's, and the other she received for her wages, which was her reason for changing both.</p>


               <p>MR. COLLMAN. These are the notes which I had in my purse - I got the numbers from Esdaile's bank, where I received them; I did not know the numbers when I lost them - I have no writing on them; on my oath they are the notes, for I asked Esdaile's the numbers.</p>

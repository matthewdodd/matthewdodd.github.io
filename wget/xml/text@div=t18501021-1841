                  </hi>. I live at 7, Drury-lane. The prisoner's father lodged with me in the rear of my house I have a workshop; you get to it from the counting-house, but there is a door to get out into the street—on the night of 11th Oct. I saw the premises locked up—the door is fastened by a bar and bolt—there is a water-closet adjoining the shop—there is an aperture at the top of the water-closet, through which some persons might get into the shop—I had in my shop a brass box; I missed it the following morning, a pair of shoes from the counting-house, and a slide-rest, which the Magistrate allowed me to have—when I came down at six o'clock next morning these articles were gone—I found the screws of the box of the lock had been taken out.</p>

On the morning of Saturday, 12th Oct., I went to work at six o'clock—I went up the passage by the side of the house, to the work shop-door—I found it open—I was the first person to go there—it is usual for the first person to ring the bell, but I found the door open—that door could not be opened from the outside, but by some person being inside—there is a bar and bolts; then, by opening that door they could get out at the door into the passage, and then into the street—there are two doors in the passage; one leads directly into the smith's shop, and the other leads to the passage of the house—that door is for the lodgers, it can be opened with a latch.</p>

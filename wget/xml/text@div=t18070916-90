On the evening of the 6th of August I had the misfortune to have my house and warehouse burned; and during the time I lost these articles that are in the indictment; they were in the house before the fire happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner taking them. - A. During the time of the fire the volunteers guarded the court yard before my house; I saw the prisoner there, I asked him what he had got there, he had a white chip box in his hand, he said nothing, it had wafers in it; I took it from him and threw it on the ground. I saw something still in his bosom, I forced my hand into his bosom, and out of thence I

               <p>Q. Did you attend to guard this house from plunder. - A. I did. As we were bidding the prisoner to fall back some person called out to see if he had any thing about him; I put my hand on his left side and felt something; I took out of his pocket a tobacco cannister, the top of a china jar, and a prayer book, and a small enamelled box; he was asked why he did it, he said he might as well pick them up as to have them burnt.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Badewell, Queen-street, May Fair. I went to the prosecutor's stable to ask for the coachman's son, and saw a light up stairs; as soon as I touched the door it flew open, I went in, and saw two men on the stairs - I could see them by the light that was above; I came out directly, they shut the door after me and bolted it. I went to a coachman, who was at a stable on the opposite side, and told him; he went and listened at the door, and heard the latch go, we then went up a little further, and two men came out, one of whom was the prisoner, he passed by me, but I did not speak to him. They ran off.</p>

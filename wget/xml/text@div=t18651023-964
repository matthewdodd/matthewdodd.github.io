I am servant to Mr. Cocke, of Tredegar-square—on the evening of the 14th of September, about half-past 9 o'clock, I heard our little dog bark, and I went out in to the area to see who was there—I saw Cooper standing on the steps—I asked him what be wanted—he called out, "Jack, Phil, Jack, they are coming"—a bundle was dropped from one of the windows, and Cooper picked it up and ran away—I went into the kitchen and got a light, and when I came back I saw Grant coming down the pillar of the portico—my master and mistress were in the dining-room, and I called out to them that thieves were in the house—I opened the door and ran after Grant—my mistress followed—I called out, "Thieves!" and "Police!" as loud as I could—my mistress never lost sight of him—he was stopped by a policeman—I saw Cooper again at my master's door the same evening, when Grant was brought back, and I said, "That is the man".</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Tredegar-square, and am a brass founder—on the evening of the 14th of September, my house was broken into at 9 o'clock, and I lost a considerable amount of property—my servant told me tore were thieves in the house—my wife and servant ran out—I went to the door, and saw a man running round the square—I could not leave the house then as it was empty—a neighbour came and watched my door—the</p>

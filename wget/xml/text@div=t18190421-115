My son was in the cart with me, asleep.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210053"></xptr>It was a very bright moonlight night. As I was going along the road the prisoner and another man were coming along facing me, as if about to pass me, they were on the near side of me; I had seen them about twenty or thirty yards before they came up. I had full time to see them. When they came up the prisoner stopped right before me, about three-quarters of a yard off, he up with his arms, and shot me directly. I had full time to observe his countenance, had a full sight of his face, and could pick him out from among a hundred. I was wounded in my right eye. I called directly to my son, and said</p>
               <p>"Jack, get up, I am shot." They then ran away, and I saw no more of them. I am certain the prisoner is the man - I will swear to him, and nobody else. I cannot swear to the other man, I had not a sight of him. I did not see what was in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it since you saw the prisoner again - A. About Christmas time I went to Hertford goal, and saw the prisoner there; Mr. Wilson, the goaler, said to the prisoners,</p>
               <p>"All of you come out." Twenty or thirty men came out, and I picked the prisoner out immediately. I became blind for sometime after I was shot. The man was half a yard or three-quarters of a yard from me - he put both his hands out.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look after the prisoner - A. I was blind, but I looked after him as soon as I got my sight.</p>

            . I am keeper of Hertford goal. I remember the prosecutor coming down to me just after Christmas, about two months before the Assizes - the prisoner was in custody at the time. He asked if I had not a man there charged with shooting another man? I told him I had - he wished to see the man. I told him I could not point him out, but I would call all the men out of the same yard, and if he saw him he might point him out. I should think between twenty and thirty men came out of the room, the prosecutor immediately pointed the prisoner out as being the man who shot him. The prisoner was committed to me from Watford, on the 31st of August - nobody pointed him out to the prosecutor; he had not the slightest intimation from anybody of his being the man.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you remember the day - A. Because I had a letter from his wife to go down to Godalmin, on the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear of his being charged with shooting Vine - A. In August - in July I heard it. On the 24th of July I heard that very thing. I heard his sister say so.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Castle public-house, in Chapel-street, West<lb></lb>minster. I shut up the house on Saturday night, 21st July, about twelve o'clock—I went to bed about one—I was awoke between three and four, and went to the back of the house—I found the kitchen window open, and one end of a wooden spout was placed in the window, and the other end of it resting on the slates—by means of that a person could get from the slates to the window—they could get on the slates by climbing up the wall; there would be no difficulty in it, the places are very low—the window was down when I went to bed, and when I got up it was open—I let the police in, and we found on the slates outside the kitchen window, an apron with four or five packages of copper money in it—I had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of copper money in pack<lb></lb>ages, in a cupboard in the bar parlour when I went to bed, and I missed 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from there—there was a jacket found on the wall close to the money, and some money: that was in the direction in which the spout passed—you could reach from the wall to the spout—I think I had seen William Bentley in my house that night—my house is in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 245). About a quarter past three o'clock on Sunday morning, 22d July, I heard a cry of "Police!" and went to the Castle public-house—when I got to the back, I saw this coat lying partly on a wall, and partly on some slates near the wall—I found nineteen packages of coppers on the wall, and three packages in this apron on the slates about a yard distant from the coat—a person could get from an adjoining yard up to the slates, and the spout went from the slates into the window—it went rather aslant—it made a bridge across.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the slates higher than the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; rather lower—you got up by the spout into the window—the other end of it rested on the slates—I am not certain whether the spout had been taken</p>

               <p>from an adjoining yard—it was a wooden spout about half a foot wide—to get on the spout you must have got to the top of the slates from an adjoining yard—they are small cottages—you can get across them from yard to yard—in these houses the greater part of the passages are open all night—you can go through them in the day, and generally at night—the wall parts Mr. Cook's premises and the next premises—this jacket was partly on the wall, and partly on the slates—this is the jacket—there is a deficiency of buttons on it—there were seven or eight persons round the door of the house.</p>

About three o'clock on that Sunday morning I and my husband were awoke by a cry of "Police!"—I got up, and saw two men go out of the passage of No. 12—I saw the spout, and the window of the Castle public-house was open—I saw another man come out of the passage of No. 10—I could not recognize those men again—I saw Mary Bentley in the back-yard of No. 12—I knew her well—I called her by her name twice—I do not know where she lived—her father lives at No. 14, Castle-court.</p>

I went to 19, Smith's-rents, York-street, Westminster, at four o'clock on that Sunday morning—I found Mary Bentley in bed—she was partly dressed—there was another female in the room—I asked Mary Bentley if her name was Bentley, and where her husband was—she said he had not been home all night—I told her she must get up—she said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "You must come with me, for being concerned with others in a burglary at the Castle public-house"—she said she knew nothing about it, and she had been at home all night—I asked her what money she had in the house—she said she had a little money—I took up a dress, and I said, "Is it here?"—she said, "Yes'—I found one shilling and three halfpence—she said her husband gave her the shilling, and the other she had—I found three skeleton keys under the bed—I asked how they came there—she said she did not know—I found in a corner of the room these three buttons, and, having noticed that three buttons were defi<lb></lb>cient from the jacket, I took care of them, and they correspond with the but-tons on the jacket—I found one of these keys unlocked the parlour door of the Castle public-house—in going to the station, Mary Bentley said it was very hard that she should be taken for what she knew nothing about, and that she could not help what her husband did—there was a white straw-bonnet in the room, which she wore to the station.</p>

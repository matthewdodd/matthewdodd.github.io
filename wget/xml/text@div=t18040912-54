               <p>Q. Could she take it without coming into the shop? - A. No; the ham was in the back part of the shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120059"></xptr>Q. How long had you seen the ham before she took it? - A. Not a minute before; when I missed it, I ran out immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner as soon as you got out? - A. No, I did not see her till I came into Bow-street, that is a great distance from our house; there are several turnings, I went the straight road after her; she was running in Bow-street as fast as she could; I laid hold of her, she had the ham on her arm, wrapped up in a kind of a sack-bag; I took it from her, I never saw her before; the officer took her to the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that to be your ham? - A. There's nobody cuts it but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner passed by, as you suppose, I suppose you did not get a particular view of her, so as to know her person? - A. She was in her shift-sleeves when I took her, and when she passed the window with the ham under her arm, she was in her shift-sleeves; I have not the least doubt but she is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going along to my work, I met with a man, and he asked me if I would hold a piece of ham while he returned; I said, yes; he told me to wait in the street, and I waited in the street; a gentlewoman came up to me, and said that piece of ham was her's; ma'am, says I, if it is your's, there it is, but a gentleman left it with me while he returned; I have no witnesses; I gave it her directly, I have two fatherless children that belong to me.</p>

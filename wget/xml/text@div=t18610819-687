                  </hi>. I live at 2, M'Cloud-cottages, Upper Clapton, and am a warehouseman—on Sunday, 4th August, I was going from the direction of Highbury barn, from my uncle's, to my home at Upper Clapton—about twenty-five minutes to 10 o'clock I was in Gipsey-lane, and found that I was being followed, I supposed at first by a man and woman—when I got just up to an embankment I turned suddenly round, finding the people behind me very close—one was just in front on the left-hand side, and the other stood where he was, behind me on the right—the prisoners are those two persons—I am certain of it—I asked Cotton which was the way to Stoke Newington—he hesitated for a moment, and then said, "I don't know;" and turning to the other prisoner he asked him if he knew—he hesitated for a moment, and then said, "No"—Cotton then said, "Oh! well you" had better go this way, "pointing in a direction rather to the right of that which I was going; a direction where I knew there was a hedge—I said to him, "I can't go that way, there is a hedge there"—just as I was saying that, I caught a momentary glance of Cotton stooping down on his right knee, and throwing the instrument round, which caught me just in the eye—it was something such an instrument as this (<hi rend="italic">a life preserver</hi>)—it was a starlight. night—I only had time to have a moment's view of it—I had an umbrella in my right hand; I immediately flourished that, and called out, "Help!"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190072"></xptr>
               <p>and then "Murder!"—the blood gushed out all over me, and smothered the front of my clothes—almost as soon as I threw my umbrella up in the air they both ran from me, just at the moment I was calling out—one went in one direction, and one in another—I followed about eight or ten yards, but I was almost blinded with the blood, and so I stood still—I was taken to the Highbury Park tavern—some one came up and assisted me there the prisoners were afterwards brought in, one at a time, and I recognised them as they were brought in—I am quite certain they are the two men—after I had had the wound dressed, about twenty minutes to 11 I should suppose, I went to the place where they ran past, and pointed it out to the police<lb></lb>officer.</p>

I live at 4, Wharton-place, Clerkenwell—on this Sunday night I was going across from the Sluice House to Highbury Park Tavern—I saw the prosecutor—soon after that I saw the two prisoners following him about six yards behind him—I had got about sixty yards off, and I heard a blow like a <hi rend="italic">thud</hi>, and a cry of "Murder!"—on hearing that, I turned and looked, and saw the two prisoners running across the field from the prose<lb></lb>cutor—I ran after Wadsworth—he jumped over a hedge, and fell—I kept on after him, and at last caught him, and then took him to Highbury Park Tavern—when we got there Cotton said that if they had done anything wrong to the gentleman they would apologise—I cannot recollect exactly what the words were—they had got Cotton up at the top of the lane, and then we took them both into the tavern together.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 4, Church-road, Stoke Newing<lb></lb>ton I was called to see the prosecutor on the night of the 4th of this month—he was then at Highbury Park Tavern—I got there about 10 o'clock—he was very pale, faint, and exhausted, and had evidently lost a great deal of blood—he had received a very severe wound of from three to four inches long, extending along to three-fourths, I should think, of the left eyebrow, and some distance, a third, down the nose, and the bone was bare the whole way—if it had been a little higher, it would most likely have fractured the skull; and if a little lower, I think it must have destroyed the left eye—I think this instrument a likely thing to have inflicted such a blow.</p>

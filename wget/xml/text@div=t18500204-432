                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. James Lanning; he is a Director of the Screw Steam Shipping Company. On 16th Jan., I was on board the <hi rend="italic">City of Rotterdam,</hi> getting wool on board—I had occasion to go to the hold, and when I came back I saw the prisoner in the barge alongside—I asked, "Who is there?"—he said, "Only me"—I asked what he wanted—he said, "Nothing," he only came to see if the men wanted anything—I told him to go away, and the sooner he was gone out of the barge the better—he shortly after went into a boat alongside of the barge—I saw a second person with him; I called to know who it was with him, and the other party said, "It is only me"—they went on shore—after they were gone, I observed that one of the bales of wool was cut, and about a handful of wool was gone, and in the end of the bale there was another hole which I could put my hand and arm in—I had observed, when I called out to the man in the boat, that the boat moved faster—I went on shore, but could not find the prisoner—I went back to the boat, and found 6 1/2 lbs. or 7lbs. weight of wool in it—I did not com<lb></lb>pare that wool with the wool I was loading, but it appeared to be the same sort—there was room in the bale for quite as much wool as I found in the boat, or more.</p>

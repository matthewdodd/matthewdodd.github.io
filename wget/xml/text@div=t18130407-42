             on the 9th of March last. On that day I carried out flour. I left my barrow by the side of some alms-houses; when I came back the first thing that I missed was two half-quartern loaves. Pugh lived near that way. I saw him and his brother and another lad when I left my barrow, and when I came back I saw the prisoner running about an hundred yards from me. I made all the haste I could, because I was suspicious when I saw the prisoner running. I saw part of a loaf under his arm. On my searching further into the barrow, I missed two quarterns of flour. The prisoner got into his dwelling-house and came out again before I came up to him, and when he turned out he had nothing with him. I asked him to give me back the bread that he had taken from the barrow. He made use of bitter oaths, and said if I came there they would put me into trouble. I told him, he had better give it me back, and I would not take any trouble in it; if he did not I would inform my master, and have him taken up. I went away. They followed me all over Bow Common, calling me names. I went as far as Mile-end. I told my master of it. We got a constable, and we all went down together. We went to the prisoner's dwelling on Bow Common. They live in a caravan. I searched the caravan. There was a quartern of flour found in another bag. My bag I never found.</p>

            . I am a master baker. I met my man in Mile-end; he told me he had been robbed. He said, on Bow Common, by Pugh's eldest son. I went to the constable, and we all went together. When we got there we charged him with stealing the bread and flour. The prisoner said, he knew nothing at all of it. We searched the place, and found some flour in a flour-bag, on the table.</p>
               <p>MR. PRIGMORE. I am a constable of Mile-end. I went with Mr. Watkinson and his man. We saw some flour in a bag that was not a bag of theirs. I found nothing else.</p>

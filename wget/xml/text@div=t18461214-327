About half-past seven o'clock in the evening on the 12th of Dec, I was in Payne's-lane, Wimbledon—I saw the two prisoners, each carrying a sack with something in it—I stopped them, and asked what they had got—they said, "Saw-dust"—I felt it to be</p>

               <p>corn—I took them into a beer-shop, and got assistance, then took them and the property to the station—I found on Leverett a key—in the sack which he carried were three bushels of meal, consisting of pollard and sweepings, and in the sack Pearce carried, were two bushels of peas—I went to Mr. Bridge's farm, and the key I found on Leverett unlocked his granary, which it about 200 yards from where I stopped diem—I found in the granary some peas in a bin, and in another bin some meal corresponding with what was found in the sack—the peas are called pig-peas.</p>

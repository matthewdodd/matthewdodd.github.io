            . I am card-maker to Henry Hall, and Anthony Olddiss Bancks. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18251208-94-deflabel472" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

On the 29th of November I found six dozen and five packs of cards, upon the boards which compose the cieling of a privy which the prisoner uses - I found, by moving one of the boards, there was a space to put some cards. I then mixed a composition of vermilion and oil, and put it on the edge of the boards, so that no one could get the cards without marking their sleeve. The prisoner did not come to our premises until the following Saturday, when I watched him going to the privy - he staid some time - he then came through the front shop, and I asked him what he had been doing - he made some excuse, and wanted to go to the back premises. I then felt his pockets, and felt some cards. - I took him into the parlour, and found three packs of cards on him. I sent for a constable, but before he arrived the prisoner voluntarily emptied his pockets of twenty-nine packs. I then went to the privy, and the number left just made up the quantity I had seen there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had not this man been some time in your house? A. Yes; he has been partly out of work for some time, though he has occasionally worked for us - he has a wife and ten children. I do not know that he has been in distress - he came to try to get work - he might earn from 8s. 6d. to 25s. a week - he was not in our employ at the time. I have every reason to think he was an honest man until that time.</p>

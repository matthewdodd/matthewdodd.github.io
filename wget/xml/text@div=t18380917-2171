                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Farringdon-street, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. I am a haberdasher—on Sunday, the 26th of August, I had in my cash-box a purse, containing eight sovereigns, and six half-sovereigns—it was a small brown purse, locked in a cash-box, in a drawer in my bed-room, the door of which was locked—I had a gold ring, with a stone, and a gold guard-chain, with a small diamond set with stones, in my dressing case in my bed-room—the prisoner's brother lodged with me—he had himself lodged there, but had left about a week—he came there on the day in question to see his brother—I opened the door as usual—it did not appear forced—I discovered my dressing-case open, but thought I might have left it so, and said nothing about it until the morn<lb></lb>ing, when I found my cash-box had been opened, and locked again—I kept the key of it in a basket in the bed-room—anybody in the room could open it, and replace the key.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Sir John Falstaff public-house, in Old-street. The prisoner came to my house on the evening in question—I do not recollect what night it was, but it was the night named in the indict<lb></lb>ment, because the officer came and asked me about it—I cannot swear to the day at all—he gave me eight sovereigns to take care of—he had some Mends with him, and seemed very much in liquor—I said, "You have been drinking a great deal, what will your master say to this?"—he said, "I am not going to master's again; I have had a fall-out with him, and he has paid me my wages"—his friends said, "You had better leave the money with the landlord," and he gave me a purse—he said, "There is a chain in the other end of the purse"—he came to me next morning before I was up—I took the purse out of my pocket, and he said, "I only want a sovereign"—I said, "You seem quite sober, I shall return you the whole; count it, and see it is right"—he counted the sovereigns, and there was a gold chain in the purse—it was a dark-coloured purse—it might be black, or brown, or dark-green, I did not notice—I gave it back to him.</p>

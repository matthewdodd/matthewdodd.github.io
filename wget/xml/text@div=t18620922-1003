                  </hi>. I live at 5, Rose-street, Deptford—on 27th July, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I met the prisoner—he said that there was a quarrel between him and his wife, through his week's money, which he had lost; that she accused him of being in bad company, and he said he was not, and threw a shell at her, and he thought he had done for her—I said, "How is she?"—he said, "She is all right now; she had got the gin-bottle</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Grove-street-hill, Deptford—the prisoner is my father—I recollect a quarrel between my father and mother on Sunday, between 11 and 12 o'clock—while I was in my own room, I heard my mother say that she would rip my father's b—y guts open, and my father said the same—my father said it first—after I heard it, I went into my mother's room—she was bleeding from the back part of the head—the prisoner was there, and my mother repeated the expression that she would rip his b—y guts open—she had only a knife in her hand—she said that my father <hi rend="italic">heft</hi> the shell at her—my father was there then, washing himself—I washed my mother's head; she was bleeding a good bit—I did not send for any medical man—a surgeon was not sent for till the day she was dying.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Rotherhithe—on Monday, 11th August, I was called to a house in Grove-street, Deptford—I saw a female there who gave the name of Shirtliffe—she was in bed, and in a dying state—she had several tumours on the head, and one of them, on the top, at the right side, was gathering—she was almost pulseless—she died on the day I saw her—I made a post mortem examination on 14th August, by the Coroner's order—her right leg, knee, and thigh, were very much swollen, and on the inside of that knee was a small contused wound—there was also a contusion on the left side of the chest—I found on the head the suppurating tumour I before alluded to—on removing the soalp, I found, on the part of the head corresponding with the suppurating tumour, a part of the skull, of the since of a broad bean, punctured in, and the membranes of the brain, corresponding to that part, were commencing to inflame—on raising the dura mater, I found a deposit of coagulable lymph—the wound on the head was such a one as might be produced by a shell like this—my opinion is, that she died from a secondary cause, arising from the suppur<lb></lb>ating wound—the skull was fractured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the proximate cause of death the absorption of pus into the circulation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she had suppurating tumours over various parts of her head—one was suppurating at the time—I have heard the testimony of her daughter—the purilent matter was absorbed into the system, thereby vitiating the quality of the blood, or, in plain English, poisoning it—if I had never heard anything about blows or violence, that alone would have satisfied me of the cause of death—the absorption of purilent matter into the blood was quite sufficient to have killed a down people—I was assisted by another medical gentleman—he is not here—the blood throughout the system was so poisoned that I found evidences of it in the legs, thighs, and joints—I have no knowledge of having seen her before—the skull was depressed, but not sufficient to cause pressure on the brain; the outer table was fractured, and the inner one indented—they were both fractured—it was the right parietal bone—the general result of indentation of the skull is pressure on the brain; the result of which would be a state of coma, and the person would be in a semi-unconscious state—I found her in that state, but not from that cause; coma would have set up at first—I have heard of cases in which indentation of the skull took place without showing symptoms for fifteen days; I do not mean without any consti<lb></lb>tutional disturbance for fifteen days—if I had not heard of the quarrel, and the shell, I should have said that the violence had been done a week or two, from the appearances—there was a deposit of pus in the leg and knee, but that was probably the result of the absorption of pus from the tumours—I have known the prisoner many years—he is in the employment of one of the public dock companies—I have heard a favourable character of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROSHER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The pus circulating in the system was the cause of death, in your belief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so—that pus, in my opinion, was first formed in the separate tumour, over the fracture—they were sebaceous tumours, and were antecedent to the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the skull was fractured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—in my opinion, the fracture of the skull was the primary, but not the sole, cause of death—it was the primary cause of that which produced death, and it pro<lb></lb>ceeded from the separation of the bone, which caused the absorption of the pus—my opinion is, that the fracture of the skull did contribute to the woman's death.</p>

               <p>I am an engraver, in Fleet-market. I saw the prisoner, as well as I can recollect, the first time was in June last. I met him accidentally at a public-house, in Fleet-market, where I used to go to read the newspaper. Finding he kept an academy, I shewed him some specimens of my work, as an engraver, which the prisoner seemed very much to approve. Soon afterwards, he applied to me to engrave a bank-note: I then positively refused, and told him the consequence, which would be fatal to us both; I conceiving at that time it would be a capital offence in both of us. Then it passed on. I did not see him again till the middle of

             falling into conversation, and renewing his acquaintance with me, he said he hoped I was not displeased with him for what he had asked me to do before; and then he asked me again if I would engrave the bank-notes, and offered to pay me 100 l. for the engraving; and, if that was not sufficient, I should have half of the first 500 l. worth that should be negociated. I, upon this second offer, said it was a matter of consequence, and would require some time to consider. I immediately went to Mr. Alderman Sainsbury, and asked his advice what to do. From that time, I having given him this uncertain answer, he used to call on me almost every day, from the middle of August till the latter end of September; and at last, on the 27th of September, he called about noon; and said he was going for a note, to the Bank. He asked me which way he should obtain a note. I told him the method. He went; and I met him again, as he returned. He told me he had got the note; and at three in the afternoon he brought to my house a bank-note for 10 l. He then desired me to take the measure of that note, for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170059"></xptr> plate. I took it rather less than the note, at first. He observed that, and said it should be the full size, because there was no mark of a plate upon the bank-note; and then I took the measure exactly. He gave me half-a-crown, to pay for the plate. I ordered the plate, and was to have it the next morning; but it did not come. The prisoner called in the afternoon, and he sent my maid for the plate to

I had but 2 s. in my pocket; and it coming to 4 d. more, Mr. Graham gave me 6 d. in order to get change, to pay that 4 d.; but the man who brought it having no change, I gave Mr.

I had then laid the note upon the plate, which was the first step prepara tory to engraving it, and I went to work then in the prisoner's presence. As often as my servant came near the window, the prisoner held up a sheet of paper against the work going on, in order that it might not be seen what it was. I engraved the outlines then, and the word Ten, which expressed the sum, was engraved white upon black. I finished this plate on the 4th of October. The prisoner came for it that day, and he was taken up about three quarters of an hour after.</p>

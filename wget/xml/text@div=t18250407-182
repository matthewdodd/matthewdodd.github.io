I had a great many apple trees, which I had been moving - some of them were put into the ground, but not fixed. I had seen them about five o'clock in the afternoon of Friday, the 4th of March; on the morning of Saturday, the 6th, I missed seventeen or twenty - I then went up to the prisoner's house, who is a tenant of mine, but had not been employed in the garden; I found a bundle near his house, which is about a quarter of a mile from where I live - I opened it, and found nearly twenty trees covered with a mat. I have no doubt but they were mine; they were worth 1 s. a tree; I intended to have them planted the next day in some other part of my garden. He was not at home when I found the trees; I saw him in about an hour, but had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What kind of trees were they? A. Different sorts of pippins and russetins, and others; they were cut in a particular way, and had been lately grafted; the prisoner is a gardener - it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070070"></xptr>usual for gardeners to put a mat over their trees to preserve them.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Poynton. I took up the trees, and put them on the ground to be planted the next day. I came next morning after Mr. Poynton was up - I then missed seventeen trees; I found some trees afterwards on the prisoner's premises, but I cannot be certain that they were my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you never seen the prisoner about the premises? A. Never in my life; the garden is fenced round, partly by palings, and partly with a hedge and ditch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the kind of trees he had? A. No; he said to me,</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Poynton came to me to apprehend the prisoner: I found him at Hammersmith about ten o'clock; he said the trees he had were his own property; the trees have not been found; I found nothing but some gooseberry and apple stocks, and plum stocks; his garden was open, and there were some other trees laid in by the heels; Mr. Poynton examined them, and said they were not his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had, I suppose, a cart-load of trees of different descriptions laid in by the heels on that day. I have lived with this gentleman many years, and paid him about 180 l., and about three months ago he brought in a broker, and took my goods; this charge was brought out of spite against me - he came and took one dozen gooseberry trees, and said they were his property.</p>

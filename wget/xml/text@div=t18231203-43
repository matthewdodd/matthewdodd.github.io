I went over to my neighbour Johnson, to ask his opinion of it, and in consequence of what passed, I had him apprehended. I did not part with the note, till I gave it to Roberts the officer.

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in the Minories. On the 27th of October, Mr. Minton brought me a note for my opinion; (looking at one,) this is it - he shewed it to me. I gave it him again, and in five or ten minutes went over to Minton; he shewed it me again, and said in the prisoner's presence, that he was the person who gave him the note. I took it, and asked the prisoner his name and address, which I wrote on it, "William Hay, No. 3, Middle-street, Cloth-fair, I. J., 27 - 10 - 23." I remained there till Roberts, the officer came and took him and the note. The officer had been sent for before he gave the address.</p>
               <p>MR. MINTON re-examined. I did not part with the note till I gave it to Johnson; it was the same I received from the prisoner. I had sent for an officer before he gave his address, but I do not think that he knew it, as I am certain nothing passed on the subject. Johnson came to my shop about ten minutes after I returned. I cannot say what made the prisoner remain so long in my shop. When I dealt with him, he lodged at a chandler's shop in Watling-street; I never knew him live in Middle-street.</p>

I locked the note up in my cash-box, which I keep inside another box, and keep the key myself, and paid it away in a few days, to Sainsbury, a tax-gatherer. I had no other Bank note by me while I had this - Sainsbury wrote "Bennett" on it in my presence (looks at one.) this is it; it has "Bennett, 20 - 10 - 23," which he wrote. He came again in the next week; paid me 10 s. more of his debt, and gave me a 5 l. note, which I gave to my daughter, Sarah, to get changed. He told me he had it out of the country, from his father, at Tiverton, Devonshire, and was going to buy some clothes to go into the country for a fortnight, and should then call, and pay some more.

            . My husband keeps the Bells, public-house, Church-row, Aldgate. The prisoner lodged at our house for three or four months, and left in May or June; he called once or twice between that and October. When he lodged with us, he worked at Mr. Carpenter's, an engraver, at Aldgate; he owed us 1 l. 6 s., but printed some cards, which reduced the debt to 1 l. 3 s. 6 d. About the 16th or 17th of October, he came to our house - I did not know where he then lived; he said, "I have got some money for you, what do I owe you," and produced a 5 l. note. I asked if he had got work; he said No, his father had sent him some money from Tiverton, in Devonshire; that he lived in Cloth-fair. He wrote on the note himself, "J. Hay, 3, Middle-street, Cloth-fair." (Looks at one,) this is it. I wrote myself "J. Hay, Tiverton, Devonshire," on it, gave him change, and he left.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes, and have been so about twenty-five years. (Looks at the note uttered to Minton.) This is forged in every respect, paper and plate. It is signed "West," but is not his signature. The others are all forged in every respect. That uttered to Mills is signed "J. Robinson," but is not his writing. He signed 1 l. and 2 l. notes, when they were issued; but we have no cashier of that name, and none but cashiers sign 5 l. notes. Those uttered to Bennett are signed "Cluff" and "Whiting," but are not their writing. Cluff is a cashier, and Whiting is not. That uttered to Beckett is also signed Whiting, but is not his signature. They are all impressed from the same plate, I have no doubt.</p>

            . I am cashier at the Bank. The note purporting to be signed by me is not my signature. It is dated the 2d of August, 1821. I was ill at that time for three months, with a bilious fever.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, written. I was out of work a considerable time, and not being able to make good my payments, and having sold or pledged all my clothes, I had no means left, being entirely destitute of friends; my father (my only friend) having left England some time, and is now in America. Having no person whatever to apply for the smallest assistance, and destitute and discharged from my lodgings, consequently driven to horror and the most wretched despair, I at length made application to my parish, St. Botolph, Aldgate, when they scrupled to relieve me; saying, I was a good workman and a young man, therefore I must go and get employment; but, alas! could not. They at length, by a repeated application, assisted with three separate sums of 2 s., 1 s., and 2 s., in nearly the space of three months, after which refused to do anything further. I then wrote to the Lord Mayor; but when I went to the Mansion House, the officers extremely ill-treated me - turned me out of the Office; neither would give my letter to his Lordship. With grief, anguish, and terrific despair, I went mournfully through the streets, not knowing what to do, being entirely without money - food I had not tasted for about three or four days. Having no place to retire or lay myself down to rest for sometimes three nights, during a week at a stretch; subject to the extreme severity of all weathers; and walking the streets all night much reduced me in health, and my clothes became almost indecent for me to appear in the day time, therefore masters would not give me work; on account of which, the violent struggles I had with my feelings became overpowered, through the innumerable difficulties I had experienced in my situation of poverty and distress; but still endeavouring to cherish my unblemished reputation against the powerful reproaches of a sinful world with a degree of Christian patience, supported by fortitude, as I was on the precipice of ruin. Yet, under all my calamities, I was at intervals cheered by the faint promises masters gave me, of giving me work on a future day; hoping, ere long, that the smiles of fortune would again prosper me, though slowly advancing. At last, walking the streets all night, as usual, I was going through Fleet-market, where the shambles are covered, I observed some paper under one of the butcher's blocks, and when I went and picked it up, &amp; to my utter astonishment were the notes in question.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030023"></xptr>My mind being greatly exalted at the idea of meeting such good fortune in the extremity of deep distress, I naturally, with gratitude, went to those persons first that gave me credit, and paid them as much as I could conveniently part with, not in the slightest degree suspecting the notes forgeries on the Bank; but, on the contrary, after having received the change (being no judge of them), I certainly conceived them to be genuine, and legal currency. I therefore wish earnestly and conscientiously to appeal to you, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, for one moment to allow the dictates of your own refined consciences to take their judgment-seats within your own breasts, to discriminate and, without prejudice, to investigate, whether, had I known these notes to have been forgeries, I should have presumptuously gone and offered payment of my debts to persons whom I have connection, and almost daily intercourse with. Doubtless, in such case, would I not immediately be pursuing an ignominious death, and inflicting upon myself the justice and extreme penalty of the law. Again, I wish to appeal to my Lord and honourable Gentlemen, the privilege of saying, could you suppose I should presume to be so ungrateful even to try to impose on those individuals, after having tendered me so many charitable services; on the contrary, it may be clearly visible I did not hesitate a single moment, from the strong impulse of motives of gratitude, but actually went, and certainly deviated not from the straight course of rectitude, to pay an honourable debt; in order that, should I ever require credit at any future period, I might obtain the same. Perhaps the question may now be asked, When I found these notes, why did I not advertise them? My reply is, that having suffered such excruciating pangs of hunger, and the terrific scenes of the inclemency of all weathers, caused me to transgress from discovering them. But had I been in circumstances above want, or even in work, I certainly should not have hesitated in immediately advertising, and should have given them up to whomsoever might have claimed them. The knowledge the whole of the gentlemen I changed the notes with have of my character, will bear the most penetrating scrutiny. The affliction I have already undergone, through my being within the walls of a prison, as I never was confined, or did anything to cause confinement, during the whole course of my life, has made a deep incision on my mind, that it will take long are it is healed.</p>

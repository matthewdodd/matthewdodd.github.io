               <p>Q. Had you a great coat that belonged to your master on the 13th of February last - A. Yes, I wore it on the evening of the 12th of February. I did not miss it until the next day. I left it in the stable; me and my wife live over the stable. On the 19th of February, as I came home through Temple-bar, I met the prisoner and another man in company. The prisoner had this box coat under his arm. I came up to them. I asked them if they had that box coat for sale; they said they had just bought it. I said, I will buy it of you if you will let me have it for a fair valuation. They said they wanted only one shilling for their bargain. I said, come into the next public-house and I will pay you for it. We went into a public-house; I told the landlady to bring in a pot of beer. I put the coat on and buttoned it up. I said it is a very good fit. I shut the door upon them. I said you are both my prisoners. They both said they bought the duplicate of the coat of a man; the men said they would go quietly with me any where. I took them to Bow-street. This is the coat. It is my master's coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of stealing the coat.</p>

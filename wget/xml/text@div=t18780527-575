                  </hi>. I live at the Sugar Loaf public-house in Bell Street, which is kept by my father—on 29th April, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, I was serving in the bar; the prisoner came in with two other men; he asked for a pot of ale; I refused to serve him because on the Saturday night previous he had created a disturbance there—they went out on my refusing to serve them—one of his com<lb></lb>panions afterwards came in and asked for a pot of ale; I served him with it, and he went out with the pot and glass; about two or three minutes afterwards I went out to see where he had taken the pot and glass to, and saw the prisoner and his companions outside; the prisoner had the pot and glass in his hand; the pot was empty—I asked mem for it, and he threw it on the ground; I picked it up, and then went to take the glass out of his hand, as I thought he was going to smash it—he attempted to strike me; my father came to the door to prevent him, and he lifted up his right foot and kicked my father violently in the lower part of the stomach—my father put his hands down to the place and told me to fetch the police, which I did—my father went to bed directly he came from the hospital—he complained of very great pain, and died the next day.</p>

I went with him, he shewed me the prisoner Noke, and said he had delivered it to Chamberlain. I had her searched, and my handkerchief was found upon her; she was carried before a justice, there the woman owned she received it from a man, but not of Noke.</p>

            . I was in the park on the 19th of December last to see his Majesty come by; I saw Noke hold his hand in a suspicious way under the skirt of his coat among the people. I followed the prosecutor and Noke, in the passage near where the century stands I saw Noke put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out a linen handkerchief, and give it to Chamberlain, by putting his hand behind him, and I saw her put it into her pocket. I went to the prosecutor, and told him I saw that man take it and give it to that woman; he searched, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160009"></xptr> said it was gone, then he went and seized the woman and I the man; Noke opened his coat, and said he had nothing; the prosecutor ordered the woman to pull out what she had in her pocket, and she pulled out two or three handkerchiefs his was one of them. There were six handkerchiefs found upon her before the justice.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the woman with Noke in the park when you observed his hands under his coat?</p>

On Sunday, the 21st of Au<lb></lb>gust, about half-past three o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner in company with another man, in Benjamin-street Clerkenwell, about a quar<lb></lb>ter of a mile from Hatton-garden stand—the prisoner was carrying a bundle—I stopped both of them—I examined the bundle, and asked how they came in possession of it—the prisoner said he knew nothing of it, that it belonged to the other one, who gave it to him carry while he filled his pipe—the other one said, "We are going to take it to his brother-in-law in Cow-cross, who is a harness-maker"—I took them both into custody—another policeman came up to assist, and about half way to the station-house the other one knocked me down, and gave me a very violent blow, and made his escape—I showed the property to Davy, and have it here.</p>

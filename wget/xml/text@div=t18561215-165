I was passing a marine store shop in High-street, Woolwich, about half past 5 o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the shop, and a female—I went inside the shop—I saw the prisoner offering this cloak, and I went in and asked him where he got it from—he said, "I received it from my brother-in-law at the Cadets' bar<lb></lb>racks"—I said that was very strange—I then took him to the station—when the charge was read over, he said he received it from a man of the name of Brown—he did not say who Brown was, or where—the man, named Brown, may have been his brother-in-law, as he did not mention his name.</p>

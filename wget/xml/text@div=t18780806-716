                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer, of 209, Brompton Road—nine or ten years ago I supplied 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, worth of furniture to the prisoner in the name of Mrs. Lawley, which was partly paid for in money and partly by the bill of a gentleman—the prisoner lived in the house for two years after that, and three or four years ago I met her in the street and asked her how she was—she said that she had been living in the country—on 13th July, about 11 am., I was sent for to Mr. Coulthorpe's shop, which is near to mine, and saw a Victoria at the door and a pair of horses and a driver—the prisoner was in the shop; she shook hands with me, and said that she had married a nobleman, Lord Beauclerk, and was in a very good position; that her husband had large estates, one in the West Indies and one somewhere else; that she was coining, to town in a few days and I was to take a house for her and furnish it, and she would spend 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said that she had been married about eighteen months, and had a child ten months old, and that her husband had given 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the horses and carriage—I left her there, and in the afternoon she came in a cab to my shop and said that she had been staying at the Alexandra Hotel, and had a very heavy cheque in her pocket; that it was too late to get it cashed, and would I lend her 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as she wanted to discharge her hotel bill and go to Ramsgate—I told her I had not cash enough in my pocket and wrote this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Lady Beauclerk, and dated 12th July—the date is a mistake, it was Saturday, 13th July—she said she would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest, but I told her I did not want it—I wrote out this I O U for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she signed it "Lady A. E. Beauclerk"—I parted with my money, on the representation of her being Lady Beauclerk, and I believed that she was living at the Alexandra Hotel—I knew that she had left the Woolpack—she had sent for me eighteen months ago, about the same furniture that I had supplied her with at Pelham Street, Brompton, and which was warehoused—she wanted to dispose of it, and I offered her a price for it, which she accepted, and gave her address at the Woolpack, where she said she was going as housekeeper or manageress—I would not have parted with my cheque had I known that. she was not a married woman, or had I known that in June she was still manageress at the Woolpack—I saw her again on the Monday, and she wanted me to lend her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more; I said that I really had not got it, and I should be glad if she would give me money to meet the cheque; she said that she had not got it—I had stopped the cheque in the meantime—she said that she had written a letter to me, telling me to stop the cheque; I said that I had not received it; it came after she left, and the post-mark was July 15—I think she was taken in custody the same evening, July 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I knew her 7 or 8 years ago as Lawley, then as Bevan, and finally as Lady Beauclerk—when she was Lawley, she was living in Pelham Street, Brompton, under, I presumed, the protection of a gentleman who was introduced to me, and said that he would be responsible and pay for the furniture, the value of which was 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and eighteen months ago I gave her 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I am not particularly in the habit of providing furniture for ladies who are under the protection of men; I have done so, on four or five occasions—her mentioning a name like Beauclerk had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060072"></xptr>
               <p>an effect upon me on that occasion—I know that fast women adopt grandi<lb></lb>loquent names—I actually refused 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the accommodation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The sole reason of my parting with the cheque was that I believed she was married to Lord Beauclerk, and her telling me about the child and the estates.</p>

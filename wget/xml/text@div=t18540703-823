                  </hi>. I am a coal dealer, of Cambridge-street, Agar-town. On 19th June, a little before 4 o'clock in the morning, I was in bed with my wife, and heard the window raised up; I then heard a <hi rend="italic">scroop</hi>, rose myself up in bed, and saw the prisoner three parts in at the window, with a toy box in his hand, which had been on the table when I went to bed—I jumped out of bed, and said, "You vagabond, what do you do here?"—he threw it down, and out he tumbled at the window, which was on the first floor, and was ten or twelve feet high—I went to the window, and saw him pick himself up and run away—I slipped oh. my trowsers, ran after him, and caught him in Cambridge-place, 300 or 400 yards off—he was stooping, and burying these scissors (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the ground, hiding them; it was a vacant place, near an iron tank—I touched him on the back, and said, "You come back with me; I have got you"—I picked up the scissors, and he said that they were not mine—I said, "I know they are not"—he said that they were his—he walked back a few yards with me, and I called a constable—the prisoner then said, "You mean to give me in charge?"—I said, "Yes, I do"—he said, "For God's sake, don't; do pray forgive me; think of my poor father and mother; what will they say of me?"—finding that I intended to give him in charge he began to fence with me, and ran away—I ran after him, cried "Stop thief!" and a constable stopped him—I had shut the window myself before I went to bed—it is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>

I employed the prisoner to mend my umbrella, and paid him for it; he then asked me to go into the house to see if there was any other job for him; while I was gone he went away, and when I came back I missed an umbrella from the corn-bin in the stable, where there had been two besides mine; I went after him, and asked if he had taken one by mistake - he said he had not; I pointed to this one which was under his arm, and said that was it; he denied it - I said it was, and he said it was not, but if I went back to the corn-bin, I should find the umbrella again; I said I would not, as he had got it; it is not a new umbrella; I did not know the prisoner before - he had three or four umbrellas under his arm; he had just got out of the mews, about sixty yards off.</p>

On the 27th of November, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was up stairs, and heard some one cry out "Thief!" I ran down into Vauxhall-road, and saw two persons running, pursued, and came up with them in Pear-street, and took one, which was the prisoner - he had ran a quarter of a mile. I took him back; a man said "That is the man, I swear to him;" he denied it. This linen was missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not lose sight of him - A. No; there are a great many turnings between my house and where I stopped him. He did not come out of a public-house.</p>

            . On this morning I was in my cart, by the prosecutor's premises, and saw the prisoner and another man go up to the yard door, go into the yard, and the other brought some property out, concealed under his round frock. I said, "Halloo, young men, what are you doing?" - he threw the things down; I picked them up, threw them into the shop, and gave an alarm. Werndley pursued, and brought the prisoner back. I am certain of him; he said he was not there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He took nothing - A. No. I saw him go into the yard with the other. I knew him by sight before.</p>

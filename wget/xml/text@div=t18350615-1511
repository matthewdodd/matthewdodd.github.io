                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Turner, and live in the Kings<lb></lb>land-road. He is a compositor—on the 6th of June, I left this property on a line—I missed them at half-past six o'clock on Saturday morning—they had been out all night—the yard is at the back of my house.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner's father has got a bit of ground near me—I saw the prisoner there on the 6th of June, between one and two o'clock—he was stooping by a raspberry-bush—I went down to him, to ask him for one pennyworth of rhubarb—he pulled out a little frock, then a pillow-case, and some other things—I said, "Did you bring these things here to dry?"'—he said, "No; I found them here"—I took my rhubarb, and went away.</p>

My mother would not let me keep the things, because she thought it was not right—I pawned some, and took the ticket to Mrs. Wil<lb></lb>son to take care of—I saw the things under the bush—the woman was in the garden at the time I pulled them out.</p>

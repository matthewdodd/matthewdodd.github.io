                  </hi>. I was formerly police-inspector of the G division—I am now employed by the Mint, and hold an appointment under the Home Office—on 6th August, I went to Cromer-street, Gray's-inn-road, with Inspector Young, and watched No. 83 with him—he was in one place and I was in another—I saw the prisoner come out about 6, and pointed him out to Young, who was in uniform—we both seized him, and I said, "<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, you are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession; what have you about you?"—he said, "Nothing"—Young put his hand in the prisoner's pocket and took out a parcel, which he handed to me—it was partly in two parcels; a little one wrapped in a large one—I saw the coin—Young handed It to me, and I showed it to the prisoner, and said that it was bad—he made no reply—he said that he had no fixed home—I said, "Yes, you have; you live at 83, in this street; I have had you under observation some time"—the packet contained six crowns, a half-crown and a florin—I took him to No. 83—Young searched the first floor in my presence, but nothing was found—I took him to the station, and charged him with having the coins with intent to circulate them—he said, "How can you tell what is at the bottom of my heart? you do not know whether I knew they were counterfeit or not. You would transport me if you could; you tried your hardest last Session."—I said, "Never mind, we will not discuss that matter now"—I do not know Charley Wyatt—I was not with him in a shoemaker's shop before I took the prisoner—I was there with Inspector Young, and have the shoemaker here to prove it.</p>

On the evening of 16th August, I accompanied Brannan to 83, Cromer-street—I saw the prisoner come out—Brannan pointed him out to me, and we went over together and seized him—I took from his trousers-pocket these packets, and handed them to Brannan—one was partly broken, and I saw the edges of coins—I heard Brannan say that it was heart-breaking to see him in that deplorable state, as he knew his relations—I found nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 83, Cromer-street, but have removed—I am single, and have lived with the prisoner—on 16th August, before he went out, a young man named Charles, who had been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to our place, gave him a parcel wrapped in a news-paper—I could not see what was in it—he said, "Hold them for me for a few minutes," or words to that effect—he went out first and the prisoner followed him, and soon afterwards the policemen came in.</p>

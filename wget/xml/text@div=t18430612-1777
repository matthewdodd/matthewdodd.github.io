                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the savings bank. I remember this deposit-book being brought on the 17th of April quite well—I cannot say who brought it, but a person came to me and stated they wished to deposit 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I immediately wrote 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in letters, and the figure 4, in this deposit-book, then passed the book to Mr. Resius, the cashier—that would be a guide to him as to the sum he was to receive—the figure "4" has since been altered to "5," and the word "four" also.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The parties first come to you, and you put down the sum in the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They must state the sum before I put it down—ours is a large office—there are a great many people there—I put down the amount before the money is paid—Mr. Resius afterwards calls the name over, a per<lb></lb>son answers, and he says, "Four pounds;" and when Mr. Resius has received the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he puts his initials, as receiving the amount—there are frequently a great many people waiting to deposit money, quite a crowd—the books are taken in rotation, and sometimes a quarter of an hour may elapse between my putting the amount down and its being paid in—the depositor never hands the book to the cashier—sometimes I take it to him, and often another clerk.</p>

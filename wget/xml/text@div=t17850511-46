               <p>On the 15th of April, between four and five in the afternoon, I lost a piece of linen cloth, about forty-four or forty-five yards, from my show-board, it was worth about 2 l. I was in the shop at the time; I did not see it taken; a man came in, and asked me if I had not lost such a piece of linen; I told him I could not say, I looked, and found I had lost such a piece; he told me he had the people in custody, if I would come and ascertain the piece of cloth, if it was mine he would deliver them up to the Justice; he went away, and I was going after him, but before I got there, he and the two women were coming with the piece of linen in their hands.</p>

               <p>(Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The mark is 80 yards, it was made by the people of the Stamp-office; I have cut off so much, that reduced it to this quantity; the prisoners are the two women that were brought over.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was this piece rolled up on your show-board? - As much as it appears in Court.</p>

               <p>I was coming home from work, and I met a woman I had not seen for a twelvemonth, or better, that I used to work for, and she said she had just received it from a waggon from Northampton, and she begged me to hold it while she went to the Ship in Swallow-street, for she had more things there; I was going to carry it down to the Ship, when that good man stopped me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jenkins. Is this in the road to the Ship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing of this when you took her? - No.</p>

            , about four years and a half old. I saw that child with all its wearing apparel perfect, on the day in the indictment, at dinner time; my dinner time is between twelve and one. I came home again at nine o'clock at night, and then I was informed that the child had been almost entirely stripped.</p>

               <p>ANN SHIMMEL. I have a son; I sent him on an errand on the day in the indictment; he was gone a long time, longer than he ought to have been gone, and a man came after him, and said a child had been stript, and all the clothes had been found, except the hat. I told the man my son was not at home. I went to the prisoner's mothers appartment about ten o'clock at night, and found him there. When I first went to the house, the mother was coming to the door.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH PRINCE. I am a constable of St. Lukes. I went to the prisoner's mothers house, I found the prisoner there, and I acquainted him with my business; I told him I came to take him, for stripping Mrs. Buttres's child; he began to cry; he said he was very sorry for what he had done. I searched the place, and the mother of the prisoner, chucked the hat out of the window. I picked that hat up under the window outside, and it was claimed by Mr. Buttress, as his child's hat.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SHIMMELL, I am not thirteen years old, I know the prisoner at the bar, I have not known him long; I knew him for about a month before he was taken up. I know Mr. Buttress and his little boy. The prisoner asked the little boy to come along with him; the little boy was in a frock and trowsers. He took him into Brown-street, and into a new empty house; he took off the little boys clothes, and said he wanted to look at them; the little boy began to cry, and the prisoner said he would put them on again, for he only wanted to look at them. He then gave them to me to run across the road with them; he was to receive them again; I was frightened, and let them fall; there were some boys playing, and they run after me; I ran away, and the prisoner met me in Whitecross-street. I had nothing to do with the hat. I told this story to the officer.</p>

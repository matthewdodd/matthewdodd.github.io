               <p>C. W. <hi rend="smallCaps">JONES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>, 879). On the evening of March 12th I was in Bishopsgate Street with Cross at 5.45, and saw Steele at the corner of Wormwood Street—we watched him an hour and a half, and saw him go into the Bell public-house, Aldgate, he came out and met Wilde, who handed him this bag—they both went into the Bell, Steele went into the taproom and examined the contents of the bag—I went in and told him we were police officers, and should take him in custody for receiving the bag well knowing it to be stolen—he was emptying the small bag into a large one, shaking it; I think the small bag had been in the large one—at the police-station Steele dropped in the dock a list of Messrs. Hewlett's prices, and said that he had bought this cream of tartar at various little shops—I found nothing on him but a pocket-book and some papers relating to drugs.</p>

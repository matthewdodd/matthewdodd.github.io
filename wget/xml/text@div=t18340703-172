               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You did not leave it in your fob? A. I am quite certain I put it under my pillow - I was sober - I had been to a benefit society - I had paid my contribution, and came away at eleven o'clock at night - I went there at half-past eight o'clock - I was not drunk - my watch was in my fob, and when I retired to bed I put it under my pillow, as I always do - I paid 7s., or 7s. 6d., at the club - I had two half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence, when I came away - I paid half-a-crown to the prisoner - I did not pay for the room - I did not say I had not money enough, and she might pawn the watch - I had drank at the club, and I went to a public-house before I met her, and had some porter, but no spirits - I was sober enough to see her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had paid her half-a-crown? A. Yes; there was no further demand on me for the house, nor any thing else.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was his apartments? - In Hewitt's court.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from your house? - Not above two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find twenty pieces there? - More than twenty; I have not reckoned them; the beadle has had them in his possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that to be your leather? - Upon my word, it is not an easy matter to swear to it. I have my doubts whether I can swear to the whole, I can swear to some.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing that you can be certain to? - There is a doubt on my mind. There are some pieces of leather here, but then they were not found in his apartment.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, (the second parcel produced) where did that come from? - The next morning, which was a Thursday, a woman came to me, and said, a person brought some leather to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing but from the information of that woman? - No. I have not a doubt but that the greatest part of this leather is mine, but then it was not found in his apartment, and the woman is not here.</p>

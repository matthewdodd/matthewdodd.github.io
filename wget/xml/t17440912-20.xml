             . The Prisoner brought this pair of boots to me to sell: I turned them up, and out dropped a pair of silver spurs. I was sensible she did not know any thing of the spurs, so I asked her , how she came by them? She said, she had them in Kent; that a gentleman who was on horseback pulled off his boots to go over a hedge, in order to be concerned with her, and she run away with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the boots as I was coming along, and the spurs were in them.</p>

             . I live next door to Mr. Brotherton: The prisoner offered to sell the boots to him for 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nothing but the boots?</p>
               <p>Beaning . The spurs were in the boots, but they were not found then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, there was 2 whip too.</p>
               <p>Benning. She said, she would not part with the whip; and when the spurs were found, she would not sell the spurs with the boots. When she came before the Justice, she said she met a man who wanted to make use of her; and that the man pulled off the boots to go through the hedge: whereupon the Justice said, he never knew a man pull off his boots to go through a hedge. And she said, while he went through the hedge, she run away with them. <rs id="t17440912-20-verdict104" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor at 14, Boston Place, Dorset Square—I am the owner of the Hackney carriage, No. 9518—William Shepherd is a driver in my employment; he had the cab on the 11th June, about 12 o'clock in the day, and he came to me in the evening and made a communication, in consequence of which I went with him to the Haymarket and saw the prisoner driving the cab—we were in another cab—Shepherd jumped out and ran to the prisoner and jumped on the spring of the cab, when the prisoner whipped the horse as hard as he could, and then struck Shepherd—I saw nothing more till I saw the horse lying down in the street with a crowd round.</p>

I am a cab-driver, 14257, and was, on the 11th June, about 9.30 p.m., out with Mr. Davis's cab, No. 9518, on the Totten<lb></lb>ham Court Road cab rank—I left my cab with the attendant to go to have my tea, and was away about 40 minutes, and on my return the cab and horse were gone—I reported the matter at the Tottenham Court Road Police-court, and then went in a cab with my master and found the cab with the prisoner turning out of Rupert Street—I jumped on the spring of the cab and caught hold of the prisoner by the collar and seized the reins—I said "You have got my cab, hold hard"—he hit the horse and then began hitting me with the butt-end of the whip, and he told me if I did not let him go he would corpse me—the horse was going at a furious pace and went on to the pavement—I saw the constable at the corner of Leicester Square—the horse went on, and I was still standing on the spring holding the prisoner—he kept on beating me the whole time, and when we got to the corner of Castle Street the horse struck a post and fell down, and I gave up the prisoner to the police.</p>

I came down to his assistance, and so we were looking about some time in the gentleman's yard, close by; we could not perceive the thief at all, so in the space of ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, he said, I think there is somebody in this place, and he followed him up stairs, and found him under the bed of one Gillerton, that he lodged with. He was not found in the prosecutor's house, the prosecutor had found him there first, but he let him go, and we found him afterwards in this Gillerton's house; we pulled him out from under his own bed; the prosecutor took hold of one foot, and I hold of the leg, and pulled him out, and the other man said, it is Jerry, watch, do you take care of him; I took his then to the watch-house, in the parish of Hackney; Mr. Messenger said, watchman, if you please, you will search this man; the prisoner at the bar said, you have no need to search me, I will give you your money again, he said so to Mr. Messenger. I have got the money.</p>
               <p>Messenger. I can swear this is my money.</p>

Mr. Messenger called out, I believe he is here in his own lodgings. I live next door to the prisoner Mr. Messenger lived one door between us; we rushed in doors, and followed him up stairs, and I saw him under the bed, and helped to pull him out; I was not the person that took the money from him, Bridges took the money.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew where he lodged? - Yes, because he used my house in dealing with me, that was the reason of my going up to his lodging to search.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I work about three hundred yards from Mr. Messenger's, and I goes there generally for my day's victuals, by going there, I got acquainted with the servant girl, she used to bid me call her up in the night; and I used to be with her from two o'clock in the morning, till five; and she has given me both money, victuals, and drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by that money in your pocket? - In about a week after that I was up with her one morning a washing, and I had my breakfast with her, and she gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Messanger up that night, that you was in the yard? - I don't know, the back door was open, and I went in at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the window open? - I don't know.</p>

               <p>Did you lose a great coat last July? - I did, on the 31st of July, it was my coachman's great coat, I was returning to my house in Charlotte-street, in a chariot that was not my own, my own being out of repair, and it was one that my coachman had got for that day, there was a particular injury done to the carriage, I was going along <placeName id="t17840915-55-crimeloc274">Hart-street</placeName>

               <p>Did you see the prisoner taken? - No; I found the coat on the pavement, some distance from the carriage; I did not see the prisoner about the carriage.</p>

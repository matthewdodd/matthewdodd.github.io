                  </hi>. From instructions I received, I went with another officer to watch the premises of Mr. Hill, a confectioner, of Bishopsgate-street Within—about half-past 4 o'clock on Monday, 10th August, I saw the prisoner leave the premises—we followed him into Wormwood-street—on coming up to him I told him I was an officer, and asked what he had about him; that he was suspected of having something about him which belonged to his master—he said, "Who instructed you to watch me? I have only a few eggs; it is a very bad job for me; cannot the matter be compromised?"—I said, "Not under any circumstances; I must take you to the station and search you"—I searched him at the station, and found in his hat this cake, which just fitted the hat, and 6 small cakes, and 10 eggs in his pockets—I afterwards searched his lodging, and there found some lemon-peel and some cakes, a quantity of butter rolled up in paper, and some loaf sugar, and about 1 1/2 lbs. currants; they are such things as confectioners use.</p>

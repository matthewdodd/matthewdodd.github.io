On the 24th of October my wife came in and threw this shawl across the wainscot, and went up stairs; the prisoner was there, and called for a cup of coffee - he drank part of it, and went out suddenly; in less than five minutes my wife missed her shawl: on Friday last she saw him in the street, and brought him home - I questioned him about it; he at first denied it - I told him I thought it was his first offence, and he did it through distress, and if he could tell me where I could go for a good character, I would be as lenient as I could with him - he said he did it through distress, and he worked at a dyer's near Finsbury-square.</p>

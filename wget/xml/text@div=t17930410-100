               <p>Q. Did you know the elderly gentleman? - I did not; the boy in the shop shewed him many; I was present, the other man purchased four, the prisoner paid for them; they had some difficulty in casting up how much they amounted to, the old gentleman desired the boy to make out a small note with it, I accidently was standing at the door, and this man came out with something under his jacket or coat, which he has on now; I had a suspicion that he had stole something by seeing something underneath his coat, I saw something like a kind of a border of a handkerchief; I saw he walked pretty fast and then began to run; I followed him and took hold of him by the collar, and took from under his coat a dozen of handkerchiefs which I know to be the property of Mr. Hobbs.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was going out you observed this dozen of handkerchiefs? - I did, and they appeared like borders of handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. In such a manner that you could hardly be deceived? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I thought they were the handkerchiefs that the man had bought.</p>
               <p>Lee. The man had those himself, and they were then laying on the counter and he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they walk out together? - No, this person left the other in the shop while the note was drawing out.</p>

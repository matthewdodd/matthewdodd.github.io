            . On the morning of the 2nd of October, I left my cottage to go to work, at about a quarter after six.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your cottage - A. In the parish of <placeName id="t18151025-2-crimeloc6">Paddington</placeName>

               <p>Q. Is there only one door to it - A. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that door shut, and were the windows down - A. The door was shut; there are no shutters to the windows; but they were shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in your cottage besides yourself - A. Only my wife; she was out to nurse a lady at Bayswater, and had been so for a fortnight before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you left nobody in the house - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return - A. At about a quarter after eight; I found my door upon a jar, a little way open; I pushed it with my hand, and opened it; the prisoner looked me very hard in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. What! was he in the house - A. In the house at the time. I said, you villain, what business have you here? what could you expect to find in a poor man's cottage like this? he said, he was searching for money and victuals. He had tied up in a clean white napkin, a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, of mine; they were tied up on the bed. He laid hold of me to try to get out at the door; we struggled together a good deal, and he said, I was not going to lock him in there. My coat, waistcoat, and breeches, were not tied up on the bed when I went out. I ran to call somebody; he got right through the roof of the cottage, and ran down Black Lion-lane; I ran after him, and caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he then say - A. He said, he did it through distress. I brought him back to the side of the house. I then got a person to go in, and see what damage was done, and then I got another person to go in, and we took him to the watchhouse, and after that to Marlborough-street. I have one thing to say in his favour, he offered me no violence. I found that the drawers in my house had been rummaged.</p>

            . At about a quarter before nine in the morning of the 2nd of October, I was by the turnpike gate, at the end of Black Lion-lane; I saw Kenton with the prisoner at the bar; he hallooed out, Kelly, and told me, that man had broken into his house; and then he gave him in charge to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say - A. I asked him what he did it for? he said, he was in expectation of finding money there, as he thought, it was the foreman of the field's cottage I led him to the Crown at Bayswater, and there searched him; but found nothing on him. I then took him to the watchhouse, where I left him, and came back to the cottage. I found that the staple of the bolt was wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Q. To Kenton. Did you find the staple broken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Kelly. What did you then find - A. I found this bundle of clothes tied up on the bed; they were tied in a towel; there are a pair of small-clothes, a body coat, and a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. To Kenton. What is the value of the body coat - A. Why, it may be ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the waistcoat - A. Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. And the breeches - A. Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt at all that they are all together worth five shillings - A. No doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. To Kelly. Was the prisoner present when you found this bundle - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any further conversation with him - A. Yes. He said, he tied up these things, and expected something better than what he found.</p>

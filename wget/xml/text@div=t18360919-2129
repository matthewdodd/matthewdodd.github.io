                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. James Hall's a pawnbroker, in High-street, Marylebone. On the 12th of September the prisoner came there, at a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, and redeemed a carpet—the young man in the shop returned it to him—this gun was hanging in the shop, against the partition in the counter, about seven or eight feet from the ground—after he was served he lingered about the shop some minutes, and when asked if he wanted any thing else, he said, "No, "he was waiting—in about five minutes I heard a scuffling—I got over the counter and opened the door, and saw this gun standing in a passage—I stood and watched for about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner then came and laid hold of the gun—he had quitted the shop before—I do not know who put it there—other persons might have done so, but no person was there while the prisoner was gone—when he came back he laid hold of then gun—I brought him into the shop—he sat down five minutes in a chair, then got up, seized me by the collar, and attempted to push me away—I found this knife in the chair he had been sitting on—this string was in the nail, and was cut—he said it was very hard for me to accuse him of a thing he was not guilty of—I charged him with cutting the gun down.</p>

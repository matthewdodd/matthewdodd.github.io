                  </hi>. I am a hardwareman, in Black Horse-place, City-road. On the 13th of May, 1833, I was in company with the prisoner at the Leap<lb></lb>ing Bar public-house—he was in distress—he asked me if I could give him a job—I told him to sit down, and I would give him some beer; and next morning I hired him to carry the articles stated, to the corner of Farring<lb></lb>don-street, and to wait, not to deliver them—I went down about half-past nine o'clock, and then I hired him to carry them on to Hyde-park-corner, and to wait there till I came—I got there about half-past eleven o'clock—he was not there—I never saw the goods, nor him, till about six weeks ago, when I heard he kept a lodging-house in Wentworth-street—I went, and saw him—I asked him what his name was—he said, "Chadwick"—I asked him about these goods—he said he never knew any thing about it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170052"></xptr>
               <p>—I said, "It is strange you don't know me; don't you remember carry, ing these fender and fire-irons?"—I am sure he is the same person.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is six years since these were delivered to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I never said it was three, nor four—I might have said that through mistake—I bought the fender of Mr. Hartell, at the Leaping Bar—when I was asked when I delivered these to him, I said I could tell by going to Mr. Hartell's; but he had not got his books by him—I had not said it was four years—I might have said four to five—I asked Mr. Hartell if he had the books six years back, or if he could recollect when I have them—I was to carry them to Brentford to sell, to execute an order for a broker—I had more goods with me—some went on with a van—I cannot recollect who ordered them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son—my father gave the prisoner the goods to take to Farringdon street, and from there to Hyde-park-corner—I am sure he is the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long ago is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About six years—I could not tell exactly How long it was till my father got the bill—I had started off that morning for Brentford—I could not tell where these things were to go to—I had fenders and fire-irons in the cart—I am certain the prisoner is the man—he has grown stouter since then—I did not have above five minutes' conversation with him.</p>

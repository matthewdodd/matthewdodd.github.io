                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Pullen, and live at 38, Great Wild Street—the prisoner, Maria Pullen, and their niece, Mary Pullen, lived in the same house—I heard something about the birth of a child—Maria Pullen made some communication to me at my shop door—after that the prisoner and his niece came and fetched her, and said, "Come down stairs, and have some tea"—shortly after that I heard screams, in a female voice—I went down into the kitchen, and found the prisoner's wife lying on the floor, by the fire<lb></lb>place—she said, "Pullen has knocked me</p>

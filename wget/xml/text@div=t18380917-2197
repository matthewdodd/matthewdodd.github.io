On Monday, the 27th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was standing on the gate, at the Kegent's Canal—the prisoner was on shore near me—John and Thomas Butcher were there—I had not been long there when I saw the prisoner hit young Butcher—I had heard the prisoner use very coarse language to Butcher's father, which is not fit to repeat, and John said he would not allow his father to be abused in that way—the prisoner then hit John Butcher a blow in the mouth—a straight-forward blow, with his fist—I had not my self seen John Butcher hit him before that—after striking him with his first,</p>

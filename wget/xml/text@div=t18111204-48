            . On Monday the 18th of November I lost the mare; the mare was in a small field near my own house; I ordered my man to put her in in the morning about eight o'clock.</p>

About eleven o'clock a man came to me and said he had seen a man riding the mare, and that he had stopped him. I went up to Whitechapel to see if it was my mare, I found that it was, it was put up at an inn.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. Monday the 18th of November the day that I missed her; I had seen her on the Sunday, the 17th. The prisoner was taken to the police office.</p>

            . On the 18th of November about half past nine o'clock, I was coming up towards town with a horse and cart, I saw the prisoner leading Mr. Daplyn's mare by the foretop; I questioned him where he was going to, he said up to the turnpike; I asked him if he was going to take her to the pound, he told me he was going to take her home. I told him the mare belonged to Mr. Daplyn, 25, Saffell-place. He turned her round to take her home towards Mr. Daplyn's, I went on about my business, not thinking I should see her any more. When I returned back from Church-lane I saw him riding the mare with a new halter about a quarter before eleven, he had just entered on the stones in Whitechapel. I ran over and catched hold of the mare, I asked him where he was going to with her; he told me was going to take her home; I said, did not I tell you that it belonged to Mr. Daplyn, 25, Saffell-place, I challenged him with stealing the mare; he jumped off, ran away, and left the mare with me. I followed him and took him to Lambeth-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not sell her or part with her at all - A. No.</p>

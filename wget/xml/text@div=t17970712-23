            Did you, at any time, leave any of your cloaths in the hands of this servant? - A. Yes, several times; I left my cloaths there, about the latter end of May; I left a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of kerseymere breeches, two pair of silk stockings, and a night shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose immediate care did you leave them? - A. I cannot say that I had left them in the immediate care of anybody; I have generally left them in the prisoner's care, and have always found them safe.</p>

             sworn. - I was servant at Mr. Danton's, the prisoner was my fellow-servant; I left Mr. Danton's on the 8th of June; I never saw Mr. Sharman till he was sent for on this occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being desired to brush any coat? - A. Yes; the prisoner at the bar desired me to brush a coat, two days before I left; it was a blue coat; she said she had a coat belonging to a gentleman that came to town once a month, and left his things in her care, and she asked me to brush it for her, as I was brushing a coat of my own, and I did brush it, and returned it to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you ever recollect, during the time you lived there, having had a coat to brush before? - A. I was only there a week, and I believe I brushed another in the course of that week besides.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that a much frequented house? - A. Yes; by Frenchmen.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many lodgers have they? - A. Only four when I was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How came you to leave the service on the 8th of June? - A. Mr. Danton told me he had missed two table spoons, and should insist upon their being found, it was about half past twelve, and I told him if I had left them any where, it must have been in the lady's bed room that I had waited upon, and it was not then a proper time to go into a lady's bed-room, but I would look the next morning for them, but they could not be found.</p>
               <p>Mrs. DANTON sworn. - The prisoner lived with me between five and six months, and lately I missed many things, and I suspected her, and sent her away on the 8th of June, on account of these two spoons; I delivered Mr. Sharman's coat to the prisoner, to put to the remainder of his things; after the cloaths were missed, I found her out, and asked her if she knew any thing of the cloaths, and she said she had left them in the drawers, in the room Mr. Sharman had slept in.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS JOSEPH LAINE. I live on my own property. - I arrived in town from Paris on the 2d of January, and reside at the Gloucester hotel, which is kept by Mr. Thomas Dale; I do not know what parish it is in. I had arrived in London before, on the 20th of October, and was at that hotel in October and November last, and saw the prisoner there then, until the 13th of November; he was a lodger there like myself; I am a native of France, and formed an acquaintance with him, as being a countryman. We met in the coffee-room. I was very unwell in November, and on the 13th, in the morning, I kept to my room - the prisoner visited me in my room; he was in the habit of doing so; he visited me in my room several times when I was in bed; I had a pocket-book, containing four 5l. notes and sundry papers, and I had a purse, containing between 6l. and 7l.; on the 13th of November my pocket-book was on a dressing-table, and the purse on a chest of drawers in my bed-room - I had occasion to leave my room for a few minutes, about ten o'clock that morning; I was not then dressed; I did not leave the prisoner in the room, but he had been there two or three times that morning, to see me; the door has a spring, and shuts by itself. I missed my pocket-book and purse about seven or eight minutes after I came back to the room, as I was dressing - I instantly went down stairs, and gave notice to the landlord; the prisoner was not then in the house; I did not see him again till he was before the Magistrate, at Marlborough-street. I went to France on the 15th, returned on the 2d of January, and have seen my pocket-book and a 5l. note before the Magistrate; I had not marked my note, but I had the number of it. Here is a memorandum which I made the day I lost them, in order to stop the notes; the numbers are 16,642 to 16,645, inclusive; I received them from Mr. Salt not long before I lost them.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. I am waiter at the Gate-house hotel, Highgate. The prisoner came there on a Friday, about the the middle of November; I do not know the day of the month; he came there about four o'clock in the afternoon, to the best of my remembrance: he remained there that night, and for about a week; he paid every day for every thing, as he had it, till about the Wednesday; and on the Monday he asked for change for a 5l. note, which he gave me; I took it to Ann Rogers, my mistress, who gave me the change, and I gave it to him; there were four sovereigns and some silver. On the Thursday evening he was in the coffee-room below stairs; it came on a snow, and was very cold; he complained of its being very cold, much more so than in Paris; he pulled a paper out of a pocket-book, and said it was a small bit of paper, but it was worth 800l. - I saw the pocket-book; he then said he wanted to go to London, to get some money from Stevenson's, the bankers, to pay his bill and go to Paris, as it was so cold, he could not stay in town any longer, and should go next day. Some time after that he asked if I ever went to town - I said very seldom; he asked if I would go for him, as it was so cold, to get some money from Stevenson's, the bankers - I said, to oblige him, I would go; he went into the coffee-room, called for a sheet of writing paper; he wrote a letter, and put the piece of paper into it, after reading the letter to me; he said his name was Laine. I believe the letter was written in English - our conversation was in English; I cannot speak French. I took the letter to Messrs. Stevenson and Salt's, of Lombard-street, and in consequence of what passed between me and Mr. Salt, I went to the Mansion-house with him, by his desire, and answered what questions I was asked; I went with Mr. Salt immediately afterwards, to Mr. Dale's, the Gloucester coffee-house; Goddard, the of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100014"></xptr>ficer, and Mrs. Dale, went with me to Highgate; the prisoner had then been gone some time. On the following Sunday evening I had information where he was, and went with Fitch, the constable, and took him, at the Bull and Mouth public-house, Kentish-town. I have the pocket-book here which he produced - he gave it to me that evening, with the letter, to bring the money back in; I have had it ever since.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the house. Mr. Hoare delivered me these four notes; I put them on the desk, and saw Mr. Laine take them up. I remember Ewen coming on the 23d of November; he delivered a letter to one of our clerks, who is not present. I have got the letter and the enclosure which was in it; I opened the letter, and went with him to the Mansion-house; my father afterwards went with him to Mr. Dale's.</p>

            . The prisoner read the letter over to me before he sealed it; this is the letter - it has my seal on it, which I lent him, to seal it with, and this is the paper which was in it; I swear I saw him write it, and he read it over to me in English - he speaks English very well.</p>
               <p>The letter in question, which was written in the French language, was here read, and translated in substance as follows:-</p>
               <p>"Highgate, 22d of November, 1827.</p>
               <p>"Messrs. Stevenson and Salt, Bankers, London.</p>
               <p>"I beg of you to remit by bearer, to me, a bill of exchange for 700l., and 100l. in bank notes, against this, which I now send you. I have more need for money than I thought I should. You will oblige, very much, your devoted servant.</p>
               <p>"J. LAINE."</p>
               <p>"I believe I shall be able to go away to-morrow, or the day after, on a journey. Send to Batts' hotel."</p>
               <p>The order inclosed in the letter was for the payment of 800l., to Mr. Joseph Laine, on account of Messrs. Rothschild, through Messrs. Stevenson and Co.</p>
               <p>MR. LAINE. This letter is not my hand-writing, nor my signature; this paper was in my pocket-book when it was taken - it is a memorandum for 800l.; it would have been available to me, but to nobody else, unless they had forged my name. Messrs. Stevenson and Salt are my bankers, and know my signature; this is my pocket-book- there is my writing in it; here is a ticket for perpetual entrance to the Virginia Museum, which I had in it.</p>

               <p>The whole of the evidence was communicated to the prisoner by an interpreter, through whom he stated as follows - I wish to know in what place I gave the witness that letter, and what I gave it him to read for. I have been five months in England, and two months of the time confined to my bed, and in that time it was impossible I could read a letter in English. I wish to know what I should write the letter for, and why I should sign it Laine. The evidence is not true.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EWEN. He read the letter to me in English; he did not give it me to read; he told me the purport of it.</p>

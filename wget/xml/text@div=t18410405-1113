                  </hi>. I am foreman of the Chelsea Waterworks Com<lb></lb>pany. In March they were engaged in some new works from the end of the Serpentine river to Knightsbridge—the prisoner was engaged it as a layer of pipes at the Brompton-road, at the Knightsbridge end of the Serpentine—this piece of lead is the property of the Company—I have brought another piece to match with it—the name of Hughes is on them—this piece is about one-third of a pig—here is the 8 and the dot on this piece—the lead is carried on a truck to the place, and what is lift is put into a box or cupboard, which is locked, and there is a watchman to mind it—the prisoner knew that very well—I intended to have put him on the next night as a watchman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 151.) I was in St. James's Park on the evening of the 16th of March, a little after six o'clock—I saw the prisoner coming down Constitution Hill—he was rather bulky under his jacket—I stopped him when he got to Buckingham Palace-gate, and asked him what he had got—I pulled his jacket open, and took this piece of lead from under it—I asked where he got it—he Mid it fell out of the truck—I said, "If it fell off, why did not you put it up again?"—he said he did not know; he was going to take it to the waterworks—I said, "Did any one see yon take it up?"—he said, "No one"—I then said, "I think it would have been easier for you to carry it on your shoulder then under your jacket"—he then said he found it in the road, and did not know whether ft fell off the truck or not.</p>

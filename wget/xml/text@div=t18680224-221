                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 981). About half-past one in the morning of 25th January I met the prisoner at Holborn Bars—I observed something bulky in an apron in front of him; he was wearing several aprons—I stopped him—I found that he had a clock in the apron—I took him to the station, and besides the clock I found four composing sticks, made of metal, three packets of bronze powder, three printer's aprons, which he was wearing, and five linen collars—he was about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's warehouse when I met him.</p>

On Saturday morning, 25th January, at nine o'clock, I went to the prosecutor's premises—I found an entry had been made by the area leading to the basement, by breaking a paper where a pane of glass had been broken, and by that means admitting a hand to undo the hasp of the window—that would give access to the warehouse.</p>

I am a machine minder in the prosecutor's employ—the prisoner was in their employ under me two years ago—on Friday, the 24th January, I left all fastened up, as usual, quite safe—about ten minutes or a quarter past eight next morning I found the paper broken and the window unbolted, and I missed the articles—I know the clock and the composing sticks.</p>

On the night in question a man named Samson, who the officer knows, asked me if I would go and carry some things for him—he left me at the corner of Johnson's Court—he went up the Court and came back about one o'clock with a coat—he said "Put this on, it will keep you dry;" it was raining at the time—it felt heavy, as there were things in the pocket—I did not touch them—he gave me the aprons—he left me in Holborn, and the constable stopped me—I did not know they were stolen.</p>

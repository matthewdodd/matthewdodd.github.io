Last Monday morning was a week, I got up at half an hour after twelve o'clock at night, and went to shift the lighter, that is, to bring her within the reach of the crane to take the stones out; I saw the prisoner in the barge's cabin; I asked him what business he had there; he said he came to look after a corn barge; I saw a boat lying on the inside the barge; I saw in it two parcels of rope lying; he was going out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030004"></xptr> barge down into the boat; I got in her too, and stopped him from going away; there were more ropes than ours of other peoples; I asked him where he had them; he said it was a parcel of old rope which he had got, and said in a lighter head; I perceived they were wet; I said, they have been lately taken out of the water; he said, I might have them if I would let him go about his business; I stopped him, boat and rope too, and took him through our yard to the watch box, and charged the watchman to go along with us to the watch house; going along, the prisoner dropped a case knife; when I went to the barge again, I found one end of the cable was loosened, and the other end was fresh cut.</p>

            . About seven o'clock that morning, I went to look at the boat that was lying on the outside Mr. Fletcher's barge, I saw many pieces of rope in it; there was a sling belonging to Mess. Fletcher and Arnold that I could swear to; it is a large rope we use to put about a block of stone, when we move them with the crane; we took the prisoner before Justice Miller, there he said he never was on the wharf where the sling was taken from.</p>

               <p>I never meddled with any thing, neither had I been upon the wharf; I am a waterman, and have been sick, and have never a boat to work in.</p>

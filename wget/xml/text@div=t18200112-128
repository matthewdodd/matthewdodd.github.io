            . On the 3d of January, as I was coming from Staines, the prisoner overtook me; he said he was going after a four-horse team that came from Farnham - he had a bundle. I remembered that no team passed, and suspected him. I asked him what he had in his bundle? he said he had a couple of geese. I examined it, and found he had two geese in a smock-frock; they were quite warm. I asked him where he got them from? he said from Farnham. I said that was impossible, he must have stolen them in the neighbourhood. He said a man gave them to him at Egham - he could not tell who the man was; I detained him. I found they belonged to Taylor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tin manufacturer, of No. 30, Red Cross-street. The prisoner was in my service; I paid him 11 a week wages—I had three horses, and two sets of harness on 6th Feb.—I left town on that day, leaving the horses in charge of the prisoner—when I came back I found two horses—I spoke to the prisoner about the other horse—he said he was sorry to say one of the men had taken it out; it came home ill, and died; and he sold it to a slaughterman—I was afterwards on Snow-hill and saw the horse in another person's possession, tolerably well—I saw the prisoner the same day, and charged him with stealing the horse—he said nothing particular—I endeavoured to find a policeman, but could not, so the prisoner went off, taking advantage of it—I saw him next day, and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>them back; I am sorry to say not a great many—the prisoner wished to go into business when he left me—I sold him these goods, and when I found he could not pay for them, I fetched them away; and instead of being the whole quantity, they were half of them short—the cash-boxes were short—I have not my books here, in which the prisoner's wages are down from week to week, from five or six months ago—he came into my service about Oct. last—I went on paying him till Christmas; my books will prove it—I have not my books here—I mean to swear I paid him his wages up to Christmas; every penny, and more—there were three horses belonging to me—the prisoner did not buy one, certainly not—I should think I bought them all—I paid for them—I dealt with the person who sold them, and to whom they belonged—I made the bargain myself—I had had one of them about nine months; that I used for the business; another I bought at a sale at Aldridge's—the third I bought from a gentleman at Brunswick-square; his name was Miller—neither of those was the horse I charge the prisoner with stealing—I changed away another horse for that—I changed my galloway for it, the one that I had nine months, with a dealer in London-wall; I forget his name—I have known the prisoner two or three years—I knew him first as an actor—I am not a bit of an actor—I have done a little in the amateur way—my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was working sometimes when the horses had nothing else to do—there was a license taken out—I did not take it out—I drove the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> once, when the man did not come to his duty—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and horses were kept in London-wall—I removed my stable just about the time that I sent this man to take these stables for me—I have since learned that he took them in his own name—he never paid anything—the horses were removed, because the person the stable belonged to became a bankrupt—I heard that he had become a bankrupt after my return from the country—I had not heard it before I went away—I was away about a week, I think—I saw the horse afterwards in the possession of a man named Shelton—I had seen him once, but I should not have known him personally if he had not spoken to me—I believe no rent was paid for the stable where the horses were—there was no bill sent in—I paid for the keep of the horses—I cannot say how much I paid—I have my bills and receipts at home—I had a bill come in from Smith and Son for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not paid it yet—I have paid a good deal in my time—I cannot tell what I paid for the keep of these horses up to 6th Feb.—I paid the prisoner his regular salary from Christmas to Feb., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and sometimes more—I swear that I paid him his salary regularly; if not week by week; it might have gone eight or nine days—I paid him at every opportunity, and overpaid him—I cannot tell whether he had on one occasion to hire another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he has done such monstrous things; whether he has done such a monstrous thing as to hire another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when mine was broken, I cannot tell—I got another partner about 6th Feb.—I got rid of the partner about Christmas—I think I must not admit that he was a partner; he merely placed a sum of money in my hands—I have got another partner, a different person from the first—I got rid of a portion of my property, which is a mere trifle in my stock—there were other goods I sold to this man—I got a fresh partner after I came back from the country—I made a fresh arrangement with the prisoner, that he should be my servant, at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; that was at his request—he wanted an arrangement that he might not be discharged—I have since been able to comprehend his meaning for that—he was to be my servant, at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, as usual, but at that time those goods which he had of me I had not fetched back—he said</p>

I am a grocer and cheesemonger, and lire at No. 24, Kirby-street I have known the prisoner about three years—he lived in my house—he was in service, but I don't know what—he sold me a horse about the latter end of Jan.—I gave him for it—the horse was lame at the time at the farrier's shop—there had been several people to buy him before me—I told the prisoner that if the horse recovered I would give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—he got well after three weeks, and then I drove him a little—the prisoner did not say anything when he sold the horse—I went to the farrier and asked if he was worth the money—when the prisoner asked me to buy it I thought it was his—his name was on the cab—Kingston and Meekin had sent him to me to try to sell a horse before—I thought it was all right.</p>

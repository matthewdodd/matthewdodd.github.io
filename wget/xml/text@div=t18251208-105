            . I live in Phoenix-street, Hackney-road, and am a wheelwright. On the 7th of November I was walking in the road, and met the prisoner, (who was a stranger,) walking with another lad; he had a saw buttoned in his coat; I passed him, and then came back and asked him what saw that was; he said "Which?" and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080046"></xptr>saw there were two of them; he said were they mine. I then took him to an officer. As we were going along two squares were picked up behind us, but I did not see them fall from the prisoner.</p>

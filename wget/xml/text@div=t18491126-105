                  </hi>. I live at No 17, Old-street. On the evening of 14th Nov. I was working in my cellar; I saw the prisoner reach over and take a basket off a nail—I ran up the ladder and saw her, one door off, placing the basket under her shawl—I overtook her and touched her on the shoulder, and she dropped the basket; this is it, it is mine—she said, "How much is it"—I said it was too late—she said she would pay me any<lb></lb>thing for it, and said she would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to let her go.</p>

I have known the prisoner nine or ten years—she has been always steady, honest, and industrious—I remember her being taken, and acquitted three months back—she was acquainted with a young man two years back, who deceived her—since then, when she has taken a little to drinking, she does not know what she is about.</p>

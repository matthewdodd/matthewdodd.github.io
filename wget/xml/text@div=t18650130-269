I am a butcher, of High-street, Deptford—on 18th January, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day, I left my shop, and on returning I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I went to the desk where I had previously counted and piled up some silver, and found it scattered about—I scrambled it up and put it into the till, so that I cannot say how much I lost.</p>

I am a brother of ‘the last witness—on 18th January I was coming from the slaughter-house into the shop, and saw the prisoner in the counting-house with a quantity of silver in each hand—directly he saw me he dropped it on the desk and said, "You may as well let me go, it will not do you any good"—I said, "No, I shall not"—I was just going to lay hold of him, when he made a rash out of the shop, and down a street opposite—I called "Stop thief," and he was caught—we brought him up Wellington-street into High-street, and gave him in custody.</p>

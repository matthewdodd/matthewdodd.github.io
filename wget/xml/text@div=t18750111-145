I am the wife of Charles Lord and live at 16, Pages Walk, Bermondsey—the prisoner kept the house, he was foreman at a dyer's—he occupied the ground-floor and I live in the front room first-floor, his children occupied the back room; there were six children with the baby, that was a female child—his wife had been confined about ten or eleven days before this occurrence—on Friday evening, 11th December, about 7 o'clock, my attention was attracted by some screams of murder from his room—I ran downstairs and saw Mrs. Hayes with the baby in her arms by the fire-side—the prisoner was in the act of getting out of the bed, he was not dressed—I said "Mrs. Hayes what is the matter)"—she said "He has murdered my baby"—I said "Don't say that, give me the baby," and I took it out of her arms and gave it to the prisoner's little girl, who took it up into my room—I then went in again and took Mrs. Hayes upstairs with my two sons—I passed in again and the prisoner was in the act of palling the quilt over his legs—two or three gentlemen then went in—I don't know who they were—the prisoner said "All of you has been the cause of this"—he did not say why—we tried to humour him—there had not been any quarrel—he had been ill and in bed for several days, pretty nearly ever since the baby was born—on the Tuesday before this Friday I went in to ask how he was—his wife said to him "Jem, Mrs. Lord wants to know how you are"—he put his hand out to shake hands with me and said "As well as can be expected, Mrs. Lord"—his hand was in a burning heat and he turned round to the wainscot and began to talk and said there was a policeman by his side—he said it very quietly, as if he really believed it—I said "Don't say that, Mr. Hayes, it is only your wife and family"—he said "It is very well for you to talk like that, I know," and then he began to mutter something, I don't know what, and Mrs. Hayes said "He has been talking worse than that all day"—he said nothing to that—I then came out—when I took the baby and gave it to the little girl it was dozing like, it had no sense or motion; I did not see any blood, it was bruised a little across the forehead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner several years, we have lived there four years; he has always been a kind-hearted, hard-working man, a good father and a good husband, he always lived on affectionate terms with his wife and children, he belonged to a sick club and was attended, by the club doctor; he was suffering from bronchitis and pleurisy—he complained of the medicine that was given him—he said the last draught was murdering him, he said that on this very Friday afternoon—when I went into the room I noticed that he seemed to stare very much at me—they tried to humour him, to get him back to his bed—his wife did not sleep with him at first during his ill-uses, but afterwards she brought him downstairs, as he was very bad and she could not attend to him.</p>

I know the back road to Scotland, there I shall get clear off"—I took the blanket to put round his nakedness and four men came in and Laid hold of him and put him in bed and the police were sent for.</p>

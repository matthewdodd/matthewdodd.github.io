            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty on the 13th of April, in St. Martin's-lane - the prosecutor spoke to me; I afterwards saw the prisoner come out of the public-house - I asked if he knew any thing about the young man's coat; he said he did not know any thing at all about it - that he had been in among a parcel of w-s and thieves, and if he had been robbed of his coat it must be among them; the prisoner is a private-watchman - I said it was very strange that a man should be robbed of his coat, and he be inside and not to know any thing about it; he said so help him God he knew nothing at all about it - I saw something projecting under his coat, and asked what he had there - he said Nothing; I said,"Come, Jemmy, let us look;" I unbuttoned his coat, and took out this bundle, with the prosecutor's coat in it, wrapped up in this blue handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the house - the prosecutor and one or two females had some gin; they wanted more, and the landlord refused to let them have it - they insisted upon having it; he put out the light, and said he would not serve any more - he came round to push them out; I opened the door, and picked up the coat - I thought I had a right to it, as there was another man there, and I did not know who it belonged to; when I came out the prosecutor was gone, and the Police-constable came and took me - I did not do it with intent to steal it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On the 12th of June, between one and two in the morning, I had charge of Ferrell for breaking open Skinner's stables; Southgate, the watchman, gave me charge of him; I searched him, I found nothing upon him but a knife; in a few minutes afterwards Gregory was brought in, by another watchman, naked, he had a bit of a shirt at each wrist, but no coat nor waistcoat on; his clothes were brought in, he asked for his clothes, I shewed him them, and asked if those were his clothes; he told me, yes, he put them on; after his clothes were on, I searched him, and found in his pocket these keys, which I believe to be pick-lock keys, (produces them); after I had taken them both to the Compter in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120016"></xptr>morning, about three o'clock, I searched the lodgings of Gregory, and in some drawers I found some more keys, which I believe are pick-locks.

               <p>Ferrell's defence. I was not in the stable at all; I was going up Old Bedlum when the coachman stopped me, I had never been there at all; I was walking along at the same time as the watchman was, and he laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Ferrell called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

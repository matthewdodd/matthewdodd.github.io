On Saturday night, the 18th of March, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in Hanley-road, Holloway, with my brother officer, Melvill, and saw the two prisoners driving the sheep between them towards the Green-lanes—they were talking together—Melvill asked them where they got the sheep from—Clarke immediately answered, that the sheep had followed them—they both said so—Wright wanted to go on, and said, "It's no use stopping here, we had better make our way towards home"—we immediately took them both into custody—Clarke resisted, and made his escape, but we apprehended him next morn<lb></lb>ing at his house—I took the sheep to the office—Cave and Willis saw it there, and recognised it by marks on it.</p>

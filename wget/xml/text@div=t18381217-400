                  </hi>. I live at Blackheath, in the parish of Lewisham. I had a mare which I saw safe between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 10th of December, on the heath—I missed her next morning, about nine o'clock—I had only had her five days—I saw her again on Friday, the 14th, at Green-street, at Mr. Winkley's, and am quite sure it was my mare—the place I put her in was Elliott's-place-green, which is on the heath, but it is railed round—there was room between the railings for her to get out, but she was blind with both eyes, and I thought she could not get out.</p>

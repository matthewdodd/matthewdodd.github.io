               <p>Q. On the night of Monday the 19th of June, were you in bed when the prisoner came up to his room - A. Yes; I observed he had his hand under his coat, and he sat down on the bed, the up stairs man told him to go down and mind the door, as it was his turn that night to mind the door; he went down and came up again in an hour and a half, as soon as he came in the room he blowed the candle out, I heard him open his box, shut it, and locked it. On the next day, after I had seen him in the bed room, he came down in the kitchen when I was there, he had a bundle in a handkerchief; he said he had done his work in the sugar-house; I told him to leave his bundle and come with me, I would show him something he had not done; he would not put the bundle down, I took the bundle from him, I opened it, it contained a dirty shirt, and sugar wrapped up inside of it; he said he meaned to use it with his tea; the foreman told him he was allowed sugar as well as the other men, he had no occasion to take it. We never use that sugar, we always use the best sugar. I delivered the sugar to Mr. Wiedner, the foreman.</p>

            . On Tuesday, the 20th of June, Wiedner brought me this sugar, I went into the men's kitchen, there I found Burke, I upbraided him for his conduct, he said it was the first time he ever had done so. He asked me to forgive him, and seemed affected.</p>
               <p>Q. What description of sugar is it - A. It is the heading of the lump sugar, it is never sold; it is worth about nine pence a pound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After I had done my work I had occasion to take my clothes to be washed. I tied them in a handkerchief and went into the kitchen to get some refreshment, I returned to the bundle, and was stopped at the door; on searching the bundle, to my great surprize, the sugar in the indictment was found; it must have been put in by some of the people in the sugar-house.</p>

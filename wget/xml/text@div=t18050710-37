               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; she lived <rs id="t18050710-37-deflabel213" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18050710-37-defend433 t18050710-37-deflabel213"></join> with me; I took her into my service in the beginning of March last, she continued in my service till this misfortune happened; I took her with a character of being far advanced in pregnancy, and she was represented to me as a single woman, that was at the last place.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told so before you hired her? - A. Yes, by her mistress that she had lived with.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner herself of her being with child? - A. I told her, I had only one objection to her character, and that was on account of her mistress saying she was pregnant; she told me, that the mistress stated that circumstance to prevent her going into any other situation as she wished to keep her herself; she denied being with child; I told her, I would not engage her in my service without she suffered the doctor, that attended my family, to examine her, she said, she had no objection whatever, provided I would take her; I hired her without having her examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doing that? - A. I meant to have it done some time after she had been in my service if she encreased in size; she being willing to be examined it removed my suspicion; as such I took her into my service, and she continued with me about two months, during which time, she appeared to have encreased very much in the size of her person; I questioned her concerning it, she constantly denied it; I told her, if she would make me her confident and friend I would do all in my power about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this during the period of the two months or at the end of the two months? - A. During the period of two months; in requesting of her to make me her confident and friend, she at last said, she could not say to the contrary to me that she was not with child; I then made enquiry of her who the father of it was; she said, he resided at Highgate, at Parson-hill, he was a waiter; I told her I would try and get her a letter for the hospital, and after I consulted my friends about it, they thought I had better decline it; I told her if she would go to the parish, I would take her into my service after she got well, and I would do what I could for her: she made me answer, that she had lain in there once before, and she would never do it again if she lay in in the street; at the expiration of two months I was very unwell myself, and the doctor attended me; I begged him to examine her, and I asked his opinion of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the doctor? - A. Mr. Bailey of Salisbury-square; I then called her into the room, he examined her no further than putting his hand on her stomach; I was present, he said that was sufficient; I told her what the doctor's opinion was after he was gone, that she was at least five or six months gone; she said he knew nothing at all about it; she was considerably further gone than that. On Tuesday night, the beginning of June, she was very ill the whole of the day, (she had complained to the people in the house, I knew nothing of it till afterwards); the next morning when she got up, she was very bad indeed, and appeared very languid; at nine on the Wednesday morning I saw her, I told her from her looks I apprehended that there was something more than common the matter with her; she told me she had been very bad all night, she had gone through a great deal; I told her that she appeared very different in her person, and hoped she would not deceive me, but tell me candidly if any thing had happened; she said, no, certainly, there had not, and she certainly was not with-child.</p>
               <p>Q. You told her that she appeared very different in her person? - A. Yes; and she answered she was very much reduced in her size, so far that she could slip through her stays; I then told her that I was certain something particular had happened to her; she begged that I would not disturb myself on that account, for there was nothing particular had happened to her; she continued poorly the whole of the week, and on the Thursday morning I went up into the attic story, there I saw she had washed some sheets, they were hanging in a room on the same floor where we are accustomed to dry in. I asked her what was the reason that she washed her own bed linen, when she knew it was always put out; she made no reply whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any more on that day? - A. I observed her bed not in a very proper state; it appeared as if some one had been in labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the beds to see if they were the proper sheets? - A. I did not look any further, it was not very pleasant to look at, I only turned down the cloaths. On Friday night, about half after eleven o'clock, she went out, I did not see her go out, but in ten minutes after that I heard the street door bell ring, and I rung the parlour bell to enquire who went out, and no one answered; I repeated the ringing of the bell, and asked who it was that rung the street-door bell, she answered it was herself; I desired her to come in to tell me where she had been out to; she would not come in, she said she had been out for some beer; with that I reprimanded her, and told her it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100054"></xptr>not a usual thing in my house for a servant to go out of a night without acquainting me with it, nor would I suffer it; this was on the Friday night; on the Saturday morning she was so bad that she could not get up, at eight o'clock she desired the apprentice to come and tell me; he brought me word that Sarah was very bad, and could not get up. I was very certain that she had been in labour; and as soon as I arose, I went to the prisoner, she was very bad in bed; I then asked her what was the matter with her; she said she was swelled to that degree, that she could not move; I looked at her, she threw the bed-cloaths off from her bosom, and her arms were quite extended, her breasts were quite up to the top of her neck, with the milk that was in her breasts; I told her I was very certain that she had been delivered; she spoke rather impertinent to me, and said, she was quite surprized at my suspicions; with that she removed the bed cloaths, and asked me if I saw a child there. I told her I did not, but I was very certain that she was not delivered on the Saturday; it was on the Tuesday night that she was delivered, I knew the time from the appearance of the things; I then told her she must have murdered the baby, and concealed it. I insisted upon immediately knowing; she answered me there was no one saw her do it, and no one could sware that she did it. I then told her I should send for a medical person, he should be satisfied respecting the delivery, as well as myself; with that she got up, and wanted to go out of the house, we detained her; I sent for Mr. - , he examined her, and said there was every appearance of her being delivered.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon: On Friday the 10th of last June, about a few minutes after eleven o'clock in the evening, a watchman came to my house, upon which I immediately went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you proceed to examine the body? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any warmth in the body at that time? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the child could you judge whether it was a full grown child or no? - A. It appeared to me to be of its full growth; there were no marks of violence upon the body of the child as I could discover.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge from appearance that the child had been born alive? - A. It had every appearance of being born alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the state of the lungs? - A. No, I did not conceive it necessary, my attention was drawn entirely to the navel string; I observed the navel string had not been tied as is usual, but that it had been divided by some instrument or other, about four inches from the body of the child; from that I infer, that there might have been an hemorrhage from thence; the extremities of the child were covered with blood, but whether it proceeded from the child or the mother it is not possible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. To what do you impute the cause of the child's death? - A. If the child was born alive, there is no doubt but the child got it's death from the navel string.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say the child was born alive? - A. The child might have died in its birth very probably; death may and does happen by leaving the navel string untied; the child must inevitably have lost a great deal of blood, but whether it died through that, it depends greatly upon the quantity of blood which the child lost, because the hemorrhage might have stopped before the child bled to death.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it not have been an easy thing to have tied up the navel string by a person in her situation? - A. She might do it, but it would not be very convenient.</p>
               <p>Q. Persons in that situation are very frequently in so debilitated a state, and the mind so far affected as to render them incapable of doing it without assistance? - A. True.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a sort of delirium attends labour sometimes? - A. It is the case most frequently after the delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately afterwards? - A. No; the child had the appearance as though it had lain in one position for some time; I do not think that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100055"></xptr>tying up the child these things, for a short time, would make it have the appearance that it had; I conceive that the mother might not be conscious that it would produce death to the child by dividing the tunica.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was with child, I was only three or four months gone; I was taken very ill, I was sitting on the water-closet, and something came from me of a great substance.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bradford, a grocer and tea-dealer, in Rupert-street, Haymarket. The prisoner applied to me for a place about a fortnight or three weeks before the 6th of September—I told her I did not know of any then, but if she would look in again some time I would tell her—she came again on the 6th, and asked if I knew of a place yet—I said no, and that she was too little—she said she could nurse a child, and do little things, and that she had a very bad mother, who pawned every thing—I told her she might come next day and I would see what she could do—she came, and in about an hour after I told her to go and sweep the school-room up—my daughter keeps a school—she was there about half an hour—at ten o'clock, when the young ladies came, a box was missing, but I had no suspicion of the prisoner—she staid all day, and when night came I told her she had better go—as she was coming</p>

               <p>up the kitchen stairs she seemed to have a pocket full of something—I asked what it was—she said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let me?"—she said, "No, my things are not clean, I should not like to show you"—I left her to call my daughter, and she ran out of the street-door—I ran into the shop and called a policeman—he and I went to where the prisoner had told me she lived, but they said she was not seen there for a fortnight or three weeks together—she was taken on the Sunday.</p>

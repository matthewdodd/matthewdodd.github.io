            . On Tuesday the 10th of July, between four and six in the afternoon, I was standing at my shop door: the prisoner came and put his hand upon my arm, and said, step to the window; I went; he asked me what a ring hanging there would come to; I said, about 14 or 16 s. he desired me to weigh it for him; I did, and told him it came to 16 s. he pulled out half a crown, 1 s. and 6 d. and laid the ring on the counter; he told me he had lost half a guinea out of his pocket; he said, Sir, it is all the same, I'll leave you a shilling and the ring: he gave me a piece of paper with a counterfeit ring and a shilling; I had seen him take up my ring and put it into his pocket. When he was gone, I opened the paper to look at my ring, and found I was deceived; I ran out, and happened to take the right way: I ran up Hart-street, and at the upper end I saw him; when I had been twenty or thirty yards in Monkwell-street, he run as hard as he could, and turned into Silver-street; I pursued him into the Castle and Faulcon yard: he stopped running, and was opening the paper to look at the ring: I got up to him, and laid hold of him, and said, my friend, you shall not drop the ring: I took hold of his hand, and led him to the first public house I came to, and desired Mr. Hayns, who was there, to open the prisoner's hand; he did, and there I took out my ring: bringing him back in Monkwell-street, he desired I would not take hold of his coat to expose him, saying, he had a great family; I let go his coat: when we came to the corner of Hart-street, he endeavoured to escape, and ran as hard as he could; and we took him again in Wood-street. (The ring produced and deposed to, and the shilling also which he left.)</p>

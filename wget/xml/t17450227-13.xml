On the 6th of February he took two shillings out of the till. - I had marked eight shillings and some half-crowns, the night before, with the letter M, and put them into the till (I had missed a shilling out of the till some time before, but I would not take any notice of that.) The Prisoner went twice by the drawer, and each time he took out a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the Prisoner took them out?</p>
               <p>Miller. I went to the till, and found two of the shillings I had marked missing: then I called him into a little room at the end of the shop, and told him of it. - I said, I must come to the truth of it; and sent for a constable. I told him, the Prisoner had taken 2 s. from me. He searched him, and found the 2 s. two Queen's Anne's shillings, marked on the neck with the letter M, in his shoes. I marked them with a pair of iron tweezers. I had put them into the till but about a quarter of an hour before.</p>

He denied it a great while, but at last took them out of his shoes, and then Mr. Miller charged me with him. <rs id="t17450227-13-verdict66" type="verdictDescription">

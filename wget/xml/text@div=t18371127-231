                  </hi>. I live in the New Cut, Lambeth, and am a printer. The prisoner was in my service—I lost about 14£lbs. of metal used for types—it consists of lead and antimony—it had been kept in the front kitchen, and is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 85, Great Saffron-hill, and am a general dealer. About nine o'clock in the evening of the 20th of November I was in the parlour of my house, and the prisoner brought this piece of metal—he said he brought it for sale, and placed it on the counter of the shop for ✗—he asked no price—I told him I did not think he had come by it honestly—I knew that persons who are possessed of metal of this kind never sell it in that kind of way—he said it was perfectly right—I said "You must give me your name and address, and I must go with you"—I went, and then I found he did live there—I brought him back to my, and told him I should not buy it then, he must call the next morn<lb></lb>ing—directly he was gone I took the metal to the station-house, and asked inspector for an officer to go and take him.</p>

            . - A. Yes. On Monday the 29th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, a young man that I had seen before in company with my husband, came to my house to enquire for my husband, he told me that he had left a man and a woman at the Cape of Good Hope, he came to my husband to know if he could give him any employment; I went with this young man that came to my husband, to shew him where my husband was; as we went along we met the prisoner at the bar and her husband in Ann-street; we all went to the Five Bells at Limehouse, where my husband was, and my husband asked the two men in; I asked the woman if she would go home and sit at my house till her husband knew whether he could have employment or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What line of life is your husband in. - A. He is a foreman in the West India Docks. The woman went home with me and sat down, in the mean time I was called out to go to a gentleman that I have attended at Limehouse for three years; when I was going out I took the candle from the table and looked at the silver watch that hung over the fire place in the front room where I had been sitting with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room when you looked at the watch. - A. Yes, it was half past six by the watch, but it was half past seven by the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this watch did not go well. - A. No, it had lost some time in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. It had lost an hour by the day. - A. Yes, I went out at that time, I desired the prisoner not to leave the place till I returned, I left my little girl with her, her name is

             sworn. I was constable of the night; I took the prisoner into custody, I searched her and found several duplicates, but nothing relating to this charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, my husband went down to this man after some work. The man with my husband went to this woman's husband, and asked this woman where her husband was; this woman went to the public house with my husband, this woman asked me to go home with her; when I went home with this woman there was a woman in the house who was cooking a supper. I had not been there long before a man came in, he took great liberties with the woman.</p>
               <p>Court. What woman do you mean. - A. Mrs. Schofield. After this man had been gone out about five minutes, Mrs. Schofield followed this man, my lord, she asked me to stay until she came back, I told her if she was gone long I would not stay until the came back. After this woman had been cooking supper she went in next door and left me and the little girl alone; I asked this little girl to be so good as to give me a bit of candle, as I wanted to go into the back yard. I came in and bolted the door after me, I gave the little girl the candle and thanked her, then I set down by the side of the door in the same seat that I was in before, I told the little girl I must go when the clock struck eight. I went to the public house and staid till ten o'clock, and Mr. Schofield was with me; when I came from there me and my husband went into Whitechapel to the Blue Boar tap, there we staid, it might be two hours, my husband and me came together into Newgate street; when I came to my lodgings Mrs. Schofield was at my lodgings, Mr. Schofield said that he had lost his watch, I told him that I did not see the watch, he sent for the officer to search me, and when the officer had searched me he told the officer to take me to the watchhouse and strip me; when he searched me, I told him he might do as he pleased. I never took a pinsworth from any body in my life, I had not been long out of the country.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

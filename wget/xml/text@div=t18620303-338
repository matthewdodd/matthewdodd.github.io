I keep the Phoenix Tavern, in Brick-lane, Spitalfields—on the evening of 6th February, I went out—previous to doing so I saw the prisoner and three or four other persons in the taproom, and I left a sixpence on the table for them—I returned about a quarter to one—I found the prisoner still in the house, and another man with him in front of the bar—I told them to go, and I fancied that they went—the prisoner bade me good night—in about twenty minutes, the witness, Mr. Thompson, came to my house, and I let him in—he took off his coat and left it in the bar-parlour—I fastened up the house—I secured the side door leading into Brick lane—about 2 o'clock I was called up by the police—I went down and found three policemen in my bar—when I went to bed I had left about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers in drawers and tills in the bar, and ten sixpenny packets of farthings in the bar parlour—when I came down I found all the drawers empty of the coppers I had left, the cupboard door forced open and the whole of the ten packets of farthings gone—I found a wax taper burning on the top of a glass—it was just expiring as I got down—about 2 lbs. of cigars was taken from a shelf where I had seen them before I went to bed—the side door was open when I came down.</p>

I am a pointsman on the Eastern Counties line, and live at Old Ford—on the morning of 6th February, about a quarter to 2, I was on the line opposite Mr. Sadler's house—there is a wall there, and I can see over it into Mr. Sadler's house, over the shutters—I happened to be looking that night and saw a man walking about the bar, with what appeared to be a wax taper burning—that was about 1.45 or 1.50, as near as I can tell—I saw him walking about the taproom, and I saw him go to the counter, pull out a drawer and take something out—I could not see what—I also saw him take two square bundles from the corner—be then went into the bar-parlour, and there I lost sight of him—at the same time I saw the prisoner against the corner of the street, outside Mr. Sadler's house, underneath a lamp-post—he went to the corner door and looked through—he whispered something—I could not hear what it was—I was then called away for a minute, and then I went to look for a policeman—when I came back the man was still in the bar—I had to go away again for about a second—I saw a policeman, and told him what I had seen, and when I returned again the policeman was inside the house—I knew the prisoner, and am not mistaken about his person.</p>

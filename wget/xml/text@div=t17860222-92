               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Had he been out that evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You looked upon him to be a perfect honest man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have entrusted him before this time with considerable property at his own house? - I have.</p>
               <p>You had never missed any thing before? - No.</p>
               <p>He, as your porter, was liable to go out of errands whenever you chose to send him? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then it was possible this man might have made purchases for himself in the course of that day? - He might.</p>

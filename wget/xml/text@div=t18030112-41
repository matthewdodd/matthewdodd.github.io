             then came across the shop to me, and I pointed out the prisoner; I saw him turn up a passage on the right hand side; we went after him, and when we got to the passage, the prisoner was concealing the hat under his coat; I immediately said, that is the man; the prisoner then took it from under his arm, the man took hold of it, and said, it was his master's property. We then took the prisoner back to the shop, and sent for a constable, and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JAMES TAPPERELL sworn. - I live with Mr. Spybey, Broad-street, Bloomsbury: I received information from Newton, in consequence of which I went up a passage about six doors from our shop, and found the prisoner with a hat under his coat, he was standing making water, he had a great coat on; I took the hat from him, and brought him back to the shop; he said, a man had given him two shillings to hold it; Mr. Spybey then gave charge of him. This is the hat.</p>

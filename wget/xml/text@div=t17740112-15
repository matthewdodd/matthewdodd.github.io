I lay at the Rose in Cursitor-street that night; the next day (Friday) my wife came over with the money; I looked over the notes and money and saw they were right, and put them into a chest of drawers in my bed chamber. On Monday evening, the 20th of December, my wife and I went to the play; before we went to the play, at about four o'clock, my wife desired me to unlock the chest of drawers and see that every thing was safe; I did, and saw all was safe; I locked the drawers and the chamber door. When we came home my wife went up stairs; I heard her cry out; I went up to her; she said we are ruined! we are robbed! the chest of drawers was left open, and there was a new key left in it. (A bank note of 200 l. shewn the witness.) I believe this is one of the notes I lost; to the best of my knowledge this is the mark I observed upon it before; when I went to Mr. Hoare's I described it by that mark before I saw it; I did not look at the number of either of the notes. I suspected the prisoner from what had passed at the Eight Bells. I went to Old-street next morning; when I returned home I found Mr. Johnson had been at my house, and left a message desiring me to meet him at the

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the play who did you have in your house ?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Two plumbers were working in the front of the house; there were two carpenters in the front room, and a man and woman in the kitchen, who were not servants to me, but were people that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The rose is a common through-fare from Cursitor-street into White's-alley ?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes; there are many cribby islands about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which hand is the stair-case on as you go into White's-alley ?</p>
               <p>Corfield. On the right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is this room?</p>
               <p>Corfield. The one pair of stairs back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication with the fore room?</p>
               <p>Corfield. That floor has the bed room and the dining room; there is a partition with a wainscot and two bolts to take down occasionally to lay it into one room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come out at the door of the bed room do you go directly upon the landing place?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes; the dining room door opens upon the same landing place as you come up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had at this time four men at work in the dining room?</p>
               <p>Corfield. No, that was below stairs; there was nobody above.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body might go up stairs coming from White's-alley?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes, but from Cursitor-street they could not. I have got a partition put up now, agreeable to the old proverb,</p>
               <p>"after the horse is stolen shut the stable door."</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it you left at the Rose?</p>
               <p>Corfield. A man that used to lodge at my old house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any hand bills published?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes, two thousand that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What description did you give of your notes?</p>
               <p>Corfield. A fifty, a forty, a hundred, and a two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not able to specify the description of the notes?</p>
               <p>Corfield. No.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Corfield. I am the prosecutor's wife. I brought in my pocket the bank notes that we received at the Eight Bells; I put them in a drawer in the one-pair-of-stairs back room at the Rose in Cursitor-street, the same room we put our plate in.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went to some place of public entertainment?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes; the agreement was made on the Thursday before, at the Eight Bells, in the presence of the prisoner. I saw the notes and money were safe about four in the afternoon; when we returned from the play they were gone.</p>

               <p>Duphin. Out doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you can say is, you brought in no other two hundred pound note, but what was brought in by other clerks you cannot say. I suppose there are vast sums of money brought in that you know nothing at all of?</p>
               <p>Duphin. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Larchin. I am a cashier of the Bank: this note is my hand writing.</p>

               <p>Beamont. Yes; I asked him where he got the note that Mrs. Johnson changed for him, and whether he could produce the person he received it from; he said he received it of a soap boiler,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120014"></xptr> at the Two Blue Posts in Duke's-street, St. James's; that he had breakfasted there that morning. There was such a house there two years ago, but it is shut up now. Afterwards, before the magistrate, he said he received it at a soap boiler's at Deptford.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross examination, he said, the prisoner said he received the note of a soap boiler that lived at Deptford.)</p>
               <p>- Smith. I live at the Ship the corner of Stones End, Blackman's street. I have known the prisoner about six months; I saw him Friday morning, St. Thomas's day; he came into my house between six and seven in the morning, and said he was cold and wet; he sat down at the fire in my tap room, and went to sleep; he came again on St. Thomas's day, in the afternoon; he went into my middle kitchen; he sat down and called for a pint of beer; then he called for me, and asked me to sit down; he asked me to drink: there was his brother with him; he asked me what he owed me; I said nine shillings and eight pence halfpenny; he bid me-sit down and he would pay me; he took out some silver and paid me. After that he said don't think I want money, Smith; I have got money enough; he pulled out a blue or red and white check handkerchief, with a quantity of guineas in it; I said this is very fine money; he said, aye, it is; by G - d, Smith, said he, I have been three years getting this money, but I insisted upon having it; I went to the gentleman and told him I would so and so if I had not my money, and so I got it now; had I got it in the King's Bench it would have done me some service, but it will do me none now; I said they are pretty things to play with. After that he pulled out a Bank note; I do not know for what sum, I only saw the back of it. He was going to put up the guineas; I said I have got a son-in-law has not seen so many guineas a good while; I called him, and said, did you ever see so pretty a fight before? he said, they are pretty chuckers: Currin said he had three in his pocket he could not make go; I said I would be bound they would go; I said I fancy there are a hundred of them; he said, yes, just.</p>
               <p>Q. A hundred what?</p>
               <p>Smith. A hundred guineas. Looking on one of the Bank notes, I said, I fancy that is a forty pound; he said it is; he put them up, and I left the room. He staid three hours after, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the guineas new or old?</p>
               <p>Smith. New.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Court to the prosecutor. You said you don't know the number of the Bank note?</p>
               <p>Corfield. I know it by a mark on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know to whom it was made payable?</p>
               <p>Corfield. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recollect that mark upon the back of it?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always carry in your memory that there was that mark?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have omitted that out of your description in your hand bill?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to omit the only circumstance you knew it by?</p>
               <p>Corfield. I did not think that would be of any service in the hand bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have recollected that on the back of the note if you had not seen it?</p>
               <p>Corfield. Before I saw the note I described the mark to Mr. Hoare.</p>
               <p>The note was read, and corresponded exactly as set forth in the indictment at large.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I was concerned between four and five months ago for a man who kept a soap manufactory at Deptford. The same defence I make now, is the same I made when taken, and offered before the Justice. Upon the non-payment of duties he went out of the way, and a process, as I have been informed, issued against him for taking him; his goods were sold by the officers of excise. He thought to have the fine mitigated, and employed friends to purchase the goods, because they sold to great disadvantage, to take them off the premises. Several applications were made to withdraw the fine, to no purpose; he proposed then to let this manufactory, and employed me to let it. When I came to treat with people that came to me concerning it, they could not enter the premises if they made the purchase, by reason the entry was made in his name in the Excise Office, and without that entry being withdrawn, could do nothing on the premises, and he not being able to attend personally to do that, an entry was made in another person's name; I made an affidavit before the present mayor at the Mansion-house, and this man went and withdrew it. About the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120015"></xptr> 13th of December last I was recommended to one Robinson; he viewed the premises, and came to an agreement to enter them between that time and last Christmas-day, on the forfeiture of five guineas: the condition money was one hundred and twenty pounds; a bill of sale was prepared, and executed. On Monday the 20th of December, Mr. Robinson called upon me to go to view the premises, and make his entry, the other entry being withdrawn by a letter of attorney; he went down to make an entry in the Excise Office, on the 20th of December last; my client went along with him, as I have been informed, and it will be proved by the excise officer that is here now; accordingly they returned; my clerk told me that Mr. Robinson had made his entry, had come to town, and would wait upon me that evening; that he would pay the money and take up the agreement, then in my hands. Mr. Robinson and Mr. Atkinson came to me between - I will not be positive to the time, pretty nigh to eleven o'clock I reckon; and Mr. Atkinson told me Mr. Robinson called upon him, had made his entries, and was coming to pay him, the money; he tendered me a two hundred pound Bank note, in order for me to take ten pound out of it: I was to have commission because I had a good deal of trouble on the business, as well to endeavour to withdraw the penalty as making this sale. I told him there was no getting cash at that time, it was so late, and advised him to call in the morning. I was very willing to get paid the ten pound because I wanted it. After some hesitation, they said they would call again, and accordingly took up the Bank note and went out, and returned soon again; I do not suppose they went outside the lower door; they came up, and said they were going a-cross the fields, and it would be necessary for me to keep the note for fear of any danger; I said you may use your own pleasure; Atkinson said it is not all mine, one hundred and twenty pounds of it is Mr. Robinson's, I had the note of him; I said I will give you an undertaking for the note; he said there was no necessity; they left the note, and appointed to call in the morning, and they called in the morning before it was time to get a note of that amount broke or changed; I said if you will wait till I have breakfasted, I will go out and endeavour to do it in the neighbourhood; Mr. Robinson said he had his horses coming to town, and desired me to do nothing with the note till he came to town on the morrow; he said he had to meet a friend at the Globe Tavern in the Strand, and would meet me there; he fixed the hour, betwixt four and five in the evening. I owed Mrs.

            , but I believe the property of the note was in Mr. Robinson; Mr. Lucas attended for me at the Justices, and set up that defence at that time; Mr. Currin says I was in the house when the notes were paid; true, I was; but I do not know what the sum was that was paid; I made an assignment of the lease; I was in his business as an attorney, and was present at the execution of this writing; I came home to his appointment on Wednesday evening; I went to the Globe Tavern, there I met Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Robinson; I told them what I had done; they wanted change for twenty five pound; their cook, Mr. Chaffley, keeps a public house, the Black Horse, at Charing-cross; I went there and paid them their money, and took what was due to myself; I did this in a public manner; my clerk is here, he will prove I did take this note of Mr. Atkinson; it would be rather hard for me to ask my client where he got it, that might hurt me; I have set up no other defence at the beginning; there is great danger if a man shall see another receive money for him to be called in question because he was there on such an occasion, if he should miss or lose his money; there has been a great deal in the news-papers, a vast deal, in order to abuse the public; I hope the gentlemen will take no notice of that, but will take the matter as it is given; I rest it with the Gentlemen of the Jury and your Lordship, and we shall call some witnesses.</p>

That on the 13th of December Atkinson and Robinson entered into an agreement for the soap house; that the witness went with Robinson to the Excise-office on the 20th of December, and made an entry of the soap house; that he parted with Robinson in the evening, and he bid the witness tell the prisoner that he was going to get the purchase money, and desired he would be at home; in consequence of which, Currin did stay at home all that evening; that Atkinson and Robinson came that evening, and he heard Atkinson tell the prisoner that Robinson had paid him a note of two hundred pound, and said if you (Currin) can break it, I will pay you, and delivered the note to the prisoner; that the prisoner gave it him back again; that then Atkinson said we may as well give it to Mr. Currin, and take an acknowledgement for the receipt, as we are going to cross the fields; that then the prisoner took the note and gave an acknowledgement for it, and that then they went away; that they called the next morning, but it was too early to change the note, but as Robinson was going to Barnett, and could not stay, he desired the prisoner and Atkinson to meet him at the Globe, in the Strand, on the next day (Wednesday) between four and five o'clock. On his cross examination he twice repeated that he saw Currin write an acknowledgement for the two hundred pound Bank note, and that he heard him read it and give it to Atkinson, who looked at it, and put it in his pocket.</p>

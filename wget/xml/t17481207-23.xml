               <p>Neal. The Prisoner at the bar, is one that clap'd a pistol to my breast; it was a moon light night, and he being so near me, I am sure he is the man; he was carried to the White-bear in Hounslow, where I saw him.</p>

            . I am the Gloucester waggoner; as I was going over Smallberry-green coming to London, having some disbanded marines in the waggon, I got on horse-back from out of the waggon, having heard there were thieves on the road; one of the marines lent me a good long hanger; this was about eight o'clock the 19th of November: I called at the great house on Smallberry-green, the gentleman told me, there had been a robbery committed about a quarter of an hour before; he would have had me lain there, but I was for coming on; I took the hanger in my hand drawn, and kept riding along, three men came riding by me a full speed; I said, they are the three men that robbed the man on the Green, the prisoner turned about and flash'd a pistol at me, but it did not go off; he turned short about as I was following him, and I took a chop at him immediately, and cut his left arm, the mark is visible enough.</p>

I having nothing bu t my whip in my hand could not: the other two men were before, my master got in between and turn'd the Prisoner back again; I went behind the waggon, and laid hold of his horse's bridle, after my master had cut him: the Prisoner put his left hand into his pocket, and pull'd out a pistol, and swore, if I did not loose his horse he would blow my brains out.</p>

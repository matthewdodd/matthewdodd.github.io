I packed up five boxes to go by the Newcastle waggon, part of the boxes were raw silk; they were sent to the inn on the 30th of November, directed to Brown, Burn, and Company, at Paisley . On the 1st of December the book-keeper came and acquainted me that the waggon had been robbed, and one of the boxes was gone. He desired me to attend him to Bow-street, for they had there two men and a woman in custody, with a quantity of silk. I went to Bow-street, and saw the silk but could not swear to it.

I hardly ever deliver silk for Scotland, but on the Monday; they do not like to have it in till they want to pack it for the waggon. It is morally impossible to swear to silk after it is gone out of my hands, unless it has my private mark upon it. I went with Mr. Stocker to the Brown Bear, opposite to Sir

I showed the officers the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090071"></xptr> mark that should be upon the silk, if it was what I dyed for Mr. Hewitt before I looked at it. I tie a particular kind of knot to distinguish one man's silk from another, and as far as any private mark will identify any property, I can swear that is Mr. Hewitt's.</p>
               <p>You found two of these marks on that quantity of silk. How many ought there to have been? - I do not know that it ought to have more; we seldom put more than two marks, if it is 70 lb. weight; we divide certain quantities into certain parcels; we seldom put less than 30 lb. in a parcel, sometimes five, six, or seven and thirty; we put a mark upon each; therefore, I apprehend, this could have but two marks upon it. We often boil forty men's silk together; we have a different mark for every man's silk. This mark has been Mr. Hewitt's as long as I have been in this way, which is ten years and upwards.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Kingsland-road. Last Monday was se'nnight, between eight and nine at night, I saw the two prisoners and another man following the Newcastle waggon. They were at the distance of about four lamps from the waggon. I had some suspicion of them; the porter went out of London a little way with the waggon, and was driving it for the waggoner; when he returned, I told him of these men following the waggon. On Tuesday morning the waggoner came to me, and told me his waggon had been robbed, and he asked me to show him where these people lived.</p>
               <p>You knew the men, did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to them that night? - Yes; I bid them good night, and Cooper, the young man, bid me good night. I went with the waggoner to their house in Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Whose house is it? - I do not know who owns the house.</p>
               <p>Who did you find in the house? - The two prisoners and another man who got away from us. When we came into the house, the men sent me back to the room they had moved from to this place, and they went up into the room and found the goods. I met one of them going up stairs, and laid hold of him by the collar.</p>
               <p>You was not present when the waggoner got into the room? - No. I had been to another house, and was come back. I secured Cooper on the stairs; my partner had before secured Lewington. We took him to the White Hart; then we went back and searched the room, and found two bags of silk. We did not open the bags till we came to Sir

The maid came out for some water;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090072"></xptr> we followed her in; we went up stairs. When I entered the room I found Lewington asleep, with his head on the table. There was a woman there; I said to her, is this your husband. I then turned round, and saw a trunk, the lock of which was taken off. The porter opened the trunk, and said, that was some of the property. I opened a door into another room, and saw Cooper and Woodey both asleep with their clothes on; Woodey was on the bed, and Cooper on the ground, with some of the property under him; Lewington rose up, and I caught fast hold of him. Woody got up. I desired my partner not to let him get out, but he made a push by him, and got away. The watchman returned, and took Cooper as he was going down stairs. I sent for a constable, and secured them; then we searched the room, and found two bags of silk and other things that will come out in the next indictment. I can swear to the bags. They have never been out of my custody.</p>

I got up, and was going gently down stairs, and the watchman stopped me, and said I had robbed the waggon, that is all I know of the affair.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the waggoner of the Newcastle waggon. When I came to Hertford I found the ropes cut, and the sheet rent down for about a foot long, and I missed three boxes out of the waggon. This was about seven o'clock on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Was there anybody in your waggon that night? - Only an old gentlewoman that went passenger from the inn; she was in the waggon all night. The three boxes were in the middle of the waggon.</p>
               <p>What was the weight of the boxes? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Joblin. The box that contained the silk, weighed one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>To Read. Could anybody take this box of one hundred pounds weight out of the waggon without getting into it? - Yes; they might pull it out at the side.</p>
               <p>Where abouts was the gentlewoman? - In the tail of the waggon. There were a great many goods between her and the boxes. They might very easily be taken out without her seeing it. I was by the side of the horses all the night, sometimes walking, sometimes riding the hobby. The ropes were cut on the off side. It was light the beginning of the night, and dark the latter end of it. When I got about two miles out of town I saw three men; they did not come near enough for me to see who they were. They followed the waggon till I got to Ponder's End, that is, about eight miles from London. I kept my eye on them as far as I could.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you stop any where to drink? - I drank a pint of beer at the ship at Tottenham. I did not stay a minute.</p>
               <p>(Cooper called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>
               <p>(Lewington did not say any thing in his defence.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Garden-row, London-road, Southwark. I am assistant store-keeper to the Gas Company—I have always understood it to be the Chartered Gas Company—their works are in Horseferry-road—we have an act to authorize the company to sue and to be sued in this name—the prisoner was in their service as a gas-fitter—I missed some brass cocks out of the store-room under my charge, and I had the remainder counted, but I did not count them myself—they were lost from a room to which the pri<lb></lb>soner had access, to get meters—he applied to me on the 12th of Jan. for meter, and I allowed him to go into the store-room for it—upon his coming out I caused the cocks to be counted, and supposing that they were correctly counted, I missed two—I called him, and told him I missed two, and he said he had not got them—the warehouseman asked if he had got them about him—the prisoner said, "No"—it was proposed to search him, and I sent for policeman—before he had time to arrive, the prisoner pulled two brass cocks from his coat-pocket, and put them on a shelf—he said he did not know what induced him to take them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the City Arms, Deptford. On 12th Feb., about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came—he recognised two young men, and asked them to drink—he called for some rum, and paid with a good sixpence—he then called for a glass of rum-and-water—I served him, and he put down a counterfeit shilling—I said it was bad, and he gave me a sixpence—one of the young men took up the shilling, bent it, and said, "This is a bad one"—the prisoner said, "Perhaps you will say these are bad ones" pulling several shillings out of his pocket—he said he took them in change for a sovereign—he had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>

I was on duty near this public-house—I heard something, and watched—I saw the prisoner in the public-house—he had a bent shilling in his hand, and was trying to flatten it on the counter at the bar—he then put it in his pocket, and came out of the house with two lads—a female joined him a short distance from the house, and they all went on towards the Broadway—I and another officer followed them—they stopped at the Broadway—while they were standing, the prisoner put his hand in his trowsers pocket, and was in the act of drawing something out—the other officer seized him, and kept his hand closed till he got him to the station—I took the female—I had heard the prisoner say in the public-house that he had got change for a sovereign, and I asked him where he got it—he would not give me any answer, but abused me—I saw his hand opened, and six base shillings, and five good sixpences were in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a bookseller's shop, at No. 48, Ratcliff-highway. In consequence of information, I ran out on the 25th of January, and about forty yards off saw the prisoner—I asked her where she got the book she had—she said she picked it up—I told her she must go back with me, and I gave her in charge—I had missed eight books—I said, "What are you going to do with these books?"—she said, "I have but two," and I found this one on her—it had been in my window—my lad saw it safe in the morning—when I brought her back she begged me to forgive her, and said it was her first offence.</p>

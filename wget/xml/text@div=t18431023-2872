                  </hi>. I live in New Gravel-lane. I was at the White Swan, High-street, Shadwell, on the 12th of Oct., about eight o'clock—I am an unfortunate girl—I had three sovereigns and half-a-crown in my hand—the prisoner was there, and asked me for a quartern of gin—I said I did not mind—as I was going to pay for it be grasped my hand, and would not let it go till he got the sovereign out—he tried to get the whole, but only got two of my fingers open—my hand was black and blue—I was not in any fear—I said, "You have got my sovereign"—he said, "Yes, it is in my mouth, will you have it?"—I said, "Yes, or I will fetch a policeman," but he would not give it me—I went for a policeman, and he was taken—it was not found on him—I swear he took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the prosecutrix, and saw the prisoner strug<lb></lb>gling with her—when he let her hand go I saw the sovereign in his mouth—she begged him to give it her for four minutes—I saw him put his hand to his mouth, and then down under the table to one of his shipmates, and while I went for a policeman that man went away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutrix came and spoke to us; then went up the room to a young man for three quarters of an hour; then came and offered me a quartern of gin. She said, "Make believe you are going to give me the money to pay for it." I took hold of her hand; she said, "Let go of my hand." I said, "Let me see what you have, and I will." I let go, and she said I had taken a sovereign, and it was in my mouth. I said it was a lie.</p>

The prisoner with another woman on Monday, about five o'clock in the afternoon, came into my master's shop and asked to see some silk handkerchiefs which lay in the window; she asked the price, I told her; she said she wanted better. I then went to the farther end of the shop and brought all we had got, as they laid together in a frame; I showed them to her; she fixed on one piece and asked the price. I told her five shillings and sixpence an handkerchief; she bid four shillings. In a few minutes after that I saw her take a piece containing eight handkerchiefs off the counter with her left hand; she said she would give but four shillings and she went out of the shop. I followed her and took the piece of eight handkerchiefs from her; it was concealed under her cloak. I brought her back to the shop; then she said she was very sorry for what she had done and begged pardon, she said she had never done any thing of the sort before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say if I would tell you of the other woman you would let me go? - I did not; I went out for the constable; Mr. Smith was left in the shop with her.</p>

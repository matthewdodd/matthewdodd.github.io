            . I was housekeeper to Lady Doddington Montague, in Grosvenor-square; the prisoner was a servant there. About the latter end of September, or the beginning of October, the cook called me up stairs, and shewed me the goods mentioned in the indictment; they were found in the prisoner's possession in his box in his room: she desired I would not tell the prisoner how I came to see them, but desired I would talk to him when he came in: when he came in I asked him if he had any acquaintance in that branch of business; he said he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lie in that room beside the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Ripley. No: I told him there had been a person to enquire if I had seen such sort of things, and I had searched his room and saw such things, and desired he would give me an account how he came by them: he told me part of them he had taken from out of a house where he had lived, and part of them were given him by another man, named John.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention what house?</p>
               <p>A. Ripley. No, he did not; upon that I told him they were very bad things to be seen on such a person, and in time he might come into trouble. I bid him carry them back again the next morning, for I would not suffer stolen goods to be in the house: I thought he had taken them away, he told me afterwards that he had: I did not know that he had them by him, till the day he was taken up: my lady's cook came and said he had behaved in a very bad manner, and used me very ill to my lady; and that he had charged the servants, on the peril of their lives, never to let me see my lady, if he was gone out, (I had married and was gone away). I asked her if she knew any thing of the things that we had seen before; she said they were in the house: upon that I went to my lady's house, and the prisoner opened the door to me: I asked to see my lady; he said I could not see her: I said, I should insist upon seeing her: he went in and told my lady I was there. I went in to her, she was angry with me: I said, if I had deceived her in any thing it was concerning the prisoner, and I was there to answer for what accusations might be laid against me: we had a great deal of debate. I told her what things I had seen upon him, and that I believed they were still in the house; the house was searched, and they could not be found. My lady bid me go down with the servant; I went: I observed him with a bundle, which he was taking out of a closet: I took the bundle out of his hand; there were the things that were mentioned in the indictment, with other things: I carried them up stairs, and shewed them to my lady; my husband was with me. My lady ordered him to fetch a constable, and take the prisoner up. We gave charge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170041"></xptr> of him to the constable, and the goods were delivered into his care, we went all together to Sir

             . On the second of July the prisoner came to my house, and told me that there were two gentlemen wanted some Allopeans and Grograms, and some silk stockings; and accordingly I took three pieces of Allopeans and Grograms, two pair of black silk stockings, and two pair of white cotton stockings , and the prisoner was very desirous for me to let him carry the goods, but I did not think proper to let him carry them, but I would carry them, and we went away together .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the gentlemen?</p>
               <p>Wilkins . Yes, and as we were going along, the prisoner said he would carry one piece and the yard, for it looked something like a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him carry one piece?</p>
               <p>Wilkins . He took hold of it, and I did not resist him; he would not go through the Mall, but he would go by Buckingham-house, and when we came to St. James's kitchin door, I put the Allo peans and Grograms down, and the prisoner took the stockings out of my hand and run away with them; I have no other witness, it was in a private place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This person, who says I took the stockings from him at St. James's kitchin door , says wrong; I would ask him whether he would swear I took the stockings from him, or whether he did not give them into my hand?</p>
               <p>Wilkins . He took them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman is a pawnbroker, and he told me he wanted to dispose of some grograms and stockings, and other things; I told him I knew some Gentleman that I believed wanted some; and when we came to St. James's kitchin door I agreed for a guinea for the two pair of black silk stockings, and 3 s. and 3 d. a pair for the white , and I carried them to the gentlemen; and I being gone a pretty while, he was gone before I returned .</p>
               <p>Wilkins . I staid there three hours, my lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . He did not stay three quarters of any hour; I desire to know whether in that narrow place I could have got away, if he had but called or lifted up his finger?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. I went after him as fast as I could go, and the first person I saw was a centry, and I asked him whether he did not see a man with a lightish coloured coat and a light wig, and he said he was just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120015"></xptr> run by, and run away ready to break his neck; while I was taking up my allopeans, he was gone.</p>

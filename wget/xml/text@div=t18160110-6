            . I am a shepherd to the Rev. Mr. Heale. I missed these sheep on the 8th, and had seen them safe on the 2nd; I missed six sheep that were marked with S H on their right side, and a heart on the hip. They were taken out of the flock, which consisted of two hundred and seventyfour. I have seen one at Hasefield, at Mr. Ivers's, in Middlesex, it was one of the six I am sure; the marks were remaining on it, and I knew it besides, by the nature of the sheep.</p>
               <p>MR. IVERS. I am a farmer, at Hasefield. In the early part of October, the prisoner came to me, it was either on a Monday, or a Tuesday; I don't specify which; he brought six sheep, and he requested me to let him put them into my fields until the Thursday, when he was going to take them to market. Four were taken on the Wednesday; but I don't know by whom, one is dead, and the other is in my possession now. Mr. Heale saw the sheep that is living yesterday; he came with his steward, and my man shewed it to him. I had no sheep marked like them; mine were all marked with a single P.</p>

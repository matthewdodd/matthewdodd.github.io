               <p>No such thing had happened to your sister? - No, my Lord, but I was rather frightened, and was glad to say anything to get away from them, but they were very civil.</p>

             came up to my assistance; the young man with sore eyes said, he would not come on; Mr. Barlow hit him over the head with a stick; Mr. Barlow searched them both, he found nothing on them but a ram-rod and a knife, they had no arms at all; as I was riding by them, I judged they had dropped something, I did not actually see them; there was a horse pistol found, and in about fifteen minutes the prosecutor came up, it was all done in less than half an hour, we took them to the alehouse, and afterwards to Justice Lamb's; the prosecutor came and said they were the two men that robbed him.</p>

               <p>Were they searched again before the Justice? - The Justice would not have anything to do with them, he delivered them up to the Shepherd's-bush patrol, belonging to Sir Sampson Wright, who searched them, and found nothing upon them; I said I believed I could find every thing in the field, and I took a stick out of one of their hands and stuck it up at the place they were taken from, and I looked in the field; I went from the stick by my horse's tracks, by his foot tracks, it was high grass, and I judged I should find something, and the first thing that I picked up was some shot and some powder, that was about fifteen yards from the place where I took them; the next thing I found was this cutlass, and the gentleman brought the sheath, and said it answered the description.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found the sheath, in the road where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Towne. The next thing that I saw was a farmer's man pick up this pistol, it was charged, and he let it off, but what with I do not know, it made a great report, it was primed; going a little way further I saw a little girl pick up this watch close to me, this was all within fifty yards.</p>

I did not recollect the number or the maker's name, nor do I now recollect the number, though I have looked at it several times; it has all the appearance of being mine, I have had it ever since the year 1767; I have not the smallest doubt but it is mine; I believe it to be gold, I was told so, but I cannot swear it is; I remember the two first figures of the number, which are one and three; I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140097"></xptr> not remember the rest, and there is the name of Gordon on the inside.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council, to Towne. The prisoners did not attempt to get away? - No.</p>
               <p>Is not this the shooting season? - There are partridges about you? - I do not know, I never carry a gun out.</p>
               <p>There is a good deal of powder and shot in that part of the country? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It is common small shot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Browning. On which of us was the ramrod found? - On Winderbank, but there is no place for the ramrod in the pistol.</p>

               <p>I joined in the pursuit of the prisoners, and after they were stopped, we found the things in the same field, within the course of forty yards, we observed a part of the field that the prisoners had gone on by the track of Mr. Towne's horse, I was within two yards of the track, my horse made a fault, and fell down into a gravel pit, so I was not up so soon as Towne, but I saw the things found; I did not see the watch picked up, I searched that man, and took a knife and key from Browning, and the other, Winderbank, had a ramrod, the prosecutor immediately said that is the man that held the pistol to my horse's head, that was Winderbank; and that is the man that stood with the cutlass, and took my watch, that was Browning, and the gentleman said that Winderbank would have given him his watch back, but Browning said he would blow his brains out; I am sure of their persons.</p>
               <p>Towne. I cannot recollect positively which it was he said stood at the horse's head, but I think he said the shortest, Browning, and the other took his money; my recollection in that circumstance differs from Barlow's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hugh M'Intosh—he is contractor for the Great Western Railway, and is executing a part near Han well—Addison was his carter—Mr. M'Intosh finds food for his horses. On Saturday, the 24th of March, from information I received, I went to his stable at Drayton-green, and ascertained what horse provender Addition had taken out with him that morning—I then went after him to Ealine I found him about seven o'clock in the morning, and asked him where the chaff was that he had taken out from the stable—he said it wag in the nose-bag—I asked where the sack was that he had taken out three quarter full—(I put that question from information I had got)—he told me he had got none but what was in the nose-bag, and denied taking any other out—I then took him out of the cart, and he voluntarily admitted to me he had left a sack with Tom, the ostler, at the Coach and Horses—this was cart of bricks he was loading—in consequence of what Addison said I went to the Coach and Horses, at Ealing—I saw Smith sweeping the front of the house—he is, I believe, under-ostler—I took a policeman and Addison with me—I asked Smith what he had done with the sack of chaf corn and beans that Addison left with him—Smith, at first, denied having seen Addison, or the corn, or sack either—I gave him into custoday he then said he had found the sack down in the shed—I looked under the manger of the stable, and found the sack produced, about three quarter foil with chaff, corn, and beans—I know it to be the same sort of sack we have for our oats and beans—it had some grey hairs upon it, as if it had been laid across a grey horse's back—I gave them in charge—when Addi-son went out in the morning, he had no business at the Coach and Horses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. M'Intosh. On the 24th March, Addison took some grey horses from the stable at Drayton, a little after six o'clock—they were going to work by the rail-road—be took his two nose-bags, and about three parts of a sack of mixed corn, chaff, beans and oats, on a grey horse's back—I have since seen a sack in the police man's possession—it has the same mark on it as my master's had that the took that morning, and it had the same grey hairs on it—I then went to find Addison, and took him at Ealing—he ought to have had the same sack of food he had taken in the morning, but he had not—this is the same sack as we have.</p>

I was in the neighbourhood of Ealing, in the morning of the 24th of March, at the Coach and Horses, about a quarter-past six o'clock, and saw both the prisoner drinking together, in front of the house—I went on and saw Mr. M'Innis—I communicated some suspicions to him—there were two grey house with Addison—they had nose-bags, hitched on to the harness, and no cart—about an hour after that, Mr. M'Innis returned to the station-house Addison and he gave me an account of what he had done with it—from what he said, I went to the Coach and Horses, with Mr. M'Innis, and Smith—I asked what he had done with the sack—he said he had chucked it down, and he did not know where it was—I went in, but could not find it—we then came out, and asked Mr. M'Innis to go and look under the manger—he went and found it—I knew Smith nearly twelve months he has been ostler all that time.</p>

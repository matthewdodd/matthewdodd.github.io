                  </hi>. I am one of the Walthamstow police—I have been sworn in as constable of that parish. On Saturday night, the 28th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was on duty with Lawrence—when I came to Marsh-street I heard a disturbance from a fight—I went to the spot and saw a great many people, and one man lying by the side of the fence as if he had been knocked down—I then persuaded them to go home—I saw Frederick Hagger—he opened his waistcoat and asked if I wanted anything—I said no, only for him to go home—I turned and told the other persons to go home—I turned again and saw Frederick Hagger had got Lawrence down on the ground, and was striking him with a stick—I went to his assistance, and Frederick Hagger struck me on the head with a stick which he took from Lawrence—he knocked me down—William Hagger then came and struck me with a stick which he took out of my hand—as I was getting up William Hagger struck me again—I tried to escape and got in a baker's yard, and they both struck me—William Hagger said, "You made me pay 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and now I will make you pay for it"—I called for assistance—Mr. Lilly came—I was assisted to my house, and so was Lawrence—a surgeon attended me for above a fortnight—I bled very much that night, and felt very weak from the effects of the blows.</p>

I know the prisoners, and they know me—on the 28th of September I was on duty near the Coach and Horses, Marsh-street—I found a great quantity of disorderly people, who appeared to be drunk, fighting and quarrelling—I saw the prisoners there—they appeared as if they had been fighting—there was a man</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tallow-chandler, and live at Walthamstow. On the 28th of September as I was going to bed I heard a noise in the street, and thought I heard a cry of murder—I opened my window, and beard the cry repeated—I went into the street and saw a great number of people, about twenty, a great many of them using violent language—I saw Frederick Hagger beating Lawrence on his head on the ground with a think walking-stick, and kicking him, and William Hagger was beating Reynolds, who was retreating from the mob to avoid the blow—he bad his cutlass up, but did not use it—I saw Frederick Hagger come to assist his brother, who was beating Reynolds—they both beat him violently—Reynolds got over a little fence, and I went to his assistance—Reynolds's wife was clinging round William Hagger, begging him not to murder her hus<lb></lb>band—Reynolds got out of the yard, and they struck him again—I ran up and pot my hand on William Hagger—I said, "For God's sake, what do you mean to murder this poor man? I will not allow it"—I assisted them home, and sent to the station-house—they appeared very much hurt, and Reynolds was covered with blood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

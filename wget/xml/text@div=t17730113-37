I saw these things about eight in the evening; I missed them next morning between nine and ten; upon that I made a great noise, and a Runner of Justice Sherwood's asked me if I missed any thing; I said I did; I went to the Justice's and there I saw the prisoner; he owned he took the things by getting through a window; he got them out at the window; the door was locked; he went out soon after I had seen the things, and locked the door and took the key with him, he came back in the morning as a watchman. When I went into the room I missed the things.</p>

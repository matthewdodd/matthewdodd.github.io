                  </hi> I live in Great Barlow-street, and am a builder. The prisoner was in my employ for three or four days—I put some old timber into my back yard, in Grotto-passage—on the morning of the 17th of July I went into the yard, found it had been disturbed, and that some was gone—the prisoner had assisted me in putting some timber there the night before—I went to a house which the prisoner rents in Grafton-court, in consequence of information, and in the back-yard there saw some timber which I had missed from my premises—I sent for a constable, and pointed out some old doors and old tim<lb></lb>ber that belonged to me—I have known the prisoner many years—I had not employed him to work on this timber on his own premises.</p>

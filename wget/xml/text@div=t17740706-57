            . I am the father of the child.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is the child?</p>
               <p>Radford. About three years. On Wednesday se'ennight she came into the garret where I was at work, and complained greatly of something that was the matter with her private parts; my wife examined her, and said she did not look as usual, and that there was a wetness; the child grew worse, and discharged a great deal of matter; on the Tuesday following the child cried very much and was unable to make water; I then called the prisoner, who was my boy, and asked him if he had done any thing to the child; he said nothing; I put on my hat and told him I would take him before his betters; he then told me he put his finger up the child to the middle joint; I asked advice of a friend what to do; he advised me to take him before the alderman; I then sent for a constable, and the boy cried out, forgive, forgive; the constable asked him what he wanted to be forgiven for; he said what he had done to the child; I asked him what he did to her; he said he put his middle finger up the girl's private parts, but denied he did any thing else. On further charging him, he said he put all he had into the girl, and the way he did it was by throwing the girl upon him.</p>

            . On the fifth of this month Mrs. Radford came crying to my house, and said my child is ruined! is ruined! and begged I would go with her; I went; Mr. Radford told me his boy had owned he had had to do with the child, and he was afraid she was foul; I advised them to send for a constable; he sent for Mr. Clarke; when he came, the boy said he entered the child twice, once as he sat on the chair, and once on the bad; he said he spread her thighs open, and put his c - k into her as far as he could. I went with the child to a surgeon, and he said he thought by some means that the child was foul.</p>
               <p>- Clarke. I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the boy; I asked him what he had done; he said he had used the child very ill; I asked him which way; he said he made use of his finger first, and then he got her a-cross his lap, and put what he had into her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any promises made to the boy to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. to the father. Did you make any promises to the boy to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Radford. In the morning I said if he would tell me truth I would forgive him, but then he would not confess any more than putting his finger into the child, but afterwards when the constable came there was nothing said about forgiving him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never cautioned him by telling him you would not forgive him?</p>
               <p>Radford. No.</p>

            . I am a surgeon: I saw the girl. On Tuesday last they first brought a clout to me, which looked very indifferent; I told them I did not like to have any thing to do in these things; if they would fetch the child I told them I would examine it; when they brought the child I found there was a great laceration and inflammation; on this I at first thought the child had the venereal; I then searched the boy, but found no symptoms of it on him. I apprehend all the child's complaint arose from the laceration; I imagine it might be occasioned by his finger, as he said he put his finger up; I observed he had long nails, which might have scratched and wounded the parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a boy of his age could enter such a child as that?</p>
               <p>Oldham. No doubt of it; but the finger would have produced all that I observed: the prisoner is very small in his private parts; his finger is larger than his parts.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of October I lost the several things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) from <placeName id="t17801206-15-crimeloc79">the Coach and Horses, Belton-street, Coal-yard</placeName>

I was washing my pots in the yard; I saw the prisoner go up stairs, and come down with a bundle. I went up stairs about a quarter of an hour after and missed my things. We had lodgers in the house, so I thought she had gone up to some of the lodgers. Upon missing them I went to the first pawnbroker's, which was Mr. Mills, in Short's-gardens, there I found the hat. The prisoner was taken up at the Sun, the corner of Brownlow-street, the next morning. She was taken before the justice and there she owned she had taken the things.</p>

               <p>Were any promises or threatenings made use of to induce her to own it? - No. She took us to Little St. Andrew's-street, and Lumber-court, where we found all the rest of the things.</p>

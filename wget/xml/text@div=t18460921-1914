                  </hi>, Sen. I am a horse—dealer, and have carried on business at Greenwich many years. I have had dealings with the prisoner, but all dealings had ceased between us—I did not owe him any money in Aug. last—on the 28th of Aug. he came to me at my stable in the neighbourhood of the Horse Shoe—he saw some horses in the stable, and suggested that he could sell three of them to Mr. Wigram, for the Calcutta market—I told him he must excuse me, but I could not entrust him with them—he said, "Why?"—I said from the way he had obtained sixteen guineas from my wife during my absence in the country, and put it to his own use, and from other transactions I had had with him, I had come to the conclusion not to trust him again—he said, would I let my son William meet him at Mr. Wigram's with them the following morning at nine o'clock—he was the first that suggested that—he said, if I would do so, he would introduce the property as mine to Mr. Wig-ram, and inform him my son was authorized to sell them, and my son should receive the money—he solemnly declared he would take no advantage of the boy, if I would trust the horses with him—upon that, I next day gave them to my son to take—I should not have given him the horses if the prisoner had not made that promise to me—they were three geldings—I have never received the money for them.</p>

               <p>from Mr. Wigram—the prisoner has handed it over to Mr. Dixon, to induce him to become his bail—I did not pay Mr. Dixon the money, because I understood he had encouraged the prisoner to keep my money—I gave a bill—this is it now in your hands—when it came to maturity I did not pay it—the prisoner had not been charged on the 9th of Sept., but I had heard that he had handed over the money to Dixon—the money was paid on the 4th—the prisoner did not get Mr. Dixon to trust me—I have heard Mr. Dixon say be would not trust him—I have no doubt about owing Mr. Dixon 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, I became acquainted with him about the beginning of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. I do not know what he was particularly, I became acquainted with him at the Crispin public house in Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him often after your first acquaintance with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times do you think you saw him from the first of March to the end of June - A. A great many times, twenty times or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these several meetings what did you meet about - A. I used to go after the hours of my work up to the City of Chester, in Bunhill-row. I am a shoemaker. I saw Cope there, he in general was talking about counterfeit money; I was determined to get into his confidence as far as lay in my power. I understood that he was a finisher of counterfeit money. He told me that he finished it and disposed of it, he received the blank in a rough state, and he finished them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the time that I have been speaking of, did you ever see him with any counterfeit money - A. Yes, I have more than once; I have seen him with half a dozen sixpences and sometimes more.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310011"></xptr>Q. I believe in the month of June, about the 25th you were taken up as a deserter - A. I was, and I was put in prison; I was afterwards sent under an escort to Portsmouth; I wrote to the Secretary of State at Guildford, and at Portsmouth; I afterwards came up to town, went to Mr. Powell, and acted udder his directions.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you came to town did you see Cope again - A. I saw him on the 10th of August, at the City of Chester, Bunhill-row. On Saturday the 11th, I saw him at the Key public house, Fleet-market. I went with him from the Key, public house, to a public house in Clement's-lane. I asked him whether he had got any spangles, meaning counterfeit seven shilling pieces; he advised me not to have any, but confine myself to work with bobs and tanners.</p>

               <p>Q. What are bobs - A. Bobs are counterfeit shillings, and tanners are counterfeit sixpences. He said, he would let me have some the beginning of the week. I saw him on Tuesday, the 14th of August, at <placeName id="t18101031-6-crimeloc30">Ben Johnson's head, Westmoreland-buildings, Aldersgate-street</placeName>

I asked him if he had any thing about him and if he would let me have any thing; he said, yes, he had got a few tanners about him; he produced me six counterfeit sixpences; he said, I should have them for a shilling, I afterwards gave them to Mr. Sewell, a clerk to the Solicitor of the Mint, the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I did not hear you say what situation of life you have been in - A. I work at shoemaking, and I had been on the recruiting service, I had my pay from the regiment. When I ran sway from the regiment, I maintained myself by shoe-making, from the beginning of March, till the 25th of June, I lived upon my work. My Colonel knew where I was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive pay at that time - A. I had not settled with the regiment, I did not receive pay.</p>
               <p>Q. We heard something of your being under an escort, were you taken in custody for any offence as a deserter - A. When I was taken in custody I was at Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going to when you were under that escort - A. I was going to Portsmouth, my regiment was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any charge against that wretched man, or any body else, till after you were taken up and on your journey to Portsmouth - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote a letter to the Secretary of State, giving a great deal of patriotic information, did not you give the information in hopes of not being punished as a deserter - A. I knew my Colonel would not hurt me, what I had done I thought it my duty; I wrote to the Secretary of State about the 10th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that time you have been an active agent to assist the Solicitor of the Mint - A. I have done all that lay in my power, you may depend upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you whether that was done merely to assist the Solicitor of the Mint or to save yourself - A. To assist the Solicitor of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after you wrote that letter to the Secretary of State that you were set at liberty - A. After my writing that letter I was set at liberty, but not through that medium.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to him about some spangles, where did you learn about spangles - A. From the Warwickshire militia; he advised me to deal in bobs and tanners; I bought six tanners of the prisoner for a shilling.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 22d of August I went to Mrs. Quin's house. I went up stairs with the officer, Vickrey, Bishop, my son, and Mason; when we came to the front garret the door was shut, it was locked I believe; we, without trying it, put our feet against it, and sent it open, there was nobody in that garret; there was a chest of drawers in the garret, Vickrey took out this counterfeit shilling and sixpence, and gave them into my hands; I have had them ever since, and this sissel.</p>
               <p>Q. What is sissel - A. It is the remainder of plates from whence the blanks are cut out for shillings and sixpences. At night I was at the apprehending of Cope in Old-street-road; he was there, and a woman, and two or three men, and the landlord of the City of Chester public house in Bunhill-row; he ran away, we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310012"></xptr>apprehended him just at the end of St. Luke's lunatic-hospital; I searched Cope, he had nothing on him, but good money; I then told him I should take him to his lodgings, No. 19, Peter-street, Saffron-hill; he said he had none there; I told him I had been there and should take him there; I had left Mason there the whole day to wait. I then took him with the other officers, and Mrs. Quin said, this is Mr. Williams; I then took Mrs. Quin and the officers up stairs that she might shew us before them the room he lived in, and where we found them goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a considerable time after the man was supposed to sell the counterfeit money, was it not ten days after the man was supposed to purchase the money - A. According to the evidence it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search any part of the room - A. I searched the chest of drawers, I found a number of counterfeit shillings and sixpences, and three pieces of metal, a quantity of sissel, and a quantity of wet rags. I have no doubt the rags had been used with aquafortis, they had green stains upon them, they had been used for the purpose of colouring; I have been an officer eleven years; I have seen the same sort of rags a number of times before, they were at that time quite wet, and at that time they smelled of aquafortis. We saw a table there, one corner of the table had been very much worn away, apparently by a file; in a crevise in the middle there was something white; I took some of it out with my knife, and tasted it, I have no doubt it was cream of tartar. The cream of tartar and aquafortis, and other things, are used to produce the colour of silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier and live in the Quadrant, Regent-street. Lee lived in my service—on the 8th of June I examined my shop, having had information, and missed two sable skins—I had suspicion of Lee and told him I could charge nobody with taking them except him—I did not tell him it was of no use concealing the fact, there was no one could take them but him, and he had better tell the truth—I suspected him because he had not a good character—I said, I suspected he had taken them, but nothing else—I did not say, if he would tell me the truth I would not punish him—I said, if he would give me up the skins I would not give him in charge to the police—he took me to the prisoner Foy; I did not find any thing there—Foy and Lee went with me to a place where I saw any two sable skins—I said to Cook, (the person who had them,) in the prisoner's presence, that I had lost some skins, and they were mine—Cook gave them up and said he was sorry he had bought them—he said his fore<lb></lb>man had bought them—next day I recovered some more skins.</p>

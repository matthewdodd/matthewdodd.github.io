                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live at 1, Great Mitchell Street, St. Luke's—about 10 o'clock on the evening of 30th March, I was in Milton Street—the prisoner came up and shook hands with me—I thought at first that I knew him, and I shook hands with him freely—there were a great many persons about—in fact, there was a lodge meeting, and I am giving two pots of beer to the band which was playing in the street—the prisoner came up to me a second time, and asked me for beer—I said "Don't bother me while I am busily engaged with other parties"—he came up again—I pushed him back, and went on the step of the door of the public-house, and he came up and gave me a kick; with that I struck him on the head with my stick, and at that moment he put his hand and got my Albert chain, with a glass instead of a watch attached to it—the snatch broke the chain, and part of it stuck in my waistcoat—I value it at about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it had a coin attached to it, which had been made a present to me—the prisoner got part of the chain and ran away with it, after I struck him—a witness pursued him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live at 20, Middle Street, Cloth Fair—on the evening of 30th March I was standing at the public-house door, next to <hi rend="italic">Brother</hi> Ross—up came the prisoner, and said "Ain't you going to stand some beer?" and made a snatch at his guard<lb></lb>chain—he did not succeed in getting it the first time—he pushed <hi rend="italic">Brother</hi> Ross inside the house—he said, "What did you do that for?"—there were two of his com<lb></lb>pinions behind him—he made a second grasp, and stole something from his pocket—I did not know what it was—he passed it to one of the other men in a flannel jacket—he dropped it in the gutter—Ross said to the prisoner, "What did you do that for?"—the prisoner deliberately up with his foot and kicked him in the lower part of his person—the congregation was so great on account of the band playing, and these vagabonds hail it all their own way—the three men ran up a narrow dark passage—I pursued them—one of them tried to snatch my medal I had on my breast, but I knocked him somewhere; I don't know where—I met an officer, and said "Stop him, governor," and he did.</p>

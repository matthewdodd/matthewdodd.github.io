                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Webb, a butcher, in Newport-court, Soho. On the 12th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I drove eight sheep into the slaughter-house, which is right opposite the place I had driven them out of, in Princes-court—I locked the door, and took the key down to the shop—I went back again between five and six o'clock in the evening—the sheep were safe then—I locked the door up again—I went to the slaughter-house again between eight and nine o'clock—I found the door was half open—I had left both the doors locked between five and six, and I found one of them open between eight and nine—I got a light, and found that there were only seven sheep out of the eight—inconsequence of something that was told me, I went to the prisoner's shop, in Newport-alley, with my fellow-servant, who is my master's foreman—I heard him ask the prisoner if he had got a stray sheep that did not belong to him—he denied it, and said he had not got one—my fellow-servant asked him, "Are you sure?"—he said, "Yes, I am"—he said he had not got one there—(he came up out of the cellar when we went into the shop)—my fellow-servant said to me, "Go and fetch a constable"—the prisoner said, "For God's sake, don't fetch one; I have got the sheep here, I have got a stray sheep"—in the mean time the constable came up, and my fellow-servant said, "I shall give that man in charge, for taking a sheep"—the prisoner said, "For God's sake, let me alone; I will go and fetch Cranshaw; he knows all about it"—he was then in the alley, in front of his own shop—when my fellow-servant gave him</p>

               <p>in charge, the policeman laid hold of his arm, and he took and ran away—I ran after him, and the constable ran, and caught him in St. Martin's-lane, brought him back, and my master gave him into custody—after they came back from the office, I went down into the cellar under the prisoner's shop—I found the sheep there, and brought it up from the cellar, which the prisoner was down in when we went to his shop—it was one of the eight sheep which was the property of Mr. Webb, and was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found a piece of iron bar lying alongside the slaughter-house door, and the lock was found inside—it must have been broken open.</p>

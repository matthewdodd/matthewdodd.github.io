                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live at 240, Blackfriars-road, in the parish of Christ Church. On Thursday night, 19th August, after going to bed, I was awoke by my shop lad just before 2 o'clock—in consequence of what he told me I went to the place where he and two other boys slept—the house faces the Blackfriars-road—it is on the left hand side going from the bridge, nearly opposite Stamford-street—a stable-yard runs at the back leading to the place where the boys sleep—there are some leads, by jumping upon which you can get into the stable-yard—I went and stood at the corner of the yard until one of the inspectors arrived—it is no thoroughfare—I then went to the gate at the corner of Alfred-place, and there saw the prisoner and another running up Alfred-place towards the Blackfriars-road—they were from five to seven yards from me—I saw the prisoner, and am sure he is the man—when they saw me they ran back again—thinking they could not escape that way I remained where I was till a constable came—we then went and searched and found a ladder, or pair of steps, placed against the wall of the stable, over which they must have got away—we then examined the back premises, and found that a window-frame had been taken out, and a pans of glass was taken out of the frame—a person by getting in at that window could get into the house—I saw the policeman find a jemmy, an auger, and a piece of wood, near the fanlight of the back shop.</p>

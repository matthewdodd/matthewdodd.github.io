                  </hi>. I am a salesman in Newgate-market I took the prisoner into my employ on the 19th of December—on the 2nd of January I was taken suddenly ill, and confined to my bed for six weeks, and then went into the country—it was the prisoner's duty, in my absence, to taball the money, and pay every farthing—there was a book called the sale-book—it was his duty to sum up all the items of the pages of the sale-book and to transfer the amount into the cash-book—on my return from the country I found they were deficient—I asked him to give me an account, but he gave me none—I have since looked for the cash-book, and can<lb></lb>not find it anywhere—I discharged him, in consequence of detection these sums in the indictment, and asked him to explain them—he could not—I sent for an officer—then he said he would explain it to me—that he had spent the money in gay company—here is the cash-book of the date previous to the one that was missing—I showed him the deficiencies in the sale-book—on the 4th of March I find he debits himself with 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have summed up the items, and find it ought to be 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is a deficiency of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 9th of March there is 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; at the bottom—I have summed up the items, and it ought to be 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; —ttal is a deficiency of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 11th of March he makes 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that should be 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deficient—I did not call his at<lb></lb>tention to these three—I did not find it out till he had left me—I charged him with taking money previous to all this—it was before he said he had spent the money in gay company that I discovered these three deficiencies—my brother's clerk, Joseph Boyd; summed up the books in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Ebenezer Howard.

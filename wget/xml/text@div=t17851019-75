               <p>Did the others assist him? - Yes, they put a handkerchief upon my mouth; but I was so frightened I could not call out, I expected to be murdered, they were not half a minute, they riffled my pockets and then ran away; I got up and went to my lodgings, I rung at the wrong door of my lodgings, and a man came and set me right.</p>
               <p>How did you know the prisoner? - I was drinking with him the day before, I had been walking about and called in at this house, and dropped into conversation with this man.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when he first laid hold of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was one of the men that did absolutely rob you? - He is the man that caught hold of me.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in company with him on the Sunday? - I suppose two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him at all on the Monday? - He shewed me to my lodgings on Sunday night, and I treated him with some beer at my lodgings, and he said, if you will come down to the same place to-morrow evening, I will spend a shilling with you, you seem to be a jovial companion, and such like as that.</p>
               <p>Did you go out the next evening? - Yes, and I found him at the public house, with his head asleep on the table; I did not see him at first, and I says to the people of the house where is my old friend, and they said that is him laid asleep on the table; so I roused him up.</p>
               <p>What time of the evening was that? - I suppose it was ten, I cannot say to half an hour; I said to him, you promised to treat me with a shilling to-night, come where is your treat; oh! says he, if you are that sort of a man, I will have no concern with you, so he got off into another seat; I do not recollect anything else passing that night at the public house, I was not in company with anybody particularly, those that were in company were strangers to me; and he got up from the table we sat at, and went to another.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I never saw two faces but what there was some difference in them, but I am sure he is the man, it was moonlight.</p>
               <p>Any other light than the moon-light? - There were lamps in the street, there was not much lamp-light, there were a few lamps.</p>
               <p>Was it by the moon-light, or by the lamp-light that you saw him? - I suppose it was by both, there was a lamp nigh.</p>
               <p>When you saw it was the man that you had been so well acquainted with, did not you say something to him? - No.</p>
               <p>How came that? - I was down so quick.</p>
               <p>Why did not you ask your old friend what he wanted with you? - The street is not further across than from me to you.</p>
               <p>What did you loose? - Seven golden guineas and two silver cased watches.</p>
               <p>How came you to have two watches? - One was my own, and the other was one I had of a person that lives in Montgomeryshire, and I lent him a little money upon it, he is a Welch drover; I keep a public-house, a malt-house, and am clerk of the parish; I live at Alvly, in Shropshire, about six miles below Bridgenorth, on the river Severn side.</p>
               <p>By the account you have given of yourself, you was very much in liquor? - Yes, I went by accident into this house in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Were your watches ever found again? - No, not that I ever heard of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him what dress or hat I wore when I made this attempt, as he says, on his person? - He was dressed shabbily as he is now, but particularly as to his clothes I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What hat had he on? - A little slouched hat on.</p>
               <p>A round hat? - A slouched hat we call it.</p>

               <p>Was not he drunk? - He was not to say drunk, he was rather intoxicated in liquor.</p>
               <p>What are your ideas of being drunk? - He was not so drunk but he was capable of giving a proper answer, he was sensible drunk; if he had informed Mr. Roberts and me where he had been robbed at first, we might have gone and taken the people, and found the property perhaps, but he was near a quarter of an hour at the door.</p>

               <p>Why did not you ask the man for the key of his apartments, and see whether he would have given it you? - I did not, I was remiss in that.</p>
               <p>How came you not to bring him to a city Magistrate? - Because he was taken in the out-parts, in Gray's Inn-lane.</p>

               <p>Was that Monday night the first time you had seen the prosecutor? - It was.</p>
               <p>Where were you on the Saturday night before, was you at home? - On the Sunday night he was at our house, and I went out and staid out to supper; my husband told me on Monday morning, that the prosecutor had been there on Sunday night and there had been some disputes about religion between them, in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Had the prosecutor frequented your house before that? - Never to our knowledge, he had never been in our house before the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Then you was not well acquainted with him? - We had no knowledge of him, any further than his coming in the second time to drink his beer.</p>
               <p>Did you know where he came from? - No, I did not know any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Did you know his name? - I do not know it now.</p>
               <p>Pray, how could your husband tell you on the Monday morning, that he had been at your house on Sunday night? - He could not tell me by his name, any further than such a sort of man had been there on Sunday night, and they had some disputes, and when he came on Monday night, the servants told me he was the same man, that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, the prosecutor has said, I had a slouched hat on when I robbed him, now when I came in, and went away, I had no hat on.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Wilson. Did you observe that? - I do not know that he had any hat on; to the best of my remembrance, I do not remember he had a hat on; and when he went out at half past twelve I let him out, and he asked me for a penny candle, and a man in the house went with him to the corner where he lodges, he lodges in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190114"></xptr> court opposite to us, he works in Grays-inn-lane; I do not remember he had a hat on, and I do not really believe that he had any hat on.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Mrs. Wilson's, and have done so five months.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner use to come to your house often? - Yes, several times since I was there.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his being there last Sunday evening? - Yes, he was in company with several in the tap-room, but I cannot say with who particularly, on the Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how long he staid there, or when he went away on Sunday evening? - I cannot say particularly to the time.</p>
               <p>Who did he go away with? - I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect his being there at all on the Monday evening? - On Monday evening he was there from five till half past twelve.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect so particularly the whole of the time he was there on the Monday evening, and not be able to tell the time he was there on the Sunday evening? - May be I might not be there.</p>
               <p>Yes, you say you was, but when he came, who he was in company with, and when he went away you cannot say; then how came you to charge your memory so particularly with the Monday evening? - Very likely I might be busier on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Were you so, I do not ask you what you might be? - I remember on the Monday, Mr. Byrne went out at half past twelve, that I am very sure of.</p>
               <p>He came in about five you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who came in with him? - I cannot rightly say who was with him, any further than he was drinking with Mr. Hall, or Mr. White to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Which of them did he come in with at five o'clock, recollect yourself now? - I cannot tell particularly, I know I saw them drinking together.</p>
               <p>What all three? - Yes, I think so.</p>
               <p>How soon after the prisoner came in did you see them drinking together? - I cannot tell to a minute.</p>
               <p>I do not want you to tell to a minute, but how soon? - To the best of my knowledge they all three came in together.</p>
               <p>Did you serve them with beer? - I drew one or two pots for them.</p>
               <p>For them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did White and Hall stay there? - I think to the best of my knowledge Mr. White went away about eleven, or a little before, and Mr. Hall went home with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who else was in company with them in the course of the evening? - I cannot recollect any particular person; there was a gentleman drinking, but whether he drank with them or not I cannot particularly say; I remember one person having a pint of beer, my fellow servant drew it, and a slice of bread.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - I think to the best of my remembrance it was the prosecutor, but 
               <persName id="t17851019-75-person785">
                  Byrne

             I do not remember<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190118"></xptr> his drinking with him, or eating anything with him on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>What time did the man come in, do you recollect? - I believe it to be about ten, or near upon ten, I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>Where was Byrne when the prosecutor came in? - I think, to the best of my remembrance, he was asleep, with his head on the table, when the prosecutor came in.</p>
               <p>Where were Hall and White then? - I think Hall sat at a table by himself asleep at the time; I think he was asleep too.</p>
               <p>Where was White? - Mr. White, I think, was gone, and Byrne and Hall were both a sleep; I think so, to the best of my knowledge they sat at different tables; there was a woman came in with some oysters at the same time, and this gentleman bought some oysters, but how many I cannot say, and he eat some, and gave some to my fellow-servant to take into the kitchen, and in a few minutes he called for the oysters, and he went to the door after the oyster-woman, and called Peggy, and he went out after her, but whether he knew her I cannot say; I cannot say whether I saw him and the prisoner speak together, but to the best of my knowledge he did not.</p>
               <p>How soon did Byrne awake again after the prosecutor went away? - I believe he slept very near upon the time, he went home, and Mr. Hall too, and Mr. Hall went home with Mr. Byrne, and I saw him to the end of the court where he lives, I cannot say how far he saw him; I did not go with him, he said he would go to see him home.</p>
               <p>Then you do not remember White, Hall, and Byrne drinking together, after the prosecutor came in? - No.</p>
               <p>What they had was before? - Yes, to the best of my remembrance, I think so.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to come here as a witness, my girl? - Come here as a witness! I only came here to speak what is the truth.</p>
               <p>But who desired you to come to speak the truth? - My mistress got me to come.</p>
               <p>When was you first told it would be necessary for you to come here, and speak about this? - I come to speak no otherway than the truth.</p>
               <p>No, no, I am not questioning that, but when was you first told? - On Saturday last.</p>
               <p>Who told it you then? - My mistress told it me.</p>
               <p>Who was in company then? - My mistress, master, and me.</p>
               <p>Were not the other witnesses Hall and White there? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath were not they at your master's house on Saturday night last? - Last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken were they or were they not? - Mr. Hall, I think was.</p>
               <p>And Mr. White both? - I cannot rightly tell you, I am sure Mr. Hall was.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath was not Hall and White, and your mistress, and your fellow servant, and you all together at your master's house on Saturday last, enquiring what each of you was to say, and telling what each of you knew of this business? - No, Sir, upon my oath there was no such thing.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - I will swear that, I can swear it.</p>
               <p>Who told you that you must fix the time from five till half past twelve? - I spoke as near as I could.</p>
               <p>Who have you talked with on this business? - Nobody, but my mistress and master thought it would be proper for me to come on this business.</p>
               <p>Who is the prisoner's attorney? - I cannot tell, I have never seen him, I will be upon my oath to it.</p>
               <p>How came it then that you so particularly recollect the time that the prisoner came and went away that particular day and no other? - May be I might be minding my business more one day than another.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prosecutor before Monday night? - I never saw him before the Sunday night, then the prisoner and prosecutor were drinking together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190119"></xptr>How long were they together as you recollect that evening? - I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Do you know which of them went away first? - I cannot take upon myself to say not positively, nor whether they went out together I cannot tell, not positively.</p>
               <p>Do you remember how much beer the prosecutor had on Monday night? - One pint, and a slice of bread, to the best of my remembrance that was all.</p>
               <p>Then he did not stay long? - He was not above an hour, he might or might not be more, I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Did he pay for that pint of beer when he had it? - No, he did not, for there was a dispute about his paying for it, he would nor pay for it before he drank it; my fellow servant drew it, and he went to the bar and paid for it himself.</p>

               <p>What is your fellow servant's name? - Her name is Amey Garlick.</p>
               <p>AMEY GARLICK sworn.</p>

               <p>Did you see them go away? - No, I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Now we will see if you remember any better on the Monday? - Why, I take it, he was at our house about five o'clock on the Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Hall and White? - By coming to the house, nothing further, I know them by sight.</p>

               <p>How long before that had you seen them together? - I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Then the sum of your evidence is this that you can swear positively, that the prisoner came there at five o'clock, and went away at half past twelve, and that Hall and he went away together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But nothing else you will venture to say? - No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Now, who told you to say that? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that? - I can be clear in that as day-light, that nobody at all told me to say so, indeed.</p>
               <p>Do you know when the prosecutor went away? - I think he went away a little before we put our shutters up.</p>
               <p>What time is that? - We put our shuters up at eleven, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there after the prosecutor went away? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that too? - Quite positive of that.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. White there after the prosecutor went away? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot say, whether White or the prosecutor went away first? - I cannot take upon me to say that.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hall there after the prosecutor went away? - Yes, I did not see Mr. White after the prosecutor went away, to best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What beer had the prosecutor while he was there? - I think to the best of my knowledge, he had a pint of beer, and a slice of bread.</p>
               <p>Had he any more do you think than that? - Not to the best of my knowledge, and he had a penny-worth of beer that he pour-into his pint, but that he had with the oyster-woman; I served him with his penny-worth of beer, and his slice of bread.</p>
               <p>Did he pay for it directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How, with half-pence? - I think, Sir, to the best of my knowledge, it was a shilling he gave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190123"></xptr>Did he pay for it before he had it or after? - No, after he had it.</p>
               <p>Do not you usually ask for the payment before? - Yes, but he scrupled paying for it when I asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any more witnesses except to your character? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you any knowledge at all of the two people that were with the prisoner when they stopped you in Chick-lane? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>None at all? - No, Sir, I should not know them if I were to see them ever so, because they came like behind me.</p>
               <p>Should you know the young man that went home with you and the prisoner on Sunday night? - Yes, that was Hall I think.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation or dispute with the prisoner on the Monday night, except about the shilling that you wanted him to treat you with? - No, Sir, he got up directly, and went to another box, I do not know who he went to.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Hall and White being there? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You cannot speak yourself, with any certainty to the time that you left the house? - No, Sir, I cannot, it was between eleven and one; it was between twelve and one, as they tell me, when I got home to my lodgings.</p>

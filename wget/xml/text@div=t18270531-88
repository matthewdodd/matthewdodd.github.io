The prisoners came into my shop on the 14th of April, about twelve o'clock; I do not know which spoke, but they asked for a hair-brush; I showed them some - they fixed on one at 2s., which I put in paper - Brooks put down a sovereign, which I weighed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310055"></xptr>as usual, and found it good - I was getting change, but Gibson said, "You need not change, I can lend you" -"Very well," said she, "do so," and I returned Brookes the sovereign: Gibson felt in her pocket and said, "No, I can't, I have got but one shilling and a few halfpence;" Brookes said, "Well, I must change," and put down a sovereign; my suspicions were awake - I weighed it, and found it a different weight; I then said, "This is not the sovereign you gave me before;" she then threw down the other and said, "Take which you please, I have but two; I took them just now, and did not know which I gave you." I kept them both in my hand, and asked where she got them; she would not tell me - I then questioned them both; they refused to give any account of themselves - I sent for a constable, and gave them in charge, with the sovereigns, after marking them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GORDON. Q. Did they come into the shop together? A. Yes; Brookes asked for the brush; one asked the other, "Will this do?" they both fixed on it - I marked both sovereigns.</p>

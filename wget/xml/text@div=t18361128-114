                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in St. James's-street, Bed<lb></lb>ford-row. On the evening of the 3rd of November I was called from dinner, and found the prisoner in my passage, charged with stealing a Macintosh cloak from the hall—he said if I would forgive him he would confess the whole—I said I should hear nothing under a promise of forgiveness, because the thing was too palpable—he then said he would tell me who had sent him to seal it—I said I could tell him—he asked me who?—I said Thomas, who had been a clerk of mine—he said it was so, and that he was waiting outside to receive it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the prosecutor. On the evening of the 3rd of November I answered a ring at the street door bell, and found the prisoner there—he asked for Mr. Palmer's address—I left the hall, and went into the office to get it—I heard him walking along the hall—I looked back, and saw him take the Macintosh cloak off the page—I went to him, and called master—he dropped it on the ground, and tried to kick it under he hall step, but he could not—he had quite got it from the peg.</p>

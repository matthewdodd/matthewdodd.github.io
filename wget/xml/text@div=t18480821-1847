                  </hi>. I sell fish in Billingsgate, and live in Dock-street, St. George's. About twelve o'clock, on Wednesday night, 12th July, I met the prisoner in Wentworth-street—I did not know her before—she asked me if I would go home with her—I said no—I then went with her into a public-house, and had a pint of porter—we then went into another public-house,</p>

About twelve o'clock, on the night in question, I heard a cry in Osborne-street, Whitechapel—I went up, and saw two gentlemen holding the prisoner—the prosecutor came up, and gave her in charge—in taking her down Osborne-street I saw her put her right hand into her bosom and throw something from her like silver—I looked in that spot at daylight, and found this shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella maker, of 38, Mitchell Street, St. Luke's, and have known the prisoner about five years—on 26th May he came to my shop—he said "Andrew, how are you getting on?"—I said "All right, Joseph"—I took him into my front parlour—I had in a chest of drawers seven half-sovereigns and a two-shilling piece—I took out the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I showed him the money, and he saw me place it in the drawer again in a little box—the drawer was not locked—on Saturday night, 31st May, I went out at 9.45—I shut the parlour window and shutters, and left a lamp burning—my children slept in the parlour—I returned at 12.45; I found the front door all right and the parlour door also—Eliza Bradmore said something to me, and on turning up my lamp I found two drawers pulled open and my box and money gone.</p>

I live at Mr. Hill's house—on Saturday night, 31st May, about 11 o'clock, I was standing at the front door and saw the prisoner come out of the front parlour window with another man—they passed me—there was a lamp, and I could see their faces—they ran down the street—they loft the window and shutters open; I closed them afterwards—next morning I was taken to the station, and was there shown six men; I picked out the prisoner as one of the men that came out of the window.</p>

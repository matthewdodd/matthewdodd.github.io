On 8th November, about quarter past 5 in the morniug, I was on duty in George-street, Lisson-grove, about half a mile from the prosecutor's premises, and saw the four prisoners standing at the side of a costermonger's barrow—Cooper had just got the handles of the barrow, he took one of these bundles out of it, and Gibbs took another, James laid his hand upon another bundle—the woman Davies said, "Here is a policeman," and they dropped the bundles and ran away—Cooper ran into 15, George-street, Jones and Gibbs into No. 14, and Davies into No. 16—I sprung my rattle, got the assistance of another constable, went into No. 15, and found Cooper hiding under a staircase—I asked him what he was doing there—he said, "Nothing"—I told him I should take him into custody for</p>

               <p>having this property in his possession—he made no answer, and I took him to the station—I was about three yards from them when I first saw them, and knew them all before well—I am quite sure of them—I have known Davies many years—I had seen them all four together about 1 o'clock that morning about ten yards from where I took them in custody, at the corner of George-street—the barrow was close against a lamp-post.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been examined twice before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; once when Cooper was taken, and once when the other three were taken—I have not always given the same account, because when I first gave evidence there was only one prisoner—I have been examined three times before the Magistrate—I said on the first examination before the Magistrate that I taw the prisoner and another—I was asked about the numbers of the doors they ran into, and I would not swear to them, but I knew the doors—there are no numbers on the doors in George-street—I have said that one man ran into No. 15 and the others ran away; I now say that two ran into 14, one into 15, and the woman into 16, that is true—the barrow was not a yard from the lamp, and I was about six yards from it when I first saw them—I hid myself behind a cart which enabled me to get close to them—I have not said before that I saw them all four together at 1 o'clock—they were then standing opposite the window of a coffee-shop, that was quite light, as there are never any shutters up—it is at the corner of the street and there is a lamp at that corner.</p>

On 8th November, about half-past five in the morning, I was in George-street, Lisson-grove, and saw the three male prisoners standing at a costermonger's barrow in the act of taking three bundles—I came in at one end of the street and Howse at the other—I came within ten or twelve yards of the barrow—I had seen them all together about half-past 11 or quarter to 12 in George-street, talking at the same door as they ran away to—I did not see them after that till they were taken—I know them all quite well—the woman was standing on the step of the door.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are the houses near the middle or the end? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Near the middle—the middle is not dark, because the lamp at the school is right in the centre of the street, and the other lamp is near James'-street; the street is not more than fifty or sixty yards long—it is built all along—I do not know how many numbers there are—there are twenty houses; some on each Bide, and there is a chapel and school on one side—there are seventeen houses on one side—No. 1 is opposite No. 15, and the lamp is opposite No. 15.</p>

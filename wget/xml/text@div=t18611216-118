                  </hi>. I live at Erith, and am manager to Messrs. Ralph Charles Price &amp; Co., oil merchants—Talling has been employed there several years, and Avis two or three years—Avis has always been carman—Talling's employment was to draw oil into casks to go out in wagons—from information I received, I went to the wagon on 7th December, about ten minutes past 9 o'clock, it was standing in King Edward-street, just drawn out from our premises—Avis was there—I asked him where he was going—he said, "To Wapping and the wharves"—I asked him if he was going any where else but to the places mentioned on the tickets—he said, "No"—I then asked him for his tickets, which he handed me—after looking at them and seeing that there was no small parcel represented by that, I desired him to get into the van and give me out that drum of oil from under the tarpaulin—it was not labelled or directed—it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Talling gave it to me to dispose of"—I sent for a policeman and gave him in charge—each ticket mentions the place he is to go to, and the name of the wharf in so many tickets—it is sperm oil—I cannot say whether it is mixed, because he had the command of all the cisterns—it is the same kind as we had in the warehouse—we have large quantities of drums about the premises—we have a town foreman and a country foreman—Avis was the country carman to take out goods to country customers, to wharves, railways, and the like—if we are pressed, we may send country goods by the other carman—Talling's duty was to draw off the oil into casks or drums, and to give out both the country and town goods—Thompson, was the foreman for that service—besides orders from Thompson, Talling would have orders from the town foreman, but that would be a separate wagon—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160056"></xptr>
               <p>Talling had not authority to give out goods to Avis unless the principal told him—Talling had no authority to give Avis goods to dispose of in town—I do not know of Avis having authority from anybody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you say that the tarpaulin was on the good's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Partially—we have a tarpaulin with our wagons, and use it when the weather is bad—the goods in the wagon were oils; they would not take harm from damp—Avis has been in our employ two or three years—this is sperm oil, the best that can be burnt; the drums are common.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Messrs. Price &amp; Co.'s factory, Black<lb></lb>friars, and am a messenger in their employment—on 7th December, from information I received, I went and searched the van about half-past 8—it was in the yard; I found in it a five gallon drum of oil, at the fore part, rolled up in the tarpaulin—there was no mark, number, or address on it—Avis was the driver, bat he had not started with it—I followed him out of the yard, hailed him, and told him to stay, as Mr. McNeil wished to speak to him—he stayed, and Mr. McNeil went to him.</p>

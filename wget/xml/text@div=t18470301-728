                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Duff and Hodson, music-sellers. On the 24th of Feb., about twenty minutes past two o'clock in the day, I was in Dean-street, and saw the prisoners at Mr. Fitchew's, a silversmith's window, with their faces to the window, quite close to it—I saw Mott with a basket, holding the lid open with one hand, and hand, and holding the basket with the other—a pane of glass had been cut—I did not see M' Gregor's hand in the window, but I saw him take his hand from the win<lb></lb>dow and pass something into the basket—I saw his hand a very small dis<lb></lb>tance from the broken pane, just by it—he put his hand into the basket—I saw that he had something in his hand, which he put into the basket, but I could not tell what—I immediately seized Mott—the other lads ran off—I took Mott into Mr. Fitchew's shop with the basket—Mr. Fitchew was in the shop serving a lady—he took hold of the basket which Mott had taken in his hand into the shop and found a knife, fork and spoon, his property, in it—Mott was taken into custody—there was also a piece of glass in the basket, which I suppose had been cut out of the window—I did not see it cut out, or see it fitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Oxford-street. Hart came into my shop and brought Mott in with one hand, and a basket in the other—he said my window was being robbed, and if I looked in that basket I should find some of my silver—Mott began to cry—I looked into the basket and found a silver knife, spoon, and fork, and a piece of glass—I examined my window, and found an orifice corresponding with the shape of the piece of glass found in the basket, and that a silver fork, knife, and spoon had been taken from the window, but not the case they had been in, that was lying open—I should say I had seen the window safe within half an hour or an hour before—I had been continually in the shop and observing the window—I had seen the articles safe a short time before—I cannot positively identify them as being there that day, but they were there the day before when that part of the window was cleaned—the window was entire in the early part of the day—as far as my judgment goes the window had been cut by some instrument being passed into the putty at the end of the glass, which caused a crack, and</p>

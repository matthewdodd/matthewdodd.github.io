               <p>Q. When had you seen your plate last?</p>
               <p>J. Wallard. I cannot tell, they were on the shelf in a passage between two rooms, I had seen them within 12 months before I missed them; the tablecloth was locked in a drawer in a scrutoir in my own room; she was still my servant, and had been for four years; she ran in debt to the value of 20 l. and the creditors arrested her; when I missed the things I charged her with them; she confessed she had taken and pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise upon her confessing?</p>
               <p>J. Wallard. She denied it at first, bu t upon my telling her, if she would confess, I would not hurt her, then she owned it; I found them by her direction (the coffee-pot, spoons, salt, and table-cloth produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I went along with the prisoner to this pawnbroker, he denied he had ever seen her before; she said she brought four of the spoons; and would take her oath of it, and said also she was in the passage at the time the coffee-pot was pawned; he was very loth to produce four of the spoons, but at last he did lay them down on his counter, but did not deliver them up to me; he mentioned the name of Worsley, who he said pawned them; she told him she came with her, and stood in the passage while she pawned the other things; I have seen the coffee-pot before, and do believe it to be the prosecutrix's property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dixon. Did you hear the prisoner say she brought four of the spoons.</p>
               <p>Dixon. No, I did not, she brought none, they were brought by Worsley.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, the prisoner at the bar wishes to retract his plea, and to state himself Guilty. Mr. Attorney General, who has very important avocations at another place, that require his attendence, directed I should conduct this prosecution; I have an affidavit in my hand of very respectable persons; of the rector of the parish in which the prisoner lives, and of a great variety of other persons, who bear ample testimony to the good character of the prisoner; he is stated to be a man with a wife and six children depending upon him for support; and he comes claiming the mercy of the Attorney General; when ever that appeal is made, you know very well, it is made with great safety; the man has been very properly advised, by those to whom he has intrusted his interest, to plead guilty; and Mr. Attorney General consents, by me, to receive his plea.</p>
               <p>Court. How long has he been in goal? - Some time in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. Do you desire to retract your plea of Not Guilty, and to <rs id="t17920523-90-verdict523" type="verdictDescription">

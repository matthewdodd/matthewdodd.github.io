(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in June 1850—I distinctly recollect the circumstances under which it was signed—Dr. Burns was dining with us, and he said to my father that after dinner he should want him to give him a check for the amount of arrears on the deed, and my father said, "I suppose you have been taking advice?"—Dr. Burns said he had, and after dinner Dr. Burns dictated the check to my father, and he wrote it as he was told, cutting it out of the further end of the check book, the last leaf—it was arranged between Dr. Burns and my father, that this check was to be presented at a meeting at the chapel in the evening, and it was to be returned, as it was a mere matter of form to secure himself and Mr. East the co-trustee from any claims that any one might make on them, for the various charities in the deed—he did return the check in the evening, and when it was brought back, I asked my father, in the presence of Dr. Burns, what I should do with it, and I also asked Dr. Burns what I should do with it, and he told me I might keep it or destroy it—my father said I might destroy it, it was of no consequence—I did not do so, as it had my father's handwriting on it, I preserved it in a little box, and put it in a drawer with some other papers—I do not remember anything passing about the date of the check—when Dr. Burns asked my father to give him the check, my father said he was never poorer in his life, and if it went to his bankers there would not be money enough to pay it, nor if he took all the money there was in the house besides—after my father's death Dr. Burns asked me what I had done with check, if I had destroyed it—I said "You told me I might destroy it"—he said, "Have you destroyed it?"—I said no, I</p>

Dr. Burns begs to inform Miss Gwenap that her letter to him of this morning is entirely unsatisfactory; and therefore, as he has to appear before the City Magistrate at the Guildhall Court against Robert Bishop to-morrow at 12 o'clock, and intends at the same time to take out a summons or warrant against Miss Gwenap, he feels it his duty to state that he will not be satisfied without a further letter, in which she will solemnly pledge herself to cease her malicious defamations against his character, and her deep regret that she has again assailed the reputation of Miss----. He wishes her to know that Mr. Underwood is privy to this, and went with him to the solicitor yesterday. Dr. Burns will not assuredly take any measures beyond this note to avert the just punishment which a trial before the Criminal Court of the Old Bailey must award. He has already called Mrs. Best's attention to the fact, that he will be compelled to call her as his chief evidence in reference to Miss Gwenap's guilt, for conspiracy and defamation, and which is still more fully ratified by her letters in Dr. Burns' possession. Dr. Burns deeply regrets that he cannot secure or retain a Christian reputation on other terms; if he were a private person, he might be indifferent to such slanders, but as a Christian minister he cannot and will not allow the friends of religion to be surprised at the evil reports Miss Gwenap has circulated. Dr. Burns begs to say that he knows of no greater or more atrocious crime than to slander a spotless person, who for weeks, with a few exceptions, has been confined to a sick room; and that Miss----was thus confined in her brother's house in Rochester, where Miss Gwenap states she was in constant company with Dr. Burns. As Dr. Burns will leave his study for the City at 10 to-morrow morning, Friday, 30th, Miss Gwenap will take such steps as she deems best." <hi rend="italic">The following paper was enclosed in the letter</hi>: "The points upon which Dr. Burns requests Miss Gwenap's solemn and truthful declaration are the following: 1st. That Dr. Burns never did influence her father in regard to the bequests to the chapel; 2nd. That Dr. Burns never did induce him to leave Miss Gwenap less, that he might give the more to the chapel; 3rd. That Dr. Burns never did conspire or arrange with her father to evade the law, or to deprive the family of his property to advantage the chapel; 4th. That Miss Gwenap deeply regrets that such reports should prevail, and will endeavour to correct them; 5th. That Miss Gwenap will never again assail the Christian reputation of Dr. Burns; 6th. That Miss Gwenap deeply regrets having circulated the report concerning Miss----, and will never speak to the disparagement of that person again." "May 7th, 1852. Dr. Burns begs to inform Miss Gwenap that he has been waiting for a reply to his last communication, and would not have sent this note till the affair of Bishop had been settled; but as Mr. Jardine, of Bow-street, has this day held Bishop to bail to appear next Friday, it is not Dr. Burns' intention to wait</p>

               <p>till then, and therefore he begs to apprise you that unless you apologise for the untrue and defamatory statements you have made, and—have made, and engage to abstain from such a course in future, he must demand that justice from a legal tribunal which you refuse to give.")—my father died in June, 1850—at the time the check was dictated to him by Dr. Burns in Nov. he was very feeble, and in very poor health.</p>

Dr. Burns, the minister of a chapel in New Church-street, and that strange doings had been known to take place—she indicted the letter herself—to the best of my belief, I received Dr. Burns' letters after the dismissal of the case before Mr. Jardine—I was before Mr. Jardine on 6th April—I received the letters before this indictment was preferred.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

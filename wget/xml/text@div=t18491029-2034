                  </hi>. I keep the Horse and Groom, in Walworth-road—the prosecutor lives opposite me. On 21st Sept., about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner take down a leg of lamb, or mutton, and give it to a woman who swept the crossing—she wrapped it in her apron, and appeared to hesitate which way to go—the prisoner held up his knife, and she went in the direc<lb></lb>tion he pointed out—she returned in about twenty minutes—she did not pay for the lamb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at the corner of West-street, Walworth-road, opposite Mr. Ward's—the prisoner was in my service nine or ten months. On Friday, 21st Sept., I went to Smithfield, and on my return Mr. Ward told me of this—the prisoner was not then at home—I went to the station, and they sent a policeman with me—the prisoner came home, and I gave him and the woman in charge—I told the prisoner I wanted him to come with me—Mr. Ward had told me he had stolen a leg of lamb—he said he</p>

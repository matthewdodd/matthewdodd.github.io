               <p>"Brig Effort," on it. I asked him where he took it, he said he took it from his Captain, for wages, and that he came home in that brig. I said I really think it is a bad note, he said it was a good one, that he had received 15 l. for wages, and this was among it; he said he had received two 5 l. notes. I asked him if he had not changed them, and got 1 l. notes for them; he said No, it was one of the notes he had received of his Captain, and that he went to the Bank with his Captain to receive it. I said I could not take it. One of the party said,</p>
               <p>"I have plenty of silver, I will pay you," and did so. They then went into the taproom and had five pots of porter; one of them, named Phelps came out of the taproom, and said,</p>
               <p>"Master, you may as well change this note, it is a good one, we received it for wages, and shall spend 3 s. or 4 s. more." I said perhaps I would by-and-by.

As soon as the gentleman went away, Phelps went out first, the other man next, and the prisoner after him. I sung out to them to stop a moment, but they all went out, leaving the note. I secured the prisoner myself, Phelps was brought back, and the other man escaped. The prisoner was searched at the watch-house, and sixpence and a penny found on him - a shilling dropped from him in the way to the watch-house. Phelps had a bundle containing sugar, tea, and tobacco. I asked him where he bought it - he said in the Highway; at first he said he paid for it in silver, and then with a 1 l. note.</p>

We took him to Brigg's, and as we were taking him to the watch-house a shilling dropped, it must have fallen from him. He said he would make it better for me than I could make.

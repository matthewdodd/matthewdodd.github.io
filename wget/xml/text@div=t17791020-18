               <p>I keep a publick-house, the Queen's-head, at Crouch-end, Hornsey. On Tuesday the 21st of September the prisoner brought these things to my house at about nine o'clock at night. I desired him to go away at about ten o'clock. He said he had no money to pay for his beer, and he must leave these things. I refused to take them without knowing what they were. I found they were wet linen. I asked him where he got them. He said he brought them from his wife in town. He left them with me, and promised to come in the morning for them, but did not come till the evening. He then wanted me to buy them. I said I was surprised he should ask me such a thing. He said then he would fetch somebody to have them. He came again afterwards with two men he had surrendered himself to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a private soldier in the 13th Hussars, stationed at the depot, Canterbury—in the year 1865, I was a private in the Military Train stationed at Woolwich—in October that year I went with some of my comrades to the Spread Eagle public-house, Woolwich Common—I met the prisoner there, I had not known him before, he was introduced to me by Berry, a Marine—there were a great many soldiers there at the time, some of the Artillery, some of the Military Train, and some Marines; they were drinking porter, a man named St Clare or Thompson was paying for it—a man called Sprigging was also there, paying—they were civilians—the prisoner was drinking with us, he went by the name of Mohan—the soldiers were in uniform—St. Clair asked me to take the Fenian oath—I refused at first—the prisoner asked me why would I not take it—I did not know what it was—some men went out of the house after I refused—I had heard him ask them if they would take the Fenian oath—he took them out into the yard separately, one by one, and they came in again—the prisoner asked me why I would not take the Fenian oath, the same as my comrades had done, and act as a man should do towards the cause of my country—I am an Irishman—he said it was for the purpose of regain<lb></lb>ing Ireland—after some time I went out with St. Clair and took the oath—it was for the purpose of establishing a republic in Ireland and keeping the country for the Irish—that is the most I can think of it—nothing more was said at that time—we met several times after that—I only met the prisoner once after that, that was in November, 1865, at the Duchess of Wellington public-house—I went there by appointment with other soldiers, McCarthy and Bryant of the Military Train, McGough and others—McCarthy made the appointment with the prisoner—when I got there the prisoner was in the house—I asked him how he was getting on—he said "Very well—I said 1 had brought a man down to swear in—I introduced him</p>

               <p>to a man named Bryant—he said it was all right, he was very glad to see I was getting on as I ought to do—he took Bryant out into the yard by himself—when he came in again, I asked the prisoner was he all right and he said "Yes"—the prisoner said he had come from Aldershot that day and had had a very narrow escape of being arrested there—he was seducing soldiers to desert at that time—we had some beer and went away—I did not see the prisoner again till December, 1865, in London; I had then deserted—I went to London—through Farrell, a Fenian agent, a civilian; he told me to go to London, but previous to that McCarthy had received a letter from the prisoner, he handed it to me, it was signed "Peter Mohan" I took it to other soldiers, I afterwards burnt it—McCarthy told me to take it to other soldiers—I took it to Cunningham, of the 5th Brigade Royal Artillery, and also to Thomas Farrell; those men afterwards went to London—it was partly in consequence of that letter that I went to London, not altogether—Thomas Farrell, the civilian, came down for the purpose of taking us to London; I had never seen him before, he came to my room in the camp on the night of the 27th December, 1865—I went to London with him, he paid my fare—ten men went with me, McGough and Leonard of the Military Train, Michael Farrell and Thomas Connolly of the 5th Brigade Royal Artillery, Niel Cunningham, of the 5th Brigade, and Sullivan, of the Royal Horse Artillery—we all started from Charlton station, that is away from Woolwich—we were all in uniform—Thomas Farrell, the civilian, paid our fare, and gave us tickets—we went by train to London Bridge, and Farrell took us to a public-house there, where we met the prisoner—Michael Farrell, the soldier, was with us—we all went in together—the prisoner welcomed us, and paid for some drink—after that we went to Vine Court, Whitechapel—Thomas Farrell, the civilian, paid for the cabs, and we went there; he went with us—we went to a public-house in Vine Court; I don't know who it was kept by—the prisoner went with us—I got half-a-crown from him to pay for some drink—we remained there a short time, and then went to Michael Butler's, in Vine Court, a private house—I had not seen him before—the prisoner and all the soldiers went there, and Farrell, the civilian; they took us there—I asked the prisoner and Farrell what time we should get our things, that is, the civilians' things, and leave our uniforms—the prisoner had spoken about changing our things, but he said there was a great job to get them; they had to go to several places for them, as there might be remarks passed—he said we should have them by 10 or 11 o'clock—we did not get them that night—we all slept at Butler's that night—we got our change of clothes on the morning of the 29th—I could not say who brought them; I did not see them brought—we all changed—they were suits; we could fit ourselves—I left my uniform there—all the soldiers stripped and left their uniforms there, and put on civilians' clothes—I did not see the prisoner or Farrell while doing this—we afterwards went in cabs to the Euston Square Station—Thomas Farrell went with us, and I saw the prisoner there—we were to go by the Irish mail train, at 7.30—we were not in time for that, and we went by the 9 train—Farrell got the tickets for us; he gave me mine—I did not see any money—I saw him have some tickets; I did not see him get them—my hat did not fit me, and I changed hats with the prisoner—six or seven of us went off by that train; some had gone the day before—we were all provided with tickets—neither the prisoner or Farrell went with us—the prisoner said we should</p>

               <p>hardly be time enough, because the rising was expected on 3rd January, 1866—he said he would soon see me in Dublin—I went by train, and reached Dublin in due course—I next saw the prisoner, in January, 1866, at my lodging in High Street, Dublin—I received daily pay there, and paid for my own lodging—Devoy was the paymaster; St. Clair brought us the money; it was 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—seven or eight of us soldiers lodged together; we were wearing the civilians' clothes that we had got at Butler's house—the prisoner asked me bow I was getting on—I said, "Very badly"—he said, "You are as well off as anybody else"—I asked him was there any chance of a rising to take place in Ireland—he said there was an expedition expected from New York, and they were waiting for their arrival to have a rising—that was all that passed—I never saw him after that till he was in custody—that was the day I was examined at the police-court, on 16th March, this year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a sapper in the Royal Engineers, stationed at Chatham—in October, 1865, I was in the Military Train, at Woolwich—I knew a person who went by the names of St Clair, Thompson, and Pilsworth—I first made his acquaintance about November, 1865, in a public-house in George Street, Woolwich—I was introduced to him by a Marine named Berry, as a friend of his—I knew the prisoner at Woolwich—I was introduced to him as being an influential man in the Fenian Brother<lb></lb>hood—that was late in November or early in December, 1865—I took the Fenian oath—St. Clair administered it in the public-house in George Street—no one else was present—the oath was to assist in establishing a republic in Ireland and destroying the supremacy of the British Crown, and to take up arms at any time we were called upon to do so—I had taken the oath before St. Clair introduced me to the prisoner—the prisoner and I talked generally on Fenian topics—I was to see and get as many men as I could to join the organization, and bring them down at stated times to the different houses that they were in the habit of frequenting—both St. Clair and the prisoner asked me to do that—I consented—I remember being with the witness</p>

               <p>Mahony one night at the Duchess of Wellington, when the prisoner came there late, and he said he had been delayed at Aldershot—St. Clair and Spriggins were there, and a lot of military—the prisoner said that some men had sailed from America, and they were expected in the first of the new year for the breaking out in Ireland; first it was Christmas, and afterwards it was New Year's Day—he said I wan to get as many soldiers as possible to go to Ireland, because civilians would be more nuisance or hindrance; they would be wanted in England, and let the soldiers do the work in Ireland—St Clair said we were to go to London, and get our military clothes changed for civilians', and then proceed to Dublin—I know Thomas Farrell, a civilian—I have met him in Woolwich camp and in some of the public-houses—I have seen him with St Clair—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing; it is "3, 914, Rd. McCarthy, No. 9 Troop, Military Train Camp"—I gave my address to the prisoner, and to St. Clair, and Farrell got it also; I think I gave this to Farrell—I gave one to the prisoner that he might write to me to know what conclusion they came to, what orders he had to give when we got to Dublin—I was to get so much money to treat a lot of soldiers to induce them to enlist, and also money if I went to Dublin—I was told so repeatedly by St. Clair—I don't remember that the prisoners said anything about money—I afterwards got a letter from either the prisoner, St Clair, or Farrell, I cant say which; I think it was Farrell—I could not get out that night, and I gave it to Mahony, and I think he destroyed it—the purport of it was to know whether the things he had contracted for were ready, meaning the men who were to go at such a time—I did not leave Woolwich—I never deserted—I remember the other men leaving, about 27th December, at 7 or 8 in the evening—I saw Farrell at Woolwich that day—I saw Mahony speaking to him and McGough and Farrell of the Artillery—Leonard was not with him when I saw him first, but he came there afterwards—I was on guard at the Royal Horse Infirmary when they left; I last saw them at the door of No, 5 hut—I did not see Mahony for better than twelve months afterwards—a few days after they had deserted I made a communication to one of the officers—after that time I took no part in the Fenian organization—I afterwards saw Thomas Tamil at the Thames Police Court, in January, 1866, with a man named Butler—they were both convicted there of obtaining soldiers to desert—I gave evidence—that was the same Thomas Farrell I have spoken of.</p>

Q.</hi> When you took him to the station, was he searched? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes a pocket book, a purse, a knife, and a bullet were found on him—I asked him for his address, he did not give it me—I said "It will look odd if you refuse to give any address; it may look as if you had something to conceal"—he did not give as a reason, that his wife was unwell—I told him that if he wished to communicate with any of his friends I would send any<lb></lb>where to them; that was two or three hours after he had refused his address—I thought that he might unguardedly make his address known—he wrote a letter in the evening—I received certain directions about it—it had not his address on it, but the address of a friend in the Borough Road—the letter was not sent—I saw him again at Bow Street, on Monday, and he then gave me his address—I went there, there was nothing in the house.</p>

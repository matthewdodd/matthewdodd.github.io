               <p>I am a waterman, when the out-cry was upon the river, I had been doing some business at Gun Dock; my brother was in the boat, rowing me down to Stone Stairs; I heard a noise on the river, and I said there is some piece of work upon the river, as soon as ever the words were out of my mouth, I heard a pistol go off, and I heard murder cried; I said to Coleman who stood alongside of me, row over towards Execution Dock, and another boat rowed past me, about a quarter of a minute after, with five or six people in it, and it pointed towards Wapping New Stairs; I was going to the place where I heard the pistol fired, and this boat was coming from that place; this boat met me and passed me; I was about two hundred yards from the shore, I did not see the flash.</p>
               <p>Did the sound come from that way? - Yes, there were about five or six people in the boat.</p>
               <p>Was she pulling hard? - Yes, there were two boats besides her, she pulled pretty fast by me.</p>
               <p>Were they sitting down or standing up? - There were three standing up and two rowing.</p>
               <p>Was there any other boat near them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near to them? - About thirty feet following them; I asked them in the boat whereabouts they were, accordingly they said they were just astern, and the man that was in pursuit of this boat, he says there they go, and we pulled our boat round and went after this boat, and pursued them.</p>
               <p>Court. Then upon the people saying, there they go, you pulled round and went after this boat that you had spoken to? - Yes, I went to jump into the boat, and whether any body knocked me down, or whether I fell, I do not know; there was a lug-boat laying at Mr. Curtis's back door, where the people jumped out of this wherry, this boat stopped on the long-side of the lug-boat, whether it was the same people that jumped out of the lug-boat on shore, I cannot say, but I saw the people that were in the wherry that passed me, jump into the lug-boat, I pursued them, and we took Wood.</p>
               <p>Was Wood one of them or no? - I cannot tell, they were all higgledy piggledy.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other two? - To speak upon my oath, I think they were not in the boat.</p>
               <p>What makes you think so? - Because the other man that rowed was a tall thin young fellow, I should know them if I was to see them again, I have seen Romain before on the river, I cannot say I recollect the face of Key, I did not know Key before.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of the people to be able to say that Romain was not there? - Yes, he was taken up upon suspicion, I went there, and said, he was not one.</p>

               <p>How long have you known him? - I never knew him before, he was taken close to me; I can be sure he was in the boat, the rest, some ran one way, and some the other; they are all strangers to me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, the 19th of March, between the hours of seven and eight, I heard an alarm on the water, in Wapping, I went to see what was the matter, and I saw some boats rowing to Wapping New-stairs; I saw one of the prisoners at the bar run past me, that was Keys; they cried stop thief to him, I pursued him as fast as I could; I was at the corner of the stairs, at Mr. Curtis's brewhouse, that is fifty yards or more from the stairs, he was going as fast as he could, I dare say; and Mr. Curtis's clerk was pursuing him at the same time; the prisoner was the first man, and there were other people pursuing after him, crying, stop thief; we stopped him; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060058"></xptr> him what he ran away for; he said he had done nothing, he knew nothing of it; says he, I ran after the thief; says I, there was nobody before you; he said, he knew nothing of it, and he would not tell where he lived; and I gave him in charge to the constable.</p>
               <p>- ADAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of March I was at Mr. Curtis's compting-house, I am his clerk, I heard a cry of murder and thieves; I thought it was only a parcel of drunken waterman; I was within two roods of the stairs, our brewhouse joins the stairs, and I saw a boat with five men come on shore, and saw the prisoner coming up the alley adjoining to the brewhouse, from the head of the alley to the water-side, I imagine to be between five and six rods.</p>
               <p>How many yards was it? - I do not know, seventeen feet and a half are in a rod.</p>
               <p>Has a person at the bottom of the stairs any way up into Wapping, but coming through that alley? - No, unless he came through our brewhouse; I saw him come out of the alley into the street, and pass me, I told him to stop, he did not stop, but ran past me; it is about as far through the compting-house to the street, as up the alley.</p>
               <p>Had anybody run past you before him? - Nobody, they took down a place called the orchard, I followed, and caught him the corner of New Market-street; I saw Keys come up the alley as soon as I could get out of our compting-house, and out of the brewhouse gates, and the prisoner was then coming out of the alley.</p>

I went down and a man came running past me with something in his hand, I stood off one side, when he had got about thirty or forty yards a head of me, I made after him, and lost sight of him in New Gravel-lane, and them two gentlemen took me; I told them I was running after the thief, immediately they took me before the prosecutor and asked him if I was one of the thieves, I was coming back when they stopped me; I was drinking about a quarter of an hour before, with an acquaintance, his name is

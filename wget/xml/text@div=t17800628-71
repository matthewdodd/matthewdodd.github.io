               <p>I am servant to Mr. Schomberg. My master's house was broke into by several people at twelve o'clock at night. I saw both the prisoners in the back parlour.</p>

               <p>Had either of them any thing in his hand? - Flemine had an iron bar in his hand. Flemine said to me, You bitch, see what I have brought for you! and shewed me the iron bar.</p>
               <p>How did he hold the bar when he used that expression? - He struck it against the ground.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it before they were apprehended? - I believe half an hour, by the Life-Guards.</p>

               <p>Court. What did the persons who broke into the house do? - They broke the doors and the pannels of the window shutter.</p>
               <p>What did you see the prisoner do? - I saw one of the people in the house take a fiddle and play at one of the windows.</p>

               <p>Flemine. At the justice's she said she believed I was one of the men; but she could not be certain.</p>
               <p>When they were examined before the justice did you say you thought Flemine was the man, but you were not certain of it? - I said Flemine was the man, I was very sure of it.</p>

I heard a noise; I was going up to my lady's, to put up lights for fear her windows should be broke. Coming by the fire of Mr. Schomberg's goods, I saw one of the Life-Guards come up and held his horse about two or three minutes; he went and brought these two men out of the house as he told me. I did not see him go in or come out of the house; he delivered them to us, and we took them to the Duke of Gloucester's riding-house, where they were taken care of.</p>

               <p>I had been to my brother's. As I was coming home, a little after eleven o'clock. I heard there was a fire. I went along with a good many people. When I came there the place was not on fire, but there was a fire in the street as to my doing any damage to any mortal I did not.</p>

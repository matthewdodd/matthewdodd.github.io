On the 19th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was returning from Blackfriars-road, and as I passed London-place, I saw a man standing at the corner; he was a tall young man, with light hair, about the prisoner's height, and as near as I can recollect it was him, but I cannot swear to his countenance; as I crossed the Triangle he said to me, "You are walking very sedately;" I walked on quick, and when I got into <placeName id="t18321129-8-crimeloc47">Tryon's-place</placeName>

               <p>Q. What became of the umbrella? A. He threw it away when he began to run, which was as soon as I called Police! he went round Tryon's place into the Triangle -I took up the umbrella; I saw my bag next morning in possession of a Policeman.</p>

             (Police-constable N 186). I was on duty near the Triangle, and saw the prisoner running across Mare-street, from Tryon's-place to the Triangle; he had nothing that I saw, and as he passed me he cried out, "What a bl-y lark" - I had not spoken to him; I was n plain clothes: I heard a faint cry of Police! I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290010"></xptr>pursued, calling Stop thief! and took him about one hundred yards further on - on my coming up to him, he put himself in a posture of defence, and said, "What do you want with me?" and said he had not done any thing; I took him back to Tryon's-place, where a crowd said a lady had been robbed; I saw the prosecutrix in the crowd, and asked if he was the man; she said she was so frightened she could not swear to him - I searched him, but found nothing; I took him to the watch-house, and asked what brought him to Hackney, and where he lived - he at first said in Green Arbour-court, Aldersgate-street, and afterwards said it was in Old-street; he said he had come with a boy with butter to the Cat and Mutton, and he had known the boy eight or nine months, by sight; he was searched again at the watch-house, and 4s. 7d. found on him in common coin; when he ran from Tryon's-place I saw nobody with him - at six o'clock next morning I and Jones went to West-street, and in the front garden of a house near the spot where the prisoner was taken, Jones found the bag, against the wall in the direction it would have fallen, if the prisoner had thrown it; he had passed that garden.</p>
               <p>- JONES. I found this bag in the garden.</p>
               <p>MISS RUSSELL. It is my bag - the articles are still in it.</p>

            . I have been in service some years; I have been out of service four months. On the 12th of January I was introduced to the prisoner by a woman of the name of Nowland, in company with a woman of the name of Byat for the purpose of buying some bad money.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Mrs. Nowland before - A. Yes. Mrs. Byat told me she would sell half a piece of goods, that is, twenty bad shillings, she would sell me a half piece for ten shillings. I appointed to meet her the next day at twelve o'clock, the 13th of January; if she did not come the next day herself Mrs. Slater would come, it was equal the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Slater was present at this time - A. She was. I then went to Mr. Powell and acquainted him with this circumstance; Mr. Powell told me to come to his chambers the next morning and to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there the next morning - A. I did, about half past nine; I waited there untill Mr. Armstrong came, and the officers came. When the officers came then they gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they gave you the money had you any money about you - A. No, I had not a halfpenny In the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the money - A. Mr. Armstrong, I saw him mark the money; two three-shilling pieces, a half-crown, one shilling and sixpence, and they gave me four pennyworth of halfpence to treat the woman with gin. After that I went to the wine-vaults the corner of <placeName id="t18120115-124-crimeloc736">Hollis-street, Clare-market</placeName>

The officers were behind me, they had sight of me all the way I went. I then met the prisoner at the door of the wine-vaults, she told me that she had been sometime waiting for me; she then said, she had brought me what was promised me last night. We walked about an hundred yards from the door; she said they were very much in want of money, and Byat's people were at work; she said they were very bad, they were all scratchy, but if I could do away with them, that is, pass them off, she would get me some that would be much better to-morrow. We went into the wine-vaults, Mr. Armstrong was just behind us, and then I treated her with a quartern of gin, and gave her the four-pennyworth of halfpence; she then gave me the twenty bad shillings out of her hand, they were in brown paper; I gave her the ten shillings that I had received of the officer, the same money; she stood at the bar, and then she gave me in her turn a quartern of gin; she paid for that with the sixpence I had just given her, she had it in her hand; then I stood at the bar a few minutes longer, and then a little boy came in; I was to put my hand to my bonnet when he came in if I had bought the money; I did, and the officers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that sixpence that was given by her for the last gin given to the landlord - A. Yes. Mr. Armstrong took hold of my hand and asked me what I had got there; I told him what I had bought and paid for; he took it out of my hand and looked at it, and asked me who I bought it of; I told him, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were not you tried here last sessions - A. Yes, and I was acquitted. The woman was drunk and pawned the watch herself.</p>

When I and my son and Bishop went into the wine-vaults Mrs. Harcup's face presented herself to me, Mrs. Slater's back was rather towards us: I catched hold of Harcup's hand and said, what have you got here; I took out of her hand a paper containing twenty counterfeit shillings; I produced them before the grand jury, and by some mistake there is only nineteen, there were twenty then, which I counted. I then asked Mrs. Harcup of whom she got them; she said she had bought them and paid for them of the prisoner, the prisoner then being present. We took them into a little room and there I saw Bishop produce some marked money, which I knew I had given<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150072"></xptr>to Mrs. Harcup. The money produced wanted a sixpence. I went to the landlord and told him the sixpence that we wanted had a dot in it under the letters, which the man found. The prisoner was secured and taken to the office. I did not search Slater, she never made use of a bad word, but behaved exceeding well.</p>

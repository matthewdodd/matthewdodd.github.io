                  </hi>. I am the son of John Johnson, and live in Wil<lb></lb>liam-street, Knightsbridge. I knew Thomas Adlington, the bankrupt—he carried on business as a corn-merchant at Kingsland, and I believe be sold coals and seeds—he was trading as a corn, seed, and coal-merchant, on the 7th of April, 1845, buying and selling goods—I took orders from him in Jan. and Feb. last for goods—on the 8th of Jan. I sold him fifty qrs. of oats; on the 15th, thirty more; on the 31st, ten qrs. of barley, and ten qrs. of oats; on the 10th of Feb., thirty qrs. of oats; on the 26th, thirty qrs. of oats; and on the 5th of March, twenty qrs. of oats; I sold to his brother, the prisoner, on his account—the whole amount of goods I sold him was about 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were delivered from the wharf to his own carts—I do not know by whom—we were never paid for them—they were sold on my father's account.</p>

No, there is not any in existence. Q. Where are the private memorandums you spoke about? A. I have got them laid about somewhere I dare say. Q.

A. Yes, I will, but not within a fortnight. Q. Why did your brother give you these things at that time? A. To clear me off. Q. Do you know that your brother had been served with two writs at that time? A. I did not—I know it now—I see them now in your hands. Q. Why were you to be cleared off at that time? A. I do not know.

Q. Where is it? A. I do not know. Q. Do you remember on your former examination stating respecting that book, 'I have it at my house, it belongs to my brother, I suppose?' A. I do. Q. Where is the book you so referred to in that examination? A. I do not know. Q. What has become of it since that examination? A. I do not know. Q. Was it true, as you then stated on your former examination, that you had the book then at your house? A. Yes. Q. Where is that book to which you so referred? A. I do not know. Q. Have you seen it since that last examination? A. No. Q. Have you not been summoned to produce it? A. Yes. Q. Why do you not produce it? A. Because I have not looked for it—I do not know where to look for it. Q. What house did you allude to on your former examin<lb></lb>ation, when you said you had the book at your house? A. No. 14, Elizabeth-terrace, Ball's Pond-road, the same which I live in still, and from which I came this morning. Q. Does your brother, the bankrupt, live in the same house? A. He did live there—he does not live there now, and I do not know where he lives. Q. When did he leave that house? A. About a fortnight since. Q. Why did he leave it? A. I do not know, upon my oath, why he left it. Q. Did he give any reason why he should leave you?—had you any quarrel? A. He did not give any reason, and we had no quarrel. Q. Have you seen him since he left your house? A. Yes, Sir. Q. When did you see him last? A. On Saturday last—I did not then ask him where he was then living, and he did not tell me—I do not know where he resides now, nor where he has resided at any time during the last fortnight, except that I know that lie slept at a coffee-shop in Bishopsgate-street for one or two nights—I do not know the name of the coffee-shop, or who keeps it—it is near Sun-street, as I have heard from my brother. Q. Did you see him go away when he left your house? A. I did not see him. Q. Do you knour whether he took any book or account from your house? A. I cannot say. Q. Do you suspect that he took away any book of account? A. I do not know what to answer—the messenger of this Court has looked for the book—I know it is not there now—I have not seen it since I was last examined, but it used to be in my brother's room, the bankrupt's—I wish to add that I do suspect that my brother the bankrupt has taken it away. Q. Do you keep a banker's account? A. I do not now, but I did so, down to about a fortnight or ten days ago, at the bank of Sir William Lub<lb></lb>bock. Q. Did you then withdraw your balance? A. Yes. Q. why did you do so? A. Because I could get no person to serve me on the arket, and I wanted to make use of the money in buying goods in my trade. Q. Had your brother handed any money over to you at any time to put into that banking-house? A. No. Q. Had he advanced any sum of money to you to dispose of anywhere for him? A. No. Q. I believe Mr. Ash lord had had some money of jours? A. Yes. Q. Had any portion of that money come from your brother the bankrupt? A. No. Q.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether there is any sum of money lying anywhere be<lb></lb>longing to your brother the bankrupt? A. I do not, upon my oath, nor do I know of any property belonging to him anywhere. Q. Do you know a person of the name of James Gammon? A. I do know him—he is a saddler. Q. Was any harness belonging to your brother, the bankrupt, sent to Gammon's? A. I do not know of any being sent—I have heard of some being sold to him by my brother, but I know nothing of it of my own knowledge. Q. Did not you hear from your brother, the bankrupt, that the harness was sent to Gammon's to take care of? A. No. Q. Did you know of any hops being sold by your brother, the bankrupt, to George Chalkley? A. Yes—I know some were sold to him, but I know nothing about their not having been paid for, or that the sale had been withholden from the knowledge of the creditors. Q,. Did you make any claim to the hops that had been sold to Mr. George Chalkley? A. No, I knew nothing of the affair. Q. Did the messenger of this Court seize any property in your possession which had been your brother's, the bankrupt? A. Yes, it had been my brother's until I bought it. Q. Does the purchase of that property appear in any book of yours? A. It did, but I cannot find the book—I have mislaid it—I wish to find it. Q. Describe the book? A. It is a little small book with a pencil in it, a pocket-book about eight inches in length—a bluish-black cover. Q. When did you see it last? A. I have not seen it since my last examination. Q. Is this a book distinct from the other black book of which you have already been speaking of in this examination, and referred to in your former examination? A. It is the very same book which I suppose my brother, the bankrupt, has taken. Q. Is the entry in that book respecting the sale of this property to you in your handwriting? A. No, in my brother's, the bankrupt. Q. What was the amount of the property so sold to you? A. About 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Q. Did any money pass on that occasion? A. Yes, about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the rest was in payment of a debt which he owed me. Q. Was there any account of that debt in any book of the bankrupt's? A. Yes, I believe it was in his ledger—I also had an account of it in a little penny memorandum-book of mine, which I looked for this morning and could not find, but I think I can produce it on some future occasion. Q. When was it you deposited the money with Mr. Ashford? A. About the middle of March last? Q. How much did you deposit with him? A. 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave me an I O U, and which I showed to Francis Gough. Q. When you showed it to Gough, did you not tell him that that money belonged to your brother, the bankrupt? A. I did not."</p>

                  </hi>. In the beginning of last March I was in the service of the bankrupt, Thomas Adlington; I know the prisoner; he is his brother; the bankrupt lived with him up to the time of his bankruptcy. I remember things being moved to my house several times, a short time prior to the bankruptcy, in March—I cannot tell the dates; it was about the middle of March—sometimes there was a quantity of groats moved, at other times ground rice—he was a corn and coal-dealer—the articles moved were arti<lb></lb>cles in his own trade—he sold ground rice and groats, corn and oats—they were moved by me and by the men on the premises—there were</p>

               <p>utensils moved, such as a chaff-machine, a hand-truck, and coal-sacks—the fiat issued on the 7th of April—a cart was moved to Glover's about two days prior to the bankruptcy; I think it went empty—it was worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw it removed from the premises, I think, by Moses Gammon—I saw the bankrupt at the time it was removed—he and the prisoner gave orders for it—I do not think either of them were present at the time it was removed—both of them had given orders for its re<lb></lb>moval, in my hearing—it was to be removed to Mr. Glover's, at Totten-ham—previous to the bankruptcy, on Good Friday, I was requested to come round to help them with the books, to go through the ac<lb></lb>counts, and see which were bad debts and which were good—the bank<lb></lb>rupt and I went through one set of books commonly used by the bankrupt, and the prisoner went through another set, and we found by the books gone through by the bankrupt and myself that he could offer 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—the prisoner was present—something was said as to the propriety of offering anything in the pound, or becoming a bankrupt—the goods were moved about the middle of March, at several times—several goods were removed before Good Friday—I knew of my master being put on his examination at the Bankruptcy Court—he requested me to go there—I did not know what for, till I got there; I then found it was to sign a paper—some goods were removed on the day the Bankruptcy Court took possession of the things—I had several conversations with the pri<lb></lb>soner after that about the articles which had been previously removed to my premises—he told me they were his, and I was to say they were his if I was examined—I can give no certain account where those goods were at "that time—I was first at the Court of Bankruptcy on the 8th of April—the last public examination was on the 31st of May—I was still in their employ at that time—I had left their house, and lived at my own house-up to the time of the prisoner purchasing the business of the assignees, part of the goods which had been removed were at my place, and part at the prisoner's place—the books were removed—the cart was at Glover's—before any articles had been removed they had both together told me that I was to have the groats, over there, because they should not be able to pass any groats while the messenger held possession of the place—I told the Com<lb></lb>missioner that I had the articles at my house, at my examination on the 31st of May—I had not been examined before—the messenger had left the premises before the 31st of May—after he had left, the goods at my house were moved back again—both the pri<lb></lb>soner and the bankrupt helped to move them back—the bankrupt's name had been on the cart—I painted it out by his orders in the prisoner's presence—I fetched the cart home from Glover's—the articles that had gone to the prisoner's were not brought back, only just a few labels for present use—the books were kept under lock and key—the prisoner then started in the business, and the bankrupt travelled for his brother—that was the place the prisoner had held for him—I made no communication to the messenger about the goods I bad in my possession, because I was ordered not, both by the bankrupt and the prisoner, and I was not to let any of the neighbours see me move them, but I did not attend to those orders strictly, because I moved them in broad daylight—I was told not to let it be known—part of the goods were then at my place, and part at the prisoner's, and the cart was at Tot<lb></lb>tenham—some of the goods were seized at my house, in Fleet-row—that was alter the 31st, after I had given evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>to serve him if I could—I had my opinion about it, but I was told they were Robert's—I knew they were not—Robert told were his—I believe he also said he had taken them of Thomas, in dis<lb></lb>charge of the debt due to him, because he knew Thomas would be a bank<lb></lb>rupt—he said he had bought them—he said so at the time—Thomas did not say they were Robert's, and that he gave them to him to secure him in case of his bankruptcy—he gave me instructions to take such things over, and I was to say they were his brother Robert's, and Robert said the same—I was to say they were his—Thomas did not tell me Robert was to have them for what he owed him—I did not say they were Robert's—I did not take them with that view—I took them by his request to his place.</p>

I would not go—nor anything of the kind—not a word of the sort ever passed—I went three times before the Commissioners—I went the first day, when the fiat was issued—I was not examined then—a question was put to me whether I knew he had been a trader, and I said, "Yes;" and they asked me my name—I was examined the second time—I was summoned then—I was not summoned the first time—I went at the request of the bankrupts—the second time I told all about where these goods were—that was on the 31st of May—that was the first time I was examined—I should say the goods were on the premises six or seven weeks before they were removed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 41, Bethnal-green-road. I have known the prisoner three or four years—I saw him after the 31st of May, not at his own house, but I supposed he was there—I saw him at my house—he has called regularly every week</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270068"></xptr>
               <p>for a long time past—I saw him at the Old Woodman beer-shop at the latter end of July—he was then going by the name of Parry—he said it was because he was in trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In your dealings with him hare you always found him an honest respectable man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always—he has on many occasions deposited money with me before his brother's bankruptcy—I did not know that he was doing business on his own account as well as for his brother, for some time previous to the bankruptcy—I knew him first of all as a carpenter—he was strongly recommended to me by his landlord as a worthy honest young man, and I furnished his house with goods; and it was in consequence of his coming to me week after week, to pay me money off the goods, that I became more acquainted with him—on one occasion he deposited money with me, it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 15th of March—Thomas Adlington came to my house once—I only knew him on that occasion—the prisoner told me that Thomas was considerably indebted to him—he said he owed him a good deal of money for commission at various times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he deposited this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whose did he say it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His own—prior to his depositing it he said, "My brother is about paying me some commission which has been owing to me for some time, will you be kind enough to take care of it for me?" and he afterwards brought me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave no particular reason for depositing it with me, only asking me to take care of it for him—I have frequently lent the prisoner money when he has said, "My brother is short, can you oblige me with money?" I felt that confidence in him—he applied for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 15th of April, and the remainder in the course of May, this year.</p>

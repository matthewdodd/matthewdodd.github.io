On Monday, the 6th of December, about five o'clock, I went out, leaving nobody but the prisoner in the house; she lodged on the second floor. I locked my door, and took the key with me. I went to a neighbour's house, and at six o'clock I was fetched, and found my door open, and missed my husband's coat and trowsers, and my son's suit of clothes - his name is Michael Powell; the clothes had all hung over one chair; - it was getting dusk when I went out, but there was sufficient light to see a person's face; - my son is twenty-four years old, and finds his own clothes.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 6th of December, about six o'clock, I went to Hazell's room; her door had been forced open by some instrument. I went again just before nine and met the prisoner coming up stairs; Hazell charged her with this - she stood quite amazed, and never said a word. I found a handkerchief on her, which Powell claimed; and in one corner of it was 20 s. 6 d., and in a purse, the duplicates of two suits of clothes, pawned that day at Cross's, Turnmill-street. I found a pair of pinchers in her pocket, which seemed to fit the marks on the door. She seemed so confused I had a hard matter to get a sight of her face. I went to her room; she seemed in the greatest distress - there was only a handful of fire in the place, and the children round it appeared literally starving; there was not half a loaf in the place, and hardly a bed to lay on - I understand her husband is a drunken fellow.</p>

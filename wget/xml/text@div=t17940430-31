On the 28th of February I lost a Sussex ox; I came home and asked my man if he had killed the bullock? he said it was gone from the premises, and was taken away. I saw the bullock afterwards at the Green-yard, I saw it the same morning, when my man informed me that the bullock was taken out.</p>

               <p>Q. It had not been slaughtered had it? - No, I found it in the Green yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you found your bullock in the Green-yard? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to the last witness, Mr. Turk; I have lived with him three years come next October. The 16th of February the bullock was taken out of our cart house, it was put in the 7th at night. In the afternoon we missed him, between the hours of twelve and one, Friday morning, midnight, we may say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any search after him? - The watchman came to me at that time, and called George, through that I immediately arose (the watchman's name is Campbell) he gave me some information about the bullock, and I immediately got up and pursued to the Green-yard, when I came to the Green-yard I knocked at the gate, and I said have you got ever a bullock brought there about half an hour or twenty minutes ago? they said yes; I said I should be glad if they would let me see the bullock? he said if I would describe the marks he would; I did not see him that night, I saw it the next morning along with my master; it was in the forenoon, about ten o'clock, I cannot pretend to say particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bullock then produced to you that which was your master's? - Yes. I see a lad at the Green-yard, when I went in the night, who is admitted an evidence, and these two at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with these two boys? - No, I said my lads, you have been doing it very nicely, taking my master's property away in this manner, and I asked if there was any watchman near, and I gave charge of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The watchman who called you is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The ox you found in the place where he would be if he had strayed, in the Green-yard? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that if a beast is lost, it is customary to take them to the Green-yard? - It may be so.</p>

               <p>Q. If he had been a stray bullock they would have brought him there? - They brought him there as a stray bullock, so my servant tells me, she went to the gate.</p>

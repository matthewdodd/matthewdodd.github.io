               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Before the magistrate did you state that he said it was the piece he cut off the night before? A. I did - I had at that time five servants - they all sell goods except the prisoner - two of them are here - I do not recollect saying before the magistrate that I could not speak to the property at all myself - it is not probable that I said so, nor that I said I could not swear to it unless it corresponded with the other piece - nor that I could not swear it had not been sold - I say it is my property, because it agrees with the piece it was cut from, and it has not been cut since he cut it - the shopmen who are not here had permission to sell - other houses have the same sort of silk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any means of knowing this particular piece has not been sold by your shopmen? A. I have not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How can you tell this kerseymere has not been sold? A. I inquired whether it was sold - of my own knowledge I do not know it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure he told you he cut that off the piece the night before? A. I am - he did not say he had sold it to any customer, or account for its being in his box - the officer was present at the conversation - I charged him with stealing the kerseymere - I do not think the silk was mentioned - he said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it occasionally the case that one of your shopmen sells goods to another, and books them to be paid for at the time their wages became due? A. Yes; I should not object to that if it was within the limit of his quarter's salary - I have my books here, and can tell by reference whether any article is entered to the prisoner - if Williams, my shopman, had entered it to the prisoner, I should not object to it, but there is no entry of it - the prisoner would have four guineas to receive at quarter day - this silk is worth 9s. 1 1/2d., and the cloth 16s.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember the prisoner applying for time that Williams might be produced before the magistrate? A. Yes; and he had from the Saturday till the Monday given to him - he did not produce Williams at the examination - he was not asked for- he was informed at the first examination that the books should be open to him, and any body in the establishment he wanted be forthcoming - he did not request William's attendance, and he was not there - he required Almer's attendance for the same purpose, and Almer was there and examined; and the book was produced ready for him if he wanted it - he knew the books were there - he gave no account of the transaction except that he cut it off the night before.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there not an entry in the book of a purchase made by him? A. For a piece of black cloth there is - I opened his boxes on the 29th of July.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure he said he cut the kerseymere off the day before? A. The night before - here is an entry in the book on the 10th of June, of 2 3-8ths black plain cloth, at 5s. 7d.; but this was in July, and this is kerseymere.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there an entry in July of the purchase of any cloth or kerseymere? A. There is not - before the magistrate he said Almer had cut it off, and entered it to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he cut it off, or that it was cut off? A. He said he cut it off himself - he said nothing about the apprentice William nor Almer.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH DAY. I am a <rs id="t18310512-65-viclabel399" type="occupation">livery-stable keeper</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18310512-65-victim502 t18310512-65-viclabel399"></join>, and live in Hunt-court, King David's-lane. On the night of the 28th of April I was in the <placeName id="t18310512-65-crimeloc400">Commercial-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310512-65-crimeloc400" type="placeName" value="Commercial-road"></interp>

               <p>JOHN PEDDER. I am a Police-constable. I heard the prosecutor call for assistance - I came up to him by the White Horse turnpike; I took the prisoner into custody - on the way to the watch-house she gave me two half-crowns, and when I got there I found two sixpences on her - the prosecutor said she had robbed him of three half-crowns and one shilling.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor wanted to prevail on her to accompany him up a court, and that the money found on her had been given her by a gentleman.</p>
               <p>JOHN PEDDER re-examined. I told her if she had robbed the man to give the money up - she persisted that she had not any thing belonging to him; she delivered two half-crowns to me, and I found two sixpences on her - she did not then say that the prosecutor wanted to go with her - she did before the Magistrate; the prosecutor told me two women came up to him.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH DAY re-examined. Q. Did you ask the prisoner to go with you? A. No, my Lord, it is false, and she was in company with another woman, who took my umbrella; I was quite sober.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was given to me by a woman, to pawn for herself: I went and took her the money; she took 1s. of it, and told me to keep the rest: I met her three days after in the street - she asked me for the duplicate; I said I had it not in my pocket, but I would give it her when I got home.</p>

On Monday the 25th of September I went to my Burean, in my Chamber, and open'd it (as usual) to take a Guinea out of a Purse, which contain'd 7 Guineas, and a mourning Ring, but it was gone; somebody had taken it away. The next Day I miss'd 9 Shirts, a dimitty Waistcoat, 3 Scarves, - 3 or 4. Three Handkerchiefs, and (I think) a pair of Stockings. Mrs. Bennet having been robbed likewise, and the Prisoner having her Goods, it was suspected that he had got mine; and Endeavours were used to bring him to Confession. At last this Corporal, (

After these Things were deliver'd to me, I went to the Prisoner, in the Black Hole, and desired to know where my Money was? His Answer was, that he had given his Wife Orders to deliver all, and it she would come to him, he would endeavour to find the rest of my Goods.</p>

            . I mounted Guard at the Tower on the 26th of September. The Prisoner came on Duty about One o'Clock, and went off without Leave about 3 in the Afternoon. Upon which I return'd him to the Officer. About 11 at Night, the Robbery of Mrs. Bennet was found out; and about that Time he came on Duty, and being suspected, I disarm'd him and took him Prisoner, and found a great many Things that Mrs. Bennet swore to, in his Pockets. Then I took him before the Officers, and he own'd that he clapp'd one Foot against the Wall, and the other against the House, so got up, and wrench'd open the Window with his Bayonet; but he begg'd the Officers would not bring him to Trial for the Fact. I can swear I deliver'd Mrs. Bennet the same Things, I took out of his Pockets.</p>

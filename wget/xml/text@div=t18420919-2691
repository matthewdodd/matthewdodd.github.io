                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Davis, of Bainbridge-Street, St. Giles's. The prisoner and his wife lodged in the adjoining room on the same landing—on Sunday evening last, I was going up stairs and saw them inside the door quarrelling—they were both very drunk indeed—the wife was holding the handle of the door—she would not go in—the prisoner was persuading her to come in, several times, and at last he caught hold of her arm to pull her in, and gave her two or three slaps on the head with his open hand—he then let go of her—she staggered and fell within a foot of the stairs—he then gave her a kick on the back, and</p>

               <p>threw her down stairs, but I do not think it was with the intention of throwing her down stairs—it was not a violent kick—she was very tipsy, and unable to guard herself—she was in a sitting posture, with her back to my door, and her feet towards the stairs—he only gave her one kick, and she fell immediately, and rolled down all of a lump, all the way to the bottom—he then went into his room—when he was told she had fallen down stairs, he cried bitterly, and said, "O my poor wife"—I went down—there was an old woman in the yard, who sat down on the stairs, and rested her head on her lap—she was taken to the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodged on the same landing with the prisoner and his wife. On Sunday evening, between six and seven o'clock, I was sitting at the door, and the deceased passed by very much intoxicated—she staggered going into the passage—shortly after I went in—as I went to the foot of the stairs, she came down at my feet in a lump—she was quite insensible then—a doctor was sent for from the station, in about a quarter of an hour, and she was taken to the University College hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge on the second floor in the same house with the prisoner and his wife. On Sunday evening I heard a scream, I came down out of ray room, and saw the prisoner give the old woman a kick—I do not know that he did it designedly—I was on the banisters, and looked over—she fell to the bottom of the stairs—there was a great crowd of people—when he kicked her, she was lying on the floor in the passage—I do not know whereabouts he kicked her—I never said before that I saw him kick her, and I should not have said it now, if his friends had been civil to me, and not abused me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the University College hospital—the deceased was brought there on Sunday evening last about seven o'clock—she was perfectly insensible, had lost all power of motion, and was labouring under symptoms of injury of the brain—she vomited repeatedly—the contents of her stomach smelt strongly of spirits—she died on Tuesday evening at ten o'clock, from laceration of the brain in two places—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on Wednesday morning—there were two bruises on the scalp, a great effusion of blood over the whole left side of the brain, and two lacerations of the brain—a fall down stairs would occasion such appearances, or any blow with an obtuse body on the head.</p>

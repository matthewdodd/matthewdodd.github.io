                  </hi>. I shall be seventeen years old in Oct.; 1 lire at No. 36, Cooper's-row, Old Kent-road. On Sunday, 31st Aug., I was playing in a field near Surrey Canal; I saw the three prisoners there—I know them as being about the street—I am sure they were there—they were gambling and tossing with money—Cook lost his money, and I heard him say, "What a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> it would be to set this place on fire!"—it was then about half past 4 o'clock—they then went across the field, over the ditch, and into the shed—when Cook said that, they were about fifty yards from the shed—he did not point to the place—it was on the same side that they were, only they had to cross a ditch—they all three went into the shed—I went after them, to see what they were going to do—I old not go into the shed—I stood on the bank of the canal—I looked into the shed—Cook had said this quite loud before me—when he said, "What a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> it would be!" the other two made answer, and said, "Yes, we will do it"—I could see them when they were in the shed—I saw Fowler strike a lucifer, and give it to Hawthorne—Cook scraped up some shavings, and Hawthorne made a hole in the middle, and put the lucifer in it—I saw the smoke come from the shavings—the prisoners all went off together running—the fire was towards the back of the shed, close to the wood—I am sure of that—I did not remain any longer—I spoke to Smith, and he and I ran away—Smith had been playing there before, and after I came across the ditch, I saw Smith again, and I pointed it out to him—I turned round afterwards, and saw the flames, after we were running—we had run about 100 yards then I turned round and saw the flames—the shed was not burnt down altogether, there is a piece of it standing up now—I did not go back to look at it, I went home.</p>

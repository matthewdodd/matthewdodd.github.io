               <p>Wood. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his having been indicted here?</p>
               <p>Wood. Yes; he was tried in Alderman Turner's mayoralty from the Black Dog, at Highgate: I cannot recollect the prosecutor's name; the prisoner was cast; I was present at the trial; Philips and I took him up for that fact. I have seen him several times in Smithfield; since he returned from transportation, and have begged of him to get out of the way, for fear I should have charge of him.</p>

               <p>Philips. For stealing some bridles and saddles from Mr. Etherington's, at the Black Dog at Highgate. I had them in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his being at large afterwards?</p>
               <p>Philips. Yes; I took him in a lodging house, in Field-lane, on the 10th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Whether you have not known me always to get my living honestly?</p>
               <p>Philips. I believe he got his living honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take him at last?</p>
               <p>Philips. I went to take a person at the lodging room; I saw the prisoner there, and a person desired me to take him away.</p>

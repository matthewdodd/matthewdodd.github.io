Cameron and Co., pawnbrokers, I went to their shop about a week ago, and found six napkins and a tablecloth - part of them have my name at full length; I cannot say when I had seen them safe. I received some duplicates from McKee, and went to Messrs. Lamb and Co., of Stanhope-street. where I found six tea-spoons of one pattern, two of an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150007"></xptr>other, a mustard-spoon, and some napkins - some of them have my name on them, but it has been picked out from the others; the tea-spoons are marked "Horns tavern," with my name; the marks have been obliterated, but there is enough left for me to identify them, as I have a private mark on them as well. The prisoner was in my employ three or four times a week, till within a day or two of my finding the property. McKee is a perfect stranger, and was never employed in my house.</p>

            . My husband is a compositor - we live in Craven-buildings, Drury-lane. I have known the prisoner a long time - I pawned some napkins at Cameron's; I bought the duplicates of them of the prisoner's wife, who had pawned them; she said she was distressed, and I bought the duplicates of her at different times; I gave her the money - she got them out; I pawned them again, and gave the duplicates to Mr. Lovegrove; I pawned some more napkins at Lamb and Co.'s, in Stanhope-street; his wife had sold me the duplicates of them also, and I redeemed and pawned them; his wife brought me four tea-spoons one night, saying she was in such misery, would I buy them of her - I gave her 17s. 6d. for them; I bought the duplicate of two more - she got them out, and I pawned them again, at Gideon's, with a mustard-spoon. I cannot say whether the prisoner knew of my having them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever know me in any other situation? A. Yes - I knew him keeping a tavern at Leith once.</p>
               <p>MR. LOVEGROVE. I never saw his wife at my house but once, that was seven or eight months ago, when she called to say he was engaged; she only came into the counting-house, and had no access to the property.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 6th of February Mr. Lovegrove gave the prisoner in charge, at his lodgings, No. 47, Mary-le-bone-lane; Mr. Lovegrove claimed a decanter, a cut glass, and a knife, with his name on it, which were in the room; the prisoner said he could give me no account of them, and he knew nothing of the things.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I admit the napkins are his - they always gave me a supper to take home, and I took them to wrap it in, when I had no glass-cloth of my own, and, as I did not go there every day, I must have forgotten to return them; as to the glass and rummer, they are mine; I never remember taking a tablecloth. I have kept a tavern, and had 160l. worth of plate in my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Hill Street, Walworth, and am a merchant's clerk—on 31st August, about 1.30 in the day, I was on the Custom House Quay—I saw the prisoner by my side—there were some boys bathing, but I could not see them; there was a crowd in front of me—the prisoner's sleeve shaved my sleeve, and I turned round—he said "You have lost your watch"—I found my chain hanging, and the watch gone—I had seen it about three minutes before—the prisoner said "There are two gentlemen up there, I believe they have got it"—I did not see any one, and I said "I believe it is you"—he said "Search me"—he had a baby in his arms, and his wife was waiting for him—he gave the baby to his wife—I don't know what became of her—a policeman took him into custody—I saw the watch at the Police-Station—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 819). On 31st August, about 1.30, I saw the prisoner coming off the Custom House Quay, followed by the prosecutor—he was running—I stopped him, and asked him what he was running for—he said "I suppose I can run if I like"—when he saw me coming he threw something to a youth, fourteen or fifteen yards away—Port came up and said he had lost his watch—I asked whether he had seen the prisoner by his side, and he said he had—I took him to the station, and while I was giving in the charge the watch was brought in, and I was told it was found in Thames Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The policeman came down and saw the mob, and the prosecutor said he had suspicion of me, and he gave me into custody. The policeman never said anything about passing the watch to a boy, till it was brought in, and then he said to the sergeant, "I saw him pass something to a boy." Why was, not the boy token. I had a child on my left arm; it is not feasible that I could take the watch. I never offered to run. I never left the prosecutor, and he said he had suspicion that I had his watch.</p>

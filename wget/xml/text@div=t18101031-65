            . I am a seedsman in Holborn. On the 8th of October this man came to my house, he said he had some seeds to sell, I agreed so give him five shillings a pound for the Minenet seed; I had some suspicion that he had come improper by it; I desired my young man to weigh it, he came and told me there was eight pound of it; I told him to tell the person to leave his name and address and call the next morning, he left his name, Smith, gardener, Paddington. I called at Messrs. Fisher and Clarkson to make enquiry, they said, there was a man of that name worked for them. I saw the Minenet seed at Mr. Fisher's, I have no doubt that the seed the prisoner brought to me, is of the same bulk.</p>

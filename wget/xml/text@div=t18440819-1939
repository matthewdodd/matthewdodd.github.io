                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 153). On Sunday, the 28th July, about half-past one o'clock in the morning I was in Drum-lane, Ealing, and met a tall stout man, and found the prisoner lying in a field at the back of a quickset hedge with a mare pony—I went within a few yards of him and said, "Hallo, mate"—he lifted up his head but never spoke—he laid down again—I asked what brought him there—he made no answer—I asked him if the pony belonged to him—he said it did not, it belonged to the field, he thought—it had a halter round its neck, and the other end of the cord was round the prisoner's leg—while I was speaking to him I heard a footstep but saw nobody—I found the gate of the field locked—my sergeant came up, and we took the prisoner to the station—in coming from the Magis<lb></lb>trate the prisoner said if he had known as much last night he should have had the other man apprehended, as well as himself.</p>

On the 13th of May, a little before eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop. My wife was in the shop. He asked for a bit of sponge. She served him with a piece of sponge. It came to ten-pence. He asked for change of a one-pound note. She counted out the change; six three-shilling Bank tokens, and one shilling and two-pence. She rang the bell for me as I was going across the counter. He threw the note across the counter, as I was coming behind the counter. I took up the note. I said, I do not think this is a good one: we cannot see by this light: I will go to the light. He had got the sponge. I was returning from behind the counter to go to the door. I went to the door, and perceived it was a bad one. He took the six three-shilling tokens, and the shilling, leaving the two-pence behind him, and ran off. I pursued him to Shoe-lane, into Holborn. I told him it was a bad note he had given me. He said, he thought it was a good one. I took him, and put him into Mr. Skinner's, the tobacconist, shop. I saw it was a false note. The three ones were turned into ="pound=" with writing. The prisoner put the note into his mouth, and tried to swallow it, and he did swallow it. We took him to St. Andrew's watchhouse, and when we searched him we found only one three-shilling token upon him. I have every reason to believe that his associate had got the sponge, and the other property from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-bouse and beer-shop in Waterloo-terrace Commercial-road, in. the parish of Stepney. On the night between the 15th and 16th of March, I was the last up in the house—I went to bed about eleven o'clock—all the doors at the back of the bouse were left on the latch—I did not consider anybody could enter the house the back way; but in front, every thing was bolted—there are two doors behind my house, which open into the back yard—they were left dosed, but on the latch, and could be opened from the yard—there is one door in front, that was locked, and the windows were ail fastened, all shut down close—between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a noise which I con sidered was the wind and rain beating against the front of the house—I had not been to sleep—I listened, and heard much the same noise, till I heard a brass candlestick drop into the water-jug in my own room—I had left it carelessly on the end of the wash-hand-stand that night, and thought it had fallen in by itself—the jug was standing on the wash-hand-stand, uiderneath where the basin is usually put, and there was no basin, so that it could fall into the jug—I still listened, and shortly after lost the tick of my watch—I had placed my watch on the corner of a little bracket on my wash-hand-stand—I then looked out of bed, and saw a parcel in the room by the wash-hand-stand, which I knew was not there when I went to bed, but I could not tell what it was—it was up in the further corner of the room where the watch was—I then got out of bed, and put my hand on this parcel, which I did not know was a man; but I put my hand on him, and Dp his back, and then on his face, and found it was a man—I collared him immediately—he was all but lying down, on his hands and knees—I</p>

               <p>dragged him from there, close against the bedside, and sung out for the police—in a short time one came—I had called my son, who was in bed with me before that, and he came in two minutes—I told him to get a light immediately—he went down stairs for it, and brought it up tome—he and the policeman came up stairs both together, as nearly as possible—when the light came I found the prisoner to be the person I had hold of—he made no resistance, but begged hard for mercy—I knew him about four years ago—he had lived with me for about twelve months in Ratcliife-high-way—I found my watch hanging across the wash-hand-stand, balancing, the watch on one side, and the chain and seals on the other—the bracket it had been upon, is a little triangular piece, over the wash-hand-basin—there is a little court called George-court, behind my house, it leads out into George-street—two water-closets part my yard from the court—my wall is about eleven feet high—he must have come over both of those water-closets—he could not come any other way—he had been at my house the night before, and had a cup of coffee, and two half-pints of beer-be left about a quarter before eleven o'clock—I let him out myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called in on this occasion, and found the prisoner in the hands of the prosecutor, in his bed-room—he was partly under the bed, and <hi rend="italic">cruppled</hi> down, with his legs under the bed—I desired him to stand up—he said, "Have mercy on me, forgive me; I will make it all right"—I took him into custody—the prosecutor showed me the watch, balancing with the watch inside the place where the basin should have been, and the seals outside—the candlestick was upset, down in the water-jug—the prisoner was without shoes or stockings, and he said they were down stairs, but I could not find them—there is a wall which separates the adjoining premises—there are two little tene<lb></lb>ments in a yard—it is a passage from the public street—there is a dust-hole in the court, about half-way up the privy, it has a top on it-a person could get on that dust-hole, and over the wall—I did it with great ease myself—there were no marks on the outside doors, but they were both open.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a smith, and live in Payne-street, Islington. On the afternoon of the 6th of September, I was at the London Spa, at the. corner of Exmouth-street, about ten minutes to two o'clock—I saw Mawbey sitting on the stone kirb—I then saw Rex come out of a baker's shop, and pass something to Mawbey—they both kept in conversation, and went up Rosoman-street—Mawbey kept showing something to Rex which was in his right hand—I <hi rend="italic">followed</hi> them to Liverpool-road—they still kept in company—I there saw Langridge, and told him—he took the prisoners into custody, and took a bag out of Mawbey's pocket—he asked me to hold it while he searched the other—I did not see what was in the bag till we got to the station—there was a shilling found in Mawbey's hand.</p>

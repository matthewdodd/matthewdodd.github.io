                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol, at Stratford. On Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 29th of April, about five o'clock, I was in the neighbourhood of Ilford, returning from the station, in company with Johnson—near Mr. Thompson's field there was a drove of cattle in the road—I saw two men come from the horse-road down to the footpath—each of them had a bag on his shoulder, which appeared to be full—they came from among the cattle on to the footpath—we followed one of the men towards Ilford—he went up an alley which leads to the Britannia beer-shop—we followed him about fifty yards up this alley—he put down the sack, and we went up to him—it was Skiggs—I asked what he had got—he wade no reply—I opened the sack, and found it contained potatoes—I asked how he came, by them—he said he had found them on the road—he was standing at the door of a house, which was open—I gave him into Davis's custody—in consequence of some conversation with Davis, I went with him and John<lb></lb>son to Sales' house—before we went into the house, we listened—I heard a conversation, but could make no sense of what was said—we knocked, and Sales opened the door—he was asked what he had made of</p>

               <p>the bag of potatoes he had just brought in—he said he had no potatoes in his house; that he had brought none in, and had not been out of his house from the time he went to bed the night previous—this was about half-past five o'clock—we found a bag in a cupboard in the lower part of the house, similar to what I had seen the men carrying, and it contained potatoes—I cannot speak to Sales being one of the men I saw on the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Hogg—I saw two men, each with a sack on his back—they appeared to me to be crossing from a gap in Mr. Thomp<lb></lb>son's fence on to the footpath on the other side—there was clamp of potatoes about 100 yards from the gap—there was a field between that and the road—I observed the impressions of two persons coming through that gap, but the mould being loose, I could not ascertain the measure of the marks—I went to Sales's house—before I went in I listened, and heard some con<lb></lb>versation between a man and a woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I took Skiggs to the cage—I had reason to suspect who the other man was, and directed the officers to Sales—I heard him say something about the b—patrols, but I could not make out what—we went in, and Hogg asked for the potatoes—he said he had none in the house, but we found them in the cupboard, in a sack, and some were in a basket—they appeared the same sort as those in Mr. Thompson's clamp.</p>

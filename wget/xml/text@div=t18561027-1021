                  </hi>. I am a meat and poultry salesman in Newgate-market. The prisoner was in my service—I gave him 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy some poultry in Leadenhall-market, on 1st Jan. last—he came back to me in the afternoon, and said he could not see anything at all likely to suit me, but he knew of a vessel coming up from Sherborne with some geese in, and if I would let him keep the money, he would see and get a bargain—he did some little business for me, and bought some geese, and then went away with the money in his possession—I have not seen him since—this was on the very day he came into my service.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Such a thing was never known in the memory of man for a ser<lb></lb>vant of our description to go into service without settled wages—I left a service I was in, where I got 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, to go with him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not true—instead of his paying for these geese, I paid for them myself—I had known the prisoner previously, only occasionally, coming and buying—he was in a respectable service with Mr. Fowler—I knew him to be a respectable tradesman, and that is the reason I took him after he was dis<lb></lb>engaged.</p>

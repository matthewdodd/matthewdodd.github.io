               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. All hot bread, marked with an iron W, would be the same as that? - A. Yes, but I never saw an iron marker before.</p>
               <p>Q. But other bakers may have iron W's? - A. They may, but I never saw one.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 25th of last month the prosecutor came to me; I went with him to his house: I went down into the cellar with the prisoner, I wanted to look into his box; he said, I should not; I told him I had got a search-warrant, and I would break it open; then he told Mr. Ross some of his property was in his box, an begged for mercy, for God's sake; he said, if he sent him to jail, he would transport him; Mr. Ross said, he was taking every step to get him into a jail, robbing him every day; then I again desired him to open his box; he took the key out of his pocket to try to open it, but he could not open it; I took the key from him, and I could not open it; Wright, the witness, got a picklock, and opened it; I found in it five half-quartern loaves, and four sixpenny loaves, all new bread, it was not warm, and seemed to me to have been baked the night before; this was about two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you quite clear in your recollection that the bread was not warm? - A. I don't think it was warm, it might, because I only just handed it out of the box; I think it had been baked the night before; he said he was going to take it to his wife and family, because he was to leave his place that night; I then took him to the office, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The key produced by the prisoner did not open the box, but you were obliged to resort to a picklock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether it was warm or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by adding that it appeared to you to be baked the night before, it could not be warm then? - A. I mean that it might have been taken out of the oven about four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you went to Ross's? - A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. That was time enough for it to have cooled? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS WRIGHT sworn. - On the 25th of April last Mr. Ross desired me to come to his house; I found a constable there; the prisoner was in the bake-house; I went down stairs, and I was desired to open the lock, which I did, with a picklock that we use in our business; I found in the trunk five half-quartern loaves and four cakes; Kennedy took out the loaves, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am as innocent of the cause for which I stand here, as any body need to be; the Monday before my master and I had some words about a batch of bread, and he said, you villain, I will six you, you have got bread in your box, you carry bread out in your pockets; he said, you villain, I have put you in trust, and you are robbing me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him an excellent character. <rs id="t18010520-43-verdict233" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of King's-college hospital—on Monday morning, the 16th of Feb., about half-past six o'clock, the deceased, James Bostock, was brought to the hospital quite insensible, and the upper part of his body covered with blood, caused by a gun shot wound on the left ear—the ball lodged in the brain—he died shortly after three o'clock in the afternoon—I examined the head, found the ball in the right half of the brain, and produce it—that wound was, undoubtedly, the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have attended many cases in which accidents have happened to the head, in which there has been some pressure or congestion of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you found when that has occurred, persons subsequently may be subject to a certain partial derangement of the mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my own knowledge—it is likely—it might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a blow is inflicted on the head, the result of which has been insensi<lb></lb>bility for fifteen or sixteen hours, must that necessarily be the result of the brain being affected in some way or other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—it would be an affection of a somewhat serious character for a time—it might arise both from a rupture of a vessel or from concussion causing congestion of the vessels of the brain—congestion would not necessarily leave a turgidity in the vessels—it might do so in an elderly person, not in a young person—the circulation would go on right afterwards—the vessels might regain their strength, and they might not, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where either congestion or rupture of a vessel has once occurred, it would, I presume, leave those parts extremely susceptible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It all depends on the cause—congestion arising from a blow would not render the brain liable to disease in excitement—it may arise from some internal cause, from the body being out of order—congestion would be more likely to occur if a blow took place when the circulation of the blood was at all obstructed—cases of that kind have not come within my observation afterwards, merely at the time of accident.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>the cause subsides, the other would indicate disease of the organ—if a person of the prisoner's age met with an accident causing insensibility for fifteen or sixteen hours, and afterwards attended to his ordinary avocations and pursuits, I should certainly not infer there was any amount of disease in the brain.</p>

Finding nothing of it, I went and ac<lb></lb>quainted my master what had happened; my master was a little in drink, but not much, and said, 'Well, then, you must be the loser of it;' no more passed then, but I went up to get paid; when I went up I said, 'I have not found any tidings of the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., sir. (I had then been a second time.) I said, 'Cer<lb></lb>tainly I'll be the loser of it, and pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, if you will allow me;' he said, 'No, you won't, I will stop every b—y farthing to-night;" then said I, 'Sir, you doing so, what am I to keep myself on next week? 'Why,' says he, 'go to your mother and borrow money of her, as you have done be<lb></lb>fore. 'I said, I could not for shame's sake borrow of her, for I borrowed enough of her when I was out of work, the week I summoned you.' I imme<lb></lb>diately after made an offer to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that night out of the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said, 'Not a b—y farthing you shall have, so,' says he, 'it's no use your waiting, you had better go.' 'No, sir,' says I, 'I shall not, for my indentures express me as an indoor apprentice, and if you won't give me my wages, or part of them, you must keep me;' when he saw I would stop, he said, 'I'll d—d soon turn you out myself,' and then he commenced, and we had a scuffle; when he saw he could not get me out, he said, 'I'll not lay hands on you, I'll fetch a policeman; and on his going, mistress said, 'James, don't have no bother, but give the lad part of his money.' 'Not a d—d farthing,' he says; the policeman then came up, he gave me in charge for being riotous in his room and not going out, I stated what was the cause of it to the policeman, and he sadly wanted to take me—the policeman said, 'You must either pay it, or go down along with me;' so sooner than be locked up all Saturday night and Sunday I paid the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half a crown which I had borrowed of him, made it up 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I borrowed half a sove<lb></lb>reign of my mother; mistress was present, and I do not think she will deny it."</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were not present at the time of the accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when he was brought home to me he was in a state of insensibility—at that time he was an errand-boy—he remained ill somewhere about a week, and then went back to work—during the time he remained ill, I had to support him—I am a poor woman, and have an aged mother to support—he was then thrown upon me for support entirely—owing to my circumstances, when he went back he was not fully recovered—perhaps he might have gone back too early—in my opinion, he was not fully recovered—he did not remain there any length of time—before the accident occurred I had no reason to suppose he would leave the service—he came home to me after he had left the service, to live with me—from that time I always considered there was a difference in him from what there had been previous to the fall—it was about this time that these matters took place about the meals—he had not pursued that course of conduct before the fall—but he was a very strange child from his birth, he has a defective vision—as far as I can answer I think it was born with him—he used to come and desire to have his meals and then leave them—he did so very frequently—it was on account of my having observed him to be melancholy that</p>

               <p>he left me—that was after I had observed the alteration in his conduct—when he complained of his master's conduct to him, he referred to it generally—sometimes he said his master was a good master, and sometimes a bad master—he did not speak of any particular occasion, but generally—on one occasion I heard from him that his master had made a charge against him of breaking into his room—when I went to the master he did not exactly deny it, but seemed to intimate that he did not mean it—he said he heard a rumbling at the door—I was before the Magistrate with my son, the decision was in the master's favour—my son did not exhibit any anger about his master to me after that, or use any threats—he was not received back immediately to his trade, but he was in work when this matter happened—he did not go to work after his master had been to the Magistrate, not that evening, he did the next morning, and continued to work till the morning of this occurrence—I found this letter in his pocket—I wanted him to come home, and he preferred not doing so—there were never any words passed between us, or any quarrel—generally speaking he has been a kind son to me—he did not exhibit the least cruelty to me—I have received wages from him—I have had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one week—I have received wages from him on more occasions than one, towards my own support—he squints, and has bad sight at well—I cannot exactly answer whether it increased after the accident occurred.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Great Queen-street, Lin<lb></lb>coln's-inn-fields. I have been in business for fifteen years—I know the prisoner—I was called in to attend him from a fall that he had had, about seven years back—when I arrived at the house he was in a state of insensibility—I was called in in the evening—I should think he remained insensible about fourteen or sixteen hours—I did not remain with him during the whole time—I saw him on the following morning, at perhaps between ten and eleven—he had not then come quite to himself, but partly so—I remained in attendance on him perhaps about a week—I heard that it arose from a fall—I considered that insensibility arose from some oppression of the brain—I did not see any marks of the fall particularly on his head—I am hardly able to speak defini<lb></lb>tively as to the nature of that oppression—it is just possible that it might have arisen from rupture of a vessel, or from congestion—there is no doubt it must</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230066"></xptr>
               <p>have arisen from one of those two causes—(I fancy I had seen the prisoner once or twice before that accident for simple illnesses—I knew him but not to notice him)—it is just possible that either of those causes might affect the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it affect the brain in such a manner as to cause insanity in some patients? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I speak from inference, it might do so—supposing either of those causes existed at that time, it would undoubtedly render the brain more susceptible—great excitement of mind would very much add to the effect—I saw no more of the prisoner until about two years since, when I was called in and found him suffering from the effects of opium—he was in a state of stupor which would follow a large dose of laudanum—I think I attended him about three or four days at that time—I should say he was in danger certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would such a dose of opium as you found him labouring under affect the brain materially? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that it would affect the brain so, very materially, still I should augur that it would operate in that way—I should not say it would affect the brain permanently, on all occasions—it might do so permanently—if the brain were previously diseased or injured I think that would render the chances of permanency greater—if it were permanent, I should say it would interfere with the reason—he was not quite recovered when I left him—he was recovered from the greater danger—I have not seen him from that time to this—I have noticed his vision—if I was asked whether it is a congenital defect or a squinting, I should give an opinion that it might perhaps be on the side of congenital defect of the brain—persons having dis<lb></lb>ease on the brain sometimes exhibit such appearances—they do not always indicate an affection of the brain—from the sort of appearances I observed about the prisoner I should say there was something the matter with the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not an established distinction between conges<lb></lb>tion of the brain, and the effects that that congestion may have, if caused by ex<lb></lb>ternal violence in one instance, or by spontaneous congestion in the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know of no distinctive difference—I differ certainly from the gentleman who has been examined in the nice distinction he makes as to that—I do not think I could tell which was which—possibly congestion from violence might be the more permanent—I should consider that congestion arising from a blow would be more permanent in its effects than congestion arising from constitutional de<lb></lb>fect or from disease—the effect on the constitution might be longer, and might subject the individual to disease in after life—a state of insensibility may be produced from a blow, from the shock given to the brain, without causing any congestion of the vessels of the brain—I should have called this concussion—in this case I should have augured that it was accompanied by Congestion—there was coma—that might certainly be presented without any congestion—there was no other symptom in particular upon which I form my opinion that there was congestion, that might arise from mere concussion—I did not notice any external mark on the head—I looked for it—I conjecture that there was an amount of disease that might either be severe congestion or rupture of a vessel—I could not pledge my professional opinion that there was a rupture of a vessel—that would be followed by extravasation of blood on the brain itself—I saw no pressure on the optic nerve—I desired him to be kept very quiet, and used the ordinary treatment, quietude and raising the head—I took no blood—I saw him from day to day for a week—I do not think he resumed his employment again before I left him—I gave him emetics to remove the opium—I saw him from day to day for a week—when I first saw him he squinted—I do not say a person squinting from infancy always</p>

               <p>indicates a defect of the brain, I say it might indicate it—I say congenitally it might have an effect on the brain.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you venture to pledge yourself that every one who squints has an affection of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it that a person having a defective brain squints? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a person who squints may have a defective brain—I have known squinting occur at an advanced period of life from some defect of the brain, and have known it arise from a blow, from concussion—if a person looked straight for years, and met with an injury in the head and afterward squinted, I should infer that to some injury done to the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where they have squinted from birth that inference would not arise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If so, I should be inclined to believe it was a defect of the brain—I should not infer it congenital squinting nor to any cause in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose, if you saw a person in a state of insensibility, and heard they had a blow on the head, you would use the term concussion to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the brain would not be acting properly at the time—it is difficult to say whether it arises from congestion or a rupture of a vessel of the brain—it is not of necessity either—there may be concus<lb></lb>sion of the brain without a rupture of the vessel, or congestion—from a shock given to the nervous system—concussion is a term applicable to a rupture of the blood-vessels, to congestion of the brain, or a shock of the nervous sys<lb></lb>tem—I do not mean to say a person who squints from his birth is insane—there may be disease affecting the nerves of the eye connected with the nerves of the brain causing that appearance.</p>

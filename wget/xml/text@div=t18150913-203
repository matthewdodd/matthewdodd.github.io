            . I went with the last witness to the Marlborough, on the 30th of May. I remember Williams was a little intoxicated; not being able to get a bed in the house, he went to sleep in the back parlour. I did not see his money; but I saw him put his pocket-book into his breast pocket. When I left him, there was not a creature with him in the parlour; and people could only get into that parlour through the bar. I told the landlord, he had property about him. The next time I saw him was on the landlord of the Marlborough turning him out of doors; and then I took him to the Eagle in the Kingsland-road, and there he missed his money.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Marlborough. I remember the two last witnesses coming to my house, and the prosecutor going to sleep in my back parlour. Understanding he had property, I locked the other door which goes into this room, and then a person could only get in through the bar; nobody went into the room that I know of; but the room window was open after the prosecutor was gone; and it was not open when he first went to sleep. When he went out, he wanted to go into the taproom, but I would not let him, for fear he should be robbed; and I advised him to go home, and pushed him out at the door. I then went and shut the window down, but did not think of any robbery. In consequence of information I gave at the watch-house, Lilley was apprehended, and the other prisoner afterwards, at Coventry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ballantyne. I remember when Lilley came into the house with Trotter, but I don't know when he went out.</p>

I went out as far as Swan-yard, and saw Bagshaw and the man that was with him, and the young man who had gone out at the window, end Lilley, all walking about together.</p>

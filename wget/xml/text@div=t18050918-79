               <p>Q. In what state did you leave the door and windows of the house when you were sitting on the stairs? - A. The street door was locked and fastened with a bar, and the back door likewise; and there is a back window which looks out into the yard which is fastened by a hook.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window whole or broken? - A. There was one square of glass broke in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. That window was fastened, you say, in the usual manner by a hook? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time of the night, hear or perceive any thing? - A. About the hour of half-past three in the morning I heard a noise at the window, and I heard the back window open, and I also heard a person get in at this window, and walk along the tap-room and open the bar door; I then pushed the person that was sitting up with me, and rushed down stairs and opened the bar-door; I had a pistol in my hand, suspecting it to be a man; I called out, if any one offered to stir he is a dead man; I called out for a light, in the mean while they were bringing the light, I felt about the bar in the dark, and I caught hold of the prisoner's wrist; a light was brought, and I perceived it to be the prisoner,

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. She was a lodger in the house at that time; the house had been two houses; the lower part is in connection with each other, the lower part and the first pair are not separated, but the second pair of stairs there is a pair of stairs to go up to that separate by itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any door to them from the street? - A. There was to that part of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. You say the garret and the two pair of stairs have a private door in the street to go out of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that pair of stairs is open to every part of the house? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Just describe it. - A. You must go through the yard, and go through a back door to go into these two stories; there is no communication from the tap-room to the two pair of stairs and the garret.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman of the Royal Navy—on 20th December, I was living at the Red Lion public-house, St. George's—I stop there on and off—on the night of that day I met the prisoner Burns in the Prince Regent public-house, and went with her to 17, Perseverance-place; we went into a room where Miller was, and afterwards, when I was sitting on a chair, Cocklin came in and struck me three or four hard blows on my right eye, without my speaking to him, or striking him first—I then went into another room, and Miller followed me, locked the door, and got me some cold water to wash the blood off my face—Burns was in the other room; and then Cocklin burst the door open, and began to ill-use me again—he struck me several times—my jacket, and a long comforter, and a black silk handker<lb></lb>chief, were taken from me—Burns tore my trouser's pocket clean out, con<lb></lb>taining three half-crowns and a sovereign, in a little bag, which was all taken away—I had not a farthing when I came out—Burns also took my com<lb></lb>forter; Miller was very kind to me while I washed myself, and said that she would take care of it—I said, "Never mind."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 310). On 20th December, about half-past 10 at night, I went to Perseverance-place, and found the prosecutor bleeding from his nose, and his right eye swollen up—I searched both rooms and found the comforter in an old chest in Miller's room, and in the same room the black silk handkerchief in a coal cupboard—Miller said to Burns, "You know you have get the man's jacket, why do not you turn it up, I do not want to be locked up for it"—I could not find the jacket, it was not in the house.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were here read as follows;—Miller says</hi>,'This young woman brought him in, and Cocklin, who lives with Burns, burst open the door and struck him as he found him in his room.” <hi rend="italic">Burns says</hi>, “I met him in the Prince Regent, he asked me for a lodging; I sent him home.” <hi rend="italic">Cocklin says</hi>, “I found him in my room; he struck me with a poker, I struck him again."</p>

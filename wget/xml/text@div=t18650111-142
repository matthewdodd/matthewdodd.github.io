I am the wife of James Warren, of 3, Nelson-street, Plaistow Marshes—I know the prisoner—he came to stay at our house about three mouths before last September—he was only a lodger—he slept with another man up stairs—I take in single men lodgers—he paid me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for his board, lodging, and washing—he had not much clothes then, scarcely a second suit—he always paid me his rent when he fetched his money from his work—he was in work then at a sugar bakery—before that, he worked at Mr. Wagner's, a butcher's, but he was not lodging with me at that time—he came to lodge with me when he joined the sugar bakery—I knew from him that he had been at a butcher's—he left my house about the 20th September—he said he was going to Germany—after some little time, he returned—I don't know the date; it was on a Wednesday—he had been gone about a fortnight, as nigh as I can recollect—when he came back, he came in company with a young man—he brought him with him—he asked me if I could oblige this young man by taking him into my place, and he told me that he was a gentleman—I said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, if he is a gentleman, our place is only for poor men lodgers"—he called him "John"—he was a very handsome, nice-looking young man, a gentleman in every appearance—he was not much taller than Kohl, but a different made man altogether; he was very fair and slight, a gentleman built—I told the prisoner that my lodging was not fit for a person in that station—I ultimately agreed to take him in, and he came—after he had been with me some time, he asked me to take care of some things for him—it was six</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Whitmore—we occupied a back room in the prisoner's house, in Hoy-street—we went to lodge there on 11th October—we paid four shillings a week—I remember seeing the prisoner go out on Thursday morning, 3d November, about half-past 9 o'clock—the young man that they used to call John was with him, the young man who is now dead—the prisoner was dressed the same as usual, with a rough coat on and dark trousers—that was the only dress I ever saw him in—the deceased had on black trousers and a long overcoat—the coat was very dark, but I can't say whether it was black or not—he generally wore a little tie, and a turn-down collar—I did not notice whether he wore that on that morning—I did not notice how high the coat was buttoned—he generally wore it buttoned all up; but I do not remember how he wore it on that morning—he had a cap on his head—I next saw the prisoner at very near 3 o'clock—I heard him when he came in at 1, but I did not see him, only through the window—I saw him when he came in the hall, through the back parlour window—that was at 1 o'clock—he was then brushing his coat—he had his coat off—I was in the back parlour, and he was in the yard—I saw him through the window;—I saw that his coat was muddy—no other part of his dress was muddy that I saw—he stayed at home about a quarter of an hour—I did not speak to him at all during that time, or he to me—I saw him pass my door as he left the house—I next saw him a little before 3—he said he had been to look for the young man that he had missed, and. I asked him if he had found him—he said, "No"—he said he and the young man had been up to London, and he had missed him in the Commercial-road; that he went into a sugar-house, and left the young man outside—he did not say what sugar-house it was—he said it was a sugar-house in the Commercial-road—I asked him if he would go to Germany without the young man, as he had missed him—he said, yes, he would go; then he said he would wait two hours, and see if he came home before he would go—he then looked up at the clock, and said if he waited that time he should be too-late to go, as the boat went at half-past 5, and he would go at once and break open the young man's boxes—I said I thought the young man had missed him on purpose, because he had no money—Kohl said he had money, for he showed him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that morning—he then took a little poker out of the kitchen fire-place, and went up stairs with it—I did not go up with him; his wife's cousin did—he was in the kitchen, and Kohl said, "Some one come and see me break the boxes open, "and he was the only one that would go up—when the prisoner came down stairs again, he said he had broken the boxes open, and John would never come back, for all his things were gone—the prisoner did not go out again quite directly—he said he could not go to Germany then, for he had not got money enough—nothing more passed until he went out again, at a little past 4—he came back about 5—I noticed that he looked very ill when he came back, and I asked him if he had had any dinner that day—on the evening of that day he came to my door and said, "You know I was asking you about a knife I had missed in your room some time ago; here it is; I have found it in John's boxes;" and he showed it to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—I had seen that knife before—the prisoner was putting up a roller with it in my room the day I went into the house—that was the first time I saw it—he showed it</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On that Sunday night did you hear the prisoner ask your husband about being called? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not ask my husband particularly; he asked to be called, and my husband was present—he asked Mr. Wade; my husband heard him, and being up first, he called him—what the prisoner said was, would Mr. Wade call him when he got up in the morning—my husband an 1 Mr. Wade both got up at half-past 5, and whoever was up first called the other—I heard my husband call him on the Monday morning, about half-past 5—I heard him get up, and come down stairs and go out, I should think, about ten minutes after he had been called, as soon as my husband was gone—I saw him again between 7 and 8 that morning; he was then sitting at the kitchen table—I asked him if he had got the work he had been after—he said, yes, he had got it, but the gentleman had gone to Scotland, and would not be back for four days, and then he was going to work—I went to lodge at the prisoner's house on 11th October—during all the time I was there he had no work—they always seemed very poor—his wife has often said she wished he would get work, for she did not know what they should do if he did not—that was said in his presence.</p>

I work at Plaistow-wharf, and lodge in Hoy-street, at the house of a person named Zilch—I know the prisoner; I also knew the de<lb></lb>ceased—on the morning of 3d November I saw the prisoner and the deceased with him—they were walking towards the reed bed on the bank of the River Thames—I know the spot where the body was afterwards found—there is a path along the embankment—they were on that path—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>)—they were going in a direction from Hoy-street towards the reed bed—they were on the path of the river bank—I have since visited the spot were the body was found—I know the creek—there is a stile as you go from Plaistow<lb></lb>wharf towards the spot where the body was found—I see Plaistow-wharf marked upon this plan—I know a place called Corry's-hut—they were going from Plaistow-wharf to the other side of Corry's-hut—they were nearer to the reed bed than to Hoy-street when I first saw them—they had not passed Corry's-hut when I saw them—they had not got as far as the stile—at the end of Plaistow-wharf there is a turning that goes round to the left, and I lost sight of them there—when I first saw them they were between the sugar-bakery and Plaistow-wharf, walking in the direction of the reed bed, and when I last saw them they had got to the end of Plaistow-wharf—I was at work at Plaistow-wharf at the water-side—it was about 10 o'clock in the morning that I saw them—it might have been five minutes before 10, or it might have been five minutes after 10; it was near upon 10—I never saw the de<lb></lb>ceased alive after that—I next saw the prisoner the same evening after I left work, about half-past 4 o'clock, at Zulch's, No. 2, Hoy-street, where I was lodging—I spoke to him—he spoke to me first—he said he had missed the young man, John, who had lodged with him; that they had both been up to London; that he (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) went into the sugar-house, and left John outside, and when he came out John had gone—he did not say what sugar-house—I said in reply, "I saw you and John this morning down on the banks of the River Thames"—the prisoner made no observation upon that.</p>

B. 6"in ink—the portion of shirt was on the side; the left arm—I searched the pockets, and found a farthing and a small piece of paper—the body was lying on its back, with the legs quite straight—the right arm was lying over the chest, and the left was lying down by the side, with the hand extended—I observed the condition of the neck where the head had been severed from the body—there was a dent in the earth, apparently where the back of the head had been—small pieces of bone were lying by the neck, and a small portion of brain—the flesh had been eaten all round the bone, apparently by rats—the body appeared quite fresh, but there was no blood, or scarcely any—I had the body removed to the Graving Dock Tavern—I took the prisoner in custody that day at</p>

I am a surgeon in Barking-road, Plaistow—on the morning of 8th November I was sent for to see the dead body of a man about half-past 11, at the Graving Dock Tavern—the body had no head at that time—I found the muscular fibers of the neck all eaten away, appa<lb></lb>rently by the rats; the clavicles and vertebrae were laid bare—the cervical vertebrae had been severed as if by a chopper or some sharp instrument—there had been an attempt to sever the vertebrae a little lower down, but it had only partially succeeded—there were several incisions on the skin at the front part of the neck, partially dividing the skin—a knife or some sharp in<lb></lb>strument had been used in the first place, and there had been several at<lb></lb>tempts made to divide the skin, as if it had been done by an instrument that was not very sharp—the instrument was sharp enough to divide the skin and muscles, after several attempts being made to do it—two instru<lb></lb>ments had decidedly been used, a knife or an instrument of that kind, and a hatchet or chopper or some heavy instrument, I mean an instrument of the kind produced—the body was eaten by rats in different parts; the skin and part of the muscular fibre of the left shoulder were eaten away, and also two places on the right arm, and the flesh from both hands was gnawed away, but more extensively from the left—I did not discover any marks of vio<lb></lb>lence upon the body except those I have spoken of about the neck.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether that blood spot was human blood! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say positively as to that; it had all the characteristics of human blood—the blood of many other animals is like human blood—it was not the blood of a reptile, or of a bird, or a fish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What kind of analysis did you make! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first place a portion of the surface of the cloth was scraped off on glass and examined under the microscope—it was observed that the blood had coagulated upon the fibres, and that the coagulation was of that kind which we call living coagulation; that is, that the blood had coagulated by a living process upon the cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean shortly after it bad left the body! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Shortly after—blood immediately removed from the living animal coagulates by a spontaneous process—the coagulation had gone on upon the cloth—the micro<lb></lb>scope does not discover albumen—the coagulation was fibrinous, not albuminous—the living coagulation is by fibrine, not albumen—the piece of cloth was then put into a test tube with a few drops of water, and I obtained a solu<lb></lb>tion of blood which, contained the colouring matter of blood, not bleachable by common processes—it was tried with chlorine, which will bleach almost any other colour, but will not blood—it was then subjected to heat, and I found that it contained soluble albumen which was thus coagulated—those are the characteristics which enabled me to speak very positively that it was blood, and that it was living blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you could not say whether it was human blood! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the measurement of the globules, they were about the same size as the human, about the four thousandth part of an inch, but as many animals have the same sized globules I cannot undertake to say it was human blood.</p>

I am an architect and surveyor—I made the plans produced—they accurately represent the places that they purport to represent—I have measured certain distances—from the Iron Sugar Works in Church-lane, Whitechapel, to Hoy-street, is three miles and 840 yards—from Hoy-street to the reed-bed, is about a mile and a half, following the footpath along the Thames; you might go a nearer way by cutting across a piece of pasture—the distance from the reed-bed to the Iron Sugar Works is four miles, 740 yards, wanting forty yards of five miles—that is the only road you can go, in the direct route—from Corry's hut to the footpath in the reed-bed is 440 yards, and from Corry's hut to the bend at the end of Plaistow Wharf is 240 yards—the total length of the reed-bed is a few yards over half a mile, from one end to the other—the police-constable Martin pointed out to me the respective positions of the head, the body, and the knife—the body laid about seventy yards from the centre of the foot<lb></lb>path, on the river-bank in the reed-bed—the head was about forty feet further on towards the river, and the knife about twenty feet from the body, to the left, forming almost an equilateral triangle—I have marked on one set of plans, the respective positions occupied by the body, the head, and the knife—this is the plan—I have correctly marked the places pointed out to me by Martin—the points that I have put there explain those positions, with the references at the side—the body was forty feet nearer the path along the river-bank than the head.</p>

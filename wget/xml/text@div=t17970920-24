               <p>OLLA HANSON sworn. - On the 18th of August, I went into the prisoner's house and asked her for a baron of soup, and some bread and bees, and I asked her what I was to pay, and she said, one shilling, she said there was time to take a dish of tea with them, if I liked; I had not drank above a cup or two of tea, before a coach came before the door, she said, she had a letter to go up farther into the town, and she asked me if I would go in the coach along with her; and when we got to the house where she was going with the letter, I called for half-a-crown's worth of punch to drink; then I paid for the punch, and changed a guinea there; when we were come out of the room where we had the punch, there were two coachmen that they called brothers, and she called one of them into the coach, and she sat down along side of him; she said to the brother of the coachman, you can go inside of the coach if you like, and we went home back again, and then there were three inside of the coach; then I said to her, if she would go with me to Mr. Davies's, in New Gravel-lane, I would spend another half-crown's worth of punch; then I went with her to that house, I asked the coachman how much I was to pay for the coach, and then I paid the coachman six shillings; I said, it was too much money to pay him, and this woman said, never mind, you must not be niggardly, you pay three shillings, and I will pay three shillings; she asked me if I would trust her with a dollar, and she had my silver watch in her bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get it there? - A. When she went into that room, she had it in her bosom, and she broke the key, she took it from me.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to give you the money? - A. I had a run with a captain from the West-Indies, and I left the money with him, and that woman said, no, you have not that money, I produced it, and then she robbed it out of my hand.</p>

               <p>JOHN GODFRED sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a slop-seller.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor? - A. Yes; he called upon me on the Saturday morning; says he, I owe you some money, and I hope it will be now in my power to satisfy you; I said, what is the matter with you, you have got no buckles in your shoes; you have been taking, have not you? says he, I do not know where they are; says I, why I suppose you have lost them, have not you? no, I hope not; says I, where have you been last night? I do not know, Mr. Godsred; you do not know, says I; say he, you will know the house I have been in, if I tell you; where have you been then? in the cook's shop above Shadwell Church; have you lost your watch? no, I have not, Mr. Godsred, I know where it is; who has got it? Betsey; I gave it to her in care, and she put it in her bosom; you have not lost your money, have you? I hope not, Mr. Godfred; if you will be so kind as go along with me, I will get it; says I, you always come to me when you are in distress, why do not you go to your landlord, and get him to go along with you? my landlord is very poorly, and I will satisfy you to go with me; did she take your money form you? he said, no, she did not indeed, Mr. Godsred; he said, she did not take his watch, he left it there; has she got your buckles? I do not know, Mr. Godfred; I suppose you have lost the whole kit, you have been in a bad house, or among some bad girls; he said, no, he had not; says I, I advised you the other day to give your money to the landlord; he said, I have paid Mr. Peterson, and have left my money with another man; I had it all about me yesterday, when I went to Betsey's house; I said, how came you to carry so much money about you; he said, he was going to lodge it in some gentleman's hands, to send it home to Norway; I asked him why he did not go to the gentleman's house at first; he said, Betsey was going up into the city about some business, and he should be welcome to go along with her; he was to pay half the coach-hire, and she was to pay half; I asked him if he went in the coach with her; he said, yes, he did; I asked him if there was any body but he and her in the coach; he said, he did not know; why then said I, you have been groggy or tipsy, that you did not know what you were about? I was not, Mr. Godfred, I was only rather sleepy; did you sleep in the coach? no, I did not; why then you were stupified, I suppose; he said, he was not; did she overhaul your pocket, or did she fumble about you in the coach; he said, no; did she take any money away from you in the coach; he said, no, she did not, Mr. Godfred, I took d-d good care of that; did you go into any house? yes; I went to a house, and we had some punch, and that I paid for; and we went into another house, and there we had another half-crown bowl of punch, and that I paid for; I asked him what houses, but he could not tell; then we came right home; home where? to Betsey's house, and there I had a shillingsworth of rum and water, and got change for a dollar; he said, he had five five-pound notes; did you give those five-pound notes to Betsey? I do not know, Mr. Godfred, I believe I did; did you give her any other money? no, I lent her a dollar to pay the coach-hire; did she take the money form you? no, she did not; who was there besides yourself? there were three or four sailors; can you tell the man that took your money? no, says he, I can tell no such thing; where were you when you first missed your money? outside of Betsey's window; what time was it? between eleven and twelve o'clock; did you sleep there? yes, I believe I did; when you awoke, which way did you feel your self robbed; were your small clothes open, or your trowsers open? no, I believe not, Mr. Godfred; I felt in my shoes, and the buckles were gone, and I missed my money too; was the house shut up then? yes, it was; I was outside of the door till between eleven and twelve, they pushed me out; where did you go to afterwards? I went down into Narrow-street, to go to Peterson's house; I asked him why he did not knock at Peterson's door; he said, he did knock at the door, but he was not up; I said to him, why you tell me so many stories, do tell me the truth; says he, I will tell you the truth, if you will go along with me to Betsey's house; says I, if you will tell me the truth, I will go along with you, then I may have some ground to go upon? yes, Mr. Godfred, I will tell you the truth, I slept in the mast makers yard, right opposite Peterson's house, in Narrow-street; says I, if you slept there, you are certainly done; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200034"></xptr>said, no, I hope not, Mr. Godfred; you are certainly robbed, you may depend upon it; no, I am not robbed; you go along with me to the house I speak of, and I think the money is in the house I went with him then immediately to the prisoner's house; as soon as he got in, an old woman saluted him, and said, well done, my lad, Betsey is gone out to market, she will soon be back, but she has left your watch hanging there, for fear you should come for it before she came back; yes, yes, says he, I know my watch, I know my watch very well, but never mind the watch; but there is some money left in this house last night that belongs to me; is not there, says I? I said to him, why do not you speak now? he said, never mind it, Betsey is not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Betsey afterwards come back? - A. I did not stop so long; says he, I will pay you one guinea if you will stop till Betsey comes; says I, I will stay no longer; I said to him, did she take the watch from you, and he said, no, Mr. Godfred, she did not, I gave it to her; I then said, did she take the money from you? no, she did not; then I asked him again, have you given the money to her? I do not know, Mr. Godfred, I think the money is in this house; I then told him I would stop no longer.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house is not far from her's? - A. No; I have known her four years; I always knew her to be a very industrious woman; and there are so many coming backwards and forwards to my house, that use her house, that I must have heard if she had been guilty of any thing of this kind; she lodged sailors in her house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a man of the name of Turbon Acres present at any part of the conversation? - A. Yes, most of the time.</p>
               <p>Turbon Acres, Samuel Hanson, and Abraham Hendersen, confirmed the evidence of Mr. Godfred, as to his conversation with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character for honesty and modesty.</p>

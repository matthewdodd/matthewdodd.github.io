                  </hi>. I am assistant overseer of the parish of St. Marylebone. On Friday, 20th March, I was present when the inquest was held on this child at the workhouse—on the next day, from information I received, I went to St. Pancras workhouse, and saw the prisoner; she was in the insane ward, in bed, partly undressed—I asked her what her name was—she said, "Crawley"—I repeated it twice over, and then she said, "No, my name is not Crawley; my name is Price"—she said that Crawley died in Marylebone workhouse about three years ago—that is so—I believe she had lived with Crawley—I asked her what children she had—she said, "I have a boy about seven, who is living with my sister; I had a baby"—I said, "You had better not make any statement to me, as I may have to repeat it, unless you wish to do so"—she then said, "I had a baby, but I threw it over the bridge," or" into the water, on Monday night"—she said, "I made away with it; do you know where it is now?"—I said, "Yes, it is in Marylebone workhouse"—she said, "When was it brought there?"—I said, "It was brought on Tuesday morning, about 9 o'clock"—she said, "I threw it over the bridge on Monday night, about half past 8 o'clock; I intended to throw myself in also, but a policeman saw me, and hallooed to me, and I was frightened, and ran away"—she had half a shawl on—I said, "Is that your shawl?"—she said, "Yes, it is; the other half is what the baby was wrapped in"—on the way to the station she repeated several</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a bachelor of medicine. I examined this child—supposing it had had a ligature tied round its neck, and been thrown into the water, it might present such appearances as I saw, but death from suffocation would not correctly express it—I first saw the child on Tuesday morning, 17th March—it had a ligature tied once tightly round the neck—it was linen of some kind—it was twisted—the cause of death was not very obvious—the appearances of suffocation were not well marked—the only diseased condition I noticed was some collapse of the lungs and more than ordinary vasculation of the intestines, appearances as if the child had had diarrhoea—I think those appearances were not suffi<lb></lb>cient to cause death, taking the generally nourished appearance of the child into consideration; it appeared to have been properly nourished—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060032"></xptr>
               <p>appearances about the intestines would not indicate any aggravated state of diarrhoea; there was no ulceration, but an inflammatory state—there was a slight amount of fluid blood on the right side of the heart, which was somewhat indicative of suffocation, but not well marked evidence of it—I think, considering the collapsed state of the lungs, and the child probably being in a low condition, judging from its flabby appearance, that the appearances of suffocation would not be so well marked as in a more robust child, or a child whose lungs were not col<lb></lb>lapsed—the other organs were healthy—the appearances were not opposed to death from suffocation, but I could not give a positive opinion—the effects would be the same in suffocation and strangulation, as far the ventricles of the heart were concerned—the appearances would not justify me in saying that death was from strangulation, though not inconsistent with it—I think I have seen cases of children who have died of cold and exhaustion from exposure—I ought to add that I do not think that death was produced from drowning, which would also cause suffocation—judging from the mark round the neck, which corresponded with the situation of the ligature, I should be rather inclined to think that death was caused as a result of that ligature, but I would not state positively—children dying from exhaustion would probably present a similar appearance of lung—collapse of the lung is a very common appearance after death from any exhausting cause; anything that lowers the vital powers, but to a greater extent than was presented here—the ligature was tied tightly round the neck, so tightly that I was obliged to cut it behind—I do not say that death could not have been produced by the ligature; I think it might, and I incline to the opinion that it was so—I believe it is impossible to distinguish marks made immediately before and immediately after death; after some interval, it is plainly to be distinguished—the marks round the neck of this child were consistent with their having been made while it was alive or very shortly after death.</p>

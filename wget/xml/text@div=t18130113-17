On the 17th of December, I lost two pair of men's shoes, and two pair of women's shoes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130010"></xptr>and three odd ones. The two pair of women's shoes were hanging up against two panes of glass in the window, and the two pair of men's shoes were in the window.</p>
               <p>When did you miss them - A. About six, or a few minutes before six o'clock, on the 17th of December last.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suppose that the prisoner was the person that took the shoes - A. I was at work in my shop. I was alarmed by a woman coming in, and saying there were three persons-lurking about my shop; one of them, she said, was a big man; he sat at the end of the window, and the other were two lads. There is a place outside of my shop where you may rest a bundle. I got up and looked, and then I set down to my work again; then my little boy cried out, father, father, there is a man's hand in the window. I looked round, and saw my wife take the prisoner in custody; she said, you are the man I want. I went and took him by the collar, and dragged him into the shop. I immediately went to the window to search for what shoes were missing. I found those missing that I have mentioned, and three odd shoes.</p>
               <p>MRS. STEPHENS. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 17th of December, between five and six o'clock, in consequence of the alarm made by the woman, I stood on the step. I heard my son say, father, the man's hand is in the window. I then saw the prisoner's hand in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise of breaking of the glass - A. No; the window was cracked. As soon as my child spoke to his father, I saw him draw his hand back. He dropped the shoes, and when he drawed his hand back; I took him by the collar, and I said, you are the man I want, and with the assistance of my husband I got him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any more than one shoe found - A. Not by the window. We have got that shoe here; it is one of the odd shoes.</p>
               <p>- TOWNSHEND. I am an officer. I took the prisoner in custody. I searched him, and found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are three odd shoes; they were found in the window. The fellows of these three were taken and gone. The shoe that the prisoner dropped fell in the window. The two pair of men's shoes, and two pair of women's shoes, and the three odd shoes, were entirely gone. I can speak to these three odd shoes; they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was stopping by the window to see a man strike a light; this woman came out, and said, where are the shoes. I said, what shoes. She said, the shoes that I took out of the window. She directly collared me, and took me into the shop.</p>

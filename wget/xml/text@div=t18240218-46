On the 17th of January I had occasion to look at a pane of glass in my front window, which had been previously cut or started in two directions. I observed one of the pieces of glass almost loosened, but not out, and, just after four o'clock, I observed the two prisoners at the window, and told my servants 
               <persName id="t18240218-46-person482">Freeman</persName>
             and Carpenter. I sent Freeman into Holborn, to stand near the hackney coaches, and told Carpenter to have his eye on the pane of glass; the prisoners separated several times, and came backwards and forwards to the window for nearly half an hour - they then came back together to the broken pane. Carpenter opened the door, and pursued - Salt ran off down Holborn. I went out immediately, and secured Gibson, who ran among the hackney coaches. I brought him into the shop. Carpenter and Freeman immediately brought Salt in with a pistol, which I missed from the window; they were taken to the watch-house, and, on searching, the constable found a knife on Salt; the blade of it fitted the marks made in the window frame - a piece of cork was found in the shop, which fell from one of them; there was a quantity of grease at one end of it; the piece of glass was out of the window, and we could not find it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had you lighted candles - A. No. It was between four and five o'clock, and quite light. I was in the shop, and saw them for half an hour - there is a glass case to my window. I have to look through two glasses - my attention was directed to them. I have seen them both before at my window repeatedly, and knew them well. I cannot be mistaken in them; the glass was loose when I looked at it, but not a piece of it was out. I have inquired, and find Salt's mother is a decent woman, and that he bore an honest character.</p>

            . I am Mr. Parker's servant. On the 17th of January, I first saw the prisoners standing against the window, lurking about, and having seen them several times before, I suspected them, and stood in the shop nearly twenty minutes looking at them. Master sent me out the back way - I went out to the coach-stand, and in about five minutes saw the arm of the prisoner, Salt, go towards the glass, and directly afterwards Carpenter opened the door and ran out. Salt ran away, and we both pursued; and when he had got near the end of the coach-stand, he threw the pistol away - I saw him swing his arm, but did not see the pistol come from him. I stopped at that spot till Carpenter brought him back to me, and he asked him what he had done with the pistol - he said,</p>
               <p>"What pistol? - I have not had any pistol." Carpenter said,</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me that, for I saw you take it out." We both looked for it, and found it under a coach, opposite to where he threw his hand out - I took it back to the shop, and gave it to Mr. Parker.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Parker's service. On the 17th of January, about four o'clock, he desired me to watch the window. I saw the prisoners lurking about, to and from the window, for half an hour - they then both came to the window, and I saw Salt push the piece of glass out; he then put his two fingers inside, and lifted a pistol off a peg which it stood on, and took it through the hole in the glass. I then moved from where I stood. Salt ran off, and on opening the door Gibson ran also. I pursued Salt, who was first, running down Holborn; I first came up with Gibson, but did not meddle with him, and after I had passed him he cried out,</p>
               <p>"Master, I have got the pistol." I answered,</p>

               <p>"I will let you know who has got it;" and when I came within three yards of Salt, he turned his hend and saw me; he put his left hand towards his pocket, and I very distinctly saw him throw the pistol under one of the coaches. I still pursued, and took him about five yards farther, and brought him back. Foreman met me - we found it under the coach, and took it back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the state of the glass before they came up to it - A. Yes; no part of it was out before, but it had been cracked - it was quite daylight.</p>

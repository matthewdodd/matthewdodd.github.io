            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 27th, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner was walking along Duke-street, Manchester-square, with the clothes under his arm; I asked him what he was carrying there; he gave me no answer; I asked him again; he said nothing but his own. I then asked him to let me look at them; he ran; I sprang my rattle, and ran after him. He ran about an hundred yards; he tried to throw them over the area rails; he could not; the clothes dropped on the pavement. Atkins, another watchman, stopped him. We took him and the clothes to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>- ATKINS. I am a watchman. I took the prisoner after he had dropped the cloaths. When I took the prisoner, Green was running after him; he dropped the cloaths in Edward-street.</p>

On the night of the 27th of April, I was standing at the shop-door, I saw the prisoner walk up and down the court that night; the last time I saw him was about ten o'clock. He put his foot into the side door; I asked him what he wanted there; he asked me if our house was not No. 14. I said, yes. He then walked down the court.</p>

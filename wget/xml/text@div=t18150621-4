            ; I live at No. 11, Sackville-street, Bethnal Green. I was returning home from Edmonton, on the evening of the 23rd of May; Mrs. Chaplain was with me; at about a quarter before ten, we were in Kingsland-road. The reason I was so late was that I was in expectation of a friend accompaning us home. I had a bundle in my hand, which contained two pair of shoes, two handkerchiefs, and some other little things; the shoes belonged to me, and the rest of the things to Mrs. Chaplin. Nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210005"></xptr>happened to us until we came opposite to the Duchess of York public-house, at the same side of the way, a man came up to the side of me from the fields, by the side of the public-house, and laid hold of my bundle; he did not say a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he snatch it - A. No; he took hold of it, and tried to take it away; I resisted. He threw me down; by which means, he got the bundle, and ran away with it across the fields. I screamed out, murder, and two men came out of the Duchess of York, who followed him across the fields. I know the man; he was the prisoner at the bar; I looked at him while we were struggling for the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you frightened - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the man sufficiently to know that it was the prisoner at the bar? don't speak if you have any doubt - A. I am sure he is the man; he had on a light great coat, with white trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on - A. He had a hat when he first came up to me; which he lost in the scuffle, and it was picked up by Mrs. Chaplin. When he ran away, he went without his hat. The next time I saw him was on the Sunday following, at Worship-street office; I could swear to him at that time. I had been to Edmonton, to see my mother; it was close to the door of the Duchess of York public-house that I was robbed; there were no persons near.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was very much terrified; I resisted much; I was very much alarmed; but from the view I had of the person who robbed me, I am certain it was the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Thomas-street. On the evening of the 23rd, I and Mrs. Palmer were returning from Edmonton; I was going before her; a man came up to Mrs. Palmer; he did not speak; I heard the cry of murder, and turned round, when I saw Mrs. Palmer and the man struggling together; I could not assist her in the least, because I had a young child in my arms. The man was pulling the bundle out of her hand; she resisted very much, and he threw her down, and got the bundle. By her screaming murder, two young men came out of the Duchess of York. When he got the bundle, he ran across the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the two young men came out of the public-house, that the man who robbed Mrs. Palmer, ran across the fields - A. He was in the fields when they came out. One of the young men is here, his name is Sullivan. I did not see the man's hat fall, but I picked it up after he ran away. I should not know the hat if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man so as to know him again if you should see him - A. No, I did not, I only knew his dress; he had on a light great coat, and a pair of white trowsers.</p>

            . I am a weaver. I live in Old Haggerston, in the parish of Shoredicth. I was in the Dutchess of York public-house, on the evening of the 23rd of May; I heard the cry of murder, I thought it came from a woman. I and another young man ran out. We saw a man running across the fields; it was a moon-light night. We ran after him, but could not overtake him; I saw he had no hat on. The other young man is not here.

            . I am a dustman, I saw the prisoner at the Prince of Wale's public-house, in Oliver-lane, on Thursday night; I do not know what Thursday; it was after Easter, but I don't remember whether it was before Whit Monday. The prisoner was taken into custody on the Saturday after the Thursday on which I saw him. I asked the prisoner to drink with me. We had known each other. He said, I am in work now Jack, and said, he should be a pint with me. He also said he wanted to buy a hat; I said, I will sell you mine Henry; he said, what will you take for it I said five shillings, he said, he would give it me. I asked him what he had done with his own, and he said, he had cut the rim off, when he was at work in the brick-fields. He asked me if Mr. Armstrong the officer had enquired for him, at Mr. Clarke's in Oliver-lane, because he believed there was some information, against him; I told him, I did not see Mr. Armstrong there; he said, he would take the hat of me and was to have met me on the Saturday following to give me the money, when I heard that he was taken up.</p>

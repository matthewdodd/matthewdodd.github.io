The prisoner met me as I came down the lane, and he caught me round the waist, and held me tight, and lifted me up. I saw nobody else near at that time. I was frightened - he said, be d - d if he would not kill me. I cried out - he pulled my bundle out of my hand, and as he saw some people runing across the field - he dropped it. I picked it up, ran home and told my mother - he had not got far off when he dropped it - he met me.</p>

            . On the 11th of February I was at work near Mile-end, and heard this girl scream out - she was in a field. I looked round for a few moments, and saw the prisoner walking along the lane; the girl was then out of sight; the field comes into the lane - she had got from the lane into the field when I saw her. I went up to the prisoner - he did not resist - the girl's father was with me - he asked what we took him for - we told him for stopping a little girl; he said he was innocent, for he never saw her.</p>

               <p>Q. You said before the Magistrate, that you saw him on the bank at first - A. It was by the side of the lane, and then he went into the lane, and stood still till we came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before the Magistrate, that he ran, and you ran after him - A. I did not see him run; he ran a little when we first hallooed to him - he stopped before we took him.</p>

             re-examined. When I heard the scream I saw the girl, and soon after saw the prisoner, and could see no other man in the field or in the lane; he was about one hundred and fifty yards from the girl; there are high banks to the lane, a tall man could hide himself behind them, if he stood upright, for they are six feet high.</p>

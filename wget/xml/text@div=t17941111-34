Thursday, the 16th of October, I was there on duty between five and six in the evening, I was waiting for them to leave off work (the workmen) the warehouse was repairing, and the prisoner was one of the <rs id="t17941111-34-deflabel171" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourers</rs>

               <p>Q. Is it in leaf in the warehouse? - All in leaf, without it is brought from the King's warehouse, and then they are seized goods.</p>

            There was leaf tobacco where this man was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This you found in his jacket pocket? - Yes; and then searching further, I found a larger quantity in his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. The inside of his breeches, not in his pocket? - Yes, in the inside of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found this, did you secure him? - I secured him, and sent for a principal officer belonging to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the tobacco you found on him? - I sealed it up.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it sealed at the time? - The next morning I delivered it to the warehouseman; he sealed it up in my presence; it was Mr. Stone, the warehouseman to the Custom house.</p>

            What become of it in the night? - I locked it up, and put it in a place till I saw the warehouseman.</p>
               <p>Court. Never mind the next morning. Is that the same seal? - Yes, it is; and in the same situation as I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Shew the gentlemen of the jury what it is.</p>
               <p>Jury. I presume these are the merchant's marks.</p>
               <p>Roberts. The first name is the captain's, the next is the ship's name, and the other of the tobacco, the mark of the hogshead and the year.</p>
               <p>Court. There were none of these marks about it when you took it from the prisoner? - Yes, they were just the same as it is now, when I took it from him.</p>

               <p>Q. This is not the same as is sold in the shops? - No, it is not manufactured, not been finished.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that mark. I understand that tobacco was found with that mark on it? - He says so; it will ascertain the cask to which it belongs.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe this may be transferred fifty times before it gets out of their hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, if I wanted to thieve any thing I could thieve better than that; I found it outside of the gate; I worked a long time with that gentleman in his house, I behaved very honest while I was in his house.

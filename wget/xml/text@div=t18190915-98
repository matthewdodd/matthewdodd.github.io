On Sunday, the 25th of July, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, Mrs. Sharp and I went out - the servant went out at the same time. I pulled the door to; I am certain the spring-lock caught - all was then safe. I returned about half-past nine o'clock in the evening with Mrs. Sharp - I found the door shut. In consequence of information I received from next door I went in; there was no appearance of violence - my own key opened the door. I found two baskets of cut glass packed up in the shop - they were on the shelves when I went out - the baskets were not ours. I took a general survey of the shop, and found a quantity of property was quite gone. I went up two pair of stairs, and on Mrs. Sharp's drawers, I found the shop poker, which was in the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150034"></xptr>when I went out. The drawers had been rifled of their contents, and a large trunk containing wearing apparel almost emptied; a hair trunk containing women's wearing apparel was broken open and rifled; a small wooden box containing five 1 l. notes, and 2 s. in copper was also gone, and the bed-clothes greatly disturbed. I then went to the first-floor; some drawers were broken open there, and a few clothes taken. The bed in that room was also disturbed; I found nobody in the house - it was not quite dark. The prisoner was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your servant - A. I found her at the public-house next door waiting for us; it was known in the neighbourhood that we were going out early that morning. I missed all the articles stated in the indictment, amounting to upwards of 100 l. in value.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended - A. I went and informed Worral the officer, then got Armstrong, and apprehended the prisoner at half-past twelve o'clock that night in Swan-place, Plomer-street, City-road, I went to a house there, but did not find him; in about half an hour he came up the court - I laid hold of him. He then said he lived at the second house on the left hand up that court. The watchman took him to the watch-house on a charge of assault, and I ordered him to be detained for robbing my house - I have found none of my property. It must have taken at least three hours to do what they had done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did you take the key with you - A. Yes. The servant had no key.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed - A. In a blue coat, and I think a light waistcoat and trowsers, shoes and stockings. We searched his house, but found nothing.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live next door to the prosecutor - I saw him and Mrs. Sharp leave the house. A little after six o'clock I was at my door, and saw a hackney chariot standing at the public-house door, about four or five doors from mine. I noticed it a great deal, left the door, returned in a short time, and saw it was then at Draper's door, which was wide open. I saw two bundles put in the chariot - I am not certain whether there were more. I went to the chariot-door, and the moment the prisoner saw me he shut the door, and told the coachman to drive on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the man - A. I always believed him to be the man - the coach drove on. He did not get in himself; he

On my return I met a man, and told him to follow the coach, as I thought a robbery had been committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Draper returned did you see the servant - A. She came and inquired for her master, and remained at my house till they came to let her in. I said nothing to her, but immediately I saw Draper I informed him. I saw the prisoner next morning at Worship-street Office, and said,</p>

            . I am a coachman, and drive No. 765. On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was taken from Old-street, by two genteel-dressed men, who got in, and ordered me to go to the corner of Fleet-market; when I got there they said they should be back in five or ten minutes, and I might go to the public-house the while. I went to the Angel, four or five doors from the last witness's, and was called from there to the glass-shop, a few doors higher - it was the prosecutor's shop. I drew up close to the door, the door was open, and two men stood at it - they put two bundles and a basket into the coach, which appeared full. I only observed one person putting them in - one of the men then went across the market, and up one of the streets on the opposite side, the other rode in the chariot with the bundles, The man who ran across the street, I believe, pulled the door to, but am not positive it was him. I drove one of them to the corner of Swan-yard, Plomer-street - it was then about seven o'clock; the bundles were then taken into the second house on the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen either of these persons so as to know them - A. Never. I did not observe them so as to know them. I drove the coach for

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of July I went to look for the prisoner. I took the coachman in charge, went to Swan-yard, and found a basket.</p>

            . I live in West Smithfield, and am a labourer. I was in Fleet-market about six or seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the coach at the Angel, public-house, door - I was then going by Mr. Draper's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150035"></xptr>house, talking to a friend, and saw two men come out of the house, and then the coach stopped - one of them shut the door, and told the coachman to drive on, he did so - neither of them were in the coach then; whether the prisoner was one or not, I do not know - one was a short man with a blue coat. When the coachman found his number was taken, he stopped, and said,</p>

               <p>"I shall go no further unless you get in." The short man then got in, what became of the other I do not know. A man went across the road, whether he was one of the two I do not know - the other man had left the short man before that. I followed the coach into Plomer-street by Mrs. Remmington's orders; a man jumped out, I do not know which way he went. A lad came and took the things out of the coach. I saw the prisoner next day at Worship-street, but can neither say he was or was not the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw two men - A. Yes; it was not the prisoner who got in. The man who went across the road had a snuff-coloured coat, but whether he was at the door I cannot say. I did not notice them sufficient to form a belief whether the prisoner is or is not one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Who should recollect best, the coachman, or the woman, who only saw the man a moment?</p>

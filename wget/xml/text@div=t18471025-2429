                  </hi> I lived at my mother's in Circus-street, Marylebone. On the night of the 23rd of Sept., I went to a chest of drawers in my bedroom, and took out a coat, and locked the drawers again—I left in the drawer a coat, two waistcoats, a pair of cloth trowsers, and other things—I did not sleep there on that night—the next morning I was sent for, I went to the bedroom, my mother told me my things had been stolen—the drawer was open, and appeared to have been forced—I missed a coat, and two handkerchiefs which I had left in the drawer the day before—I missed my trowsers on the Sunday, and a pair of braces were on them—the gloves were in the coat pocket—on Monday the 27th, I was called to the station, and saw is a prisoner—my braces were on him—I am quite sure they are mine—there is a little place where I stitched them myself—I believe these to be my gloves, but I have no particular mark that I can swear to—the order things I have not seen again—I am quite sure the braces were on the trowsers.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of George James Mattocks. On that Friday, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I saw the prisoner come in at my street door; I concluded he had gone up stairs—he came out again and went away—his body was enlarged, and I concluded he had been to take washing away—I saw a string hanging down—I went up stairs into the room where my son had slept, and observed the drawers were open, and his best clothes were gone—I called to a person who is in Court to run after the prisoner, and she took a wrong direction—I saw the prisoner when he was apprehended, and knew him again decidedly—I had not known him be<lb></lb>fore I am sure I am not mistaken in his person—these gloves are my son's—I sewed the thumb of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Which is the thumb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot exactly say that you can see my work—I have lived in that house thirty years—I have been in the habit of seeing the washing of the other lodgers go away—it does not generally go away wrapped round a man's body—I saw a string hanging down at the opening of his coat-tail—I was in my shop—my husband is a broker and appraiser—my lodger's room is over the shop, on the first floor—I have only one lodger, Mrs. Tapp, on my first floor—her husband died in our house—she has kept it on ever since—she has one lodger and three daughters—they have not a good many visitors—there is not a man comes there once in three weeks—Mrs. Tapp's daughters are shoebinders, and work at the next door—I have a lodger in each room on the second floor—one is a smith and his wife, the other is Miss Prendergast; she is an invalid, and not capable of getting her own living—I would not aver anything about these</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of James Harris, and lodge at No. 31, Circus-street. About eleven o'clock, on the morning of the 24th of Sept., I saw the prisoner—he stumbled up the stairs—I went up—I afterwards saw him standing against George Mattock's bedroom door, putting something in his right-hand coat-pocket—I observed his person, and saw his face and his coat—I observed that he was much stouter then when he went up—I did not see him come down—I did not see him again till he was at the station—I did not know him the first moment, but when he turned round I knew him; I knew him when he put his hat on—I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What coat had he on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A blue coat and broad pockets—he was standing at the room-door, putting something into his pocket—he looked paler and stouter then than when I saw him before—he was very pale at the time—I did not see any strings—I had not see him before—I had never seen any of the lodgers in that part—the street-door is on the latch—visitors always knock—they knock twice for the second floor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, D</hi> 12.) On the 27th of Sept. I was called to Shouldham-street—the prisoner was given into my custody—I took him to the station—I went and saw Mrs. Harris—she went with me to the station—she did not know the prisoner at first, not till I turned him round—the prosecutor was there—he said he had lost a pair of braces and a pair of gloves, beside what he had told me of before—I asked him what sort of braces—he said a brown pair—I then unbuttoned the prisoner's waistcoat, and he had these braces on—the prosecutor showed me where he had mended them—I went to a house in Kilburn-lane, where the prisoner's wife lived—I found these gloves there—the prisoner said he never was in Circus-street in his life.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the first thing you did was to examine the trowsers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I examined the trowsers and waistcoat—they were not the prosecutor's—I then found the braces on him—Mrs. Mattocks identified the prisoner at the station—he was the only prisoner there—I turned the pri<lb></lb>soner round, and Mrs. Harris identified him—she said she would fetch some more—she fetched Mrs. Mattocks, who was quite certain of him.</p>

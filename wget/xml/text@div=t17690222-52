I was alarmed between seven and eight in the morning on the 5th instant, February. My wife got up and went down stairs; she soon seat me word up that my house was broke open, and I was robbed. I got up and came down, and found the door of my cupboard in the bar was broke, the lock also broke, out of which I mist eight table spoons, a pap spoon, a milk pot, a pepper castor, a punch ladle, six silver castors, some table cloths and shirts, a cloth coat, and several things out of the parlour, that are not mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Vaughan. It was. There was a bolt on the inside, which went into the frame, which they were obliged to force before they could get in. Part of the frame was wrenched up. I advertised an odd buckle, scratched W. B. upon it, among other things we had lost. The day after

               <p>Vaughan. No, he did not; only that he had been drinking part of the brandy with them, and bought the buckle of Murphy. After Winstanley was committed by Mr. Alderman Crosby, he desired to be admitted an evidence, but the Alderman would not admit him.

He said, To one Peggy, that lives at one Welch's in St. Giles's, at a little chandler's shop by the dead wall. I said, What did you mean by having that little hatchet in the bar? (I found my hatchet lying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220036"></xptr> there, which we used to chop wood with in the cellar to light the fire in the morning.) Sir, said he, I knew you was resolute, and if you had come down, we were determined to chop any one down that came to detect us. (The hatchet produced in court, and the broken lock to the cellar door.) Said I, Would you have chopped me down? But he made no answer to that. He said, Murphy went down into the cellar with him, and was in the house with him. He said, After they had taken the things, they went into the parlour, made a fire, and made some punch. I said, I hope you made it good, Frank? Yes, Sir, said he. Then he said he went into the scullery and got a pair of my shoes, and pulled his old ones and stockings off, and the while he was putting them off, and putting a pair of my shoes and stockings on, Murphy drank all the punch up. He told to several people that he himself was the principal person in acting, but Murphy persuaded him to it, and was with him. Here are his old shoes and stockings which we found in the parlour the next day (Produced in court ).</p>

            . I am a peace officer. On the 9th of this month, at night, I had been round searching my ward. I came home about two or three in the morning; as I was coming home, I thought to go and search the lodging houses, to see if I could find any of these lads; Mr. Vaughan having told me he had been robbed. I found Winstanley in one, I made him dress himself. (I knew him when he lived with Mr. Vaughan. I searched his great coat pocket, there I found a brass candlestick, and also another on his pillow. I said, How came you by these? He said he stole them out of Broad-court, in company with Murphy. I secured him in St. Giles's round-house; then I went to another night house in Drury-lane, and found Murphy in bed. I brought him to the Round-house. The next morning I brought Winstanley to Mr. Vaughan, and he took him before Mr. Alderman Crosby, the sitting alderman. I asked him how he could be so foolish to do such a thing; he said, it was by getting into bad company, that made him do it. I asked him who were the chief persons that put it into his head; he said they were Murphy and Coleby, and that they had been at him some time to go a thieving with them. I asked him how he broke the cellar window open; he said, With an ax. I asked him whether he went into the cellar immediately; he said he did, and Murphy followed him; and he found an old rusty gimlet on the head of an old butt, which he opened the cellar door with, and also the cupboard door in the bar, where the plate and money was. (The gimlet produced by prosecutor, and rusty as described.)</p>

               <p>Q. to Row. Had you made Winstanley any promises before he made a confession?</p>
               <p>Row. I believe he expected favour. I only told him, he had better tell. I made him no promise that he should not be prosecuted.</p>

               <p>The morning Mr. Row took me at this night-house, he got me greatly fuddled, and I might say what I did not know. He told me he would let me go, if I would tell him where the things were. I am going into the 15th year of my age.</p>
               <p>Row. I never stopt any where, but took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have known Winstanley eighteen years and upwards.</p>

               <p>I was not in the robbery. I never knew there were brandy and rum. I never knew there were any. This lad (meaning Winstanley) came to me one morning and asked me to lend him half a crown for that buckle; I gave that buckle to Maxey Miller. I was not with them in the robbery. I never saw the punch ladle, nor owned to it. I am a <rs id="t17690222-52-deflabel311" type="occupation">poulterer</rs>

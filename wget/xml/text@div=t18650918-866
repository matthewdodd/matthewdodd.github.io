                  </hi>. I am gaoler at the Mansion House justice-room—on Saturday afternoon, 2d September, about half-past 1, I was on duty adjoining the prison cells; a Mrs. Burrows came into the passage to make some inquiry of me—I asked her to go to the bottom, and I would speak to her—when I opened the door to answer her, I saw the prisoner there, pressing against Mrs. Burrows very rudely—I said, "What are you about?"—he made no reply, but walked out of the passage into the street—I then spoke to Mrs. Burrows, and from something she told me, I followed the prisoner—I lost sight of him for a minute or so, but when I got outside the door, I saw him about twenty yards off, just stepping up to another man—he moved his hand towards him, but did not pass anything—I caught hold of him, and said, "I charge you with stealing a watch from a lady in the passage"—he said, "I do not know anything about it; I have not done it"—I took him back into the passage—there was another female sitting down there on a form, and he placed his hand in her lap; the moment his band left the lap, I saw this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is wrenched off from the swivel—I gave him into the custody of the officer Curtis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Burrows, of 35, Brit<lb></lb>tania-street, City-road—on 2d September, I was at the police cells at the Mansion House in the passage—I had this watch then—my name is on the back of it—it was on my side, attached by a swivel to a chain—I saw the prisoner in the passage—he passed me, and pushed very roughly against me—Hubble spoke to me, and then I missed my watch, and said, "That man has my watch"—the officer brought the prisoner back.</p>

About half-past 1 on this Saturday, I was in a room at the Mansion House—I heard the lady say something to Hubble, and he went out and brought back the prisoner—just as he got inside the door, I saw him put something in a woman's lap who was sitting there, and saw Hubble take it up—it was this watch—I took hold of the prisoner—he said, "Let me go; the lady will not press the charge; she has got her watch"—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook at Simpson's Tavern, Bond-court, Cornhill. On the 12th of April, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I was going up Snow-hill, and saw the prisoner—she began to pull me about, and put her hand into my trowsers-pocket—I found I had lost my purse from that pocket—I di<lb></lb>rectly seized her, held her, and called "Police," who came up—she took my purse away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. Hearing a cry of "Police," I went to the spot, found the prosecutor holding the prisoner by the hand—he had one end of the purse in his hand, and the prisoner the other end in hers—he charged her with stealing it—she said nothing to me—the prose<lb></lb>cutor gave her in charge—she was not drunk, she might have taken a little—she did not say that he had not given her anything, and ought to give her something.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Sheriff of Middlesex; I live in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane, and keep a house for the reception of persons arrested. Winslow had been in my service—he quitted it about September—Fitzgerald was in my service, and continued so up to last Monday fortnight—in 'consequence of something, I had her taken into custody—I understood that the two prisoners were about to be married—while my wife and family were at Herne Bay I missed some property, and suspected the prisoners—on the 8th on November I went to Wins<lb></lb>low's lodging in Falcon-court—I met him coming up out of the kitchen where he lived with his family—I told the officer that was the man—I found his mother, father, and sister there—I saw a box there which I un<lb></lb>derstood had belonged to Fitzgerald—I had it opened, and a quantity of tumblers and goblets, two decanters, and water-bottles, and other things, were found in it—the officer found some other wine glasses, goblets, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, living at Lewisham. In April the prisoner was employed to buy marble for me—he had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check, and I perceive it was bought in his own name—I believe he met with a friend of his father's, and the marble was purchased for me—he was in my employ till last October, at different periods—he had a quantity of marble at my former residence, delivered to him to manufacture at his leisure, the other was removed to my new building—Subsequent to the purchase of this marble, I employed him in October to put in some sills, and a builder was mentioning to me about the prisoner wishing him to take two marble chimney pieces in payment of a debt—this awakened my suspicions—I counted the marble that the prisoner had brought, and found but a small portion left—I made inquiries, and ray suspicions were so excited that I returned home, and asked my men whether the prisoner had had any marble away, and they told me yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you lost any marble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot say how much, be<lb></lb>cause it was all intrusted to the prisoner—it is not here—I am deficient altogether, about fifteen feet—it is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was on my own premises—no one had the care of it—I do not know when I saw it last safe—I had no idea of any thing of the kind, I am not looking over my premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you told all you know on the subject of this marble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as regards my acquaintance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183905130162"></xptr>
               <p>with it—as far as it can be ascertained, there is a deficiency of six or seven feet—I know of no circumstances except the witness's evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you know of no circumstance causing this prosecu<lb></lb>tion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as what has grown out of it—as far as asking him to de<lb></lb>liver up the marble that was delivered to him—I never came to make any charge, nothing but a civil charge for him to return property intrusted to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you now mean to tell my lord that you have told the circum<lb></lb>stances out of which this prosecution has arisen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because these three pieces were taken away without my consent—Mr. Duboice was in<lb></lb>trusted with some marble, and the rest was at my premises—he had no right to take it away—this was imposed on me by the Magistrate—I made inquiry of my men whether Mr. Duboice had removed any marble, to their knowledge—"Yes," a man said, "I helped him to take it away."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you told all the circumstances that provoked this prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nothing to provoke it—I have come here, which was the furthest off ray thoughts, but when a man had robbed me of my property—when I called for him to account for the marble he had supplied Captain Pidding—I have been dragged into this prosecution, as I stated before, and I am entitled to a patient hearing—I find I am deficient, and other circumstances are connected with this that will speak for them<lb></lb>selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Once more, I ask you, yes or no, have you told all the circum<lb></lb>stances out of which this has arisen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot comprehend, for the life of me, what you mean, because there are many circumstances con<lb></lb>nected with it—I know of no other circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner ever summon you for a sum of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he did—I am very glad you brought that forward—he said I owed it him—I was summoned about a fortnight ago, I think—I received a summons from the Justices to appear before them—the summons was returnable last Tuesday fortnight, and I attended to it—I did not go on the Monday and charge the prisoner with felony—I had no idea that I had a felony against him—I am very sorry that it amounted to it—when I was before the Justices at the Court of Requests, I did not deny what the prisoner chal<lb></lb>lenged me with—I said he had to account to me for these chimney<lb></lb>pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Justices disbelieve that, and make an order upon you to pay the sum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was bound to give him a written notice of the particulars of the set-off, and that I had not furnished him with—I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. very readily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this set-off that you have spoken of what he is now indicted for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not—nothing of the kind, certainly not, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 25th of April, last year, was the prisoner at work for you at some houses of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appears he was—I had supplied him with marble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you authorised him to purchase marble on your account, as he was in the trade, and you could save by his doing so 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a matter I deny—he was intrusted to go to buy it in his own name and mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say that a part of your complaint was that he pur<lb></lb>chased it in his own name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not consider that a complaint—here is the bill—it is at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183905130163"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did yon not know, that unless he went as a person in the trade, you would have had to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had bought, by Mr. Tranter, some at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is not a discount of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot—there is none at all—I can go and buy as well as any man—I asked the prisoner to take some marble at my place to work into chimney-pieces—I cannot say how much, but this stolen, was on ray premises from April to October—I believe it was in May I trusted the prisoner with marble—I cannot say how long he continued to work on the houses—he did not work the whole time till the fall of the year 1838—I think he did not work till the fall of the year—he did not work till the autumn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in the autumn, say you thought the days were getting too short, and you could not get work enough out of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—that was in the fall of 1838—I knew of nothing that I owed him—he had received every shilling, but I was summoned—I had no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, on the 26th of January, send a man to the, prisoner to tell him you had determined to begin the work again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—I desired him to send me by that man the saw-tackle—he refused to send it, unless I sent a written order—I sent it and got it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having sent to him for this, did you go without settling accounts with him, and employ another man on his unfinished work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did do so, because I wanted to expedite the work—on the 30th of April the pri<lb></lb>soner summoned me to the Court of Requests for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was a dis<lb></lb>puted account—he summoned me for work—it was his own saw-tackle—it was not the prisoner's work I set another man on, it was mine—I cannot say what day I had to appear to the summons—I sent to him repeatedly to bring up the marble that I had intrusted him with, but I had no know<lb></lb>ledge of any being stolen, and then I heard he had sold some chimney<lb></lb>pieces, and that led me to suspect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say any thing of what you now charge him with till the 6th of May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not, I had no idea of it—this I charge him with taking, was in October, the last time he was in my employ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrates say to you, "This is a most extraordinary charge; it never would have been preferred, if he had not summoned you to the Court of Requests?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of it, but I admit, for the sake of saving time, that they said what you say—but I believe they did not say any thing of the kind—I did not get a search warrant, and search his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you search his premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For what?—he had no stolen property that I knew of—I did not search his premises—I did not go to search them—I went to demand property—I went into the premises—I do not call that searching, to demand the property intrusted to his care—I went to his back-yard—he was there—I passed through the house—I saw him—I did not go any where but to the back-yard—I did not go up stairs—I did not go into the loft—I asked for marble, that was the very thing that I went for—he told me the marble he had was what I had in<lb></lb>trusted him with, but I owed him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it; and if I gave him that, I should have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the marble you indicted him for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we have not found it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give a sovereign and did his wife give you 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did—I said, "This it off the bill, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183905130164"></xptr>
               <p>suppose you mean?" and demanded the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back, and the sovereign was returned—I had a man before the Magistrates, to measure the marble that the prisoner worked up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you offer to bribe this man with money after you made the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> God forbid—I have lived too long in the world—sooner than do a thing of that kind, I would suffer death—I certainly did not offer him money—it is the last thing I should have thought of—if I was on a dying bed, I did not—I swear I did not—I did not offer him money.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">A man was here produced to the witness.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this man—did you offer him money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I deny it most solemnly—I never pulled my purse out to him—Oh, shocking!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he refuse to accept the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Really this is a most affect<lb></lb>ing thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he refuse to accept it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My good sir, it is a thing I am a total stranger to—the constable asked if I was not going to give them some<lb></lb>thing to drink—I pulled out two shillings, and gave them to the witness Soard, to get drink—I believe the measurement was made—I only saw part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there found in a shed, among a parcel of rough work, some pieces of marble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did these pieces, when taken with the marble measured, amount to all the marble you had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was five or six feet short, accord<lb></lb>ing to my man's measurement—it was taken down by three parties—I have no recollection of saying, when the pieces were found in the rubbish heap, that I never saw a man have such an acute memory in my life—I did not proceed to take the dimensions—the prisoner did not ask me to call over the dimensions in his presence—I left it to them—after this the prisoner gave me notice to produce the bill of parcels—I had not got it till I went up to Westminster to get it—the second hearing might take place on the 13th, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrates threaten to turn you out of the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Me out! Oh, no, nothing of the kind—I cannot swear it—it might have been done without my hearing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrates say that, as you had chosen to swear, they must hold the prisoner to bail, to appear, if required, but they would not send him to prison on your evidence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps they did do that—yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say to George Grubb that you would not mind 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you could get the better of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—that is a villanous principle, come from where it will—I have been <hi rend="italic">lugged</hi> into this thing contrary to my wishes—I would rather have given 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than it should have occurred—I did not say to the constable, "Dear me, I never thought it would have come to this—I wish Duboice had begged my pardon, I would have dropped it—if he had said the marble had been taken, it would have amounted to a civil action"—I never said I never saw so acute a man—the constable did not say he would have acted as Duboice had acted, for be was satisfied he was an innocent man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say "Oh dear, I am so bad I cannot stand any longer?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I might, or I might not.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you ever know a charge against him in your life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have known him living there three or four years—the warrant charging him with felony, was obtained last Monday week, the 6th of May—I was in attendance opposite this court before the bill was found—I saw Mr. Keats on Tuesday, the first morning the prisoner was in attendance to take his trial—he came up with me—Mr. Keats said to me, "I am very unwell, I wish it had not come to this—if Dnboice had spoken to me, it would not have gone so far"—I said "If I had been Duboice, I should have done as he has done, for I am satisfied of his inno<lb></lb>cence."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEATS</hi>. The whole teems to consist in this, that some day the prisoner ordered some marble to be put into his donkey-cart, but what of that? how do I know that he might not have been going to execute his work for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not deny it, my lord.</p>

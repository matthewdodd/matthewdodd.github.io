             called to him not to stand sprinkling with his hand, but to throw it over; he threw it, till he threw all the four buckets over us; then we got down out of the loft.</p>
               <p>Who had the most of this water? - I had the most of it; I begged for the most; I desired him to sling the most upon me, as she was so ill.</p>
               <p>How much water might she get? - What things she had were very thin indeed; she had but a trifle of the water; when we got down out of the lost, the same men began throwing dung at us; we were going to make our escape to get somewhere to dry ourselves.</p>
               <p>What did they throw at you? - The stuff out of the streets, out of the gutters, out of the yard; I made my escape, I was but just touched, except the clear water; Oliver had it very much indeed, she could not make her escape, she was so ill; then we went and made a fire, and dried our things a little, in one of the little narrow lanes; her nose bled as much as a pint; after we came to sit down by the fire, and she came to sit still, she complained of her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250057"></xptr> breath very much after the water was thrown upon her; when we had dried ourselves a little, we went and sleeped upon the ricks; she got in at the bottom, where no wet could come; I lay till between one and two the next morning, then I moved; she spoke very frank to me indeed, and said her breath was something better, and in the morning she was found dead; the under hostler came and awaked me, and I found her dead; I know nothing more than this of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was it you was awaked? - Between five and six I had shifted away on the other side of the ricks, but we were both in the same ricks.</p>

               <p>Mr. Graham, Prisoner's Counsel. I think it was on the Tuesday that you slept in this hay-loft? - Yes, nobody slept but we; but there was a travelling man slept in the loft.</p>
               <p>Was there only one man? - There were two men, one was a stranger, and the other belonged to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Did not he sleep with you? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Nor the night before? - No, the prisoners came to give drink and feed their horses; they were the yoke buckets; they belong to the regiment.</p>
               <p>After this little water that you say was thrown on this poor woman, you went to make a fire to dry yourselves? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay by the fire? - Till between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What month was it in? - I cannot recollect; I am no scholar.</p>
               <p>You made a pretty good fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You dried yourselves well? - Yes, dried her; she was perfectly dry by nine o'clock; the hay-rick was very nigh the stables; we crept in between the ricks, there we slept; it had been a very wet night; the rain did not come between the two hay-ricks; but when she found she grew worse, she got out, and lay at a distance from the ricks.</p>
               <p>What time of night was that? - I do not know; I left her between one and two on the next morning; I was very wet and lay at the same end as she did; but there was not room enough for us both; the wet did not come in upon her, but it came in upon me, and I went to look for a better place; she kept in that place till she found herself worse; I do not know what time she got out; I found her laying under the rick, under the place where I left her; the water must come upon her.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in that situation before the morning? - I cannot tell, we found her in the wet after she was dead, and the place she was dead in, was quite exposed to the weather.</p>
               <p>I understood you to say, you had nothing for two or three days except those three rolls? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you no drink? - We had none but what was brought up to us; Adams brought us some water, and this man brought us some water.</p>
               <p>Was not Adams there the whole time of this story that you tell us? - No, Sir, he was not; we desired Oates in the morning to bring us some water, and he did; we told him we were dry.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner Oates when he came up complain that you had littered the hay about? - He said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you by laying there you spoiled the hay for the horses? - No, he did not; we had no ill words not difference; when they pelted us going out, we said nothing at all to them; then we went quietly away.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you been laying about there? - I came from Windsor.</p>
               <p>Do you know how long the other woman had been laying about there? - She had been a long time in Windsor.</p>
               <p>Had she the bad distemper? - No, she had not.</p>
               <p>Had you? - No, Sir; nor they did not offer to meddle or make with us at all.</p>
               <p>Had you been with these soldiers? - No, Sir, nor I had not been in their company to be misused before.</p>

               <p>I am saddle-horse keeper to Mr. Shipcot; I never saw the woman with the soldiers in my life; I saw nothing about water or any thing of the kind; I was in the stable; I heard a noise of laughing and hallooing among the soldiers; I thought they had been at play; they did so sometimes; when I came down, I saw the deceased and another girl walking in the yard and I saw Thynn take up a bone, or something of that kind, and ran round the stable towards the deceased; but whether he hit her or not I cannot say; but he came back without the bone; when he came back, he said to Oates, d - n her, I have jobbed her well; they seemed to be in a very dirty condition, as if they had had water and flush thrown over them; I said to Oates and Thynn, if I had been there, they should not have had the water thrown over them; they said, how could you help yourself; I said, you should have thrown it over me; but because I took the part of the woman, he said, he would be d - d if he would not bring her back, and put her in the slush hole, and he would if ever he found her in the hay-lost any more; the women were in the yard at the time; they went away; I saw no more; the yard is a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. Had you any quarrel with any of these men before? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Mr. Shipcot's; I am a chaise washer; on Wednesday morning, I was going in our yard, and I heard somebody talk up in the lost; I went up and I saw two women and two soldiers; I came down again, between three and four in the afternoon; the soldiers went to the stables, and I saw the prisoners carry water between three and four, up into the stable, and they threw it over the women, for what I saw; for I saw the women come out in less than a quarter of an hour, very wet.</p>
               <p>Court. Both of them very wet? - Both of them very wet; they came through our hog yard, and the prisoners threw a parcel of dung and muck at the girls; the prisoners horses were quartered at our house; the women went out of the yard; they were very wet and dirty.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing else? - Yes; just as I had got out of the yard, Oates took a handful of dung and muck out of a gulley, and threw it against Oliver, the side of her face, and one of the prisoners followed her, and said, he had well jobbed her; I saw no more; the next morning I was called as I was going in our yard, between seven and eight; says they here is somebody wants you up here; so I went up into our rick yard, and this poor girl lay dead; the other girl, Barrows, was on the other side of the rick; I did not see her then, the other people saw her; I suppose she might lay with her head, three or four feet from the rick, with her feet towards the rick, and her head out from it; she was laying dead on her left side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. She was quite exposed to the weather? - Quite; not at all covered with the rick.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night had it been? - A very misling night; it rained in the morning when I waked; I know nothing about the wind; I did not hear at all what they said together, or what the women said; I heard no words; the deceased girl went out very quietly, because she could hardly walk; I saw three or four pails; they were carried; they were put into the lost; the horses were quartered at our house; this was about the time of feeding them; the men used to feed them; they got the hay out of the lost; the two men were standing up; the women were laying down; the hay was laid all spread about, and they were laying higgledy piggledy on this hay.</p>
               <p>Court. Do they water in the stable or fetch their horses out to water? - They water in the stable; it was watering time.</p>
               <p>Then this water was got for the purpose of watering the horses, though they put it to another purpose? - I do not know what they got it for.</p>
               <p>Were the other soldiers watering their horses? - They were all watering together,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250059"></xptr> some in one stable, and some in another.</p>
               <p>- DEGGE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon at Isleworth; I examined the body of this unfortunate woman after her death; my observations were, that this woman was loaded with diseases, venereal, billious, flux, and an ill state of her lungs.</p>
               <p>Was the venereal disease in a considerable degree? - Her lungs were ulcerated and decayed.</p>
               <p>Was there any external marks of violence in any part of her body? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. No bruises of any kind? - None to be seen; I examined her the next day.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the state of her bowels? - Yes, I examined them particularly; I found it was the chief disease of which she died.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you determine the time in which this woman would have died, if the water that had been thrown over her had aggravated her disorder; can you take upon you to say, in what time the death would have happened? - Yes, I think I can; for if this woman had died soon after this water was thrown over her, the death would have been by throwing water upon her; but she laid six or seven hours after.</p>
               <p>Do you think that that hastened her death? - Not in the least, it could not hasten her death.</p>
               <p>Have you always been of this opinion? - Exactly, always of the same opinion.</p>
               <p>You was examined before the Coroner? - I was so.</p>
               <p>Was you of opinion that this venereal taint was an old one or a very recent one? - An old one.</p>
               <p>Then it did not occasion her death? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Could you tell whether the billious complaint was of long standing? - I could see very plainly that the billious complaint was of long standing, and that there was very plain appearances of a mortification.</p>
               <p>Might not these symptoms have been matured, and increased by this treatment? - They would if she had died soon after, but as she lived they could not; there is a great difference between one and two hours, and six or seven hours.</p>
               <p>If she had died two hours earlier, should you have thought that was the cause of her death? - I expected her to die in a quarter of an hour, or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to state at a professional man, that that would have been the case; would it not depend on the degree of sickness or weakness? - It would not; if a person receives an injury by water, certainly he should die soon after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did it ever happen to you to be exposed to a hard shower of rain? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Wet through? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not die in an hour after? - No.</p>
               <p>Did all your patients under venereal complaints die in half an hour when they were wet through? - I certainly will make some allowance, if a sick person of that kind should be taken care of, and receive proper nourishment, and should die, then I would alledge it to be entirely owing to the wet.</p>
               <p>Suppose she should get her clothes thoroughly dry again, what should you think of it then, might not that delay the death a little? - My observation is this, that if a sick person gets wet, and this wet hastens his death, he probably will feel the effects of this wet in half an hour or an hour.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon at Isleworth, I inspected this body, there was no appearance of injury internal or external on the head, or any part of the body.</p>
               <p>You opened the head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find the brain inflamed or otherwise? - Not at all, it was in a perfect state, opened the body, the liver was in a sound state, the gall bladder rather more extended than common, the lungs in a very disased state and knotty, the stomach and the whole of the intestines perfectly empty, the extremity of the rectum a good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250060"></xptr> deal inflamed for two or three or perhaps four inches.</p>
               <p>What did you take that to have proceeded from? - From a billious flux.</p>
               <p>Could you judge whether that flux had been of a long continuance? - I should judge so, I cannot say whether days or hours; she had the appearance of an old venereal complaint.</p>
               <p>If a woman in that situation should have a quantity of cold water poured upon her, and then be exposed to the weather in inclement weather, do you think that would have increased the symptoms and have hastened her death? - It might.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing that would have induced you to expect the death so soon. - She might not have survived so long.</p>
               <p>Might she have survived two or three days? - It is hard to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. Suppose such a person was to lay out all night exposed to the weather, would that occasion her death? - It might.</p>
               <p>Court. Did it? - I should rather ascribe it to being exposed to the inclemency of the weather; there were all the symptoms of an old grievance and gradual decay, that could not be the effect of having water an hour or two before.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean to say that there were appearances that might have accelerated her death? - Yes.</p>

               <p>In general terms during the time you have known them what has been their character? - Three of the best men in the regiment since I have known them; since they have been in my command I never knew them in a fault, nor in any scrape; I came here to day attended by every officer of the regiment that are off duty, on purpose to give every testimony in their favour; they are men in whom I have placed great confidence, and I believe them perfectly incapable of doing any such thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer of 8, Northumberland Street, Strand—on 29th December I went to the office of Messrs. Abrahams—&amp; Roffey; and on Saturday, the 30th, I went to Marlborough Street police-court and swore an information against a man named Kerr and others, for fraud and conspiracy—on the Sunday evening I was sent for to Islington police-station, and saw Kerr in custody—I had had frequent opportunities of seeing him before and knew him well—on Monday morning, January 1st, the prisoner Stenning called at my house—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—he did not ask my name; my name is on my door—he said "You recognised the person who was arrested last night at the Islington police-court, but you recognised him by gas-light, don't you think it is quite possible that you have recognised the wrong person?"—I said "You allude, of course, to Kerr, one of the four parties who formerly occupied the suite of apartments in this house?"—he said "Yes; Kerr and I have often been taken as brothers, in fact, I have known him from his youth up, he is a very good fellow; have you any-animosity towards me? and could you not go to the Marlborough Street police-office to-day, when the prisoner Kerr is brought up, and say that you have mistaken the person's identity?"—he also said "You could not positively deny the identity, might you not say that you are not quite sure about the identity?"—my reply was that Kerr, with others, had been visiting those chambers at 8, Northumberland Street for nearly a month, and were in and out five or six times a day; that Kerr was a very tall man and so easily to be known, that I could not possibly fail to recognise him—he said that if I would go to the Court and say that he was not the right man, or that I thought he was not the right man, he was prepared at once to pay any reasonable amount of money for my doing so, and asked me to accompany him to the Northumberland Hotel close by, to carry out—his plan—I refused to do so—I told him I could not possibly contradict the information, to which I had sworn, which had led to the arrest of Kerr—that conversation took place shortly after 11 a.m., and by 11.30 I had communicated what took place to the police at Scotland Yard, and at 2 o'clock that day I went to Marlborough Street—I saw the prisoner outside the Court about 1.50—he spoke to me—he brought up a gentleman who I had not previously known—he did not introduce him to me, but I after<lb></lb>wards found him to be a practising solicitor of that Court, called Froggatt, who repeated the offers to bribe me, but he put it in a more definite shape—I told him that it was impossible that I could state anything but the actual facts, that I had been called upon by the prosecution to simply identify the party, and I could not deviate from my proper course of action—the Court opened at 2 o'clock, and Mr. Froggatt followed me into the Court, and to make the conversation, as I suppose, much more secret, invited me to the passage leading to the cells of the Court, by the goaler's room, and he there offered to give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Stenning was not there—after that I went into Court and identified Kerr—I had no further conversation with Stenning—I had never seen Stenning or Froggatt in my life before January 1st.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I was before the Magistrate on two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187702050040"></xptr>
               <p>or three occasions, and was examined by Mr. Poland on behalf of the Crown and cross-examined by you—I have not taken the trouble to consider whether I have given the same account to-day as I did at the police-court, or whether I have amplified it—I cannot say whether I have given it con<lb></lb>siderably more in detail to-day; I do not take the trouble to recollect what I am going to say; I always speak the truth, but I make thousands of speeches—I have not said to-day more than I said before the Magistrate, but at the time you cross-examined by Mr. poland—they did not come out a portion of them—I was re-examined by Mr. Poland—they did not come out only a they were frustrated—they came out partially; as much as was sufficient to make his Lordship and the Jury understand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> His Lordship and the Jury <hi rend="italic">were</hi> not at the police-court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every word I have told you to-day came out then, but not in the same words—by being frustrated I mean that in the middle of the charge Mr. Froggatt jumped up in the Court and the legal gentleman for the Crown seemed to fancy that he was a privileged person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean to assert that you brought that charge against Mr. Froggatt at the police-court, and that Mr. Poland, acting for the Crown, stopped it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was Mr. Newton suggested that the attorney was an agent, and that matters between an attorney and his client could not be dealt with; that was the inference; I do not mean to say that Mr. Newton said that after, I said that Mr. Froggatt had attempted to bribe me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now you are making accusations against the Magistrate, do you mean to say that you told Mr. Newton that Mr. Froggatt, outside the police-court, had put this attempt to bribe you in a more definite form and that Mr. Newton refused to hear it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not tell him the exact words, I was stopped—I have given it in evidence that Mr. Froggatt attempted to bribe me—I never said a word at the police-court about Mr. Froggatt offering me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was in the brief—I have not sworn it in any court of justice before to<lb></lb>day, I had no opportunity, I should if I had had an opportunity—this is the first time in my life that I ever heard that a reward was offered for the apprehension of Kerr and the others; that I swear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then everything you did in the matter, going to Mr. Abrahams and everything, was for the furtherance of the ends of justice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is ail nonsense, I did not care a straw about the ends of justice—I told them I must be paid for my time—I said before the Magistrate "I was applied to on the Friday previous to my coming here on Saturday to swear an information, I declined to say anything until I had my expenses; I received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Abrahams before I said anything; I fixed the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my expenses; I took it in order to be convinced that it was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> affair and something to fall back upon"—Mr. Abrahams asked me whether I would take a cheque for my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I said that I must have money, that was to show that I was an unwilling witness; I was an unwilling witness with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to fall back upon, I do not walk outside my door without something to fall back upon; I should require 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to come outside my door to see you—I said that I did not care one straw for furthering the ends of justice, and I do not now—I did not also say that I hoped I should get something else out of it; I said that 1 was entitled to something; I live in hopes—I said before the Magistrate that when the prisoner first came he did not ask me my name, but he might have done so—I have said that while I was having the conversation with him in the street Sergeant Manton passed; I have not told you half.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not tell about Sergeant Manton, because I was not</p>

               <p>asked—when I was stating what Mr. Froggatt said to me I was interrupted, he got up and made some statement and in answer to it the Magistrate, Mr. Newton, said "Then you claim it as a privilege"—I understood that he addressed that remark to Mr. Froggatt, but it stopped the matter from fur<lb></lb>ther inquiry—no other objection was taken to my continuing the statement I had commenced—before I went into Court I had given all the particulars to the solicitor for the prosecution, Mr. Abrahams—I have had to appear over twenty times; I have been at the police-court about thirteen times, and I have attended at the solicitor's office for the prosecution eight or ten times, and, at the request of the Magistrate, at Marlborough Street, once, and I have received nothing but the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>Kerr was brought into the dock alone, and the prisoner was immediately behind him—while Sergeant Littlechild was giving evidence about a sir-chambered revolver loaded being taken from Kerr, the prisoner touched me on the knee and said "You may think yourself b—lucky that you did not have one of them into you"—I made no reply.</p>

It was after that that he was given in custody by order of the Magistrate—nobody else heard those words, I was actually sitting next to him on his right and no one was near—I knew he was the person who had been with Kerr the previous day—I never attempted to take him at the police-court, but the day before, at 7 p.m., I put my arm through his and walked with him down to the cab, but we did not want him—I think I saw him outside the police-court but I won't be positive—I know I saw him before he was arrested for about an hour off and on—I never attempted to take him in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector C</hi>). I have charge of the station adjoining Marlborough Street police-court—I was there on 1st January when Littlechild brought Stenning in there; he was placed in the dock and charged with assaulting Sergeant Littlechild in the discharge of his duty; Littlechild proceeded to search him, and the prisoner took something from his pocket and began tearing up a piece of paper—Littlechild seized his hand and desired him to give it up to him, which he did; and Littlechild handed this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to me torn in three places; it is a sketch of the back of the police-court and of the police-station—those dotted lines lead from a cell in which Kerr was confined (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Tour all" in the sketch</hi>), through the reserve-room attached to the station into Marlborough Mews, and another line leads from the goaler's-room, through the same reserve-room, into the street—neither of those lines lead through the Court—the door from the reserve-room leads out into Marlborough Mews—a person brought from cell No. 3, where Kerr was, into the police-court, would pass the door leading into the reserve-room—two constables were generally on duty in the reserve-room.</p>

On Saturday, 30th December, I passed through the gaoler's-room at Marlborough Street, about 12.40 p.m., and saw there a prisoner named Murray, who was there under remand, and Kerr and Stenning; they were all talking together—that was after Murray had been brought before the Magistrate—they were there when I went out at we or three minutes to 1 o'clock, so that they were together about twenty minutes—two gaolers were present—Mr. Froggatt, was there—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> smallest of these two rooms on the plan is the gaoler's-room—there are three entrances to the gaoler's-room, two from the Court and one from the station.</p>

On Monday morning, 1st January, shortly after 10 o'clock, I saw Stenning at Marlborough Street police-court—Mr. Froggatt was with him—they were coming from the back entrance of the police-court—there are steps there leading to the inspector's</p>

I saw Stenning first at 10 o'clock in the yard in the rear of the police-court—the police-court fronts into Marl borough Street, and the station is at the hack, so that he was between the station and the court—I had not seen Roots and the other officers the whole morning—their place would be to come for their prisoners—the prisoner was in the yard again between the two places at 12 o'clock, but for a very short time—it was not till 2.30 that he was given in charge by the Magistrate.</p>

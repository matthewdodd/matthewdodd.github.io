            's, I lodge at the hotel Berkley Square, the lodgings of the prosecutor and my master are all adjoining together. All that I know, the portfolio was deposited in my charge by the prosecutor, I deposited them in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose it out of that place. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you saw it before it was stolen. - A. I received the portfolio after being stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say that before. - A. I know no more than it being delivered to my charge.</p>
               <p>JAMES FESBURY. Q. You are the master of the hotel. - A. Yes, I was informed of the things being stolen out of Mr. Stewart's apartments, I can swear to the man being in the house, I cannot swear that it was the time the property was taken, I can swear positively that I saw him in the house, in the entrance of the hall, he was standing with three or four other people. I was sent for to the Running Horse public-house, in David Street, that the portfolio was there, I went there and saw the portfolio, I returned home and fetched the servant to identify the portfolio. I delivered the portfolio from the landlord to Rice.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HOLLAND. I live with Mr. Butterfield the publican, at the Running Horse, David Street, I saw the prisoner bring the portfolio into our house, the Running Horse in David Street, he called for a glass of ale, and the bar maid was going by the parlour, she said,</p>
               <p>"what a way you have left the table," then she

             the table near to him, he took up the glass of ale, spilt it, and put it down again, then he took up the portfolio from where he was sitting, took some papers out and looked at them, and when he had looked at one of the papers, he took it out and put it under the seat where he was sitting. That is all I know about it, I am sure it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the portfolio afterwards. - A. It was taken into the bar, and my mistress locked it up. I know it is the same portfolio, because it was cut open, I did not see him cut it open.</p>

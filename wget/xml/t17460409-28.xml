               <p>Q. What do you know of the Prisoner's having them?</p>
               <p>Parran. They were found at the Pawnbroker's, one Perry.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found with Perry?</p>
               <p>Parran. I have a List in my Pocket-Book: Four Napkins, two Shirts, five Table-Cloths, a Holland Apron, a Sheet, twelve new Pewter Plates, and a Brass Mortar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they pawn'd?</p>
               <p>Parran. At one Perry's in Shepherd-Street; the Prisoner own'd that she had pawn'd the Things there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you heard the Prisoner say? Did she own the Things?</p>
               <p>Parran. Yes, she own'd the Things were stole from me, and several more that were not pawn'd there: I had a Warrant from Justice De Veil to search the House of the Pawnbroker. Both Perry and his Mother offer'd to swear that she had several of the Things away that we afterwards found there.</p>

On the 4th of January, I had been to Pall Mall, to see my aunt home; I lived with Mr. Beaufoy then, but lodged in New-road, South Lambeth.

               <p>"Stand, I demand your money, or else I'll blow your brains out." I told him I had got none; he said,</p>
               <p>"- You have." He still held the pistol to my face. Two more men came up instantly, and I stepped a foot or two back with my face to him; he followed me up, put the pistol to my temple, and said,</p>
               <p>"Positively I will blow your brains out, if you don't deliver your money;" they had all three laid hold of me, the man had his hand on my breast, when he said he would positively blow my brains out, but the others had not touched me at that time; they then laid hold of me, the man who presented the pistol having hold of my breast; one held me round the waist, and the other held me by the left arm. I said,</p>
               <p>"I will see you d - d before I give you money," and instantly made a rush to get away, and got loose from them. I cried out Murder, and the man who had the pistol immediately fired. I only called murder once; I did not see him fire; but saw the direction of the pistol, it was directed to me; the ball came so near as to brush against my hat, and knock it off. I caught it with my left hand on the top of my head; it knocked my hat up, the ball came under the hat brim; they all three ran off directly; the one who took hold of me behind, ran across the road - the other two ran through into Rochester-row, which leads out of the road. I followed them, and cried Stop thief! and saw one of them cross the row - they ran down the row; one crossed over the road - I believe that was the man who fired the pistol. I kept the other in my sight, and saw a soldier, who ran faster than me, catch him - it was the prisoner Raines; he is the man - I never lost sight of him. The soldier brought him back to the guard-house. Pace, the officer, came and searched him immediately, and found three or four pistol-balls and a powder-flask on him - he was searched within five minutes of his being taken. I saw Elliott in custody on the Friday following (this was on Sunday). I rather thought that he might be the person who fired, but when I came to see, the prisoner Wren (which was on the Tuesday following), I was satisfied that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140033"></xptr>he was the man who fired; he was taken on the Monday night or Tuesday morning, early.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Elliott, you at first thought he was the man who fired - A. Yes; but on seeing them both together on the Tuesday following, I believed Wren to be the man, by seeing him with his hat on, and believe now that Wren is the man who fired. He had some black stuff over his eyes when he fired - it came half way over his nose - I think it came over his eyes; he was the tallest of the three at the time; they all had their hats on. Wren, I believe, had blue or dark trowsers on; and, I think, a dark coat, and lightish waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the means of observing the dress of the other man, who you now call Elliott - A. Yes; by his height, and his dress, and figure, I think it was him - his dress was nearly like Wren's, I do not think there was any difference. I believe, on my oath, that those two men were both present at the time; the other man was not out of my sight till he was taken. I had drank nothing, and was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were a good deal alarmed - A. Yes; it was a darkish night, but this happened just under a lamp. I never saw either of them before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was more taken up with your escape than observing the parties - A. Yes; one of them was behind me. I have the hat which I wore - there is no mark on it. I believe it was the swiftness of the bullet coming under it that knocked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistol was so near to you that the wind of it could raise your hat without a bullet - A. Yes; I found no bullet - I thought there was a bullet.</p>
               <p>Q. One man being behind you, you had not much opportunity of seeing him - A. I saw him coming up - they both came up together. When I saw Wren, they put a hat on him, which was found that night, and I thought he was the man. It was not put on Elliott.</p>
               <p>Q. The hat made you form that conclusion - A. The hat and his appearance - it appeared to fit him the same as it did on the night in question. I could not see his forehead so well as, if it had been uncovered; they put nothing black on his face when they tried it on. He was about a yard from me when he fired - the muzzle of the pistol was within a few yards of me - it might raise my hat without a ball. Before they fired, I had said I would see them d - d first.</p>

            . I belong to the first regiment of the second battalion of the Grenadier Guards. On the 4th of January, a few minutes before eight o'clock, I was talking to my comrade, Harper, at the corner of the guard-room, in Rochester-row, and heard the report of a pistol or gun about two hundred yards off, and heard a man cry out Murder! I immediately afterwards heard somebody sing out Stop thief! Both the cries came from the spot where I heard the report. The corporal said something to me - I looked that way, and saw a man coming up Rochester-row, on the opposite side to me, running from where I heard the report. I ran after him - I saw no other man in pursuit. I did not see the prosecutor till I secured the man and brought him back to the guard-room. I pursued him about two hundred yards - he was running very fast; and as I ran after him he said,</p>
               <p>"What are you running after me for - I have done nothing?" I said,</p>
               <p>"There is a cry of Stop thief - run as hard as you will, I'll overtake you presently" - and took him at the corner of Vincent-square, brought him to the guard-room, and just as I got to the door, the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"That is one of the men that stopped me in the Vauxhall-road." I gave him in charge of the corporal, and immediately sent for Pace - it was the prisoner Raines. Pace searched him, and found four small pistol balls on him, and a glass bottle with powder in it; he also found a small piece of cane in his pocket, which, I think, had been used as a ramrod.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A ramrod is wanted whether you use powder only, or ball - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square, and live in Rochester-terrace, Vauxhall-road. I heard a call of Stop thief, about eight o'clock at night, as I sat by my fire; I immediately ran out; a man was coming up the steps, who said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake go down - there is a man stopped for a highway robbery!" and just as I got into the guard-room I saw Raines, and sent for my handcuffs - handcuffed and searched him, and found four bullets upon him - I do not think that they were moulded, but merely squeezed from the lead - a bottle with gunpowder in it, and a piece of cane, one end being rather forced up, apparently by pressure. Just after I had searched him, Stiff brought in a hat, and a piece of black stuff in it. I inspected it very minutely, and found the name of</p>
               <p>"J. Wren" in it; and knowing Wren well, and knowing that he wore such a hat, I apprehended him on Monday, the 12th, between twelve and one o'clock at night - I had been looking for him nearly every night - I have known him three or four years - I knew his lodgings, but could not find him there, nor at the places he frequented. I went to his lodgings once. I took him on the 12th, at twenty minutes to one o'clock in the morning, at a house of ill fame, No. 3, Almonry, on the second floor. I got in at the front of the house, broke two room doors open, and found him in bed with a girl of the town. When I got into the room, I asked who was there - he put his head out, and said</p>
               <p>"It is me, what do want with me?" He knew me very well - I had a light in my hand. I asked his name, and understood him to say Wilson, but will not be certain that he did not say Austin. I took him into custody. He asked if I wanted him for felony - I said I did. He dressed himself, and said he hoped I would not handcuff him, but I did immediately. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is your hat?"</p>
               <p>"Here it is," said he, and put a paper cap on his head, saying,</p>
               <p>"That is all the hat I have got." And while I was taking him out of the room he said,</p>
               <p>"I know what you want me for now - I am sure of being topped," which means hanging. I took him to the watch-house. I went to Raines' room on the morning of the 5th of January, and knocked at the door; his wife answered, and in the room I found a large vice, which screws up. I had the balls in my pocket; I put one into the vice, and it exactly corresponded with the inside of the vice. On the same day (5th) I went in search of Elliott, and found him near Salisbury-square, Fleet-street, and told him I wanted him, on suspicion of a highway robbery; searched him, and in his left hand pocket I found three flints, a small key, 2 s. 6 d., and a quantity of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. - Q. Raines never admitted to you that they were his lodgings which you went to - A. No.</p>

            . It was a pistol of this description - this appears to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not notice it much - A. I speak from the brightness and size of it. It looked brighter than it does now.</p>
               <p>ELLIOTT'S Defence. My Lord, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>WREN'S Defence. I was at the Rose and Crown, public-house, over the water, at the time.</p>

               <p>RAINES' Defence. On Sunday morning, before I was out of bed, Elliott called on me, and asked if had got any lead - I said I had not. He said he was going to the Middlesex Hospital, and would call on me in his way back.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Wren a good character, and three deposed the same on behalf of Raines.</p>

            . I am prosecutor, the prisoner brought a jacket into my house in order to sell it, he ask'd five shillings for it, but I bought it for three, and put it in my bar, and I know nothing of the taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him in money or liquor?</p>
               <p>Pawsey. I gave it him all in money. He came in with a companion with him on the 18th of October, and call'd for a pint of hot, and I made it: The water was coming in and I went out to fill my water tub, and when I came in again his companion was gone and the prisoner alone in the tap-room.</p>

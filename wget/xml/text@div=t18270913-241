            . I am an officer. I found this tin-box in the prisoner's jacket pocket at the office, on the 31st of August; Rose was there, and said he had been robbed of these articles and the tin-box - the prisoner said it was his own property; he had been brought on the 30th of August to the watch-house, on suspicion of stealing some other things; he said he had taken them from the house where his brother was lodging, to take care of them.</p>

            . I lost my shirt, trousers, handkerchief, and snuff-box, on the 30th of August - the prisoner has my handkerchief on his neck now - I came that day from the India-house to Mr. Cole's. I saw the prisoner there, and he said, "I will cook for you, if you will give me a mouthful of rice;" I gave him a half-crown to go and get some beer; he went away, and did not return with it - he afterwards came and took my clothes away. I was a little tipsy, and went after him, but he got away - this was on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell any body of it that night? A. No; I was not so drunk as not to know what was going on. I saw him take the articles; I know this tin-box to be mine; I saw him take it along with the other things.</p>
               <p>GEO. DEVEREL re-examined. Q. When did you take this box from the prisoner? A. On the 31st of August; Rose came the next morning with another person, on another charge. I found on him a bag, which belongs to the other prosecutor and this box in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The things I took I delivered to the officer. I did not steal them; Stevens gave me them to take care of.</p>

            . Rose is a Lascar. There is a barrack for Lascars in Shadwell, and he was there; I saw the shirt and trousers, and other things belonging to Rose- the prisoner is a stranger. I never told him to take any of Rose's things, or to take care of them.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY ROSE. Q. How do you know this box? A. It has been black, and the black is rubbed off - that is my handkerchief round his neck; it is quite plain, and has no border; it is three-cornered shape.</p>

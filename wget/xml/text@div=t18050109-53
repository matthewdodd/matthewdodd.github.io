I am: On Saturday, I think the 15th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to purchase a goose; she offered a dollar in payment for it; I went with the dollar into Mr. Glover's shop, a neighbour of mine, knowing that he had a balance with which he weighed dollars, and upon weighing it we found it was light; Mr. Glover then took it out of my hand and rubbed it on a steel; after that, he returned it to the prisoner at the bar; I told her I did not think it was a good one, and I would not take it; she then said she would leave her basket and the goose, and bring me the money presently; she left the basket and the goose.</p>

This is the dollar; here is the mark I made upon it; I said to her, you know it is a bad one as well as I do; I returned it to her, and she went to Mr. Barber's, who is an egg-merchant, and deals in butter, up Ship-tavern passage, in Leadenhall-market, about five doors from my house, on the same side of the way; I followed her for the purpose of watching her; there were a number of butter-flats piled up; I stood behind them, and heard her ask the price of two lumps of butter; she agreed for the price, and went into the accompting-house to pay for it; I saw the clerk found a dollar, and upon hearing it found I thought it was the same, or one similar; I went in, and said to Mr. Barber's clerk -</p>

He got from me, and I tried to stop him - he was stopped about ten yards from me by the constable, who took the watch from him. I have not found the seals - he was alone; I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 26th of October, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street, near Artillery-lane, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me; I ran and stopped him - another young man also laid hold of him. The prosecutor came up in about a minute, and said the prisoner had robbed him of his watch. I endeavoured to search him, but he had the watch in his right hand, and held it at a distance from me, with his hand stretched out. I told him to give it to me, but he at first refused; I took it out of his hand, but did not find the seals - part of the ribbon hung to the watch. I took him to the watch-house - he said nothing; I found only a halfpenny on him - I never saw him before. On taking him to the Compter I searched his foraging cap, and found a razor concealed in it - he is a soldier.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor in Houndsditch, and he asked me to go and drink with him. We went to the Nag's Head, public-house, and had a pint of beer and a pint of gin. He went up a court with me, and I asked him the time? - he took his watch out. The wicked thought came to my mind at that moment, to cut the ribbon, and take the watch, which I did. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

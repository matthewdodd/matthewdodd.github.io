                  </hi>. I am going on for sixteen years old. I am the son of John Robinson, sen., of No. 19, Kingsland-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—he is a cutler—on the night of the 18th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary I was in my father's shop, and observed, through the window, the prisoners looking in at the window—that was Harris and Sheen—they could see me—they moved away from the window on seeing me, and re<lb></lb>turned more than once—this continued about half an hour or three quarters, and when I came to the door they ran away—I was looking over towards the cook-shop—I saw a piece of glass lying down—I found the glass was taken out of the window, and a hole large enough for a hand to be put through, and the knives gone—this was just before eight o'clock—I missed four pen<lb></lb>knives and a pocket-knife—the knives had been quite close to the pane of glass, except the pocket-knife, which was further on—I gave information to Sayer, the policeman—Sheen and Harris were afterwards brought into the shop and searched in my presence—on Sheen a piece of wire was found, which had been in the shop window—I had been filing it, and had placed it there before the knives—I knew it to be the same—I did not miss it from the window till it was found—I afterwards saw in the policeman's hands, two of the penknives, which I knew by a flaw in each handle—they were 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the pocket-knife is worth 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>Was you at your house on the 7th of June last? - I was; about ten or twelve men came to my house, at about a quarter after twelve o'clock at night; they broke the doors in, and broke all the glasses, and destroyed all the furniture, throwed it out at the windows, and burnt it in the street; they broke one door entirely down, and several other doors the pannels were knocked out.</p>
               <p>Was it the outer or inner door of your house which was broken? - The inner door entirely down.</p>
               <p>How was the wainscoting in the garret? - Broke; there were holes broke through the garret, and in the house are some places where they have broke, but not pulled down;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280157"></xptr> there is a partition in the garret which is entirely broke through; the doors were pulled down.</p>
               <p>How was your outward door? - The pannel was broke in, and through that pannel they got into the house.</p>
               <p>Was the house in repair before they broke in? - Yes it was.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Lady Austin. I live in North Audley-street.</p>
               <p>Were you in Woodstock-street at the time Mr. Schomberg's house was attacked? - Yes; the mob began at a quarter after twelve o'clock I was passing through the street.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I did not stay there long; I went to South Audley-street, and then came back again.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any person in particular who you can speak to being present in that mob? - If they are here I can speak to them.</p>
               <p>Look round and see if you see any one? - I saw that person (the prisoner.) When I first saw him he was coming out at the door with something in his arms, which appeared like chair covers; I had seen him several times before but not to speak to him, but I knew him by passing the streets once or twice a day; he drove cows about.</p>
               <p>What did he do with those chair covers? - Threw them into the fire which was burning before the door.</p>
               <p>Did you after that observe him do any thing? - Yes, I saw him come and stand under the window, receive the things which were thrown out from the one and two pair of stair's window, and throw them into the fire likewise.</p>

               <p>Did you observe him have any thing in his hand? - I observed him have a link in one hand and a stick in the other.</p>
               <p>How long was that after? - I cannot say justly; he was raking the fire with the stick, and setting the things on fire with the link.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner apprehended? - On the 21st, last Monday.</p>
               <p>How came he to be apprehended? - I saw him in the street, on the 20th, upon a grey horse; I mentioned it to my lady; she wrote immediately to Lord Le Despencer, and his lordship sent to Sir

               <p>Had you not seen him between the 7th and the 20th? - Not to my remembrance, if I had I believe I should have made a remark of him before.</p>
               <p>Had you given any description of him before? - I mentioned it to my fellow servant as soon as I got home, that I happened to see this person; I had seen him about the streets several times, and that I positively could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the same day that the house was burnt, or when you saw him with the grey horse? - The same day the house was destroyed. They asked me what I had seen, what passed, and then I described the prisoner to them.</p>

               <p>Jury. What was the reason of your being there at that late hour? - Lord Le Despencer, who lives in Hanover-square, is my lady's own brother. His lordship's house was threatened to be plundered that night; my lady desired me on that account to go there that I might inform her whether there was any danger or not; and so I continued going backwards and forwards till four o'clock in the morning, and then I went off.</p>

               <p>Jury to Tribble. Was the prisoner in your service till he was taken up? - Yes, in the compacity as he was before, and went about the street in his business as before this time; he never kept out of the way a minute.</p>
               <p>To Rose. Do you look upon yourself as entitled to the reward? - I do not know that I am. I have heard there is a reward about something, but what I do not know.</p>

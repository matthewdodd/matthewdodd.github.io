                  </hi> I am in partnership with Messrs. Welch and Margetson, of Cheapside. On the 25th of Aug. I was passing along Hoxton, and in the window of Mrs. Collins' shop saw this handkerchief—I took pos<lb></lb>session of it, took it to our warehouse, and compared it with some we had made by a witness—we have five dozen and two made—we were six deficient—I swear this is one of the six—there was another handkerchief at Mrs. Collins', which the officer seized—that was a different pattern—we had not sold one of this pattern—they were to have been sold at the end of this month—they were not made for any one but us—no one would have a right to make them—we are the inventers of the pattern—this pattern was drawn on our premises, and sent to a house in Macclesfield to be made for us—we register most of them, but this is not registered—there are 512 threads in the manufacture of the border alone—I swear that no one made this pattern but us—this other handkerchief is our pattern, which we have not sold one of—we are printers as well—here is another handkerchief, which is our printing—these others have not been sold—these were not shown—they were to be in our possession from five to six weeks—we have a dozen or two up every week till the order is completed—we had five dozen and two of this sort, and five dozen and three of the other—we have mixed six of each pattern—I saw the prisoner at the station, and said, "How long have you had these handker<lb></lb>chiefs?"—he said, "I have had them eight or nine months"—I said, "Are you sure of that"—ha said, "It is an accumulation of stock I have had eight or nine months."</p>

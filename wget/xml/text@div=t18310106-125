On the morning of the 1st of January the prisoner came to my house, and asked me to grind an axe and put a handle to it - while I was doing it my back was towards him; he went out once, and came in again - I caught him putting my smoothing-plane into his hat; I said I would give him to an officer - he ran out, and I followed, but could not catch him; he had left the plane and his hat behind him - I had not told him to go but said I would fetch an officer; I did not tell him to go out - this signature to the deposition is my hand-writing; I told him to go, and he ran off fast - he was not brought back to my shop in custody; he was put into custody, but not brought back - it is not true that he was brought back in custody; he did not come again to my shop after he went away - the constable brought these other articles to me; they had been in my shop that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never touched any thing but that plane; I bought the other things at a sale shop in Chelsea, that morning - I asked him if he would lend me that plane for about an hour; I took up the plane and just put it to my hat, and he said," You are going to rob me, you had better go out of my house" - out I went and he after me, crying, "Watch and stop thief!" - then there came twelve Policemen round me, and I killed six of them with my stick - I am the King of Sardinia, and a captain general in his Majesty's service besides.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I followed the prisoner into Westbourn-street Pimlico - he went into a baker's yard and concealed himself in the privy; I stood in the passage, saw him come out, and run across the yard to the wash-house - I followed him into the washhouse, and he had no coat or jacket on - he had a red jacket on when I first saw him, the same as he has on now; it appeared to me to be the same - I found it in the washhouse; I have not said I found it in the privy - I found in it a snuff-box, a tobacco-box, this tin case, a pair of tips, and some nails to go in them, a two feet rule, and a soldering-iron - I said to him, "You must go with me, I am informed you have stolen a plane." he said he had not brought it from the house; I then put up the two feet rule and the soldering iron, and asked if he had any knowledge of them; he said No; I found the rule under the jacket - I then asked him where he lived, he said he could not distinctly tell, but it was in Little Ebury-street- that he had not been near there for many days; I took him to the watch-house, and then went to his lodgings -I found his wife there, and the people of the house said he lodged there; I found a good many articles there, among them was this square and this turn-screw.</p>

            , up in the City, he will give me the greatest character that a man ever got, for honesty, sobriety, and hard working - I declare to God, I never had any of this man's tools in my hand but the plane; that tin box I had bought that day to put some cash bills in; that rule I do not know any thing about; I have five of them at home myself, and that screw-driver is mine, the plane would not go into my hat; I took it in my hand and put my hat on - I gave 1s. for that square on new year's-day morning.</p>

            . I am a medical man, and am employed in this prison; I have seen the prisoner daily since he has been in custody, and have taken particular pains to ascertain the state of his mind, and he has related his adventures to me so connectedly and so consistently that I entertained some doubts as to his insanity, but within these last two or three days my conversations with him have been longer, and I have some doubts of his being of sound mind; from the appearance of his head, from an injury he received in battle, I am led to conclude that his brain has been affected - the external mark of violence leads me to conclude his brain has been injured; it is such an injury, as liquor frequently operates upon, to deprive persons of their senses - he says he has a plate in his head; I have not detected it to my own satisfaction, but there is a depression on the scull.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Sir, as a person of science, do you, on your oath, believe him to be deranged or not? A. I believe him to be of deranged mind, my Lord.</p>

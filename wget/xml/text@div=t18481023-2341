About a quarter to one o'clock in the morning, I was in Golden-lane, and saw the female prisoner sitting on Mr. Boffey's door step—I passed her, went into the back yard, and found Blackborough standing there—I asked him what he was there for—he said, "I came through to make water"—he was not so doing, but had his hand in. his pocket—I lighted a match-while so doing he passed me, and went through the passage—in the passage of the house I saw the lock taken from the door that leads to the cellar—I went down a few steps and heard a noise as if some one was knocking against the glass—the match went out, and I lighted another—the cellar flap, which was outside the house about two yards from where the female was sitting, was lifted up, and I heard some one run—I called to my fellow-constable—when I got into the lane, I saw Blackborough and Rosa Laxton in Blogg's custody.</p>

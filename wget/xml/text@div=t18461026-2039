                  </hi>. I am a pastrycook, and live in Church-lane, White-chapel—the prisoner was in my service on the 29th of Sept.—he had been in my service then for about four months, and he had been with me formerly—on the 29th of Sept. I went to a marine-store dealer's shop in Backchurch-lane—when I got opposite the shop I saw the prisoner just come out of the door—I went into the shop and found this basket, which lean identify as mine, and some ginger-beer bottles—I sell ginger-beer in such bottles as these, and I had missed a great many from my premises—Elizabeth Robinson was there—I then went to the prisoner's lodgings, and in a few minutes the pri-soner came in—I said, "William, I want you to account for the bottles you have been selling?"—he said, "All right, Sir," and ran off—he ran down Wellclose-square, and was found against the Dock-wall, lying down, apparently asleep—I missed two baskets of bottles the same day.</p>

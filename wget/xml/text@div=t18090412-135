             I am an apprentice to Mr. Burkett, chemist and druggist, 20, Fleet-street. On the 6th of March, in the fore part of the day, the prisoner came to our shop for a pennyworth of candied horehound, I gave it her; she gave me a six-pence, I shewed it to Mr. Fletcher, he kept the six-pence, and I gave her the change, and she went away. On the 8th of March she came again; she asked for a pennyworth of Spanish juice, I gave it her, she gave me sixpence, I gave her the change; I put the six-pence in the upper part of the till, where there was not any other money. Mr. Fletcher has the six-pence, I saw him take it. On the 14th of March she came again, and asked for half an ounce of cream of tartar, that came to two-pence; she gave me another six-pence, I took it to Mr. Fletcher, he nipped it with a pair of scissars; and there I saw the copper; he came and told the woman this was a bad six-pence, she must know of it, he had given her warning. I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>COURT. The three six-pences were given to Mr. Fletcher by you - A. Yes.</p>

             a six-pence, he gave it me; that sixpence I put into a box by itself. On the 8th the prisoner came again for a pennyworth of Spanish juice; she offered another six-pence; I looked at it; I compared them together, I thought they were both of one stamp. On the 14th the prisoner came again for half an ounce of cream of tartar; she offered another six-pence; I cut it with the scissars, I saw it was a bad one; I told her she must be aware of it being a bad six-pence, for I had told her that the first she offered was a bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to take them - did you know it to be a bad one on the 8th - A. Yes; I meaned then to have her taken up, but having no person in the shop, I could not. When she came on the 14th, then I was certain that she was an utterer of bad money; then I had her taken up. I have kept the sixpences ever since; these are the six-pences.</p>

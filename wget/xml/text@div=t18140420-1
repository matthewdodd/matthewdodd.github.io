               <p>Q. Is the shop a part of the dwelling-house - A. Yes, it is. There is but one door to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a noise was it - A. It was a noise like the ratling of shots against the window. Upon my hearing the noise I went out to the shop door, and I caught hold of this boy. I asked him what he was doing; I don't know that he made any answer. He did not go. A man came up and assisted me in taking him into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of articles were there in that shop - A. Hosiery, and clothes of different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him into the shop, did you examine the shop to see how it was entered - A. Yes; I put my hand in the hole, and observed the glass broke. The stockings were in a glass case. The hole was big enough to take out the stockings. We found the boy outside of the shop; I found no other boy there. The prisoner was standing close to the hole outside of the shop; we took him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him before you took him into the house - A. No, not till we took him into the house, and then we found one pair of stockings upon him; they had the shop mark; they are my husband's property. The prisoner was taken to the office the next morning; I was present at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this; was there day light enough to distinguish any human face without the assistance of candles - A. I cannot say; there might.</p>

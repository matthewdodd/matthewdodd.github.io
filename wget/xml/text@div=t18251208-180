Last Saturday night I was in the back of their shop, and saw the prisoner come and take a piece of bacon out of the window; she came a little way into the shop afterwards, and went out immediately. I went and took her one house off; I brought her back with the bacon under her arm.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into the shop to buy a bit of bacon, and there was not a bit to suit me; I walked out again, and was not three yards from the shop, when the young man came and took me back to the door of the back parlour - he said, "What have you got there?" I said, "I have nothing;" he turned back to the shop - he then saw a piece of bacon by my side on the counter, and said,"Here it is."</p>
               <p>GEORGE SHARP re-examined. I brought her back with it in her arm - when I got her to the back of the shop I said, "Where is the bacon," and the young man who was in the shop said, "Here it is;" he saw her lay it down on the counter. I declare that she took it from the window; I saw her take it and bring it into the shop, and go out again. I did not see her put it on the counter, but I saw her with it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see it in her possession after you brought her back into the shop? A. No; she had put it down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Here is what you stated before the Magistrate, and signed, "I followed after her, and took her at the corner of Hampshire Hog-yard, and took from underneath her shawl the piece of bacon now produced;" now which of these is true? A. My Lord, I might have made a mistake; but I have said nothing falsely.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the bacon you saw on the counter is the piece you saw her take? A. I found the property on her.</p>

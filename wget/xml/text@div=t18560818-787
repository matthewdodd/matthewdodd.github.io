                  </hi>. I reside at No. 18, Compton-street, Brunswick<lb></lb>square; I am married; my husband is abroad. On Sunday, 6th July, went to Kilburn to spend the day with my brother—before going there, I locked my room up—I filled my teapot full of tea and hot water, to make cold tea, took it into my bedroom, locked the door, and took the key in my pocket—I came back from Paddington about a quarter to 11 o'clock at night—I walked the best part of the way home—I was very hot and fatigued, it was rather a showery evening, and I hurried home—I desired Walker to fetch me half a quartern of gin, and to ask for the loan of a bottle—he brought me back the bottle produced—I said, "John, you have brought me a good half quartern, this is nearly a quartern; as it is I shall divide it in two, and take one half this evening"—I took it up stairs into my bedroom, and took off some of my things, to get to bed—I poured about half of what was in the bottle into a tumbler of cold tea—I took about a quarter part of it—I experienced a dreadful burning and vomiting and on the Tuesday I was very much disordered in my bowels—I ran down stairs with the bottle, and said to Walker, "John, you have not brought me gin, you have brought me poisoa; who dravoed it?"—he said, "I asked Mr. Westcott to lend me a bottle"—I went as I was to Mr. Hopton, a surgeon, at the corner of Judd-street—I saw him, and told him I had been poisoned—he prescribed for me, and gave me a bottle of stuff—I left the bottle I had taken, with him—I was very ill for about four days—I went to Mr. Westcott on the Mondav morning: I did not see him: I saw a stout man, and left word with him—I went home, and in the afternoon Mr. Westcott came—I said to him, "Mr. Westcott, this is a very serious thing for you to send this poison instead of gin; Mr. Palmer has not poisoned enough, but it appears that you want to poison me"—he replied, "In the hurry of business, I am sorry I made a mistake; I suppose it was vitriol and copperas, or some other liquid, that was kept behind the bar to clean the bar and things"—I said, "Well, Mr. Westcott, that is a very serious thing"—he said, "It is a great blessing you did not take it neat,</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Pater, solicitor for the prose<lb></lb>cation—I delivered this notice at Mr. Westcott's, the Hunter's Arms—it was to all appearance an ordinary public house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you formerly live at Bristol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not deliver the notice to Mr. Westcott, I left it with his wife at his dwell<lb></lb>ing house—(<hi rend="italic">This was a notice to the defendant to produce his licence</hi>; <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that the defendant had only been in the house a few days, and the licence had not been transferred.</hi>)</p>

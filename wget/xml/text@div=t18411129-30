                  </hi>. I live with my father, in King William-street—about one o'clock on the 9th of November, I was going up Cannon-street towards King William-street—I turned round to look for a friend, and the prisoner passed me—I felt a violent pull at my handkerchief, in which I had a pin—I immediately looked, and it was gone—I ran after the pri<lb></lb>soner, collared him, and accused him of stealing it, which he denied—a person came up, and said he bad seen him throw something glittering away—he went to look, and found the pin—it was mine—the prisoner tried to make his escape when he heard it was found.</p>

I was passing the end of Martin's-lane—I heard the prosecutor say, "The fellow, or the man, has got my pin"—the prisoner attempted to run, but the prosecutor prevented him—I saw the prisoner throw something from his left hand down St. Martin's-lane—I went and searched, and the pin was found by a little boy, who gave it to me.</p>

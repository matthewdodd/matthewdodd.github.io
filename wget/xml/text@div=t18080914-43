            . Q. What are you - A. I am employed in Apothecaries' hall. On the 2nd of September, after spending the evening. I was returning home; drinking a good deal of wine and other things, and being a good deal overtaken with liquor. I was very sick at the corner of Long lane; by some means I went to sleep at the corner; I know no further.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid down - A. I sat down, as I understand. I was violently sick, and a perspiration overcame me.</p>

            . Q. You are a watchman - A I was off my watch at that time; I was going home about five o'clock; I was walking down Long lane; I observed White sitting at a door, he had lost then his hat from his head, and the shoes from his feet cash, and every thing else that he had about him.</p>
               <p>Q. That you cannot say what cash he had; you could see whether he had hat and shoes - A. I was then walking towards my place; I observed as I walked along Skinner and West, they were about as far as you may say a quarter of a mile off; Skinner had the hat swinging in his hand, West was walking with him, and he took out from under his coat, as it were, a pair of shoes, and gave them to Skinner; Skinner asked him what he was to give him; but as to the answer I do not know; he took and put his hand into his pocket and pulled out something, which I supposed to be money; I could not ascertain whether it was or not; afterwards they went in the French Horn alehouse, Beech street, and I went in after them; and when I came out I got assistance and took them in custody; when they came out from thence we came up to Mr. White in Long lane; he was up then and quite awake; I gave them over to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon them - A. Yes, the hat and shoes: the watch and handkerchief has not been found; there was a pen knife picked up by a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say that Skinner bought of the other prisoner a pair of shoes - A. I cannot say how that is; he gave him the shoes, and Skinner gave him something; what it was for I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a considerable distance from where the man was sitting on the stop - A. Yes, it was in Barbican that he took the shoes and gave him something.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor has told us he was exceeding drunk - he did not know what he was about - A. I do not think he by any means knew what he was about; I asked Skinner which way he came by the hat and shoes; he told me did not know; he was as drunk as the other; they were all drunk; I cannot say West was as drunk as the other.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. Sepulchre's. On Friday morning the 2nd of September, I was returning from my duty, about a quarter after five o'clock; I was going down Beech street; the former witness was standing by the French Horn; Skinner and West came out from the French Horn; Skinner had a hat and shoes concealed under his coat; a person there said he had property that did not belong to him; he made a blow at him; I immediately took hold of Skinner, I said you have got that which does not belong to you, they belong to that person sitting in Long lane; he replied I am innocent; I said so much the better for you if you are innocent you shall go back with me, then we shall know whether you are innocent or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is West a watchman - A. I understand he is a watchman in Aldersgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk too. - A. No; nor did Skinner appear to be so drunk at that time, but at the Barley-Mow he got more liquor and appeared worser than he did before; he then throwed some things from his pocket; the penknife was the only thing that was picked up; I secured Skinner in the back room; West made his escape by the assistance of some drover. The hat and shoes were delivered up to the officer; there was some money found upon Skinner; the watch was not found.</p>
               <p>MR. KENDRICK. On Friday morning the 2nd of September, I saw the prosecutor sitting on the step, with his head leaning against the door post, without hat and shoes, his sob pocket was cut open, his breeches pocket turned inside out, and his waistcoat pocket likewise; I received information that two men had gone up Long lane and Barbican with the hat in one of their hands; I immediately went after them; I found them at the French Horn in Beech street, they were drinking at the bar. Skinner said he could dispose of the property; I followed them out; I told Skinner he must go with me; he put himself in a posture of defence and said he would not, with horrid oaths; directly Gullen and Davis stepped up; Skinner was going to knock me down; they seized Skinner; I laid hold of West, we brought them back to the Barley Mow, Long lane; Skinner was taken in custody; - a penknife and fifteen shillings were taken from his pocket.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Skinner's Defence. I was in a state of intoxication; I might pick them up in the street as they were laying about, I cannot say; I never saw the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>West's Defence. When I came from my duty I met with Skinner, we went to the French Horn to have a glass of liquor; the reason I had the shoes, we were playing and walking about together; I never was in Long lane at all.</p>
               <p>Skinner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

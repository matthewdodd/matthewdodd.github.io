I had the care of his gelding: on the 23d of July I turned it out into the field about six o'clock in the evening - I put the saddle and bridle into the stable, and locked the door - the saddle had not been used that day - there are two gates to the field from the road: I put the gelding into a field through the gate leading out of the stable yard - there are two other gates to the field - one leads out of that field, into another, and one leads into the garden - that gate has hurdles set round an apple-tree, to protect the apples: the hurdles went all round the gate - the horse could not get through that gate without breaking through the hurdles, which were all closed, but I am not certain whether they were all tied; all the gates were fastened - the small gate leading into the garden was pinned, and the horse could not get out without the pin being taken out. On the following morning, between six and seven o'clock, I found the stable door standing a little way open, and the bolt of the lock forced out; I missed the saddle and bridle. I went into the field, and the gelding was gone; there was a poney and another horse left; I found in the field one girth of the saddle and the corn-seive, which had been taken out of the corn-bin. I saw that one hurdle was open, and traced the horse through the gate into the garden, by his foot-marks; he was peculiarly shod - he had then gone up a grass walk by the side of the field, through two gates, which had been left pinned, and had then to cross more fields into the road. I accompanied master to London next day, and went with Armstrong and Attfield to several places - and about eleven o'clock in the morning of the 25th, I saw the horse in Chenies-mews, near Tottenham-court-road, and saw the saddle and bridle hanging in the stable there; it was a dark brown gelding. I saw the prisoner, but not when I first went in - I saw him a little after one o'clock; I waited for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that you saw the prisoner that day? A. Yes; what I said was taken down; I was asked if I saw French, and said I did - I was there two or three times; I only signed my examination once - it was read over to me, and I signed it. I cannot say whether every thing I said was taken down.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went with Armstrong and Petchy to No. 42, Chenies-mews; a woman answered the door - I went into the stable, and Petchy immediately identified the first horse in the first stall; he said, "Here is my master's horse" - we found a saddle and bridle there, which he also claimed; we waited some time, for the owner of the stables to come home - we did not see him, and we took the horse to a stable in the Curtain-road. On the 6th of October I, Garton, and Armstrong went to a house in Park-place, near Kennington-common - I knocked at the door; a woman looked out of the first floor window, and I knew her to be the woman whom I had seen at the stables in Chenies-mews - we were admitted at last; I went up stairs, and saw the prisoner there - it is above three miles from the mews. I said, "French, here you are" - "Yes, Mr. Attfield," said he; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250038"></xptr>I had had a great deal of trouble in looking after him since the 25th of July - he said he was exceedingly sorry for it, but he had been kept out of the way by the parties, who had allowed him 1l. a week - I said he must get ready and go with us; I asked him about the horses in Chenies-mews, whether the stables there were his - he said they were: we then took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said at once they were his stables? A. Yes - he behaved very well, and came very quietly. He said that the parties had allowed him 1l. a week to keep out of the way.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's son, and am seventeen years old. I saw these horses taken away from the stable - I remember a dark brown one - I was present when it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, how that horse came to your father's stables? A. I went out to work at six o'clock on a Wednesday, I think it was, and when I came back to breakfast it was there; it was not there when I went out; my father was at home when I went out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought the horse there? A. A tall young man brought it; he was there on the evening before about it; his name is Thomas Shaw - I have seen him before at my father's stables; he lives in Osnaburg-street, New-road - I do not know the number; it is a stable-yard; he was to pay a guinea a week for the horse - I heard that said.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you hear it said, he was to pay a guinea a week? A. On the Monday morning - I cannot say what day of the month it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Monday would be the 23d? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Monday morning that Shaw came to the stables? A. It was Monday when I came from breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before it was Wednesday? A. Yes; the horse came on Wednesday - I came home to breakfast at eight o'clock on Wednesday; my father was not at home then, but he was at six.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home on Monday night, was your father at home? A. Yes; he went out on Tuesday morning, after I went out - I found the horse there on Wednesday morning - I do not know who brought it myself; my father was out on Wednesday; only one horse was brought - there were two there before - I do not know who brought them - I have known Shaw twelve months; he is very well, I believe - I have not been to Osnaburg-street since my father was apprehended - I did not know before this morning that I was to come here to give evidence - Shaw keeps livery-stables.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. You went out at six o'clock on Wednesday - when did the officers come? A. On Thursday; it was Thursday; I was fetched from my work, when they came, as there was nobody at home with the children; a little boy who lives opposite fetched me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came and spoke to the officers? A. Yes; the horse was brought on Wednesday, between six and eight o'clock - I saw the officers when I was fetched - I did not tell them when the horse was brought; they did not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask why they took the horses away? A. No; my mother was at home, crying, as they took her away from the children - I did not ask them why they took my mother away; which way was I to interfere? they took the horse away with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "That is the horse my father is to be paid for?" A. I told Attfield it was the horse that was brought in the morning, and my mother told them who brought it - I will swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she tell them had brought it? A. The name of Young - I believe the name of Wright; the young man who brought it, said his name was Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was Thomas Shaw? A. Thomas Shaw came about the horse; he bargained about it; my father and I were in the stable at the time; my father slept at home the night before the horse was taken away - I do not know where he slept the next night; he was not at home, nor my mother; the officers had taken her away; they locked her up at Worship-street, and would not let me see her - I did not state at Worship-street, that it was Shaw's horse; they did not ask me any question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the officers, "My mother knows nothing about this horse; it was brought by Shaw, and you will find him at Osnaburg-street?" A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body, from that time to this, that the horse was brought there by Shaw? A. No - I have not been at home: I have been at work at Dulwich - Shaw keeps livery stables; he keeps them at this time; he had not room in his own stable for it - I was there the day before; he had three horses tied up under the shed then - I do not think I have seen him since that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to him, and say, "My mother is taken, because your horse was found in our stable, come and get her liberated?" A. No - I have not been to him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250039"></xptr>my father has been taken up three weeks on Saturday - I have not been to look after Shaw - I have not had an opportunity - I have been at my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but your father's life was concerned, and did not you go and inquire for Shaw? A. No - I had no idea of it; there were my sisters at home - I did not send them there - I was not present when my father was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. After your father was taken, did you tell any body Shaw had left the horse there? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the stables after the horses were taken away? A. There was nobody to do the business - I do not know where my father was, and did not inquire where he was - I have since been living at my place, with Mr. Berwick, coach-master of Dulwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Berwick, that your father had been taken up for a horse, lodged in the stable by another man? A. No - Shaw is a tallish young man - I have not seen him since; my mother was kept in prison three weeks - I went to see her; she did not desire me to call on Shaw - I did not tell her Shaw had brought the horse; she was up stairs when it came, and could see if she liked - I was not there when it came - I have not talked with her about it, or how it came there.</p>

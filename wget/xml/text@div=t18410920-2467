                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, and live at Stepney. I met the prisoner in the Commercial-road, on the 3rd of September, from nine to ten o'clock at night—I had been drinking a little ale, but was sober enough to know what I was about—I went with her to some apartment of hers—I believe it was in Tarling's-lane—I put my trowsers under the pillow—I bad seven sovereigns and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in a purse in my trowsers' pocket—I felt them safe in the pocket when I put the trowsers under the pillow—I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—she turned the button of the door, which would</p>

               <p>keep persons out, and we went to bed—I fell asleep—I was awoke at twelve o'clock by the prisoner—she was then up—she said I was to get up, as she had a friend coming to see her at twelve o'clock—I got up, and found my trowsers partly drawn from under the pillow—the purse and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note were there, but I missed the sovereigns—I said, "You have robbed me"—she said she had not—I called the officer, and gave her into custody.</p>

The prosecutor called for the police, and I found the prisoner in the kitchen of No. 2, Tarling-street—I questioned her about the money, and she denied it—I asked her if any body had been in the room but her and the prosecutor, and she said, "No"—I searched the place, but found nothing—she had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her hand—on the road to the station the prosecutor said, "If you will give the policeman 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

I apprehended the prisoner on the step of a door, on the morning of the 13th of September, which was ten days after the alleged robbery—she was drunk—she threw her shawl off at the station, and I saw a biscuit sticking in her bosom—I took it out, and found it to strike against something—I took out a piece of paper, containing three sovereigns, four half-crowns, five shillings, two pence, and two farthings—the sergeant said, "I suppose that is the cow-man's money?"—she said, "Yes, I <hi rend="italic">milked</hi> his cows."</p>

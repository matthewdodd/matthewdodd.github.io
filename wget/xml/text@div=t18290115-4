On Friday, the 5th of December I went to my employ, as usual, between twelve and one o'clock; I am a carpenter - I left the house in the care of my daughter Julia, who is about twelve years old, leaving my wearing-apparel safe: I was fetched by her between three and four o'clock, and found the bed-room door broken open. The prisoner, I am sorry to say, is my son; I found several persons round the door, in consequence of the alarm - I found my son next morning, between nine and ten o'clock, at his lodging in Duke-street, St. George's-fields; he is a painter and glazier: I took him immediately to the office in Queen-square, and a pair of black ribbed worsted stockings, quite new, were found on him: I knew them by a peculiar mark on them, which I observed when my wife brought them home, and I objected to them, as I thought it was a defect: I am quite sure they were in my box between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

I am the prosecutor's daughter. -On Friday, the 5th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, he left me at home; the prisoner came and brought a message that I was to go to my aunt's to tea- she lives at Lambeth: I said my father's orders were that I was not to leave the place - he said, "You had better go;" I said No, I could not; I did not go - he went up stairs, washed his hands, and then went down and filled the pitcher; I went out about half-past two o'clock, for some bread, and he went out with me - I locked both the room doors; when I got into Rochester-row I saw two girls, and left him talking to them - I was out about half an hour; I went to Strutton-ground, about half a mile from my father's house, and when I came back I found the bed-room door broken open - the lock was broken; my father's box was broken open, and all the things taken out: I saw nothing more of the prisoner that night.</p>

            . On the 12th of October, about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner, with another lad. They passed me. There was a boy looking at them. I went home with a sack which I had with me, then returned and followed them. They saw me, and the prisoner threw some lead through a broken railing, in two bundles, and ran away. I pursued them about thirty yards, but finding they got a-head of me, I returned and got the bundles out of the railings. I took one bundle to the watch-house. The watchman was calling past eight o'clock. I got a light and found the other bundle of lead, and took that to the watch-house. Each man had a bundle of lead; they weighed 84lbs. together. I am certain the prisoner was one of them. I have known him three years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. They were about fifty yards from the house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EARLEY. The lead belonged to the cistern. I fitted it.</p>

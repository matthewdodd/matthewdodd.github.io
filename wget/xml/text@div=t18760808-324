                  </hi>. I am a Magistrate for the County of Sussex and live at B Park—I took an active part in the Tichborne case, in favour of the defendant, and gave my evidence at both trials—I am president of the Central Belief Association—Mr. Harding is secretary—in May of the present year it came to my knowledge that an application was likely to be made for the prosecution of Lady Radcliffe for perjury—upon that I wrote letters to Mr. Kinder, Mr. East, and Mr. Guildford Onslow to protest against it—I was about to go out of town and I instructed Mr. Harding, the secretary, to attend the police-court, and if such an application should be made to remonstrate against it; and upon a second occasion I went personally in order to protest against it—the Magistrate would not hear me, saying that it was <hi rend="italic">sub judice</hi>, I could not speak—on the following day I sent to the daily papers this letter; it was inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>—in the letter I stigmatised the proceedings as a cruel persecution—in the daily papers of 2nd June I saw an account of the proceedings—in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> and other papers I was represented as appearing through Mr. Harding, and protesting against the proceedings—on the 7th June there was a report that a summons was to be granted—application had been dismissed, and I was represented as being amongst other gentle-men upon the bench—having taken those steps my attention was called shortly afterwards, on the 10th June, to this reply in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Register.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "The wretched clique of conspirators, as cracked-brained as they are malicious, the congenial friends and supporters of the thrice-perjured villian, Orton, have been doing their little worst still further to persecute one of the most amiable of gentlewomen, one who is a model of every Christian virtue as a wife and mother, but happily," &amp;c. "The Magistrate before whom they made their unseemly exhibition, with badly-suppressed indignation, scouted their application, and they withdrew," &amp;c, &amp;c.) I am a member of the Tichborne family there alluded to—upon that I wrote a letter to the editor and sent to him also a copy of the letter which had been inserted in the morning papers, and extracts from the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> showing him that I was amongst those who opposed the application—those letters and extracts were never inserted—on the 17th a paragraph appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Register.</hi> ("'Tell me what company you keep and I will tell you what you are is a saying as old as the hills, and Mr. Biddulph would do well to remember it. That gentleman writes complaining," &amp;c, &amp;c.) Finding my letters were not answered I communicated with my solicitor to take proceedings—during the proceedings I proposed that if the defendant would give up the writer of this libel I would discontinue the proceedings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Guildford Onslow was a member of the association, he had nothing to do with my committee, he ought to have been a member but I did not want him; we told him that he could not remain with the association—there is an association—there are several committees in Lon<lb></lb>don—Mr. East had been a member of our association—there is a central, Tichborne Relief Association, one that calls itself the Metropolitan Belief</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080043"></xptr>
               <p>Association, and there, are other committees—an hour and a quarter ago Mr. Onslow and Mr. East left my association; they had been members—Mr. Kimber had never been a member, he had been a follower of Dr. Kenealy and as such I could not admit him—I subscribed funds towards the defence of the claimant—Lady Radcliffe was called, I was not in the Court—I never told Tichborne anything about the insinuation against his cousin—I was not in Court and did not seek information on the subject—I do not call it a complete retractation of every suggestion against me which was made at the police-court by the defendant; I take it for what it is worth; kick a man and then apologise for it afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the police-court I heard the counsel say "If you choose to give up the writer we will be content;" they refused, and have persistently refused.</p>

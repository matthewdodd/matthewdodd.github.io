             sworn. On the 31st of July I met the prosecutor in Dyot-street, he said he had been robbed of his coat, hat, breeches, and handkerchief, at a lodging-house in the galleries. I enquired who had got them, they said Scotch Peggy; I met her in Dyot-street, after I took her in custody, I got the handkerchief from the servant, and the bundle from Mrs. Cotterell; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are all mine.</p>

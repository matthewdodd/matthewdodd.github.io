On the 26th of September the linen hung in my garden to bleach, in the evening it was taken off the lines, and put in a washing tub in the courtyard, at the top of the garden, Next morning it was taken - I found the prisoner, in custody with it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PORTER. I am a watchman at Holloway. I saw the prisoner Mason about half-past four o'clock in the morning, with a bag on his back; I asked him what the bag contained; he said he did not know. I found it was wet linen - He said a man gave it to him to carry, and was to meet him in a brick-field, and was to give him sixpence, and a good breakfast, for his trouble. As I was taking him to the watch-house he said he would tell me the truth, and where I could find the man; but if the man knew it he would kill him - He said that he sent him forward, and said he would go and get a bag of fowls, and another bag of linen. I took the constable to the brick-field, to see the man, and found a man looking to see if anybody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280053"></xptr>was coming-Beak was with him. The man saw us, and said, "D-n their eyes! here they come, run off my boy." They both ran into the fields-the man escaped. I took Break, and asked him where the other bag was, he said he did not know. I took him back to where they ran from, and found another bag of linen covered over with straw. I have never found the man.</p>

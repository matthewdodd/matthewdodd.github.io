On the 20th of December, I was informed by Michael Cogan of something, in consequence of which, I followed the prisoner out of the shop, and told her that she had got something that did not belong to her—she did not say any thing—I asked her to walk into the carpet-room, and there repeated the same words—she said she had got something, and gave to me, from under her cloak, a length of mousselin de laine, a length of silk, bombazine, and poplin—these are them—they have our private mark on them.</p>

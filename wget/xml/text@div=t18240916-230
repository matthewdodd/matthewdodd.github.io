            . I live at Elsham, in Kent, and am a farmer. My gelding was turned out into my field; I saw it on my farm on Monday, the 23d of August, about eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160084"></xptr>o'clock in the morning - next morning, about six my son gave me information, and I missed it. I came to town in search of it, and saw it that evening at the Ram inn Smithfield. The witness Hunter brought it to Hatton-garden; it is the horse I lost. I never saw the prisoner about my premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long had you had it - A. Five or six years. It was in care of the hostler at the Ram; he is not here. We took it to Hatton-garden - it is now in my possession, and is mine. I had not seen it after the afternoon of the 23d.</p>

            , a horse-slaughterer, whose premises are in Sharp's-alley - he lives in Coppice-row. On Tuesday morning, the 24th of August, about two o'clock I was in bed at my own house; the watchman called me up - I came down, and found the prisoner at the door, with a gelding, which was afterwards taken to Hatton-garden, and claimed by Green; I had never seen the prisoner before - he asked me to buy it; I asked what part he brought it from; he said out of Kent, from Tunbridge, and that he had another to bring. I asked his name; he said

            : I said I would not buy it at that time of the morning, but if he would take it away, and bring it at a seasonable hour, about nine o'clock, or so, I would buy it - he said he had no place to put it in, being a stranger in the neighbourhood; I said I would put it into my master's premises, and give it some hay - he delivered it to me; I put it into my master's stable. He took a bed at a lodging-house next door to me that night, and between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, as I was going to work, I saw him in the custody of Barnley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him taken into custody - A. I saw him in custody. He said nothing about the horse; it was removed to the Ram. I saw nothing more of it till between eleven and twelve o'clock that morning, when it was at Hatton-garden. I swear that is the same horse by the marks upon it; there was a small star on the forehead. I had noticed it in the morning - there was a mark on the side of it, also a saddle mark.</p>

On the morning of the 24th I saw the prisoner on the horse, on Saffron-hill; he asked me where Hunter of York-street, lived - I showed him the house, and heard the conversation between them about the horse - Hunter's account is correct.

            . I am constable of the Liberty of Saffron-hill. On Tuesday morning, the 24th of August, between four and five o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner next door to Hunter's. I neither threatened, nor made him any promise. I asked if the horse was his; he said it was not; I asked who it belonged to - he said to a man, but he did not know his name, nor where he lived - that he met with him on the Tunbridge-road, and he was bringing it to London, to sell it. I took him to White's place: Hunter gave me the horse at White's stables, in his presence, and Green saw it at Hatton-garden; it was then taken to the Ram inn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed by another man to sell it; the first time I saw the man was at the Bricklayers Arms, public-house; he had four horses. A coach passed, and two of them broke from the halter. He asked me to go with him, and I did - I left him at Hyde Park-corner, and on Monday morning I met him; he asked me to go with him to fetch a horse that was coming from Tunbridge - I did so, and met a man; he gave me a direction to sell the horse at Hunter's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Slough, in Buckinghamshire—I had a set of gig<lb></lb>harness safe on 6th of September last. On 8th Dec. I accompanied Turton, a policeman, to the prisoner's house—I heard him ask the prisoner to let him look at his harness—he took us into the back kitchen where it was—Turton said to me, "Is that your harness?"—I said, "Yes"—he then said to the prisoner, "Where did you get that harness?"—he said he picked it up in the road—I lost it from a stable at Slough—the door of the stable was not locked—the stable was in the yard of the Reindeer inn—I cannot say when it was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 93). In consequence of information I received, I got a search warrant, and accompanied the last witness to the prisoner's house—when I first saw him in the stable, I said to him, "I want to see the set of gig harness that you have for sale"—he says, "That is the only harness I have, that is old cart harness"—I said, "I have got a search warrant to search your house"—then he said, "I have got a set of gig harness in the kitchen"—I went to the back kitchen, and he showed it me—I said, "Is this the gig harness that you offered to Dobson for sale? how did you come by it?"—he said, "I found it in a bag in the Colebrook-road"—I produce the harness—the <hi rend="italic">twits</hi>, the ✗s through which the reins go, were taken out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw it plainly when you went in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was hanging behind the door—Dobson is a fishmonger—I met him one night, and, from information I received, I asked him if he had not been to buy some harness, and he said, yes, and he was glad he had not bought it—the prisoner sells china, and travels about in a hone and cart—I never knew anything against his character—he goes through Colebrook and Slough, and along that way—Colebrook is about four miles from Slough.</p>

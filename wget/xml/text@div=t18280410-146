I send bread to various parts of the town; the prisoner was to receive money for what he delivered - he was to account every evening for what bread he had left, and to give what money he had received; there was no book kept between us. Mr. Sugden, of Angel-court, was a customer, also Mr. Gunter, of Rahere-street, and Mr. De Morgan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. Eighteen months; our regular wages are 18s. a week, which I paid him, but if he delivered above nine hundred loaves I allowed him a half-penny a loaf for it, for a certain time; there was no agreement or memorandum to that effect - he has not sold eleven or twelve hundred loaves in a week, but he has sold above nine hundred in a week, which have been accounted for, and I paid him the halfpenny a loaf; I never entered into a bond with him - his uncle was answerable to me to the amount of 10l. - I have not made any application to his uncle; he has left the place where he did live - I have my day-book here, in which the accounts are made principally by myself; here is the account of what the prisoner delivered out to customers who had credit. I have not been paid 4s. 9d. which he received on the 24th of March.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he a private book of his own? A. I believe he kept a book - he had to account for a good deal of money; it is possible he might make a mistake, but I do not think it was any mistake of his; I will swear none of these sums are included in these accounts; here are some entries without the names of the parties, but here is the number of the house; I never receive any money without putting down the name or the number; he could not have placed the sum he received from one customer to another. I entered it every night in my day-book; there is nothing due to the prisoner. I believe there is a book which the prisoner left, but I have not brought it; I have not examined it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who drew up these bills? A. Some of them are my writing, and some are written by a young man who assists me.</p>

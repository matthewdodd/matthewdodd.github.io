I keep a private boarding-house in Fish-street Hill—on 9th January I was talking with two gentlemen in the first-floor sitting room—the door was partly open, and I saw some one steal cautiously by—I went into the kitchen on my toes, knowing that the servants were up stairs, and found the prisoner there—(the kitchen is on the same floor as the sitting-room)—the prisoner had two of my coats, which he was rolling up, and a shirt, which he had taken from a basket of clean linen, and was in the act of taking another—this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—I asked him what he was doing—he would not give me a straightforward answer, so I gave him in custody.</p>

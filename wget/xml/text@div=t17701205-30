            . Last Monday was a week, I was drinking with some friends at a house in <placeName id="t17701205-30-crimeloc128">Drury Lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Stewart. It was between nine and ten when I came into the house; I went to her room about ten; this was about twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Stewart. I was not very sober when I came to the house at first. I gave her a shilling; she picked my pocket of the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not give it her?</p>
               <p>Stewart. I am sure I did not give it her; I was not so drunk as that. I had wore the guinea in my pocket a month or six weeks; I could know it from a great many; she owned to the justice and the watchman, that she had taken it. There was a young man with a girl, in the other room, had lost 5 s. 3 d. he went to charge a watchman with her, and that was the way it came out.</p>
               <p>Constable. We were called to a man that was in this house. We were taken to the room where the prosecutor and the prisoner were in bed, he waked, and said let me see if I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050019"></xptr> robbed. He got out of bed, and felt for his breaches, and said, I have lost all my money. I asked him what he had lost; he said, a guinea and some silver. The watchman searched the prisoner, and found the money, laid in the indictment, upon her. She was very agreeable to be searched: she said, she did not know she had again in the world; she said, they went to bed in the dark, and she did not know what the prosecutor had given her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had robbed him of it?</p>
               <p>Constable. No. she did not.</p>

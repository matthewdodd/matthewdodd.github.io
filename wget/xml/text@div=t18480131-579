                  </hi>. I keep the Haberdashers' Arms beer-shop, Milton-street. On Saturday evening, 22nd Jan., about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoners were in my back room—I cannot say whether they came in in company, but they were both there drinking together—Holmes came to the bar, and gave me half-a-crown, to pay for two pots of beer—I gave it to my son James—I had not then any other half-crown—after that I went into the parlour to stir the fire—I saw Clark there—he paid me for two other pots of beer with another half-crown—I gave that to my son to look at—it was bad, and was returned to Clark—my son then looked at the half-crown I had received from Holmes—we found that was bad—I went to the parlour to look for Homes—he was going out to the water-closet—my son went for a constable—while he was gone Homes went away—the constable came, and took Clark—on the Monday morning Homes came again, and asked for my son, and was given into custody—the half-crown I received from Homes was given to the officer.</p>

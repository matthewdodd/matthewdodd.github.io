                  </hi>. I keep the Magpie public house in New-street, Bishopsgate. On Saturday, 3rd Feb., the prisoner came about 9 o'clock at night; he asked for half a quartern of gin, and a screw of tobacco—I served him—they came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a half crown on the counter—I examined it, and found it bad—I told him it was bad—he said he had taken it for wages, at Stratford—I sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—I gave the half crown to the constable—on the Monday, the prisoner was taken before the Lord Mayor; but that was the only case against him, and he was discharged—the name he gave was not King—I believe it was Adams.</p>

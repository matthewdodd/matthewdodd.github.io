                  </hi> I am in partnership with Charles Chilton, as button manufacturers, in Old-street. In Aug. last Lane was in our employ—my partner purchased some tools of him in that month, consisting of lathes and the tools now in question—we were to give him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I fetched them home my self next day from Lane's premises—Grover was there at the time—the hobs were packed up in a box in his presence, and afterwards brought to my premises—I paid the money—Lane came into our service after that, and Grover also, but he was under Lane, not actually in our service—I entrusted Lane with these eighteen hobs—they are worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are attached to lathes for cutting umbrella knobs and things of that kind—the prisoners worked on our premises for about ten weeks, and left on 30th Oct.—I paid Lane that Saturday night what was due to him—he had no authority from me to take away these hobs—they were using them at that time—the prisoners did not come to their business on Monday morning, in consequence of which I went with my partner, and Sergeant Brannan, to where they live—I searched for the tools—part of them were on the bench, apparently in use—Lane afterwards brought this little box out, and said, "Perhaps you will say these are your's"—I said, "Certainly they are"—I have no doubt they are the same—neither of them had permission to take them from our premises.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Tavernar—I purchased the tools—these hobs were included in the purchase, we could not finish our work without them—12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid for them; 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid first, and Mr. Taverner went for them—they were put into a small box and delivered by Grover—I saw them at our factory—Lane had the use of them—I would not have taken one prisoner without the other, they were both together, I con<lb></lb>sidered them partners—they were eight or nine weeks on the premises after the purchase—they were not discharged, they left of their own accord—we then searched for the tools and missed them—I went with Brannan to the prisoner's premises, and eighteen of the things were given up—we could not find the others out—these produced are part of the hobs, and this is the box they were put into to come to our place—I found them in a room where the prisoners were at work, on Saturday night as we lost them on the Monday—the prisoners were both there, they had no authority from me or my partner to remove the tools—we could not finish the articles we had, without them—I have been thirty-five years in the trade, and would not have purchased one without the other.</p>

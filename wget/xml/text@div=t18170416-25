On the 3d of March, about four o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed and got up. As I was going down stairs, I heard some person walking on the ground-floor - I looked out of window, and saw some person get over the garden wall, and heard another person run out of the house, and at the same time a glass breaking. I found both my doors open, a piece of glass broken in the back door, and a hole cut in the shutter. I found my glass case laying in the garden, and all the trinkets scattered about-it was in the shop the night before. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The shop door had also been forced by cutting a hole in it; the kitchen poker lay just by-the door was black, as if it had been struck with the poker. I only missed the case of trinkets out of the shop-part of a leg of mutton had been eaten, and a bottle of wine gone. There was a chissel, a gimlet, and a screwdriver by the shop-door. In about ten minutes, the watchman brought the prisoner, Norton, and a man named Evans to me. The next morning Witchen brought part of the property-the trinkets were worth 150l.</p>

I went with some other watchmen into Holland-street, and saw two persons coming towards Mr. Wild's house. I asked them where they were going-one of them said, "what is that to you!" I told them that a house had been broken open, and I must know where they came from. One of them said, he came from Hyde-park-corner - He was going to Hammersmith (they were Norton and Evans) - I secured them.

            . I had known the two prisoners about ten days before the robbery; we met together-Norton said that he had dreamed of a house at Kensington, which he had been looking at about two years ago, and said it was good now. We all three agreed to go down and look at it - We set off about ten o'clock, and Norton pointed out Mr. Wild's house to us. Dugan said he would count how many doors it was from the corner. He said it was No. 8, but only seven doors from the corner. Norton went round to see if the walls were low enough to get over; we then returned to town-this was about twelve o'clock in the morning. Norton asked me for money, and went into the shop to buy something, to see if it was the right house, or not. I saw him come out, and put something in a piece of paper into his pocket. We all three agreed to meet at the top of Oxford-road in the evening, at six o'clock; I stopped there till eight or nine o'clock, and then went to Dugan's house in George-street, waited there sometime, and then went into a coffee-shop. At eleven o'clock we set off. Norton took a screw-driver, a chissel, and a knife. We got to Kensington about one o'clock. Dugan and Norton said I had better get over the wall, as I was stronger. Dugan lent me his handkerchief, as it would not shew so much as mine, being darker. Norton got over after me, and Dugan kept watch outside. We cut the back door open with the chisel and knife, and went into the kitchen; we took four aprons, a pair of boots, two shawls, and some table-cloths; we tied them up and gave them over to Dugan. We then cut a hole in the shop-door, and got the poker to wrench it open. I thought I heard some person up stairs - I took the glass-case and ran out - We threw it down in the garden, broke a pane of glass in it, and scrambled as much out as we could hold in our hands, and ran away. I let them fall in getting over the wall. I had the spoons in my pocket; we ran different ways, and I hid them in the church-yard. I met Norton, and while we were looking for Dugan, the watchmen took us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never committed a robbery before; I gave information about a week after we were apprehended.</p>

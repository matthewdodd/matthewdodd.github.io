                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Wood's-buildings, Whitechapel-road—I know the prisoners. On the 5th of Feb. I was in company with them—the two who have given the names of Jones and Smith are brothers, by what I have heard of them—I have known them to go by the name of Higgins—the real name of the prisoner who has given the name of Williams, is Thomas Bird—on the occasion in question, Williams gave me some money, and sent me into the prosecutor's shop for some tobacco—while I was in the shop, Mr. Carpenter missed the bees' wax—on my way home I met Williams—he said, "Where have you been?"—I said, "I came out of the shop, and have been making my way home"—he said, "You may go where you like now"—I thought it my best way to watch these parties, and I went opposite to where they live—Mr. Higgins, the prisoner's mother, lives in Whitechapel—I saw the prisoners go in there with a bag on their shoulders with something in it—they came out in about a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner Jones said, "We have go the bees' wax."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you know about bees' wax? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I met Bird he said they had got a great piece of bees' wax from the door—that was how I heard of it—I was not aware of it when I was in the shop—when Williams gave me the money to buy the tobacco Smith was with him—they were very nearly opposite the shop—I did not see Jones at the time—I got the tobacco to smoke—Williams said, "Go, get me a quarter of an ounce of tobacco"—I did not give him any of it—I kept it, and smoked it—Williams and Smith proposed I should be sent in for the tobacco—they did not say anything as to the object they had in sending me in—Smith told me to go in, and I went in—he did not say why or for what object—this my signature (<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—it was read over to me before I signed it—I was sworn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was said to you before you went in to get the tobacco, were you not willingly an accomplice to take the man off his guard while they stole it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was not aware of it when I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say Smith said, "Let us send him in for some tobacco, and while he is in we can take it?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they were the words, sir.</p>

I said, 'No;' he said, 'Well, I have not seen any of them since I gave them the bees' wax;' Bird said, 'You can go where you like;' I watched Bird to Mr. Higgins's, the mother of the other prisoner; in about a quarter of an hour afterwards they came home with something in a bag, which I believe to be the bees' wax; they all three came out in about twenty minutes, and Smith said it was very heavy; I went with them down to Whitechapel Church, where they asked a man if he knew where they could sell it; I do not know where they sold it; I was not with them; I never saw the bees' wax after it was taken; they spoke of the bees' wax before I went into the shop; Smith said, 'Let us send him in for some</p>

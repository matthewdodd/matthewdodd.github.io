            . I am Niece to Mr Sadler , and live with him. - When the House was broke open, I lost a Cambrick Apron, and a Cambrick Cap; the Cap was left in a Pan upon the Dresser the Night before, and the next Morning, when I came down, was missing: I never had either the Apron or the Cap again. About six o'Clock in the Morning the Maid came up to me, and desired I would come down, for the House had been broke open. When I came down, I found the Staple of the Window forced out, the Casement was taken off, and put on the outside of the Window, the inside Shutters were open, and the Dresser-Drawers were open. - There were more Things lost than are laid in the Indictment.</p>

             . I live in the Square, just by Mr Sadler's, and had lain in the House about a Fortnight, because Mr Sadler had been sick, and if he had died, he had given me some Charge concerning it. On the 30th of September, or the 1st of October, when I came down in the Morning, I met this young Woman, Mrs Burton, and she said, We are robb'd! Said I, How so? She said, Go into the Kitchen, and you will see - I usually<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080030"></xptr> took Care of the Fastenings my self, but I am not certain I did that Night: They had forced out a large Staple, and they had opened a flap Shutter, where there was a strong Chain; when they came down the Flap, they came to a Glass Window, and there were two Panes of Glass taken out, by which they might open the Window; the Case ment was taken off the Hooks, and sat down by the Side of the Window. - I my self have gone in there, as any Man almost may. These Gentlemen, who are the King's Officers, saw the Prisoner with some of the Goods upon his Shoulder. Cordosa and Robinson were taken up about a Month afterwards by one Unwin ; it was on a Lord's Day, between Eleven and Twelve, that I was charged with both of them by this Unwin the Thief-taker. I went to Justice Ricards , but he was not at Home then; at six at Night I carried them before him. - The Thief-taker took this out of Cordosa's Pocket before my Face. [It was an Instrument crooked at the End like a Pick-Lock.]</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Unwin?</p>
               <p>Jell. He is ill of the Gout, and almost killed by some Rogues who beat him the other Day. Cordosa, on my first asking him, denied having any Knowledge of the Fact, but at last confessed ingenuously that he was guilty of stealing the Things out of this House: He produced none of them; nor would he own how he took them. - He did not confess the breaking open the House.</p>

             . I was going through Well-Close-Square the 1st of October, about three o'Clock in the Morning: I saw a Man with a Bag upon his Shoulder, and he, I suppose, imagining we were pursuing him, dropped the Bag off his Shoulder, and made off: I took the Bag up; there was in the Bag two Dozen of Pewter Plates, and some Linnen. - I do not know that ever I saw the Prisoner before.</p>

             . I only saw his Back; I cannot say the Prisoner is the Man that dropped the Bag. On the 1st of October, at very near three in the Morning, I saw a Man walking down Well-Close-Square, with a Bag upon his Shoulder; the Man seeing us, run away, and I run after him, and he dropped the Bag; my Partner took hold of it, said he, we have got a Prize; I believe it is a Bag of Tea.</p>

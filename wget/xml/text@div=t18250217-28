They were decent people, and always appeared to live in harmony. They lived in Lascelles-court, and appeared rather above the class of persons living there.</p>

There were two quartern loaves, two pots of beer, and some fried steaks on the table; one pot was full of beer: she asked me to drink, which I did. I was then going out, but the deceased called me, and said I should drink with him before I went - it was all in good humour; I drank with him, wished him good night, and went up to my own room; they were not quite sober. I afterwards heard a loud talking, as if a man and woman were at words - I afterwards heard a voice calling out, "Mary, the man is bleeding." (Mary Moore lives opposite.) I had a young child to attend to, and did not go down. I heard people coming into the house: I went down in a quarter of an hour, to the door of the prisoner's room, and found several watchmen and neighbours there. The prisoner was on her knees, clasping her hands together, and calling out that she had murdered her husband - she was kneeling on his body, and kissing him; he laid on the flat of his back. I saw blood on his face and head - she appeared much distressed at what had happened. She was a sober, hard working woman - they appeared a very happy couple.</p>

            . I am the last witness's husband. I was at work in my room, and heard the voices of a man and woman talking loud, in the prisoner's room; it was only a few words, and then all was quiet. I then heard a noise as if something was broken, and thought something had fallen off the mantle-piece. I afterwards found a square of glass was broken - the window is near the fireplace. I heard no alarm of murder, and did not go down till the prisoner was in custody. I never knew them quarrel before.</p>

            . I live in Lascelles-court, opposite to the prisoner. About twelve o'clock on this night, the prisoner came into my room, fell on her knees, and said, " For God's sake, go over and pacify between me and my husband!" She said words had happened between them. I went over, leaving her in the room; on tapping at their room door, no answer was given: I opened it slowly, put my head in, and saw nobody there; a candle and two pots of beer stood on the table. I returned to my room, and told the prisoner I could see no one in her room. She said "He must he looking for me!" and said to my wife "For God's sake, go over, and see if my husband is there." My wife went, returned immediately, and told her the man was there stretched on his hands and knees by the fire, bleeding. I ran over and picked him up - he laid with his head towards the cupboard, but I cannot say whether it was on the ground, he was between a chair and the jam of the fire-place - there were some coals near him - I think the chair supported the body a little from falling - he drew his breath when I lifted him up, and blood came from the back part of his head. I called across to my wife "Mary, the man is murdered!" The prisoner and my wife came over. The prisoner took the deceased out of my hands, and told me for God's sake to fetch a doctor. I went to two, but could not get them. I returned and got the watchmen, who came - I believe the man was then dead: the prisoner was hanging over his body, crying and kissing him, and saying</p>
               <p>"Joseph! Joseph! my dear I have killed you!" I waited till the doctor came, and saw him pick up a large handled hair broom, three feet long - the handle was broken in two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man's head was towards the cupboard, between the chimney jam and chair? A. Yes, it was very close to the fender - when I first went over I could not see that part of the room, as the table was between me and the body - I found him on his face.</p>

            . I am conductor of the patrol. I heard a rattle spring, and went to No. 5, Lascelles-court with Harrington - several people were round the door, and the room was crowded. The prisoner was leaning on the deceased, crying out "I have killed my husband!" he laid on his back, with his clothes on, and his face all over blood - he appeared to be dead. I saw two wounds, there was a deal of blood on the left of his head, near the coal place. There was a wound at the back, and one on the side of his head - they were some distance apart. I asked the prisoner what she had killed her husband with? she said with a brush. I saw this long-handled broom laying on his right hand, (producing it,) it was broken as it is now, and the brush part of it loose - I did not examine it to see if there was any mark on it - the shovel and poker laid by the broom. I believe there was a little hair on the point of the poker, and on the corner of the shovel, but no blood, except on the handles of them. I sent for a medical man, and took her to the round-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Many persons had been in the house before you arrived? A. Yes; I could scarcely get through the crowd; his face was smeared with blood, and about a yard from his face, near the coals, there was a great deal of blood - the broom was about a yard and a half from the fire-place - the poker and shovel might have been knocked down by the people.</p>

            . I am keeper of the round-house. The prisoner was brought in about twenty minutes before one o'clock. Before I said any thing to her, I went to the house, and found the man dead. I returned - she was then crying bitterly, and said "Mr. Furzman, how is he?" bursting into a flood of tears, (I knew them both before, they were decent people.) I said he was a little better; not liking to tell her he was dead. I then asked her how they came to quarrel? she said, "Oh, good God! Mr. Furzman, you know us well, and I will tell you:" she said they went down Drury-lane to buy some meat for supper; and I think she said she paid 1 s. 6 d. or 1 s. 9 d. for it; and, on the way home, he requested to have a pot of porter. She said, "We have one pot at home, which is quite sufficient:" but he insisted on having another - they had one - they went home, she cooked the supper, and as they sat at table, he began to be playful, which she did not like - and he said "D - n your eyes! you have got three halfpence of mine! give them to me." Words occurred, and he struck her a blow across the nose with his hand or fist, and made it bleed - that she instantly jumped up, and laid hold of the first thing she could, which was the hair broom, and struck him a violent blow, as he sat on the chair - he fell off the chair, and she instantly ran to her opposite neighbour, and begged Moore to go in, for she was sure she had done something wrong. He went over, returned and said he could not see him; and she said "For God's sake, run for the doctor!" - that is all she said. She appeared very sorry for what she had done, and told me every thing without hesitation. She appeared to have been in liquor, but knew what she was about. On Monday morning she begged me to tell her how he was.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170023"></xptr>I said he was no more.

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Great Russell-street. On Tuesday the 8th February I was called in to view the deceased's body. I found two large wounds on the head; one of which communicated with an extensive fracture of the skull near the top of the head; the other was merely a wound of the scalp. I should think the wound on the top of the head was done by some obtuse instrument powerfully struck on the head. The broom head I think would have done it, it being angular as well as obtuse. There was a large portion of bone broken off and pressed on the brain. I have no doubt of his death happening from the bleeding, caused by that wound. The second wound had fractured the inner table of the skull. His skull-bone was exceedingly thin, and scarcely to be called a sound bone. The same blow on an ordinary skull would not produce such consequences. Some part of his skull was not much thicker than an egg shell.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating the particulars the case, in precisely the same manner as her account given to the witness Furzeman.</p>

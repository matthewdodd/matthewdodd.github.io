                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Kingsland-green. I know the prisoner by sight—on the 18th of Nov., about eleven o'clock, I went into the Nag's Head, Tot hill-street—the prisoner was there—I staid there about an hour—when I came out, he followed me—he came behind me, and snatched my shawl off—I can swear it was him—there was no one else near me, and I saw him with my shawl about half a minute after—he ran away with it, and was out of sight before I could get a policeman—I saw him again at the same house—I said he was the man I wanted to see—he said what did I want him for—I said, "Will you give me the ticket of my shawl, and I will get it out myself, if not I will go against you?"—he said he did not know me, and then he said, "If you don't transport me I will go and get you your shawl"—he attempted to run away again—at the station he said lie would give me a sovereign if I would not go against him—I have not found my shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. On Thursday I was drinking with the prosecutor from four o'clock in the morning—I had her shawl, and delivered it to her that night—she was very tipsy—I wanted her to leave her shawl—she would not—the next day she sent for the shawl that she had left at Mr. Priest's, bat she had not left one—she said I had got the shawl, because I had had it in the afternoon.</p>

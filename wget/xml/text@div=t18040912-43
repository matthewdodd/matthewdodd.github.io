Yes; I bought them of one Mr. White, and put them at my door for sale in that basket, on the 1st of August; I was at work backwards, and was called by my youngest daughter; she told me a man had robbed her mother of some fowls; I then run after him towards Bow, I was informed he was taken in Stepney fields; he was taken to our house; the man who took him is here with the fowls and basket; when I got home, they had let him go; I desired him to be fetched back again, and he was brought back again directly; I have lost a great many things from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same man that was brought back first, and the man who had the fowls? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was your daughter that told you of the transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you know nothing at all about it yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- HOLDER sworn. - I am a labouring man: I was going down Mile-end-road to dinner, and saw the prisoner at the bar take the fowls from the door; I told the prosecutor's wife of it; I ran after him, and overtook him, and brought him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120051"></xptr>and the fowls back to the door; the man that lived over the way ordered me to let him go about his business; I am sure that is the man I saw take the fowls.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure they are my fowls, I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You have a great many fowls for sale? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great many fowls that you keep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought back, did you not give them a little airing with the other fowls in your yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you swear to them? - A. This is the basket, and these are the fowls that were lost from my house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

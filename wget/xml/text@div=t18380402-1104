                  </hi>. I keep a corn shop at Walthamstow. I have one partner—in consequence of something that was told me by a boy named Roberts, I went with a policeman after the prisoner, and found him down the street—I said, "You little rascal, you have been stealing peas out of my shop"—he said, "I have not, Roberts gave them to me"—he had his pockets full—he began to take them out, and throw them about the street—they are as much like my peas that are in the bin as possible—I get them from a farmer—there are plenty of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I work with Mr. Turner. On Wednesday, the 15th of March, I saw the prisoner, about eight o'clock in the evening, come into my master's corn-shop, take the peas, and put them into his pocket—I was coming through the shop, and he held me with one hand by the collar—I told him I would tell my master—he said, "If you do, I will <hi rend="italic">smash you"</hi>—he then put the peas into his pocket—I think he took about a pint—he took a good many handsful.</p>

Mr. Turner and I were toge<lb></lb>ther when we stopped the prisoner—he said at first that he had not got any peas—he put his hand into his pocket, and was throwing some down—I said, "You are throwing them down," and then he said that the boy Roberts had given them to him—he had a knife in his hand, which I have here—I took it from him—he laid down on the ground, and called "Murder," and every thing that was bad—he threw some peas at the windows as he went along, and some he threw down.</p>

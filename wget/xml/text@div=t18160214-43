I desired my young man to follow her and being her to the private door, and I went round to the private door and let him and her in. She made considerable efforts to get her hand into her pocket; but we prevented her. We sent for an officer who searched her in a private room. She said if we were men we would turn our heads aside; the officer then informed me he could find nothing on her; I wished him to take her to the Compter as a suspicious character, feeling convinced that she was a suspicious character; in about half an hour after she was gone we found a leather pocket with the piece of ribbon in it in a snuff-box, in the room where she was searched; the snuff-box was mine.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Messrs. Ellis and Browne; I saw the prisoner between three and four o'block on Monday afternoon; she being a woman that we had long suspected, we were more particular in watching her motions. She was purchasing a piece of black ribbon. I went from behind the counter, into the middle of the shop, and plainly perceived her hand go directly from the ribbon drawer into her pocket. From her motions I concluded that she had put a piece into her pocket; but that was merely suspicion at that time. When she went out, I followed her by my master's desire, and brought her back before she had got twenty yards, After she was searched Mr. Ellis missed a piece of ribbon.</p>

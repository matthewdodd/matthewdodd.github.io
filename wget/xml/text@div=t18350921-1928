                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. James Corss, a tailor and draper, who lives at No. 49, High-street, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On the 9th of September, in the evening, I was in the shop, and discovered, about nine o'clock, that something had been done to the win<lb></lb>dow—I found it had been broken, and a piece of silk gone, and a piece of kerseymere, about four inches, out of a hole in the window; it was removed from the place where it had been in the window; but was only partly through the hole—I had seen the window at six o'clock—It was then whole, and the silk and kerseymere were in the window—It was a yard and one-eighth of silk, worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the kerseymere measured two yards and a quarter, and was worth 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>of September I was in shoreditch, on the opposite side of the way to Mr. Corss, and saw the prisoner Ward, with his left hand, deliberately working at the bottom of the window, at the third pane glass—the other prisoner was standing on his left, close to him—I then saw them go away—they came again; and the third time they came, I saw the prisoner Ward's hand the same way as before, working away with his left hand, and all in the moment I saw them both run away together across the road—I and my brother-officer crossed the road to the shop, and found a piece had been taken out of the window—I went in pursuit of the prisoners, but saw nothing of them that evening—I saw about four inches of a piece of cloth of this description sticking out of the hole of the window—I was observing them from about half-past seven o'clock until a quarter or half-past eight o'clock—next evening I was on duty again in Shoreditch, and about a quarter to seven o'clock I met them coming towards the shop together, and with the assistance of my brother-officer I took them into custody—I knew Ward before—I have a small recollection of him. but I cannot say I recollect the other before—I saw both of them so as to be quite certain of them—there are gas-lights there—I took the prisoners into Corss's shop.</p>

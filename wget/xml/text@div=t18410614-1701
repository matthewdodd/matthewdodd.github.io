                  </hi>. I am steward of the ship <hi rend="italic">Norval</hi>, which was in St. Katherine's Dock. On the 8th of June I went into the Dundee Arms public-house, in High-street, Wapping, about eleven o'clock at night—I was very sleepy, as I had been up four or five nights—I fell asleep, and awoke about half-past four—when I went in I had two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and some silver, and my watch, seal, and key—when I awoke I saw the prisoner close alongside of me—that was the first time I bad teen her—I missed my watch, and I accused her of it—I said, "Where is my watch?"—she said, "What watch? I know nothing about it"—I said, "You deliver it up to me"—she said, "I have got a comfortable room, come home with me, and I will find your watch"—she went out, I fol<lb></lb>lowed her, and said, "You had better give it up, or I will give you in charge"—she said once or twice that she had not got it, and then she again said, if I would go home she would give it me—I missed a sove-reign, but that I might have lost, I cannot say—this is my watch.</p>

I took the prisoner—I said to her, "Where is the watch?"—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "I will have none of your nonsense, give it up to me," and she pulled it out of her bosom, and gave it up to me—I said, "Now I want the sovereign"—she said, "I have got no sovereign, and know nothing about it"—I took her to the station, but nothing was found on her.</p>

On Friday, the 27th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at our house - she came and asked for 1d. worth of gin: she gave me a shilling - I gave her a sixpence, 5d., and the gin; I put the shilling into my pocket, where I had two good shillings, and five sixpences, but no other change - a very short time after on that evening, she came in again, and asked for a 1d. worth of gin, and paid me another shilling; I served her, and gave her change - she took the gin and went out; I put the shilling into the same pocket - I saw her at the house again in a very little time, on the same evening; she had another 1d. worth of gin, and gave me a shilling - I gave her change, and put the shilling into my pocket; she came again the same night, a very little time after, and asked for 2d. worth of gin, and gave me another shilling - I gave her change, and put the shilling into the same pocket; I saw her again the same evening - she came and had another 1d. worth of gin, and gave me another shilling; I gave her change, and put the shilling into my pocket - she came again the same evening, almost tipsy, and asked for 2d. worth of gin, which I gave her; she offered me a shilling - I did not give her the change, but rang the bell for Blackburn, my servant, who came and said it was a bad shilling; I sent her over the way to get change for it, as I differed from her - she returned, an officer came in after her, and took the prisoner into custody; I took the five shillings out of my pocket, with two good ones, which I had before, and gave them to my servant, because my husband should not know it; I took all the shillings out of my pocket - I had five bad, and two good ones; I gave the five bad ones to Blackburn - I had received no other shilling between the time the prisoner first came, and my giving them to Blackburn, except what I received from the prisoner; the officer had taken her away when I gave them to Blackburn - I did not put the last shilling into my pocket, but gave it to Blackburn, and have not had it since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner.

She paid me five, and was stopped with the sixth; she drank the gin in the house each time - it was last Friday week.</p>
               <p>MARY BLACKBURN. I am Mrs. Brand's servant. I received a shilling from her last Friday week, about six o'clock in the evening; she told me to go and get change for it - I looked at it, and said it was bad; I shewed it to a young man named John Blackburn, who was in the taproom - he gave me back the same shilling, and I went over to the butcher's shop with it; the butcher took it in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030008"></xptr>hand, looked at it, and said it was bad - he returned it to me; I kept it in my hand - it was not out of my sight, and is the same as I gave the butcher; as I returned home, I met the Police-man, Walters - I kept the shilling in my hand till I came to mistress' house, and then gave it to the Police-man; I received five more shillings from Mrs. Davis, a quarter of an hour after - she told me to put them into my pocket, that her husband should not see them; I put them into my pocket, and Walters came again - I took them out, marked them, and gave them to him; I had nothing else in my pocket, but a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALTERS. I am a Police-constable. On the 27th of November, I met Blackburn, about six o'clock in the evening - she said something; I followed her into the Three Compasses - she gave me a shilling, and said the prisoner, who stood there, had endeavoured to pass it; I produce the shilling - I examined it, and searched the prisoner - she was very willing to be searched; I found nothing of any consequence on her - I took the prisoner home, and searched her at home; I left her in the next room to the one she said she occupied, as she was so intoxicated - I went back to Davis, and Blackburn gave me five more shillings, which I have kept ever since, and produce; I then went back to the prisoner's room, and found her in bed in her own room - she was much more sober then; I searched the room, but found nothing - I made her dress herself, took her to the watch-house, and on the way there, I told her it would be better for her to confess; when I took her to her room she was very much intoxicated - that was about six o'clock - she got sober about ten, when I took her again; I was detained some time at Davis', and was looking for another party.</p>

I certainly went into the shop, and had a glass of gin; the lady gave me a sixpence and 5d. -I went in about an hour afterwards, and the servant objected to the shilling, and went over to the butcher's to ask if it was good - she was gone twenty minutes or half an hour, came back, and said, "Ma'am, I don't like it;" she took it into the tap-room, and shewed it to a young man, who said he did not like it - she went out, and brought the Police-man; he asked where I lived - I told him; he took me home, and I remained there till half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o'clock, when he came, and took me - had I been an old offender, I should not have stopped in my own room from six to a quarter to twelve o'clock; the servant said I came in in different clothing, and then she contradicted that.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner on the side next the foot-path, or the other side? - He was on the foot-path; I suppose the child was thirteen or fourteen months old.</p>
               <p>How near was the fore horse of the cart to the child when you first saw the child? - The fore horse was beyond the child's head before I saw it; he was driving very gently.</p>

I jumped down, and took hold of the middle horse; he cried wo! wo! but before I could stop the middle horse, the near wheel went over the childs head, and crushed its brains out; it died instantly; it never moved; the prisoner was walking on the foot-path; the cart way is narrow; there is bare room for the carriage to pass.</p>
               <p>Was not the parent, nor nurse, nor no one near this child? - I did not see any one; it is a narrow place; there is not room for two carriages to pass one another.</p>

               <p>I am a coach wheelwright; this coal-yard runs parellel with Holborn, and comes into Drury-lane. I saw this child crawling in the foot-path; its head was off the kirb stone; I followed the cart all the way from Short's Gardens; the prisoner was coming along the foot-path, on the same side where the child was lying.</p>
               <p>Do you think he saw the child? - He must see the child, when he was going past it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he step over the child? - No; he walked by.</p>
               <p>How do you know he saw it? - He went by the child; I screamed out before the wheel touched the child; I saw the child for the space of half a minute before the wheel went over it; I screamed out just as the wheel was going over the child, and then it was not in the prisoner's power to stop it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner cry out wo? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any body by to take care of the child? - No.</p>
               <p>Was that part of the street narrow where the cart went? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the father of the deceased?</p>
               <p>The Father. I am a bed joiner; I have five children; my wife was washing.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from where the child lay? - A yard and half.</p>

               <p>How do you know that this was the child that was killed afterwards? - I saw it after it was killed.</p>

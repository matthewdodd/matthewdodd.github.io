                  </hi>. I live in Herefordshire. On the 17th of October I was returning home, and called at the Duke of York public-house, at Han<lb></lb>well, to get refreshment—I cannot say how long I remained there—I was waiting for a conveyance to take me further down the country—I inquired for a bed, but the landlord could not accommodate me, and I left about nine o'clock—a man in a flannel jacket followed me out, and said "Old man, I can furnish you with a bed if you will go with me"—that was William Spinks, who has been tried for this—I went with him about twenty or thirty yards, and two men joined us, who said they were going the same road—they appeared to be in dark clothes—they walked a dis<lb></lb>tance behind, and I did not notice them much—I was taken across some fields till we came to a hay stack, when the prisoner seized me by the throat, and I was thrown down—I begged them not to injure me—the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183611280108"></xptr>
               <p>said "If you don't lay still, you old b----, I will kill you"—they felt all over my body, and took every thing away I had about me—I had four handkerchiefs and a collar in a bundle, and a shirt and cotton waistcoat was wrapped in another parcel—I cannot say which of them rifled my pockets—they kept me down—I saw the prisoner at the time I was pushed down, he was upon me by the hay-stock, holding me down—the left hand cuff of my great-coat was torn—they were pulling my boots off—I begged them not to take them—they then left me with a threat, that if I moved from there before morning they would come back, and kill me—I believe it was the prisoner who said that—it was the same voice—I had seen the prisoner at the public-house in the course of the evening—I have no the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time in the morning was it that you went to the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say positively, it might be from ten to eleven o'clock—I waited there, I believe, till after nine at night for a conveyance—I do not recollect refusing to go—the landlord pointed out a coach, and I went to the door, but was too late for it—I did not drink much there—I consider I spent about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not recollect going to sleep there—I do not consider I was tipsy—I did go to sleep—I felt somebody with their hand on my face, but cannot say whether it was blacked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you went out of the house did you tell the landlord you had lost your money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I got change for half a sovereign there, and I had lost money while I was in the house—I told him so—I had three half-crowns, and paid him for what I had—that was taken out of my pocket be<lb></lb>fore I left the house—I had four half-crowns besides, and three shillings, and three sixpences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you then to change the half-sovereign? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had paid a half-sovereign for a sixpence once by mistake, and I changed it that I should not do the same again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said to-day that Spinks was the man who followed you out, and said he could find you a bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he was the man—I do not recollect saying that Spinks was not the man, but that it was one who had not yet been apprehended—I do not recollect saying so before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not swear on the last trial that the person who followed you out was a man in a flannel jacket, and you could speak to nobody else who was in the public-house—you now say the prisoner was in the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was—I left the two men who joined us in the public-house when I went out—this man took my money from my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now the prisoner was the person who seized you by the throat, and threw you down, and was on you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am confident the prisoner was upon me—I always said so, far as I can recollect—I think I told the Magistrate it was the prisoner, as far as I can all that took place—it was a dark foggy night—I do not recollect having seen the prisoner since, except before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. You said before the Magistrate that the prisoner was at the Duke of York at the time you left it, and he was then differently dressed, and before on the trial you could not describe the dress at all, except the dark clothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had a kind of fustian jacket then, I believe—he had a darker dress on before the Magistrate, something of a darkish green.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183611280109"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You swore a few days ago that the man in a flannel jacket had not been apprehended—why you had him apprehended, and have convicted him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner at the bar had not a flannel jacket—I believe two of the men had flannel jackets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the former trial you swore the prisoner then on trial was the man in the flannel jacket, and you swore to his voice; the policeman took him up from your description, and he was convicted, but you now say the man in the flannel jacket was not apprehended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were two in flannel jackets when I left the Duke of York.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of York, at Hanwell. On the night of the 17th of October, I saw the prosecutor at my house, he had been waiting there all day—I told him he could not sleep there, and he went on the road for the purpose of getting a lodging—he left about nine o'clock—there were several persons in the tap-room—Spinks was in the tap-room—he had a flannel jacket on, to the best of my recollection—I cannot speak to any body in particular who was with him—the prisoner was in the tap-room in the course of the evening,—he was in the habit of frequenting the house—he and Spinks were acquainted—the pri<lb></lb>soner is a native of the place, and Spinks had lived there six or seven years—he was working on the rail-road, but the prisoner was not—there were several others with the prisoner, who are in the habit of using the house—the prisoner was there about two hours—I did not see him leave—I saw him there perhaps from six to nine o'clock—I am sure I saw him there as late as eight o'clock—he lives just by my house—I cannot say how he was dressed, whether he had a fustian coat on, or the brown coat he has now—it was a dark coat—I saw the prosecutor go out—I had taken great pains to get him out two or three times—he said he had lost the silver out of his waistcoat-pocket before he left house—there might be between twenty and thirty people in the house—the prisoner did not come in or go out with Spinks—I did not see him at all with him—I did not attend to that room much—the prosecutor came back to my house next morning, and said he thought he should know the one in the flannel jacket again—he said nothing more to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

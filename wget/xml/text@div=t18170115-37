               <p>ROBERT CLARKE. I am a constable. On Saturday, the 7th of December, I and Smith, were coming down George-street, St. Giles's, which is a quarter of a mile from Juggins's, I saw the prisoner and another man going up the street, the other man was first. I set off after the other man, I could not overtake him. I stopped the prisoner, he had something under his coat, I asked him what it was, and took it from him. He said his mother had bought it. He afterwards said, that he found it in Short's-gardens.</p>

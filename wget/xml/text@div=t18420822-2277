                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman. On Sunday, the 3rd of July, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I went into St. James's-park, and saw the Royal carriages and the Queen and Prince Albert coming from Buckingham Palace to go to the Chapel Royal, St. James's—I was standing about half way down the Mall, near the watering-place, which is a kind of pump—I did not distinctly see the Queen—She was in the last car<lb></lb>riage—there were three carriages, and she was in the last—I did not distinctly see her, but I have heard she was in the last—I have seen her a great number of times—She was always in the last carriage—when the last carriage was passing I observed just before it passed the prisoner come in front' of the crowd, and present a pistol at the last carriage of the three—he seemed to come from the back of the crowd—he elbowed his way to the front—I saw him present a pistol at the last carriage—I heard the click of the hammer striking against the pan, but there was no explosion—I heard that as the last carriage was passing—the pistol was full cocked when he presented it, and he was holding it out at arm's length towards the carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it while the pistol was elevated towards the carriage that you heard that click? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I immediately seized him by the right arm, which had the pistol in it—I forget my exact words, but I said, How dare he shoot at the Queen? or something of that sort—I took the pistol from him—but before that I turned round to my brother, who stood on the right-hand side (the prisoner was on my left,) and mentioned to my bro<lb></lb>ther what had happened—I held the prisoner by the arm at the time, and after I had told my brother, I took the pistol from him—he made very little resistance—he did not say anything that I remember—He took the pistol from under his coat—I saw him draw it out—I cannot say whether it was in a pocket, or what.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220073"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How high towards the carriage was the pistol directed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The action was so quick I hardly noticed it—he held it at arm's length, and immediately drew his arm back when he found it missed fire—the carriage was passing at the time—I was about two and a half or from that to three yards from the carriage, standing on the edge of the footpath—there was an immense number of persons there—it was on the right-hand side, as the carriages were going down towards the gardens of St. James's-park—my face was towards St. James's Palace—after taking the pistol from him, I and my brother took him across the Mall, and offered him to the policeman A 56, who was standing across the Mall—a great number of persons followed us, and asked me to give the boy back his pistol, saying they believed it was a hoax, they did not believe it was loaded—the policeman refused to take him into custody—I offered him the pistol—he returned it to me, and said he thought it did not amount to a charge—I had hold of the prisoner all the time—I offered him to Claxton, A 134, who likewise refused to take the charge—the pressure of the crowd became so great, and most of them sided with the prisoner—he was forced from me, and escaped—I still had the pistol, and went down the Mall with it in my hand—I myself was soon after taken into custody by policeman A 136, who stood lower down the Mall—I had the pistol at that time in my hand, and the people were at that time charging me with attempting to shoot the Queen—the con<lb></lb>stable took the pistol from me—I was taken to Gardiner's-lane station—I saw, when the prisoner pulled the pan up, that it was full of coarse gun<lb></lb>powder; and when I took it from him I put the pan down, and half-cocked the hammer, to save what gunpowder remained, but a portion of it had got out—when I gave it to the policeman I had put the pan down—in other respects it was just the same as when I took it from the prisoner—I do not remember the prisoner saying anything to me—I think he asked me for his pistol again—that was while I had him in custody—I saw him afterwards, when he was taken into custody—I have not the least doubt of his being the person.</p>

               <p>there was a great noise after it happened—while I had hold of the prisoner they kept shouting at me to let him go—they cried out that the pistol was not loaded—I do not think there was a great deal of laughing—I will not swear there was not—I spoke to my brother and uncle—I do not recollect what I said to my uncle—I crossed the Mall towards the Green-park be<lb></lb>fore I met policeman A 56—the people were about me all this time—my brother was helping me to take the prisoner—I do not remember whether he had hold of him—he was walking by the side—I think he had hold of him—I kept hold of him—he made a little resistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not he pushing and pulling from you as the people pushed and pulled? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he was—that is what I mean by a little resistance—as he went along I believe he appealed to me to give him his pistol back—I have no doubt of it—he did not follow me, and keep up with me, when I had not hold of him—when he got away he made his way off—we might have gone twelve or fourteen yards before we got to policeman 56 A—he did not ask me to give him the pistol back several times—I will not swear he did not ask twice, nor that he did not ask me when I had not hold of him—I do not think he did—the crowd kept by us half-way across the road—he might then have got away by the assistance of the mob, but I had hold of him—I met policeman A 56 about half-way down the road—I did not cease to keep hold of him till I was made—I said nothing about the click to A 56—I told him I saw him present the pistol—just after the second carriage had passed, I observed him take the pistol and present it at the third—he was by my side at the time the first carriage passed—I was looking down towards Buckingham Palace, and watched the carriages as they came up—the prisoner was standing by the side of me all that time—I saw him take the pistol from his coat—I did not see distinctly that it was a pistol when he was taking it out, but I saw it when he pointed it—he took it out as the second carriage was going by, and as the second had just passed he presented it about the middle of the last carriage—at the moment he took it out he and I were standing exactly abreast of the horses—he presented it immediately he took it out—I heard the click immediately.</p>

On Sunday, the 3rd of July, I was with him in St. James's-park, seeing Her Majesty going to the chapel—there were a good many people there—I stood on my brother's right-hand—I did not have hold of his arm—I did not see him take hold of any body, but saw him when he had hold of the prisoner—I had not seen the prisoner do any thing before that—when my brother had hold of him he had a pistol in his hand—he got away from him by the crowd pressing on him—my brother kept the pistol.</p>

I have been in the police better than seven years—I have been on duty in the Park repeatedly when the Queen has been going to the Chapel Royal—I have been on duty at the Palace nearly twelve months—there are generally three carriages, and Her Majesty usually rides in the third—On the 3rd of July, Her Majesty was in the hind carriage—I saw her so as to recognise her—She sat in the hind part of the carriage—I was on duty in the Green-park, and she was on the side towards where the prisoner was standing—I was keeping the gate going into the Green-park—as soon as the Queen had passed, I returned into the Green-park again, looked round, and saw a mob coming down from Buckingham Palace towards St. James's Palace—I immediately ran down, and when I got about twenty yards from the Duke of Sutherland's house, I saw Charles Dassett with a pistol in his hand, and 400 or 500 persons following him—this was about five minutes after the Royal carriages had passed—I did not see any thing of the prisoner—I took possession of the pistol, and put it into my pocket, on account of the mob of persons crowding around wishing to see it—I afterwards gave it to Inspector Martin, of my division—it was partially examined in my presence, but not unloaded in my presence.</p>

I was on duty on Sun<lb></lb>day, the 3rd of July, in St. James's-park, and observed Dassett in custody of Partridge—I went with them to the station—there was a great crowd, which followed us to the station, and there Partridge gave me a pistol, said to be the one he had taken from Dassett—I have it here—I drew the loading—there was a small quantity of powder, a bit of paper, and two small pieces of pipe, or gravel, or something—it was a coarse sort of powder—it was rammed down with paper—it appeared to be properly rammed down—the powder was not sufficient for an ordinary charge of a pistol of that description—it was about half an ordinary charge—it was rammed down in the usual way—the bits of pipe were loose on the paper, and very small—I have them here—they fell out when the pistol was turned down—one of them is about the size of an ordinary shot—I drew the paper with the ramrod, and then poured the powder out—there was no powder in the pan—there were a few grains sticking about it, as if it had been recently primed.</p>

               <p>far I was from the gate of the Palace—as near as I can guess, it may be forty or fifty yards, more or less, it was further than across this Court—I saw the three carriages come out—I saw the pump, or watering place—I may have been ten or twelve feet from there, to the best of my recollection, towards St. James's Palace—I was on this side of the pump—the seat from the pump—I was on the other side of the pump from the Palace, nearer St. James's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before Dassett took hold of him. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him, it might have been a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before—I had seen him with the pistol in his hand all that time, and kept my eye on him—he held the pistol in his hand the whole time, by his side—I was about three feet from him—I cannot positively say whether any one was between me and him, I cannot recollect—of course the people were round, but for to say who was between me and him I cannot—there were several people round the prisoner, they were drawn up at various places round him; but to say who was, or was not, round, I cannot say—I cannot say whether any one was between me and the prisoner—several persons were standing near me—I did not point him out to them—I was standing by the side of the prisoner, not before him—I was standing to his right, about three feet from him—I saw Dassett, he seemed to be standing in front of the pri<lb></lb>soner—I cannot say whether he was nearer to him than me—I did not see Dassett before I saw him standing near the prisoner—how long that was before I saw Dassett take the pistol from him I cannot positively say—I am sure I saw him—nothing out of the common way made me observe him, I noticed him, that was all—to the best of my recollection he was standing rather nearer to the prisoner than me, but I cannot say—he was standing in front of the prisoner, to the best of my recollection—immediately before him—I was standing by the side of him—I cannot say whether any one was between me and the prisoner—I saw Dassett take hold of his arm, after the carriages had passed about thirty or forty yards—the carriages had passed thirty or forty yards before I saw</p>

               <p>him take hold of the prisoner—the last carriage passed, as near as I can tell, about twelve o'clock—it might be five or six minutes after the last carriage had passed that I saw Dasset take hold of him—I can<lb></lb>not say the time exactly—to the best of my recollection the distance was thirty or forty yards, and to the best of my recollection it was four or five minutes after the carriage had passed—I was standing looking on, looking at the prisoner—I continued to look at him after the carriage had passed; and, as I have before described, saw Dassett take hold of the prisoner's arm after the carriage passed—Dassett was standing in front at the time—he took hold of his arm, by turning round in this position—he turned round and took hold of him—he was standing between the prisoner and the carriage, which had passed, and I by the right side—I saw the whole of the carriages—I did not notice whether any body was with them—I noticed that there were three carriages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see the boy get away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the boy walk, as I before described, walking down towards St. James's Palace, very leisurely, after what had occurred, as if he might have gone away if he chose—Dassett was walking down in company, but whether he had hold of the boy I cannot say—I cannot tell whether he was walking before, or behind, or by his side—I saw the boy go down the park, Dassett was in company with him—I did not see him go away without Dassett.</p>

               <p>—I saw them coming along the road up to where I was standing, and where Bean and Dassett were—having seen them together, as I have de<lb></lb>scribed, I left them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you wait to see whether he would do it or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I waited to see whether it might be; whether he would do it, it was not for me to say.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you saw the boy with a pistol in his hand ten minutes, and was waiting to see the result, and that result you thought possibly might be some attempt on Her Majesty, How came you not to interfere yourself, and take hold of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My Lord, I had not the self-possession, at least, I did not think anything of doing anything of that—I did not know whe<lb></lb>ther there was mischief in it or not.</p>

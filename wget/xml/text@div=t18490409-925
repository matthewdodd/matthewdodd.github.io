In April last year, I was porter to Mr. Bartlett, a bookseller, of Paternoster-row—the prisoner was in his service—on 19th April, I saw him in the warehouse, at twenty minutes after one o'clock—there was nobody else there—the cash-box was on the window-sill—the pri<lb></lb>soner was outside that window, on the sill, going to clean it; that was the last I saw of him till he was before the Magistrate.</p>

On 19th April, I left the warehouse, about ten minutes to one, on business—I came back at twenty-five minutes before two, I found the premises entirely deserted—I immediately missed the cash-box, and on searching, we missed an empty bag—I did not see the prisoner again till he was before the Magistrate—he was under notice to quit on the Saturday; this was on Wednesday.</p>

I am a bookseller, of 32, Paternoster-row, the prisoner was in my employ between three and four years—I had given him notice to quit on the previous week—on Wednesday, 19th April, I went to my cash-box, about ten minutes past one o'clock—I took some money out, and there was then left in it seventeen sovereigns, and about ten shillings in silver—I went out at twenty minutes after one; I then saw the cash-box—I do not know whether Aldridge was on the premises then—I afterwards missed the cash-box, and gave information to the police—I went next day to the prisoner's mother, and while I was there, this letter came in the prisoner's writing, I opened it; this card was enclosed in it, with two half-crowns on it—I have seen nothing of the cash-box—it was the prisoner's duty to remain on my premises from one till two, especially if there was no other person there—he was not apprehended till March, 1849.</p>

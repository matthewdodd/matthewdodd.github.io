               <p>Q. I concluded that you were not sober at this time? - A. I was far from drunk, I had had two sixpennyworths of rum and water, and a shillingsworth of punch, with Mr. Edmunds, in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I only judged so far from your going into such a house? - A. It was an important trick in me, undoubtedly, but so it was, the other girl never come back.</p>

               <p>I am partner with Mr. Palethorp, but I have no concern with this garden or shrubs; I was at the house at the time that this happened; on the 23d of December I was alarmed by a tittle underneath my chamber window; between twelve and one at night; I immediately jumped out of bed, and took a cutlass I had in my room, and ran down stairs, and opened the garden door, and found these two men close up to the door, with a blunderbuss presented at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090048"></xptr>them; I asked him how many he had got; he said here are a couple, but I do not know how many more; we took those two into the kitchen, and searched them; and I saw them searched at the watch-house; there were found upon them two knives and a cord; I had seen the state of the shrubbery before, when we came, to examine it, I found they had ben cut by some body in the course of that time; I took them into the shrubbery, and shewed them one bundle compleatly tied up; and another bundle ready to tied up, with a cord underneath; I told them I made no doubt but they were the people that had committed the former depredations; they said they had never been there before; on Friday, the 28th of December, in order to ascertain the value of the bay that these people had cut, another friend and myself went down to Fleet-market, and we found it is of larger value than five shillings considerably, for I gave sixpence for this bit alone, (producing a sprig which he had bought.) and in proportion to the value of this, it must be worth three pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any conversation on this subject with any body before? - No, Sir; no further than buying this piece; the woman I bought it of is here; she told me it cost her four-pence; they pleaded guilty to the charge, and begged pardon; I cannot particularly recollect the words.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how many plants were destroyed that night? - I believe there might be five or six cut down close to the ground.</p>

               <p>Where do you live? - In Fleet-market; I know the tall prisoner by sight, this two or three years; I have seen him go backwards and forwards in the market; I never bought any thing of him in my life: I deal in this sort of article, but I cannot be any judge of the value of that quantity, because we buy it in bundles such as this; the value of this bundle is two-pence; I buy at two shillings a dozen; they may be two or three dozen made out of each bundle.</p>
               <p>Then tell us, upon the oath you have taken, is that of the value of 5 s. or is it not? - The value Sir, for me to buy? we buy it of people that bring it into market; we never ask them any questions where they get it; there are many things that grow wild, and this may grow so.</p>
               <p>Court. When you buy these things, they are brought to you in the market? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there is the price of carriage upon them? - May be I buy half a dozen out of six dozen.</p>
               <p>But they would not be worth so much if you was to go to the garden and fetch them yourself? have you judgment enough to say, whether the bays growing would be worth five shillings? - In my opinion they are worth five shillings; I would give 5 s. for them.</p>

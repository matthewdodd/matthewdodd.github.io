I saw the Prisoner, on Monday the eighth of February, cleaning Mr. Spooner's stable, and Mr. Spooner's groom said he had lost a shirt, and three pair of stockings. I saw a ladder in the yard, and thought there was something more than ordinary, by my hay being tumbled about, and that the person must get through my haylost into Nicholls's, and so into Mr. Pollexsen's stable.</p>

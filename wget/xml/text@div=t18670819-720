On 18th July, about half-past ten, I was in Cheapside along with Obey, another officer, and saw the two prisoners, in company with seven or eight others, at the corner of King Street, leading to Guildhall—I saw Smith go up to a young man who wee standing there, and take hold of his watch-chain—the young man saw bin do it, and got away as quickly as he could—I then saw the two prisoners with the others surround a lady and gentleman who were endeavouring to get across from Cheapside towards Cannon Street—I saw Smith go in the front of the gentleman, Mr. Dudley, and take hold of his watch-chain, and draw from his waistcoat pocket this watch—Wells was standing behind him, and the others were regularly surrounding the lady and gentleman, and preventing them from crossing the road—at that time there was a great crush, just as the Sultan left Guildhall, and we were pushed about—I saw Smith leave the gentleman—I forced my way to him and seized both his hands and took from his left hand this watch—Wells left, and went and leaned up against the wall—I told Smith that I was an officer and should take him into custody—in going to the station I took from the waistband of his trousers a meerschaum pipe, a wooden pipe, and a silk handkerchief—the other officer took Wells—Wells was close to Smith when he took the watch.</p>

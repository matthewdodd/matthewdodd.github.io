                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in King Street, Covent Garden. On 11th Nov., about a quarter past 12 o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner on Ludgate Hill; she was alone, she caught me by the arm, and asked where I was going; I said I was going home—she pressed herself very close up to me, and dragged me underneath an arch; she was talking to me all the time I was under the arch, and I felt her hands outside my breast pocket—I instantly put my hand into my pocket, and found a sove<lb></lb>reign gone—I had received a sovereign about an hour previously, and a few shillings—the silver, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was in my waistcoat pocket, the sovereign was in a purse in my breast pocket—I had felt it safe in St. Paul's Churchyard, for I unbuttoned my coat, being rather warm with walking fast; the sove<lb></lb>reign</p>

               <p>was gone out of the purse and the purse put back again, it was a leather purse; I have not got it here—I instantly accused the prisoner of taking the sovereign—she said she had not got the amount on her—a police<lb></lb>man was close at hand, and I told him the circumstances, and gave her in charge—she said, "Nonsense, you must be dreaming, I have not got such an amount on me"—on my way to the station I missed a shilling out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>

On the morning of 11th Nov., about a quarter past 12 o'clock, I was on duty on Ludgate Hill—I saw the prisoner there, and I had seen her twice before that evening, between 10 and half past 12 o'clock—she was pulling two gentlemen about—I kept my eye upon her—I saw her take hold of Mr. Husberry by the arm, and give him a turn under the arch, and hold him there; it is the entrance to Pil<lb></lb>grim Street—I went down the hill and up Martin's Court, and came on them at the rear up Pilgrim Street; I found them still there—I said to the prisoner, "You are out of your latitude here, I think?"—she said, "No, sir; it is all right"—I said, "I do not think it is all right;" and I said to the prosecutor, "Is there anything amiss?"—he said, "Yes, I felt her hand in my pocket, and I have lost a sovereign and a shilling"—I said, "Will you charge her with that?"—he said, "Yes;" and I took her to the station—I kept her hand confined all the way there, that she should not make away with anything—as she was standing in the station house, I saw her fumbling her hand about under her shawl—I said, "Let me see what you have got in your hand?"—she refused to do so; I took hold of her hand, forced it open, and found in it a sovereign, three sixpences, two halfpence, and a farthing—she was afterwards searched by the female searcher, who produced to me an empty purse and a latch key.</p>

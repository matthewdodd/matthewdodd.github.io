                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. John Purdie, 15, Welling<lb></lb>ton Street, Deptford, clothier—on Saturday evening, 16th April, about 6.30, I was standing just inside the door—I looked outside, and saw the prisoner with a shawl in his hand—he saw me, and dropped it—I asked him white he had done it for, and he said, "Find out"—I picked it up—he said two or three—bad words, and walked over the road into R public-house—I called a policeman, and he was given into custody—the value of the shawl was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had seen it the shop door, just before.</p>

I am the wife of John Purdie—on this Saturday evening, I was outside my shop, opposite the prosecutor's, and I saw the prisoner pull the shawl down—I was looking to see whether he was going to take it into the shop, and Mrs. Truman came to the door, and asked him what he was doing—he said, "Find out"—that was all I heard—he dropped it when she spoke to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. That is James Bradley, he is a <rs id="t17971206-30-deflabel169" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

My wife and I were returning in a single-horse chaise from Windsor to Hounslow; when we had got near the eleven mile-stone upon <placeName id="t17971206-30-crimeloc170">Hounslow-heath</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was the day closed? - A. No, it was not, it was rather dusk; I passed two men together, one a great deal taller than the other; and a few yards further, a third man; they were on foot at that time; I did not see the fourth, which I say was Bradley, but instantly as we had passed them, they must have returned upon us, for somebody came up immediately and laid hold of the horse, they all came by the side of the chaise; I was going to drive on, when one of them stepped his foot upon the chaise-step; as he got up to me, another immediately got up on Mrs. Brown's side; a third got across the shafts, behind the horse, and presented a pistol, while the fourth was at the horse's head; the one on my side had no pistol; the man on the other side was presenting a pistol at Mrs. Brown's breast all the time; the man on my side unbuttoned my coat, and felt on both sides, and in my inside pockets, for my pocket-book, and my watch; he demanded my money, and felt my small clothes, he felt that there was money and notes in my left hand breeches-pocket; the cash was, six guineas, I think, and six half-guineas, two two pound notes, and a one pound note; then he felt that there was something more in my right hand pocket, he demanded that, which was silver, and I gave it him all; the other on the other side, demanded the money of Mrs. Brown; the man on the shafts only held the pistol while the others robbed us; Mrs. Brown gave them all the silver she had, and they demanded her cloak, "your cloak,"Ma'am;" I said, my brave fellows, do not treat us ill, I will give you all the money that I have; we gave them all, and they did not take the cloak; then they got down, and told us we might go on, and they would not hurt us.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they dressed? - A. They appeared to have all great coats and crapes.</p>
               <p>Q.What hats had they? - A.They had all flapped hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the one that you thought was Bradley? - A. The fourth man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was Bradley? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060047"></xptr>A. I have not, nor never had, from the moment I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife was ill in consequence of it afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Bradley was bailed, and now comes surrendering to take his trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you have not a doubt, as to Bradley being the person? - A. I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. The persons that robbed you had crapes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you could not see their faces? - A. I saw the face of him that looked at me, when he took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. So as to distinguish the features? - A. I really thought it was Bradley, from the features, for it was double over his nose, and single below.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said before, upon your oath, that the only means you had of knowing him, was, by his voice? - A. No; I knew him personally, as well as any man in England.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not said so before upon oath, in your examination at Bow-street? - A. I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not say that at Bow-street? - A. I do not recollect that I said any such words.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear you did not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This much, however, you will insist upon, that there was a crape over the whole face? - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, at that hour of the night, undertake to swear, with a crape over his face, that you could distinguish the features of any man? - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, at that late hour of the night, with a crape over the face, could you, by that light, distinguish the features of a man through that crape? - A.Certainly, I might distinguish him from another man, knowing the stature and features of the man, it is possible to see features.</p>
               <p>Q. You may see flesh, but not features; where was the crape double? - A. Over his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet, through the double crape, you could see his features? - A. I know him as well as I do any man in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you prosecute that young man till you were served with a copy of a writ, and an action for slander? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, three days after you had been served with a copy of a writ, you instituted this prosecution? - A. I do not know to a day; for I did not think any thing about the writ.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the robbery, it was circulated throughout Hounslow town, that Bradley was the man - did he not wait upon you, and proffer to satisfy you by reference to witnesses, that it was impossible he could be the man? - A. He said, he could bring witnesses.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not refer you to the persons? - A. I told him I was confident he was the man, and should say so to the latest day I had to live.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not refer you to those witnesses? - A. He said, he could prove he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who they were? - A. I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Indeed you are exposing yourself most miserably-did he say by whom he could prove that he was not the man? - A. I cannot tell that he mentioned any name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that upon your oath? - A. I do not recollect that he did tell me any names; he said, he was at Cranford-bridge, and that he could bring witnesses; he said, he was drinking with some post-boys, or horse-keepers, or something of that sort, I don't recollect who.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he mention any names? - A. To the best of my recollection he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But, surely, after the man told you, you having been robbed, that he would produce witnesses, and mentioned their names, one would have thought you would be very glad to have had it cleared, I think I should not have forgot it? - A. I do not think he did mention any names.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that he did not mention any? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. As he did not refer you to any name, how came you to go to Hawkins the coachman? - A. He did not tell me about Hawkins to my recollection, but I spoke about the robbery the instant I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not tell you of the man that had driven him from Hounslow to Cranford-bridge that night? -(Hesitates.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now be cool, and give a direct answer, did he mention Hawkins to you? - A. I do not know that he did at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon your oath, will you say he did not? - A. I asked Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now do answer the question, you are disgracing yourself most miserably, it is a plain question-did he mention Hawkins or not? - A.Upon my soul, I cannot say whether he did or not, if I was to die this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask Hawkins? - A. A neighbour of mine said he went down by such a coach, that same night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now tell me, after being reminded of it, how came you to ask Hawkins? - A. I cannot say, if I was to die this moment.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Never mind dying at present, that may be a very serious question by and by, upon your oath, did he mention Hawkins? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he did? - A. He might, probably.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060048"></xptr>Court. Q. Why might he probably mention Hawkins? - A. I suppose he might mention Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do not you believe he did? - A. I really cannot say; I would not say it for all the world; I cannot say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he did? - A. I cannot answer you whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say, you have no belief upon the subject? - A. I would believe right things, but I cannot say what I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, just now, it seemed probable, do you believe that he did mention it? - A. As I said before, if I was to drop down dead, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me an answer, one way or the other, do you or not, believe that he mentioned Hawkins's name, and refered you to him? - A. No, he did not; I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you are sure he did not? - A. I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. I think the Jury will hardly depend on a man who gives such evidence as this; for the sake of the prisoner, you may go on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I thank your Lordship. - Q. Was George Such, Bush's ostler, at Hounslow, present when that young man made this application to you? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you do not recollect Hawkin's name, do you recollect Goddard's name, of Cranford-bridge? - A. I asked Mr. Goddard.</p>
               <p>Court. For shame, is that an answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Upon your oath, did he not at that time mention Goddard, of Cranford-bridge, to you? - A. He said he was there at Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I thought you mentioned just now that he mentioned no names? - A. He said he was at Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Court. Oh fie.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you not make enquiries in consequence of the reference of this young man? - A. I did ask Mr. Goddard about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you again distinctly-In consequence of the reference made you by this young man, did you not make enquiry of Hawkins and Goddard, and the servants, at Cranford-bridge? - A. I did not ask any of the servants.</p>
               <p>Q. It was about the eleven mile-stone that this transaction took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is about a mile and a half from Cranford-bridge? - A. About a mile and a quarter, I cannot say to a mile and a half or a mile and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know it to be more than a mile and a quarter? - A. I have not measured it.</p>
               <p>Re examined by the Court. Q. You asked Goddard and Hawkins? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask them? - A.Because I had heard that he had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to them in consequence of the prisoner having mentioned their names? - A. I cannot say whether he mentioned Hawkins or Goddard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention either of them? - A. He said he went to Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he mention neither? - A. I believe he did mention Goddard or Mr. Goddard, or Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention Goddard? - A. I cannot say whether he did or not; I believe he did mention Goddard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you tell me he mentioned no names? - A. I cannot say particularly whether he said he was at Mr. Goddard's, or at Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were coming from Windsor to Hounslow, do you know any thing of the persons who attacked you? - A. I cannot say I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Under this evidence I certainly do feel it too much to call upon a Jury, when a man's life is at stake; from the beginning I have had my doubts whether it was such a case as was fit to be supported.</p>
               <p>Court. The prosecutor has acted very abominably, and I could say something further, but I will not; the character of this young man will certainly stand as fair as ever it has done at any one period of time.</p>

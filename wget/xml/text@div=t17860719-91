               <p>I am a day labouring man; I came to Smithfield to sell a horse; I saw this horse in Smithfield on the 30th of June exposed to sale; there was a boy on the horse; he said, here is my father, and his father went and fetched the owner; then I took the prisoner down to the Rose.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say he was the owner of the horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said, he bought him at Cambridge fair, and gave a guinea and an half for him; he was exposed openly to sale in the market; I am sure it was Mr. Lee's horse.</p>

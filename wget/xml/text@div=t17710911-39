               <p>Craswell. On Monday morning; I opened the bag and found it right; there was an account as usual; the value of the four-pences agreed with the mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain that?</p>
               <p>Craswell. As they are told off from Bristol, we tell them afterwards, and if there is any difference we make an alteration; if there is none, we do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the Post master at Bristol put the charge on the letters?</p>
               <p>Craswell. Yes.</p>

               <p>Craswell. I should; I do not suppose the tale varies once in a 12 month, (a paper produced) here is the tale of 645 then there is 19 added, we make it into one sum, that makes up the whole sum, so that it tallied exactly with the charge.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. It is possible to make a mistake in casting up the four-pences, suppose 645 were charged when there was 646, in truth such a thing might happen?</p>
               <p>Craswell. It seldom happens.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Suppose the letters instead of 645 there was 646, if one was lost they would be right?</p>
               <p>Craswell. No, it could not, because there would be one difference?</p>

               <p>"The prisoner said in his defence, that the day he sent the note to his brother, he took a walk to Cold Bath fields to meet an acquaintance: that, not meeting with him, he went to Lord Cobham's Head, and began amusing himself at the billiard table: that a person asked him to play; that he did, and was considerably the gainer; that he pulled out a handful of money; that the person asked him to change a twenty pound bank note; he told him he could if he was at home; that rather than loose what he had won, he took him home and sent the bank note to his brother to change; that if he had stole the note he might have done it privately, and should not have sent it to his own brother to change, who he knew must write his name upon it; that he believed it was a planned scheme; that the story being abroad that the office was robbed; it was a designed thing to throw suspicion on him, and that any man in his senses, if he had been guilty, could never have acted in the open manner he had done.</p>
               <p>The prisoner began calling witnesses to his character; but the judge said that the jury would give him credit for a character; for none but those of good characters had places in such offices.</p>

On Saturday the fifth of July, about four in the afternoon, two or three booksellers came to me, and told me they had lost book; that day, a little after came the prisoner to the shop window ; I saw him take two books up, and clap them under his left arm, under his coat. I went to him, and said, friend what have you got here? he said nothing of mine; he went to make a push to run away, and the books fell from under his cloaths . They are called , A journey through every stage of life, (produced in court ) I took him into my shop, then there fell another book from him. but that was not mine; the other two were. I took him before justice Fielding; there he own'd he had liv'd in this way for about six weeks and beg'd he might be sent to sea.</p>

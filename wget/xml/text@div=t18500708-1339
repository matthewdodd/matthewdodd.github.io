                  </hi>. I am independent. On 1st July, I was lodging at Jubilee-place, Stepney—on that day I met the female prisoners at the door of No. 12, St. John's-lane—there was another woman with them—it might have been one, or two, or three o'clock in the day, I think—I am quite sure it was not the middle of the night—they asked me to give them some porter—I gave them 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went into the parlour with them—one of the three went for some porter, and I assisted them in drinking it—I afterwards gave them a shilling to get some rum—after that was finished, they asked for more—the two female prisoners were still in the room, and a third, but not the one that was there at first—they kept asking me for rum—I made an excuse, stating I had only sovereigns about me, and appealed to Haseman how <hi rend="italic">follyfull</hi> it would be for me to change a sovereign—as I was making the excuse, my hand fell down on my waistcoat pocket where my purse had been safe an hour and a half before, and I found it was gone—I had then been in the house nearly two hours—I had it safe when I went in—it contained five sovereigns—I had pulled my purse out, and showed the two women the five sovereigns—when I missed it, I got up from my chair, and said, "By G—! you have robbed me"—I stood against the door, and said they should not go out, and the male Haseman struck me right and left, and his wife and the younger prisoner all beat me together till they got the door open—I followed the man to the back door—I did not keep hold of him—I caught him again—I had called at the door for the police—Smith assisted in beating me—I did not see her do any<lb></lb>thing else—after the beating, and before the police came, I saw her come from the back parlour—when the police came they brought the prisoners into the back parlour, and they said, "Search him, he has got the money himself"—while they were saying that, I saw the purse lying in some drawers, and snatched it up, and handed it to the police—I did not do that until they told the policeman to search me—I might have said, "By G—, I have got it"—I examined it, and there were five sovereigns in it—I did not put it where it was found—I cannot say whether the purse was in my pocket after the male prisoner came into the room.</p>

About a quarter past ten o'clock, on the night of 1st July, I heard a cry of "Murder!" and "Police!" from 12, John's-place—I went there, and the door was opened by Smith—I went into the yard, and found the prosecutor on his back, with his head raised, covered with blood—he was calling out for help—the male prisoner was over him, in the act ot striking him—I pushed him away—I saw the female, Huseman, put a pole against the wall—she had it in her hand, as if she was going to</p>

I went to 12, John's-place, on the night of 1st July, and found Pye there, and the three prisoners and the prosecutor in the front parlour—the prosecutor was bleeding from just over the eye, and his waistcoat and handkerchief were covered with blood—I asked him, in the prisoners' hearing, what was the matter—he said he had been assaulted and robbed—I asked who did it—he said, "That man," and pointed to the male prisoner—I asked if he would give him into custody and charge him—he said, "I will"—the other constable then left with him—after that I was searching, and the female Haseman said to the prosecutor, "You had better go to Mr. Cooper's public-house, where you were this afternoon, and see whether you have left it there," and both the females said, "Search him"—27 <hi rend="italic">K</hi> asked the prosecutor if he had got it himself, and he said, "I have it," and I saw 27 <hi rend="italic">K</hi> take the purse and contents from the prosecutor's left hand—I examined it, and it contained seven sovereigns—the prosecutor was stand<lb></lb>ing near the drawers at the time—Haseman said at the station, "I know nothing about the man."</p>

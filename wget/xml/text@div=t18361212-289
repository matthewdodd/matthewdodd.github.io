                  </hi>. I am servant to Thomas Richard Killick, of New Cross, Deptford—he sells bread and other things. On the 3rd of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Jones, a grocer, in Church-street, for some sugar, tea, and tobacco—I put them into my basket—the tea was at the top—when I got to Broadway the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up against me, and asked me where I was going—I told her to New Cross—she asked if she might carry my basket, and I said she might if she liked—I allowed her to do so—she said it was very heavy, but it was not—when we got to the Lord Duncan public-house she asked me to go back with her—I told her "No"—When I got home I missed a pound of tea from the basket—I am certain it could not have fallen out—she was carrying it with one hand, and I with the other—she was a stranger.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 49.) I apprehended the prisoner in Broadway, and charged her with taking the tea; and when I took her to the station-house the prosecutrix said that was the woman who car<lb></lb>ried her basket, and stole a pound of tea—the prisoner said, "No, my dear, you should mind what you say; girls like you take peoples' characters away"—I afterwards went to Creeck-place, in consequence of inquiry—the prisoner told me she lived there in the first room, ground-floor, and in that room I found two canisters, containing 12 1/2oz. of tea, and a portion of tea leaves wet—it was about twelve o'clock on the 5th of December—she said at the Magistrate's office, after leaving the girl she kicked against a parcel, and found it contained tea—that she picked it up in the mud, took it home, the paper was wet, and she burnt the paper in the morning—she bore a very good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shoreditch, and am a hosier. The prisoner was in my employ—I missed a considerable quantity of articles from my shop, and determined to search his boxes—I went to the station and got a policeman about half-past eleven o'clock at night on the 5th of Oct.—the prisoner was in bed—I went to his bed-room, accompanied by the officer—I said, "Fisher,</p>

               <p>I have been missing stock a long time, I strongly suspect you, it makes me so uncomfortable, that I determined to call in the police"—I asked which were his boxes, and he told me—the first thing they showed me was a shirt, marked 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was taken from a hat-box—that shirt had certainly farmed a part of my stock—I had marked it with my own hand—I had never sold it to the prisoner—he had no right to have it there—we found twenty-three or twenty-four other shirts and thirty-eight pairs of stockings (I suppose about ten or twelve pairs of them were quite new) and some gloves—the new stock<lb></lb>ings were such as I had in my shop, but they had no mark by which I could swear to them—I had never authorised the prisoner to take any articles from iny shop, except he bought them of me—I said, "This shirt is marked 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is one of my shirts"—he said, "I took it out of stock, and put the money in the till the next day"—the shirts were all dirty—he did not addren me about them, but 1 think he said to Teakle, "You saw them when yoa searched my boxes before/' or something like that—I had occasion to mike a search before, in consequence of a female servant being dishonest.</p>

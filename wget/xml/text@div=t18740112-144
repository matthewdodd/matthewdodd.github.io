                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife and live at 26, Currie Street, Nine Elms—the prisoner is a labourer in an iron foundry—on Saturday, 29th November, in consequence of an arrangement between us, I sent my daughter to him for some money—after some time she came back and I went out to look for the prisoner—I found him in a public-house—I said he ought to be ashamed of himself, keeping the child so long—it was a very wet night—I stopped some time in the public-house because there was somebody wanted my husband to go back to a stable, and I said he should not go back—my husband went out and I afterwards went next door to my home—when I got to my own door I received a blow, but I don't think it was meant for me—I put my hand to my forehead and sat down—I did not see what he struck me with—I saw a poker afterwards in the fire-place, when I returned from the hospital—he did not mean it—he was not right then; he had been drinking, it might be accidental—I did not throw anything at him.</p>

I am medical officer of the Wandsworth Infirmary—the prosecutrix was admitted on Thursday, 4th December—she had a large lacerated wound in the centre of the forehead, and erysipelas over the face and forehead—it was such a wound as would be caused by a poker—the wound is not well yet.</p>

I was called on 29th November, and saw the prosecutrix bleeding from a severe wound in the forehead—I took her to St. Thomas's Hospital, and had it dressed—I saw the prisoner after<lb></lb>wards, and accused him of the assault on his wife, and he said "Yes; I done it"—the wife gave me this poker.</p>

We had some words, and she got hold of a gallon jar of water, and heaving the water at me, the jar slipped out of her hand and caught me on the cheek bone. I got out to catch my wife, and she caught her forehead up against the door as it was open She shut the door, and I tried to prize it open with the poker, and it struck her on the forehead, and she said "There you are; new you have done it again." I did not hit her.</p>

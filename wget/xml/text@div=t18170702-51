On the morning of the 30th of June I missed twenty pieces of stained paper from my shop - I had seen them the evening before at four o'clock-they were in the farthest part of my shop from the door. I was at home at eight o'clock in the evening before; I had been out before that. The same afternoon, at three o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Davies's, in High Holborn; I knew nothing of him.</p>

            . I am a paper-hanger. On the 30th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I bought the paper of the prisoner for 2l. - he has worked for me. He told me his father (who is a paper-stainer) wanted to sell them for some money to pay a bill.</p>

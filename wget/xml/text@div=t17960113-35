               <p>Court. What they told you we must not hear. - A. I went down to the wharf immediately, and went into one of the warehouses, and there were two sacks of flour untied, and appeared to have been robbed; I taxed Willoughby with it, he was in the warehouse at the time, and I told him there was a man stopped with the flour, as I had been informed, and I was fearful he might know something of the business; he denied it, and said, he did not know any thing about it; I told him to come to me, and we would go to the office; he did not come to soon as I was ready to go to the office, but he followed me; and after being examined, denied knowing any thing at all of it: the other man was examined first; that is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>Q. But of the flour? - A. He has as much to do with that as I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he always had? - A. Upon the wharf business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been partners? - A. I cannot say how long; many years.</p>
               <p>Q. You taxed the prisoner, thought another man was stopped with flour; you told him you were going to the office and desired him to follow, and he did follow you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury; it is taking up the time of the Court to examine this man; I shall think it my duty to tell you, that a man taken up for felony is not a witness upon which you ought to convict any body, unless he was corroborated by others: before you can convict a man upon the evidence of an accomplice, there must be other circumstances from creditable witnesses, and such as you can give full credit to, to confirm his story; it serves frequently as the link of a chain when other circumstances are mentioned by witnesses; but here we have examined no less than five witnesses, and what do they say? the watchmen say, that between five and six in the morning, they met this fellow with property in his possession; the constable says, he was brought to him; the Giles's say, the prisoner lived sixteen years in their service; he denies knowing any thing of it; and, therefore, the whole of the evidence must rest upon this man, who is confessedly and avowedly a thief; and is the man who ought, if they can identify the property, to stand at that bar, for it was found upon him; and if he were to swear that that man took it, positively I should say, how can you believe such a man? I ought to tell you, that though you are bound to hear it, you are bound not to believe it.</p>

               <p>Court. (To the prisoner.) I am afraid there is too much reason to suspect you; I cannot believe these gentlemen would have brought you here, after sixteen years service, unless they believed you were a bad man; and though I cannot convict any man upon such evidence, standing here to do justice, it may happen that a good man may stand at that bar charged by a bad man; I trust, therefore, this will be a warning to you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In justice to the prisoner, my Lord, I ought to say, that I have upwards of twenty witnesses to call to his character for honesty: the whole Hamlet of Hackney have contributed to befriend him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer's clerk. On the 7th of June, I was walking down Vinegar-lane with a rose in my button-hole—the prisoner asked me to let her smell it—I took no notice—she came behind me, put her hand round my neck, and took the pins out of my scarf—I looked round, and could not see any one—I did not miss the pins till she was gone—I lost sight of her for half an hour.</p>

I went with the prosecutor to Vinegar-lane, and saw the prisoner standing at the door—we went past her, and she called to the prosecutor, and said she had got his diamond pin, that she had tried to take the rose, and had taken the pin by mistake—the prose<lb></lb>cutor said he would give her in charge—she ran into the house, and through into another house—I went and took her.</p>

            's: I went with Mr. Clark, the first day of last sessions, to a house by Battle-bridge-wells, in Britania-street, I believe it is; Mr. Clark first sent a gentleman's servant with a letter in his hand for Mr Askew, to get the easier admittance into the house; the door was opened by Mrs. Horner, myself and Mr. Evans rushed into the house; we immediately ran up stairs, and upon the garret stairs, within three or four steps of the top, I met Askew; he had got on a cheque shirt, the sleeves of which were tucked up, and the collar was unbuttoned; he pressed very much to come down stairs; we had a little struggle with him; I insisted upon his going up stairs, and we forced him up: when we met him on the stairs, Bissell ran out of a garret that is on the left hand into a garret that fronts the stairs; we took Askew into the front garret, and kept him there till Mr. Clark came.</p>
               <p>How was Bissell dressed? - He had his coat off, a silk handkerchief tied round his head, his breeches knees were unbuttoned, he had no garters on, and was in a sweat; they both seemed to be in a working condition; their hands were all over mould and sand; they both wanted much to wash their hands, but I would not let them till Mr. Clark came up: in the front garret there was a forge fixed, a crucible upon the fire, with some metal in it, and a large quantity of charcoal lying by; there were the flasks; there was some sand, which was hot, that must have been just made use of; there was scouring-paper, and a bottle of aqua-fortis; these were all in the front garret, into which Bissell ran; there was a small earthen tea-cup, with some pickle in it, which is used in that business, and some water in a quart stone pan, of a greenish colour;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220047"></xptr> there was, in a larger pan, some very dirty water, and by that was a scrubbing-brush, and a little earthen platter, with some common scouring sand, and the floor was wet where they had been scouring something, I suppose the counterfeit silver.</p>
               <p>Who were in company? - Clark, Evans, Heley, myself, and a gentleman's servant. I went some few days afterwards with Mrs. Horner, and found some scouring-paper, and some few other things.</p>

               <p>I was at the Old Bailey last Sessions; Mr. Clark came up to me, and said there were some coiners in my parish, and asked me, as being constable of the parish, to go with him; I went with him to this street, I think it is called Britannia-street; it is near Bagnigge-wells; Mr. Clark, Mr. Bryant, Mr. Heley, and I, went together, a gentleman's servant went with us, with a great coat, whip, and pair of boots; Mr. Clark gave him a letter, and bid him knock at the door, under pretence of asking for a person; the door was opened by Mrs. Horner; while he was speaking to Mrs. Horner, Mr. Bryant and I rushed by him; Mrs. Horner cried out, Master, four distinct times; we immediately rushed up to the garret; when we came almost to the landing-place of the garret, Askew was down one step or two; he had a cheque shirt on, his sleeves were tucked up, his collar was unbuttoned, he had no garters, his breeches knees were loose, and, if I remember right, the flap of his shirt was out before, and his hands excessive dirty, as if he had been working in some sand, or something of that kind: Bryant laid hold of him; I ran into the room to the other people, and we tied their hands; they wanted to wash their hands, we would not let them; the other prisoner ran out of the back into the fore room; we tied both of their hands there; Bissell's hands were very dirty and whitish. When I told Askew that Mr. Clark was there, he said, I would not have minded if all the men in England had taken me, if it had not been Mr. Clark; Clark blamed him, and asked him how he could do so; he said, He could not help it, it was now too late to talk about it; Mr. Clark shook his head, and said, O Tom, Tom, how could you do so! Mr. Clark, said he, it is over, and I cannot help it; Mr. Clark said, now, Tom, be candid, do show us where the things are; we searched the fore room, we found every implement that was there as was described by the other witness; then said Askew, If you will come along with me I will shew you where they all are; we went into a back room; there was a wide large chest, upon which were files, scouring-paper, and some shillings and six-pences, and upon the floor on the right hand side going in, there was, I believe, a hundred shillings, six-pences, and half-crowns; I saw likewise the aqua fortis: there was a crucible on the fire red hot, whether there was metal in it or no I could not be certain, as it was thrown on one side; I found some sand, which was broke up, that was hot; there were some moulds that the flasks had been fixed in; there were some files, scouring-paper, and a little pipkin with some wet stuff prepared, and there was another bason of water in the room of a green colour; Mr. Clark put his hand into that, and took out some shillings and six-pences: there was a scrubbing-brush lay down by the side of it.</p>

               <p>Did you see any forge? - That was in the fore room; it is not properly a forge, it is the same the refiners use on purpose to melt in.</p>
               <p>What quantity of counterfeit money did you see in both rooms? - I believe twelve half-crowns, and half a hat full of shillings; I found three shillings on Mrs. Horner, which were good; I asked her why she gave a report to Mr. Askew that we were coming? she said she thought she had a just right so to do.</p>

            ; Bryant and Evans were at that time up stairs in the garret; they called me up; when I came up I saw the two men prisoners: Mr. Askew was in a cheque shirt, and an old pair of breeches, his stockings were about his heels, and he had on a pair of slippers; he was rather in a sweat; his hands were daubed all over with a sort of mould that was found in the room; the other man had a handkerchief tied round his head, his stockings were down: he was taken down into the one pair of stairs to tie up his stockings, and he begged to be washed, which was refused<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220048"></xptr> him; at that time his hands were the same as the other: Bissell's hands were green.</p>
               <p>How came they so? - I fancy by handling metal, or something of that sort: we went into the front garret first, there I found a furnace, some call it a forge; it is an air furnace which they melt metal in; a crucible on the fire, with some metal in it, two pair of flasks, some sand in a box which is here, warm; there was a quart pan with some water, and by the side of that was a tea-cup with something green in it; it appeared to be aqua-fortis and water.</p>
               <p>You call that pickle, don't you? - We do; there was a bottle with aqua-fortis; in the quart pan I found these three counterfeit shillings (producing them): I begged Askew would not give me any trouble, but shew me where all the things were; then he took me into the back garret adjoining to the other; the first things I saw in the back garret were three files, and other things (producing them) a bottle of aqua-fortis: these flasks are made use of in casting; whatever is cast, in making the first part of the mould sand is laid, the sand itself is of a porous nature, and would leave it spongy if cast in sand alone, but here is some facing, which, when put upon it, fills up the pores of the sand, and strengthens it, and it is cast much smoother.</p>
               <p>Court. Can these flasks be applied to any other purpose than that of coining money? - Yes; they can be used in the silversmiths business.</p>
               <p>Court. Then all we understand from it is, that these flasks are used for coining silver, but may be applied to other purposes? - Yes; searching Bissell's person I found these two shillings (producing them) and here are two six-pences.</p>
               <p>Are these bad shillings? - They are, and the six pences are bad; he had these in his pocket: in the back garret where all these things were, I found these finished shillings; and here is the metal that was in the paper; here are the files, they have something white in the teeth, but that may be done with something else; all the words that passed that I heard was, Askew said he wished we had not come so soon, if we had been half an hour later, it would all have been over; that he did not intend to coin any more, for he had took a house in Smithfield, and paid ten guineas earnest; Bissell said he came to help him move his goods: there were no goods there to carry away; there was only a great trunk or box which they worked upon by way of a work bench.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Mrs. Horner? - Not any thing particular; her hands were examined, they were green, the same as Bissell's were.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I believe you are a silversmith? - I am more in the cane head way; I have worked in both.</p>
               <p>Are you skilled in the casting of silver and other metals? - I am.</p>
               <p>You have given an account that these flasks may be used in casting other metals besides coining; I suppose your knowledge goes so far as to know that every tool produced here may be used for many other purposes besides coining? - Every thing besides the money.</p>

            , a little better than half a year ago.</p>
               <p>Court to EVANS. Was there any bed in any of the garrets? - No, nor any kind of furniture as I saw; I believe I was in every room of the house.</p>

               <p>I am a monier belonging to the mint: this money is very bad, there can be no doubt; if you rub them on a bit of sand you see they are copper immediately; they are all of them very bad; the best not worth above two-pence or a penny a piece (one shewn him); I have seen several; this is as good as any of them, and it is as bad as bad can be.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Whether that very bad shilling, which is as bad as bad can be, strongly resembles the current coin of this kingdom? - They are so covered, I frequently take them myself by candlelight.</p>
               <p>To CLARK. Whether they were not duller than they are now when you found them, and not so much like the current coin? - They were more like the current coin.</p>
               <p>ASKEW's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>To the best of my knowledge there was no such thing as a had shilling in the house.</p>
               <p>BISSELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The reason of my being at Askew's house was, he asked me to help him remove his goods.</p>

               <p>I kept Mr. Askew's house; if he did any thing amiss it was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Askew called five witnesses, two of whom said he dealt in steel chains, and all of them gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Bissell called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

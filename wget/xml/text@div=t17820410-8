            . The 28th of last month I met with Mr. Burn, a servant under my master, I went with him to Goswel-street, with a cart that belongs to Mr. Preston, we set our cart at the place called the gulley-hole at Mr. Ratcliff's, we stopped at the bell ale-house a little below; we left our cart while Burn went in for money, while we were in the house they took the cart and horses away, Collier and Birch came out together, after we had weighed our rags, the prisoners joined us at the ale-house, we went out all together, Burn said let one go one way, the other the other, to see if we can find our cart and horses that are lost, accordingly Mr. Burn went off, I know the prisoner very well, I have drank with them, Burn knew them as well as I did; we went to look for the cart and horses, they crossed the street, to the hat opposite Charter-house-wall, there stood this dray, the fore horse was on one side and hooked upon one side, Collier went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100016"></xptr> and unhooked the horse and rode him to Clerkenwell-Green, Collier got off and Birch got on, there were none but Birch and him, I followed, then Burn went to look for the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>He turned another way from us, as soon as he came out of the house Collier unloosed the fore horse of that dray, got upon him and rode him to Clerkenwell-Green, I might be nine or ten yards from the dray when he took the horse off, at Clerkenwell-Green, when I came there Collier got off and told Birch to get on, he did and rode down Turnmill-street, they came back again and found our cart, and they tied on the horse to the tail of the cart.</p>
               <p>Did not you go and offer this horse for sale? - No, they stopped much about the pitch of the hill, on Clerkenwell-Green, I don't know that they went to any house there, Collier got off there and Birch got on, they went down Turnmill-street, they stopped on coming back, when they found our two horses and the cart, they tied this horse to the tail; and they drove it to Mr. Paris's house, what they said I don't know; his house is in Ray-street, Clerkenwell, they might stay there three or four minutes, it was only Birch and Collier, when they had left Paris, they tied the horse on and drove the cart to Bloomsbury, Burn came to us, I said they would get themselves into trouble and advised them to untie it, they did, Paris and some more men came up, and Collier ran away.</p>
               <p>You saw them take this horse and tye it to the cart and carry it to Paris, what did you think they meant to do with him? - I cannot tell, no good I thought, I don't know whether they took him to sell or no, I was afraid to stop them when they took it; I had not the sense or wit to tell any body about it. I only watch'd them, I advised them to take it to an Inn and the right owner might have it the next morning, I walked after them, Collier was at Clerkenwell-green sometime before I got to them.</p>

            . You went out to look at this horse that came to your door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Those two men were with them? - Two at the door and two at a distance, and a little farther off; I asked the price, they asked 35 s. I said I don't like it, and I will not have it at all, he halloed to one of the others to know what he would take, there were two at the door and two more appeared to be in company, I did not think I was safe in stopping them.</p>
               <p>They appeared to be all of the same company? - I understood so.</p>
               <p>About five or six minutes before we stopped the cart, for me to take the horse away, they all four stopped, I went to the watchman who denied lending us a hand, after I looked round the horse, I did not like him, and I went in again, I was not out two minutes, I then determined to follow them, and went out again directly. They were never out of my sight, I first saw the four together in Ray-street, about a hundred yards from my house, they went all together, the four men went all together up the hill with the cart.</p>
               <p>(Denmore called again.)</p>
               <p>Where did you stop them? - I ran as far as Theobald's Row, when I saw them together sometime, when we got up beyond Bloomsbury I told Paris to stop them, he said he would not till they got home; I crossed over, and then there were four or five talking together.</p>
               <p>When did you first see more than three men? - I did not see three men till I came to Bloomsbury; I only saw two when I saw Mr. Paris first, I believe there was one walked behind Paris, when they came opposite Bloomsbury they cast up and they all met together, and stood talking, and I went to the watchman, and I said the horse was stole, for they came to offer it to sale, the watchman said they did not affront him and he would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>To Paris. Was it before or after Dinmore joined you, you saw four men together with the cart? - Before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker.

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother-in-law, and was rowing the boat with him on the 19th of May—I do not know whether it was a licensed boat, it belonged to his father—the prisoner is a waterman—I do not know whether he is licensed—I cannot say how many persons were on board—as we were rowing out from the stairs, a steam-boat was going from Fishmongers'-pier, a dumb lighter laid against London-bridge wharf, then another boat, another dumb lighter, and the Diamond, which nearly occupied the navigation of the first arch, it was impossible for any steamer to go out with safety—the instant we struck against the steam-boat, my brother told them to sit still, but they all rose up—if they had sat still, no doubt they would all have been saved—had not the steam-boats been there the accident would not have happened—the current took all power from us, it took the boat away—the steam-boat coming from Fishmongers'-pier caused the swell, and took all power from us—it was about two yards from the bridge, and the distance of the bridge from our boat—the stern of the boat nearly touched the bridge—the steam-boat moved from the bridge at the time we moved—it left a great swell, which drove us against the Diamond—the navi<lb></lb>gation of the arch being stopped up made the swell the greater—the best waterman on the river could not have helped it.</p>

I am beadle of the Watermen's Company—I have seen the boat in question—it was not licensed—if it had been it would have been licensed to hold four persons besides the waterman—it ought to have the number of persons for which it was licensed painted on a conspicuous part—it had not so—she was owned by the prisoner's father—the prisoner was apprenticed to his father, who is a licensed waterman, but had not a license for this boat—he would lawfully have charge of a boat as an apprentice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Thames-police. On Sunday evening, the 19th of May, I was at Fresh Wharf, rather below bridge, and saw the defendant in a skiff, close to the stairs, with thirteen or fourteen children in the boat—he had the management of it—there was a number chalked on it, but not painted, and no owner's name—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it out with the scull, not sitting down to row, and the rush of the tide through the arch drove her athwart the Diamond steam-boat's bow—I saw no swell—the boat was laying in the eddy—there were two or three standing up—it was not any swell caused it, it was the rushing of the tide through the arch—I had seen a steamer go up some time before—I did not see one move from Fishmongers'-pier—the tide carried her against the steamer that was moored—I succeeded in saving two children, and three more were dragged out.</p>

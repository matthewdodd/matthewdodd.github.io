On Sunday, the 15th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I and my wife went out; I have a room on the first floor, and a room over that, as a work-shop; the house is all let out to different lodgers; the landlord does not live in it; the prisoner lives in a room on the first floor also, and passes as a married woman; her husband lives with her. I locked my room-door when I went out, and put the key in my pocket, leaving nobody in the room; I have no family; we came home together about ten o'clock at night, and found the door open - I examined it, and could find no marks of violence on it; I am certain I locked it, for I tried it afterwards - when I got into the room, every thing in the drawers laid so smooth I thought nothing was gone - I went to bed, and next morning, about seven o'clock, my wife called me from the work-shop, and gave me some empty loose papers, which had contained the spoons and sugar-tongs - I then searched another drawer myself, which I had put two watches into two or three days before, and found them gone also - I searched the prisoner's room on the Tuesday night, in the presence of her husband; she was then in custody - I found four pieces of cloth, but nothing else - I had no officer with me; I tried the key of her room-door, and found it opened mine, and the key of my work-shop would also open it - I believe the drawer was left unlocked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does the landlord live in the house? A. No; I rent one half; another person another; the prisoner's husband had one half - I spoke to her husband when I came home; I do not know whether she was at home; I did not then know of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of her going to the Police-office, to complain? A. She threatened to do it for my taking her character away; she was taken on the Tuesday morning; I discovered the robbery on Monday morning; I searched her room after I had found the plate in pawn.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you speak to the prisoner that night? A. I did not see her - I do not know whether she was in the house when I went out; the spoons laid at the bottom of the drawer when I last saw them.</p>

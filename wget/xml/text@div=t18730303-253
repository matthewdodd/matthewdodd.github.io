I live at Gales Gardens, Bethnal Green—I am a carpenter and secretary to the Perseverance Birmingham Society—we met at the Crown and Anchor public-house, Temple Street, Hackney—the defendant was the landlord of that public-house since 1868—he was appointed treasurer of the society in 1868, and he has acted in that capacity up to December, 1872—we have certain rules, and when he became treasurer I gave him a copy of the rules—I have got my book here—I paid money to the defendant from time to time—the entries are all initialed by him—I have paid him 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. last year—I have paid him that from time to time, and his receipt is here—I paid him 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the course of the year 1872; that was the total amount left in his hands; that is the balance—Brown, whose signature is here, was his servant; he received for the defendant when he was not there—money had been paid to sick members, but 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the amount which he received after we had paid bills and everything—we arrange as to what payments shall be made, and the net cash goes into the treasurer's hands, that makes 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd altogether now in his possession—I spoke to him on 10th December—I told him that I had heard he was going to leave his house on the 17th, and he said "Yes, he was"—I said "Will you be able to square up with me, Mr. Clark, the day before the 16th?"—on the Monday night that would be—he said "Never mind, it will be right enough, I will square up on the club night"—that was the 17th—the 17th arrived, but he did not come—I saw him again on the 18th at the place he had moved to in the next street—we asked him then for the money—two of the trustees were with me, Diggins and Patterson—we asked him for the money, and he said he had not got it—he said we must go to his security (bond), and we went to his bond, and he said he would have nothing at all to do with it, Mr. Clark must pay his own debts—Mr. Clark said he had not got a farthing—I have not received any <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—lie had no authority to deal with the money. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If they had let me alone, I should have made it up.</p>

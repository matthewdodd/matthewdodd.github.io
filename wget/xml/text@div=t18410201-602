                  </hi>. I am master of a barque lying at Mr. Curling's, at Limehouse. The prisoner was employed by me, and was directed to bring the nails on board from day to day—on the 7th of January I missed 2cwt. of composition nails—I instructed Johnson to bring these nails on board, but there were none taken on board since the 2nd of January that I know of.</p>

I observed the prisoner Gregory, when about thirty yards from me, come into the road. When he came near me, he presented a pistol, and said, D - n your eyes, stop! I looked at him, meaning to take an opportunity to run from him. Then there came two more, and laid hold of the skirts of my cloaths. Then Stevenson came up, and came between me and the man who had the pistol at my head, and went to take the buckles out of my shoes. I told him they would be of no use to him; for they were plated. They asked me for my money: I said I had none. They then asked me for my tick, by which I understood my watch; for I had heard of the word before. I said I had none. I had, previous to that, suspecting I might be stopped, taken it out of my fob, and put it into my breast. They ordered me to stand still. I did. Upon which the two men on each side me rubbed me down on each side, and behind and before me; when I felt the men feeling at my breast, where my watch was.</p>

               <p>Which felt at your breast? - The two other persons that kept behind me, and pulled me close back. I shifted the position of my head, to look at them; and then they said, D - n your eyes, you b - r, stand still! The man at my left side felt my watch; he said, D - n your eyes, I have got his watch! did not you say you had no watch about you? I said,</p>

               <p>"I did not understand you, gentlemen." Then I was ordered to go on, and not look backwards. I went several steps, eight or nine, or more. I was then holloa'd to by Stevenson. I knew him perfectly. He said, D - n your eyes, stop; and do not look back: he said, Take your buckles. I put my hand behind me, and he put my buckles into m y hand.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you lose in all? - All the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them.)</p>

               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing the persons of either of the men who robbed you? - Yes, the person who stopped me; I had an opportunity of seeing him: and the man who gave me my buckles I had an opportunity of seeing. I looked at him, and then he bad me not look back.</p>

               <p>How soon after this did you see the prisoners? - On the Monday morning following I saw them at the Justices' Office, in Bow-street. I went on the Sunday to Litchfield-street, to give an information. Mr. Fletcher desired me to come on Monday morning, and he would write out an advertisement, which he did, offering a reward of three guineas for my watch. While I was there, a person came in, and said, You have no need to trouble yourself; for I believe the four men are taken, and are in Bow-street. I went to Bow-street. I was ordered to look round. The first man I saw was Stevenson, with an hand-brush in his hand. I said, He is the man that took my buckles out.</p>

               <p>Was he among other people? - Yes, I suppose there were forty. Mr. Bond said, Move about: I then saw Stevenson. I said, That is the man that robbed me. There were a parcel of men and women sitting upon a bench, but he was in the further corner.</p>

               <p>Have you ever seen any of your property since? - None but a small pocket-handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Have you any doubt as to the persons of either of the prisoners? - Not the least doubt: I am perfectly clear.</p>

               <p>Stevenson. When he was at Bow-street, he charged Gregory with pulling his hat over his eyes.</p>

               <p>Court. Is that so? - Yes; and he did do so.</p>

               <p>When I went up to Bow-street, this lad's breakfast was brought, and the handkerchief with it. Mr. M'Mahon said, I believe that is my handkerchief. Directly the other gentleman laid hold of it, and said, Look at it, and see if you know it. He looked at it, and said, It is mine. Before the justice, he said he knew it by an hole. When the robbery was done, I was at home with my father by ten o'clock.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a spectacle-maker, in Black-horse alley. The prisoner is my son. He is apprenticed with me. He was at work all day long. A little after eight o'clock he went out. He came home a little after ten, eat a bit of supper, and went to bed: that is the whole truth of the matter. He never went out of doors afterwards. As I hope to be saved, he was in bed before eleven, with me.</p>

               <p>Was you in bed before your son returned? - I had just got into bed; and I told the justice so before I knew he was in custody.</p>

               <p>How do you know it was your son returned then? - I know my son when I see him.</p>

               <p>Did you see him? - Yes; he lies in the same room with me. There was nobody in the house to let him in but us. Two of the doors are always open. Another son of mine keeps the house. He lives in another house. He rents the whole place. There are two houses in the court: he rents them both. Only the prisoner and I live in this house.</p>



               <p>What is your other son's Christian name? - Thomas.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>

               <p>How do you know that was the night? - Because he was out the Sunday night. They came to me on Monday morning, and were going to take two pewter plates I have had these seven years, and take me to the justice. It was the very Monday following after the Saturday they came and asked me after my son. He searched my apartment, and found nothing but what was my own.</p>

               <p>Had not the prisoner an apartment in Chick-lane? - He has no apartment but mine.</p>

               <p>Jellous. We found him a bed on Saffron-hill.</p>

               <p>Has not he an apartment on Saffron-hill? - None at all.</p>

               <p>Did you attend before the magistrate? - Yes, and said the very same words I do now.</p>

               <p>Did you see Jellous there? - I do not remember him. I believe he is not one that came into my apartment. I know the two men that were going to take my plates away.</p>

               <p>When you were examined before the justice, do you recollect this circumstance, that you said you did not know whether your son was in in the night, but when you waked in the morning, you found him in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110107"></xptr> bed with you? - No; he came home a little after ten, on Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Stevenson. On Sunday I had my dinner with my father, and went out, and staid a little later than ordinary: a young fellow said, You may as well lay with me. On Monday morning that gentleman came up, and took me out of bed.</p>

               <p>To Jellous. Was you present at Bow-street when the father attended? - I was. The old man was very candid. Justice Wright asked him particularly about his son. He said, that on Saturday night he went to bed, and when he 'waked in the morning he found his son in bed with him.</p>

               <p>I live in George-court, Union-court, Holborn. Gregory lodged in our house, on and off, about two months.</p>

               <p>Did you hear of his being charged with this robbery? - He was taken out of our house on the Monday morning; I can't say what month it was, but between the hours of six and seven. On the Saturday before, he came in, to the best of my knowledge, between ten and eleven o'clock: it did not exceed eleven. I was at supper when he came home.</p>

               <p>Can you positively swear to the time? - I can't swear to a minute, under or over: it did not exceed eleven. The chandler's shop is always shut at eleven: it was then open, when he came home; and the person he brought home with him went and fetched some small beer.</p>

               <p>Do you know Stevenson? - No.</p>

               <p>Gregory. I am charged with an handkerchief the person I live with borrowed of you.</p>

               <p>Correy. The young woman that lives with this young man came to me on Monday morning, and borrowed a handkerchief of me to the round his breakfast.</p>

               <p>Had she no handkerchief of her own? - She was poor in cloaths: I do not believe she had.</p>

               <p>How did you come by that handkerchief? - I have got several of the same that I bought in Rag-fair.</p>

               <p>Did he borrow a red and white one of you? - Yes; I bought that and these two blue and white ones, in Rag-fair, together, about five or six weeks ago: I gave a shilling for them.</p>

               <p>To Prosecutor. Was there any mark on the handkerchief to which you swear? - No; only the size of it, and the hole near the centre.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>

               <p>The handkerchief that was borrowed of you had no mark on it? - None in particular.</p>

               <p>How came you to go so far as Rag-fair for them? I understand Union-court leads into Field-lane: you may buy them very cheap there. - I was going through Rag-fair: it is very uncommon for me to buy them in that way.</p>

               <p>What makes you recollect the man being at home that day? - After this man came, I recollected he came home, and the woman he lived with went and fetched him some small-beer.</p>

               <p>What sort of a house is yours? - A lodging-house for any body that wants a lodging.</p>

               <p>They come at all hours? - No; never after twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>How often do you recollect Stevenson's calling there? - I do not recollect his calling there at all.</p>

               <p>Did you put this Saturday night down? - No.</p>

               <p>How came you to recollect it was Saturday night? - Because the chandler's shop was open.</p>

               <p>It was open, I suppose, on Friday night, till eleven o'clock? - No; they do not keep open so late, only on a Saturday night.</p>

               <p>What business is Gregory? - I cannot tell: he came in of a night, and went out in the morning.</p>

               <p>What is he? - He used to work in the market, when he could: he has the dropsy now, and is under Dr. Pitcairne's hands.</p>

               <p>Where was he when the prisoner came in? - He was in bed; he went to bed soon after he came in.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, did he sit down and eat any supper with you? - Upon my word, I can't say whether he eat or no.</p>

               <p>Did the girl sit down to supper with you? - I do not know: they came in together.</p>

               <p>Did not he send for a pot of porter to treat you? - No; he sent out for some small beer.</p>

               <p>You did not ask him to eat? - No.</p>

               <p>Was there nobody else in company with them? - No.</p>

               <p>Are there no other lodgers in the house? - They come in at night, and go out in the morning.</p>

               <p>No fixed lodgers? - No; they come in of a night, and go out in the morning.</p>

               <p>Court. If any person comes of a night that you don't know, do you let them have a lodging? - Yes.</p>

             the night before he was taken up? - At our house, the night before he was taken up, I believe; I can't say much about that. He was at home on Saturday night.</p>

               <p>You remember Saturday night very well? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Why can you speak of a Saturday night more than any other night in the week? - Because on Saturday night, when he came home, we had some peas and bacon for supper.</p>

               <p>What time did the prisoner come in? - I believe between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>What company were there? - He came in by himself.</p>

               <p>Who was in the room? - Me and my wife.</p>

               <p>Any body else? - No; I believe not: I can't call to mind any body else.</p>

               <p>What makes you particular as to the time? why might it not be twelve o'clock, as well as between ten and eleven? - Because he wanted some beer, and a woman fetched a pint of beer for him: she could not have got it if it had been later.</p>

               <p>How do you know it was Saturday night? - Because we had peas and bacon. We asked him to eat some peas; and he took a spoon and eat some, and then sent for some small-beer.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>

               <p>You had peas and bacon for supper? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What meat had you besides? - I don't recollect any.</p>

               <p>Don't you recollect the cold blade-bone of mutton? - Yes, I do recollect it; we had a blade-bone of mutton.</p>

               <p>Do not you recollect the woman being angry at his sitting down and eating with you, and your not inviting her? that you did not ask her to sit down? - No.</p>

               <p>Was not she very angry, and abused your wife about it? - They had a word or two, but I do not know what it was about.</p>

               <p>Did not he treat you with a pot of porter by way of making you all friends? - I do not recollect that we had any porter afterwards.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110109"></xptr>You let lodgings to any body that comes? - If they ask for a lodging, I let it to them.</p>

               <p>How much a single bed? - Sixpence.</p>

               <p>If they come double, a shilling? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the bargain of handkerchiefs your wife bought in Field-lane, Chick-lane? - I do not know where she bought them, whether there or in Rag-fair: there were a couple of red ones; and another, I believe, a blue one.</p>

               <p>Did you take notice of the handkerchiefs? (shewing the witness an handkerchief) Do you think that was one of them? - There was a hole in one of them.</p>

               <p>How long had she had it in her possession? - Some time.</p>

               <p>Two months? - No; I believe, not so long as two months.</p>

               <p>How much short of it? - About six weeks ago, as near as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>Do you believe that to be one? - It was very much like that: I do not know that this is the handkerchief, because there was a hole in both of the red handkerchiefs, I believe.</p>

               <p>You are sure there were two red and one blue, and a hole in each of the red ones: there is no hole in this handkerchief; how came that about? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Is this the handkerchief? (shewing him another) - That is very much like one of them.</p>

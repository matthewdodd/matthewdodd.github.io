                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 6, Bell Court, Gray's Inn Road—I have known the prisoner about two years—I have been to the Sussex Hotel several times, and have seen him there—on Wednesday, 26th August, I met him in Fleet Street, and he went home with me—on the following day, the 27th, he asked me for a pen and ink—I saw him place some stamps in an envelope—he told me they were genuine articles, and if they came off all right he would make me a present—he left me on Thurs<lb></lb>day—before he left I agreed to meet him on the Friday, at 10 o'clock, at the Old Bell, in Holborn—he gave me a pocket-book and some stamps before he left—there were about sixty-nine stamps of different kinds—I afterwards gave the pocket-book and stamps to the police—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

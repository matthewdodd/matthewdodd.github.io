               <p>Q. Where did you put them before you went away? - I left them in the taproom; in a little corner where they keep their pots to dry, I laid them there, and she told me they would be safe till I came back again, then I was gone about an hour and a half, while I was out one of my companions said, she would go to her mother-in-law, and the other said, she would go to her father's, and left me; a gentleman saw me in the street very distressed and he gave me six-pence, and I gave it to somebody in the street to shew me the way back again, this was just before dark.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing from this time, from half past twelve? - I could not find my way back, they went to see for lodgings with me.</p>

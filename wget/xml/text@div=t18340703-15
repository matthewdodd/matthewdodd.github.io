I got into an omnibus in the Strand, on the 24th of May - the prisoner Dowling got into the same omnibus, and sat next to me, on the right hand side; and in about two minutes he went to the opposite, and soon after English got in, and sat next to me on the same side, the right side - there was not sufficient room for him, but he thrust himself in - he observed that he expected a friend in, and went to the opposite side of the coach - there was plenty of room on the other side - he unnecessarily crowded me - another person came in, and he also sat by me- there was still more room on the opposite side - there were only two persons on my side, but there was not room, because we sat close together - an elderly woman was next to me at first - the third person rode about 100 yards and then wished to get out - upon that English observed that it was very warm, and he should get out - he stopped the omnibus and got on the steps, and then the conductor asked me if I had lost any thing - I said I had not at first, but I put my hand into my right hand pocket, and missed my purse - the conductor charged English with having my purse, and stopped him - he denied having it, got down and ran away - while this was going on, Dowling said he wanted to get out - I pulled him back by the advice of the conductor, and then he did not attmept to get away - my purse was safe two minutes before I got into the omnibus - there were two sovereigns, and 12s. or 14s. in silver in it - I cannot exactly tell the silver - it was a green silk purse - I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it very warm in the omnibus? A. It was a very warm day - I did not think the omnibus particularly warm - there were not more than three males, and two ladies besides myself, and a boy in it - there was my daughter on the opposite side to me, and an elderly woman and the two prisoners on the opposite side - I could have gone to the other side if I was incommoded - there was no conversation going on - it was on English's going out that the charge was made - he was the second that went out.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were in an omnibus, and a charge of robbery was made in it, should not you be very glad to get out? A. Undoubtedly I should - Dowling was searched - nothing was found on him - I saw no communication whatever between them.</p>

            . I am conductor of the Blackwall omnibus, No. 5,332. I was in the Strand - the prosecutrix and another female got in - there were two women in before this occurred - the prosecutrix got in at the Red Lion in the Strand, and English about forty yards further - he sat on the left hand side of the other lady - he did not sit near the prosecutrix - that I saw - Dowling, when he got in, sat close to the prosecutrix - he took off his hat and had his handkerchief in his hat, close to the lady - I did not observe him change sides - one gentleman got out at Shoe-lane, who had got in shortly after the prosecutrix - he was the third man that got in - I perceived something in his left hand like a purse - he put his hand in his right hand pocket to pull out a 6d. to pay me - I went on a little, and directly after English went to get out, and seeing the man with the purse in his hand excited my suspicions - and English getting out so shortly afterwards, I said to the lady, "Have you lost any thing?" she said, "No;" but on feeling, said her purse was gone - I stopped English on the steps - he gave me half-a-crown to take his fare - I had not change - he said, "I have smaller change in my pocket" - I said I must detain him for the robbery in the omnibus - he went down Shoe-lane - I called to the coachman, who got off, and went down Shoe-lane and secured him - English ran off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030016"></xptr>leaving the half-crown in my hand, without waiting for his change - he ran about forty yards slowly - I ran after him rather fast, and caught him - the fare was 6d. - when I said I must detain him, he said he had business to attend to - he did not wait for his change - he was given into custody of Martin - Dowling remained in the omnibus till we came down Shoe-lane, when I gave them both into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. People get out when they like, do not they? A. Yes; and sometimes if they see a companion in the street - English was not on the same side as the prosecutrix at all - I peep into the omnibus now and then, and see where the different people sit - I did not see the other man hold any communication with any body - seeing Dowling sit close to the lady, made me take notice of them, and seeing the other gentleman and the two prisoners all three getting in so close together - they all got in within forty yards of one another - I suspected something when I saw the purse - it was not in my thoughts at the moment I saw the purse in the man's hand - the omnibus went on after the gentleman got out with the purse in his hand, as far as St. Bride's church, about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you help ladies into the omnibus when they get in? A. Yes - I did not help this lady in; I stood on my place - there was another omnibus near - I had the door in my hand - the other omnibus was only going to the bank - the prosecutrix was going to the Commercial-road - she stopped us - I was not searched - I have been conductor to the omnibus two years - if twenty or fourteen persons had been in the omnibus, I should have stopped every one of them if I had suspicion - I saw something like a purse in the man's hand - it was green - I did not say that before the magistrate - I never heard the lady say it was green, before she said it here - I was not asked the question before, and I was so flurried by the prisoner's solicitor, I hardly knew what I was about - the solicitor did not ask me the colour of the purse - I am sure I did not mention another colour there.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you happen to remark the purse in the man's hand? A. It was strange, he having a purse in his hand, should put his hand in his pocket to pull out silver - I suspected it was not right - the prisoners did not hold any communication with the man to my knowledge - I cannot tell who robbed the lady - he might have done it unknown to the prisoners - English was the man who attempted to get away, when I charged him with being concerned in the robbery.</p>
               <p>MRS. BROWN re-examined. There might have been one half-crown in my purse, but not more, I am sure.</p>

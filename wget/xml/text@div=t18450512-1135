                  </hi>. I deal in coals, and live at Edmonton. On the 15th of April I had been to London for a load of coals—I got at far as the Hare and Hounds at Newington on my return, about two o'clock—I saw the prisoners sitting by the side of each other at the Hare and Hounds, having bread and cheese and porter—I left there about three o'clock—they had left before I did—when I got on to Stone Lee I saw Wright by herself—I went on about a hundred yards further to Bruce-grove, and then taw them together—Hall left, and went into a grocer's shop—Wright went on ahead—she was about twenty yards from the shop—when Hall came out they joined together—Hall took something from bis pocket and handed to Wright out of a paper—they went on together, and when I got to Tottenham I informed the police, who accompanied me down the road to the White Horse, where Wright was taken—I know Mrs. Bourne's shop at Stone Lee, and I suspect Hall was in that shop when I saw Wright standing about twenty yards from it by herself—when Wright was taken she was alone, but she screamed "Murder!" and Hall came up to her assistance, and he was taken at the tame time—we could not ascertain whether he came from the public-house or the stationer's shop.</p>

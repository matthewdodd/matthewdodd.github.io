                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of 13, Alfred-place—on Saturday night, 14th May, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was coming out of the Sir Isaac New<lb></lb>ton public-house, Kilburn, and just as I got off the step I received a blow—Wood seized my watch-guard and twisted it round his hand—I hallooed out, and Wornham came over and struck me, as did several others not in custody—I stuck to Wood and held him ten minutes, but he got away and ran about fifty yards, when I knocked him down, and kept him for half an hour before I gave him in custody—he had passed the watch away to somebody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an errand-boy, and live at 13, Alfred-place, Kilburn—I was standing at the door of the Sir Isaac Newton public-house, and saw the prisoners there—Mr. Cock came out and Wood snatched at his watch<lb></lb>chain twice, and then ran to the fence—they got Cock down, and Wornham kicked him—Mr. Cock then hit him, and Wornham said, "I will fight you"—he said, "No, I have got a case in hand"—he hit Mr. Cock, who let go of his prisoner, but caught him again—I saw the watch in his hand, but did not see him pass it.</p>

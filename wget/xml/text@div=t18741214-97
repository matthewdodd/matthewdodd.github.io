                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London Bankruptcy Court—I produce the proceedings in the bankruptcy of James William Oliver, of 12, High Holborn—the date of the petition for adjudication is 17th April, 1874, and he was adjudged bankrupt on 8th May—on 2nd June Mr. Robert Bagg was appointed trustee—the proceedings include a statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt on the 2nd June—that shows unsecured creditors 674<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as sets 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which are made up of book debts 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and cash in hand 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bankrupt was examined on the 25th June, and there is an order for his prosecution dated 5th November—there is an order on the proceedings for him to file and cash goods, and defi<lb></lb>ciency account on the 1st July; that was adjourned until the 15th, and then again until the 29th, and then till the 11th November—I see a memorandum of his non-attendance on 11th November.</p>

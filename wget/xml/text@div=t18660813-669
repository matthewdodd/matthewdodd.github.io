I am a widow, and keep a general fancy and tobacconist's shop in Fulham Road—on 28th June prisoner came and asked for half an ounce of tobacco—that was three halfpence—he gave me a shilling in payment—I gave him change—I retained the shilling in my hand—after he had left I looked at it and found it was bad—I did not put it in the till until I found it was bad—I kept it for three or four days till the constable came—there were no other shillings in the till where I put this—I marked the shilling—I spoke to the constable the same evening—he afterwards brought the prisoner with him—I did not see prisoner again till he was brought down to the shop on Monday or Tuesday, the 3rd of July, I think, I didn't mark the date—the officer brought him down and I iden<lb></lb>tified him immediately.</p>

I live" at 135, Homerton Street—on the evening of 17th October, I was at the Albion public-house, at about 11.50 or 11.55—the prisoners were in the same compartment—I took a sovereign out of my pocket in mistake for a shilling to pay for some ale—they could see it——I put it back into my pocket, pulled out a shilling, paid for the ale, drank it and came outside—I no sooner got outside them I received a blow in the eye, and one under the ear, and another in the mouth, and was knocked down' into the gutter—the knocked me about and kicked me—Burnam, a policeman, came up" and pulled Smith off me, and took him to the station—I went with him; I saw Fisher there—he was not taken at the same time—I charged Smith with assaulting me, and then I returned with a policeman—the public-house was closed; we were turning home and were in the Caledonian Road, and saw Fisher talking to a wench—I noticed that he had my hat on—it is a coal hat full of coal dust—I had Fisher's hat on—in the struggle I suppose he picked up mine and I his—I gave him in custody.</p>

On the evening of 17th October I was in Albion Street, Caledonian Road, about 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoners come outside the Albion public-house and stand one on each side of the doorway—Anderson came out directly after—I was about 3 yards away—Smith then struck Anderson and knocked him down, and Fisher also struck him and fell on him—Smith then threw himself across Fisher, on top of both of them—I took hold of Smith and tried to pull him off, and found his left hand in Anderson's right-hand trousers pocket-while on the ground Anderson said "You b———thieves, you are trying to rob me "—I did not hear any reply—I took Smith into custody—he said to Fisher <hi rend="italic">"Harry;</hi> you bolt; I'm caught"—Anderson then took out his purse and said "This is what you were after; this is my master's money," and shook it up in his face—I took Smith to the station and charged him—on returning with Anderson I found Fisher, with Anderson's hat on, standing talking to one of Smith's friends—I asked him how he became possessed of the hat—he said "Well, he has got my hat and I have got his"—I took hold of him—he said "I never tried to rob him; I only took hold of him by the whiskers."</p>

I I had not been there long, and was lying on the form, when prosecutor came in and said "Are you going to treat me?"I said "No." He said "I will toss you for a pint." We had a few words and then he struck me first and went outside and said he would fight me for a sovereign. My father and young woman pulled me away and put me against the wall Then prosecutor turned round and struck Fisher and knocked him down, and was atop of him, and the policeman came up and took me in custody, This is an old spite he has against me. They will not let me get an honest living. Because I will not go out watching for the detective of the Y division he has put constables to watch against us." <hi rend="italic">Fislier says:</hi> I was with this young man Smith. He had words with the man. He said he would fight him for half a sovereign, and both went outside. He knocked me down, and while he was over me I held him by his whiskers. As I got up some young man gave me the wrong hat, and as for attempting to rob prosecutor it was no such thing."</p>

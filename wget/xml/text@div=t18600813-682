                  </hi>. I am daughter to Mr. Leon, of 7, Upper Woburn-place—we had some coals of the Great Northern Coal Company—they amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a ticket had been left with them by the collector, after the coals had been delivered—in June last I was called into the hall to see somebody—I do not recollect the day—it was about the middle of June—I went into the hall and found the prisoner there—on seeing him he solicited orders for coals from the Great Northern Railway—I said we did not require any coals, and I would pay an account that was owing—he said that he had not called for the money—I said, no; but I would prefer paying him, and asked him if he had any bill with him—he said, no—I said that I had a bill with me and that he could receipt that—I paid him the money and saw him sign this receipt at the corner, "Paid, J. West, June 14th, 1856"—he left, after having signed that—I do not know the date when I saw him again—I was called out of bed on the next occasion, and on going down I found the prisoner and the policeman there—I did not go to the police-station at that time; I refused to go—I heard the prisoner speak at that time, and that added to my recollection of the man—I said I believed that he was the person—he was asked on that occasion, before he left, to give his address</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130019"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not ask him, I told the policeman to ask him, and he wrote his address—he wrote two addresses—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the papers that he wrote on that occasion—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Henry Jones, 33, Provost-street, Hoxton," "Henry Jones, 33, Provost-street, East-road, City-road")—I saw his writing on the first occasion when he wrote the receipt to that note—I have looked at this since; in my opinion it is the writing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Singleton-street, East-road, and am the wife of John William Pulley, a plumber and painter—I am a daughter of Mrs. Eastman—I remember going to the last Hampton races on 14th June—I am a relation of the prisoner—my mother-in-law is his wife's sister—the prisoner went in the van with us to Hampton races; we left between 8 and 9 in the morning, and got home just upon 12—he had a moustache at that time as he has now—he was in the habit of wearing it, and has worn it for a twelvemonth, I can swear to—I was with him and his wife on the course the best part of the time.</p>

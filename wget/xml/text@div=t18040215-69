               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving a gold hunting-watch from him? - A. Yes, this day fortnight; there was a seal to it, and a seal to my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when he gave you his watch to take home? - A. At nine o'clock at night, I was to take it home; it had a gold seal, with my master's coat of arms on it and a red ribbon; I put it in my left-hand breeches-pocket; then I went to a public-house, about ten o'clock, the Feathers, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your master live? - A. No. 30, Great Maddox-street; I met with the prisoner accidentally, I had seen him once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person there? - A. Another Swede; I am a Swede, and the prisoner is a Swede; we sat down and drank together, I paid for all the liquor; we drank five glasses of gin and water each.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any watch about you? - A. I had my own, and my master's; my master's is a gold hunting-watch, with a gold seal; mine is a silver watch, with a metal seal.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at this public-house? - A. Till one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out together? - A. Yes, me and the prisoner, and my friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your master's and your own watch about you? - A. I am quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you were very drunk? - A. I did not feel myself drunk in the house, the air took effect of me when I came out, that I could not recollect any thing but calling for a watchman in Leicester-square, and I recollect perfectly well knowing that I had both the watches in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Who called the watchman? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect missing your watches there? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You went home? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find yourself? A. I found myself in my own lodgings, in Upper Rathbone-place; I do not know whether I walked or rode there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you were rolling on the ground? - A. I cannot say whether I fell down, I remember having some words.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times you fell down or no, you cannot say? - A. I do not recollect that I fell down, my clothes were not dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you feel for the watches before you left the public-house? - A. I remember feeling for them, and looking at one before I went out, and I saw it was one o'clock when I went out.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you all drunk? - A. Yes; these two men, when they came in the air, could not stand; I was the best of all three; they went this way and the other; Captain Johnson's servant wanted something more to drink, and then they called a watchman, and a watchman came and asked us if we wanted to go and have some drink; the watchman told us of a place, as we could not find any open; then we got down to a public-house, and that made us worse; I could not see any difference, one was as bad as the other; Chamberry said, I have lost my watch.</p>

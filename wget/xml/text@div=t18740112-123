                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Wilson, a blacksmith, of 19, Chopping's Court—the prisoner had been living there from about a fort<lb></lb>night before Whitsuntide—he came first with one child, the boy, and the girl came afterwards, I can't say how long after—his wife was dead—he had been out of work some six or seven weeks prior to the death of the children—on Sunday, 23rd November, at a little after 12 o'clock, I had a con<lb></lb>versation with him—I had seen the children alive between 2 and 3 o'clock on the Saturday afternoon, the day before, in the front room first floor—on the Sunday, a little after 12 o'clock, the prisoner came down into my room on the ground floor, to go through; he did not say anything to me—I spoke to him and said "Now Parker, you must take those children and go to-morrow, for my husband is cross, he thinks I am doing too much"—he said "I will do so"—I said "I suppose you heard him last night"—he said "A little, ma'am"—(my husband and I had had a few words about keeping the children)—he said" I will do so;" and he went on to the threshold of the door—I said "You know you are not doing quite right"—he said "I will be back in five minutes"—he never returned—I went direct up into his room, directly he went from the door—I did not see where he went—I went up to take the children some food, it was all ready for them—I found the room door shut, which was very uncommon—I went in and found the children in bed, covered over, they had only their night gowns on—I turned the counterpane back—I called out "Oh, Mrs. Moore, the children don't move"—Mrs. Moore was down stairs, she came up, and I then looked at the children, I saw the little girl saturated with blood, I put the quilt down again and came out of the room, leaving them as I found them—I did not notice the pail, only the hand basin with blood in it—I went straight up into the room after having the conversation with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>—it was not arranged that I should find food for the children and he pay me for it—he had not work when he came to us; he got to work for Mr. Knight afterwards—he had no wife—I looked after the children when he was at work—I gave them food, but I had not anything for it, because he was not earning anything—I did not agree with him that I would provide for them; when he got to work I found food for them, and bought things, and he paid me for it on the Saturday, and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for looking after them, and cooking the food for him and them—when he came down stairs on the Sunday, I think it was about 12.15, I can't quite say the time—he had always been a kind father to the children while with me; he was always very kind, but most to the little boy, he was very fond of the little boy.</p>

I live at 13, Pearl Street, St. George's-in-the-East, and am the prisoner's sister—I remember my brother meeting with an accident when he was a lad of about ten years old—I cannot recollect what my right age was at that time; I am now forty—I cannot recollect the date of the accident, both mother and father being dead—it was at Cirencester—my brother was from about ten to fourteen at the time; I must have been between fifteen and sixteen; I am two years older than he is—I was living at home with my mother at the time when he was brought home—it happened through a coach-horse—he was between two, holding one in each hand—I was not there—he was brought home smothered in blood, and he had a serious cut on the top of the head; it caused him to keep to his bed for a considerable time—he was very dangerously ill; the doctor gave no hopes of his ever recovering—I saw him every day during his illness; I and my mother attended on him—he knew none of us for many days; he was not at all conscious—when he was recovering he always complained of a headache—I remember his enlisting in the Welsh Fusiliers—I can't tell the date—I know he was away for ten years in the Army—he went abroad part of the time, to India—he was there during the Indian mutiny; we received letters from him—he returned from India about eight or nine years ago—he was out in the Crimea—I don't know whether that was before or after he went to India—he lodged with me after he came from India—whilst he was there I remember his coming home on one occasion the worse for drink; a little overcame him—when he came home I told him of it; he would not retaliate much upon me, but he turned round into the passage and kicked against the wall violently, and likewise with his hands as well as his feet—the last time I saw him before this occurrence was on the Tuesday as it happened on the Sunday morning—he came into my place—very few words passed between us; he merely came in and out again—he seemed in a very low, desponding state, but I thought it was through his being out of work—I know that he had previously worked at Mr. Knight's—I frequently saw him during his married life; I often saw him in company with his wife and children—he was very kind indeed to his children, and wife, too—I was present at his wife's death—she was about thirty-eight years of age—she died on Easter Monday last—my brother seemed of late to be in a very low, desponding state of mind, but I thought it was from being out of work or being ill—he was very deaf, indeed, after he began to get about after the accident, but it gradually wore off; he was always a little deaf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the station-master at Swanbourne, Bucks—my wife is an aunt of the prisoner's—we have been married about forty years—about the year 1848 we were living at Woburn Sands—my wife was then very ill indeed, for a long time, and she was very low and desponding, and I was obliged to have her taken away from her family altogether—she was ill both in body and mind—she was attended as an out-patient at the Northampton Infirmary at the first outset, for some length of time—she was not attended by a medical man at home at that time, not till after she had left me; she was taken violently ill in 1848—it was about six months before we went to Woburn Sands that she was an out-patient at the North<lb></lb>ampton Infirmary; I was then living at the Weedon Station, near North<lb></lb>ampton—she was brought into a very low state of body by illness, and her mind was very much wandering as well—she was never violent—she was always very strange for a length of time, until I had her taken away from me, and after she was taken away I can't say what was the matter with her—I did not have a medical man to see her while she was with me—I am not aware that there is any medical man here who did see her—I consider that her illness at the first onset was rheumatic fever—she was very ill, and she was going on in very strange language, that the house was all on fire; and she got all my children out in the road one morning about four o'clock, and was praying with them; I could not do anything at all with her; I got some of my neighbours up, and got her into bed again, and got the clergy<lb></lb>man to come and see her; I did not have a doctor till the next day; it was Dr. Barker, I think, that attended to her, but she was taken away the next day by her sister, Mrs. Millard, to King's Langley—she was taken away on my own account; I wrote to her sister to say what a state she was in, and she came and took her back with her to King's Langley—Mr. Moore, the clergyman of the parish, was the gentleman that had her taken away.</p>

I live at 42, Drummond Street, Euston Square, and am aunt to the prisoner—I have a sister married to Mr. Hedges—whilst they were living at Woburn Sands, in 1848, I received a communication from Mr. Hedges, in consequence of which I went down there and saw my sister; I found her in a very melancholy state; she thought that every one was interfering with her, and finding fault with her, and she took her children out in the lane to kneel on the sands and pray to the moon—she was not at all violent—she could not eat, or drink, or sleep—I took her home with me to King's Langley—she would not mind what her husband said to her—she was about three weeks with me—I took her to Hemel Hemp-stead Infirmary, and she was there three days, and when I went to see her on the Sunday with my husband, the house surgeon said that I must take</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Gaol of Newgate—I have seen the prisoner daily since he has been confined in the gaol, since 1st December last—I have examined his head—there is a very distinct mark on the upper part of his head, in the shape of a horse-shoe, between four and five inches long, and an eighth of an inch wide, showing that there must have been a very violent external injury—there is no evidence of the bone having been injured—it was alleged to have taken place twenty-four years ago, I think—that injury would affect the brain at the time very decidedly, and that injury to the brain might or might not continue—if deafness followed upon that injury, the presumption would be that it was the result of it—I have had some experience in cases of insanity in this gaol for the last eighteen or nineteen years—lunatics very often reason logically, but the basis of their reasoning is very often quite false and delusive—the presence of skill and arrange<lb></lb>ment in an act does not necessarily imply that the act-is not an insane act in itself—when the brain is diseased, it may not show itself in permanent and continuous insanity, but in outbursts of mania from time to time; that is quite consistent—outbursts of mania may occur, although usually there is some indication of madness independently of and antece<lb></lb>dently to the acts of violence—insanity is so varied in its form that it would be difficult to give any particular indication of what may exist prior to an outbreak of acute mania—a melancholic disposition of mind is one which very often leads to acts of suicide as well as murder, and again persons may have certain delusions which prompt them to acts of violence—I think an unwillingness to avail oneself of the ordinary and natural means of pro<lb></lb>viding for one's daily livelihood, is an indication—a man not availing him<lb></lb>self of the ordinary means of living, when he has them at hand, that is a state of things that may accompany insanity—a man may be of a melan<lb></lb>cholic disposition and not be capable of doing anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that it shows that he did not know what he</p>

               <p>was doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is another matter—I believe there are many acts, the nature of which they know, but they cannot control; they are the victims of delusion—I will explain what I mean; if a man destroys those for whom he has shown kindness and affection, and does not seek to conceal the act, and then gives himself up, showing a perfect disregard of the consequences of the act as regards his own safety, I think those are indications of an unsound mind; the fact of his having no accomplices I attach very little importance to; I cannot imagine an insane man having any accomplices—I cannot enter into whether it shows that at the time he did the act he did not know what he was doing, or that what he was doing was wrong—I cannot speak of the state of a man's mind when I am not present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I would not go so far as to say that if a man kills his wife and gives himself up he is insane, and if he runs away he is sane—his giving himself up is not necessarily a proof of insanity—there is nothing about the prisoner to show that he is unfit to plead this morning—he has not given me any reason while he has been in Newgate to indicate that he is of unsound mind—he has been somewhat depressed, more than men usually are—I have seen him every day since 1st December.</p>

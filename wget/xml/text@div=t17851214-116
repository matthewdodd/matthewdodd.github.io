               <p>Mr. Silvester. Before we read that confession, was any thing said to him, to induce him to confess? - Nothing in the world, from any body living.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know whether Mr. Clark's apprentice had said any thing to him before? - No.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these trees? - They are fan yews, and sold at six shilling or seven shillings a piece, but they are worth three shillings a piece of an average, I think the value about six pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There were several of these trees cut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the age of the trees? - Some of them are twenty years old.</p>
               <p>Does yew ever grow to timber? - It grows a very large tree.</p>
               <p>Is it a timber tree? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140131"></xptr>Upon your oath, is it not a shrub? - It certainly is, I will answer for it to be a shrub.</p>
               <p>I believe it is a yew tree, do you call a yew tree that is twenty years old, a yew shrub? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would you call an oak of twenty years growth, if it was put in a shrubbery, a shrub? - No.</p>
               <p>You would however call a yew tree if it found its way into a shrubbery, a shrub? - Yes, if it found its way into a shrubbery.</p>
               <p>Court. I will tell you my idea, I rather think I am correct, I conceive that the description of the act of parliament is meant to comprehend all possible cases; first it discribes the particular species of trees that are usually denominated timber trees, and lest that denomination should not be likely to be compleat, it says, any timber tree, or tree likely to become timber; by the word shrub, I understand that which is of a nature that never would grow to a timber tree; by the word plant, I understand that which is in its infancy, as an oak plant, a beech plant, an elm plant; if they ever would grow up to trees, they are plants; if they would not they are shrubs.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were these trees spoiled by these sticks being cut out? - They were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They were fan yews? - They were.</p>
               <p>You say yew is not timber? - I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>If you had found a fan yew, in a church yard, you would call it a tree; if you found it in a shrubbery, you would call it a shrub; now, suppose by accident, you had found a yew tree upon a waste or common, what would you call it there? - There, it might by called a plant.</p>
               <p>Have you any fourth name for it? - I do not know but they may, they certainly are described under all these names, a yew tree, a yew plant, a yew shrub.</p>
               <p>But not at the age of twenty years? - They are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. A shrub is what I understand, to be a tree cut down for gardening.</p>

               <p>What morning was this? - Saturday morning the 12th of December, I purchased them of him, I gave him fifteen shillings, this is the piece that matched, I saw them matched, and cut off by Mr. Burchel's gardener, they matched exactly.</p>

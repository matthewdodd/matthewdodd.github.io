I saw the property in question all safe the day before the robbery; I went to bed before eleven o'clock. I was disturbed by a noise; I set up in bed, looked at my watch, and it was a quarter past twelve. I supposed it to be the noise of a gate swinging, and did not get up. The prisoner Brown had visited a servant of mine, and knew perfectly well the ways of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hire the house yourself? A. Yes; but it is a joint concern.</p>
               <p>ANN WALKER. I am the last witness's sister. I go round every night to see the house safe; it was perfectly safe on the night in question - the window was bolted and fastened. When I came down in the morning I found it open, and two panes of glass broken. Some of the property stolen belonged to me, and some to my sister. The house is leased to us both.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. I saw the house all fastened up the night before the robbery. - I came down about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - it was hardly light then. I found the back door wide open. I went to the parlour, saw the door ajar, and saw a light shining through the door - I screamed out, and Brown came out of the parlour, and opened the door - I am sure he is the man; he came with a candle stuck in a bottle, and a carving knife in his hand - he said if I made any more noise he would murder me; I ran directly to the back door, and ran round over to a neighbour's cottage, and when I returned he had got out by the dust-hole. I examined the house, and found the kitchen window open - two panes of glass were broken; they could then open the sash and get in. I opened the parlour window, and missed two silver table spoons from the celeret - they belonged to Miss Susannah Walker, I believe. I found eggs and butter had been used by the persons who had been in the house. I missed a basket of linen which had come from the mangle; the basket itself was not moved. The property belonged to both Miss Walkers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the things after they came from the mangle? A. No. Brown was very tipsy - he did not do me any mischief. It was just light enough for me to see him. They had been drinking liquor in the house.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton. On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, about seven o'clock, I was in Ponders End field, three or four hundred yards from the prosecutrixs', and saw a man crossing the field; he seemed very much in liquor - I watched him; he got into the hedge - I went up to assist him; it was Brown; he crawled up the bank, and went right across - he had a bundle under his arm when he passed me. I left him there, and when I went to breakfast I heard of this robbery. A boy, named Withers, gave me a little work box, and the top of a wicker basket.</p>

            . I am constable of Edmonton. On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, I apprehended the prisoners - I found Alligan near the Angel Inn at Edmonton, took him to Lower Edmonton, and found Brown, at the Jolly Farmers, public-house, quite tipsy. Alligan had been drinking; they were put into the same watch-house, but in the evening I separated them. On the Sunday afternoon I went with Wallis to a field near the Cock, and found a basket, containing several pieces of lump sugar, and a pair of white stockings - it was concealed in a ditch, two or three fields from the prosecutrixs' house. I have some table-cloths, a spoon, and other goods, which were brought to me - one lot by three boys, on the 18th, and the other by a man who is in Whitecross-street prison. A toast rack was brought to me by a boy named Soley.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Edmonton. - On the 14th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners near the door of the Three Tuns, public-house, and saw them again at twenty minutes past ten, going towards Ponders End - I had been watching them from six o'clock till then. I was present when they were examined before Mr. Mores; (looking at the examinations) - the signatures to these are Mr. Mores's writing; I saw the prisoners make their marks to the papers - they were read over to them by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there all the time they were under examination? A. I went out once or twice while they were in the office - what the Magistrate said to them while I was absent I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you there when it was read over to them? A. Yes: Alligan could not write, but Brown signed his name. The Magistrate asked what they had to say, and what they said was written down and read over (read.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, J. Brown, being asked what he had to say in defence of the charge made against him by Jane Cooper, says, "I am guilty of the charge brought against me. I, in company with John Alligan was drinking at the Three Tuns, at Edmonton, about ten o'clock on Friday night, the 14th inst.; I left the house, and John Alligan followed me; we agreed as we went along to break into Mrs. Walker's house, at Ponder's End, which we did by forcing the outside shutter of the kitchen window, breaking the window and unfastening the catch. I then lighted the fire in the parlour to cook some eggs which John Alligan was obtaining from some part of the premises. By the time I had lighted the fire Alligan brought four eggs and boiled them, I eat one, and Alligan two - one was rotten; we also eat bread and butter taken out of the pantry. Alligan broke the lock of a cupboard in the hall and brought in several sorts of liquor and wine, which we both drank of freely, tasting several sorts. After we had eat and drank as much as we liked, I fell asleep in the parlour. About one or two o'clock I heard the table clock strike which was on the table. I was very tipsy. I don't recollect any circumstance, till I awoke and found myself in a ploughed field close to the house, and the dust hole of which there was a board broken down which made the hole that John Alligan and myself crept through when we first went to the premises in order to break into the house. The parcels now produced, viz. a basket, containing several lumps of sugar, and a pair of white cotton stockings, as also a large piece of sugar about 7 lbs. in a blue paper and string round it, I found by my side. When I awoke I got up and took with me the basket containing the lumps of sugar as also the large piece of sugar, and hid them in a ditch in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170025"></xptr>in the adjoining field. I then went to the Jolly Farmers, in Church-street, Edmonton, where I was apprehended by the constable, Wilson.</p>

               <p>John Alligan being asked what he had to say in his defence, or whether the account given of him by John Brown was true, says, "I was with John Brown when we broke into Mrs. Walker's house. I partook of the eggs and the liquor, but don't recollect any thing else.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. This was about eight at night? - A. Within five minutes up or down.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a dark night, very misty? - A. It was misty.</p>
               <p>This violent blow must have stunned you a little? - A. It did, undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you coming from at that time? - A. Finsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in company? - A. Yes, with one person at a gentleman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking? - A. I cannot say, it might be a pint; it don't signify cross-questioning me, I have said the truth, and can say no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. It is my duty to cross-question you a little.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot recollect what you drank? - A. No; I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any view of the person previous to the time you were knocked down? - A. I passed them; I did not know who they were, they jostled me, and then knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear, when the prisoner turned down, and you were one hundred and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170075"></xptr>fifty yards from him, and being stunned with the fall, that you can swear to the face of the man? - A. I never said I was one hundred and fifty yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you had run one hundred and fifty yards before you came near him? - A. I was about eight yards from them, and ran one hundred and fifty yards, then I came near them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the watch-house, was the prisoner searched? - A. I believe he was searched; I saw him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found upon him? - A. I believe nothing but a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. He had never been out of your sight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Were you examined before the Lord Mayor? - A. Before Alderman Newnham, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account there as you have here? - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you fix upon another man? - A. No; I said, I believed a person who was there, was one of the party, but I was not certain; I believe so now.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not the Alderman commit him? - A. He did, for another hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your money before this time. - A. About half an hour before I was knocked down; a few minutes before I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You fixed upon another person before the Alderman, and he had so much doubt, that he dismissed him; did you never hear any thing of a reward? - A. Never; I never was in a Court before.</p>
               <p>Court. About eight o'clock you were going by these men, and they followed you, and before you could say a word, you were knocked down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the person that struck you? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. You said your pockets were rifled of a half guinea, a half crown, and a sixpence; had you recovered so far as to take any observations of the persons? - A. As I lay on my left side, there was a lamp on the right side, and I had a perfect view of the prisoner's face.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How soon did you get up? - A. I got up immediately; I picked up my hat in my left hand, and ran with it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You never lost sight of the men till they stopped? - A. I never lost sight of any of them, till they ran different ways; I never lost sight of the prisoner till I put my hand upon him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What business are you? - A. A collar-maker; I work with Thomas Mayo, No. 231, Upper Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long have you worked with him? - A. Ever since I have been in town; three years last October.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a clerk to the East-India Company: On Sunday evening last, going down Bread-street, from Cheapside, I heard the cry of watch repeatedly; I saw the prisoner, with two others, running, and as they advanced within a few yards of me, they halted, and became from a run to a walk, a sharp walk, scarcely to be called a walk; I heard the prisoner say to the other two, "don't run, or they will be after us," which caused me to suspect the prisoner and the others had been doing what they ought not to have done; but, on the man not calling stop thieves, I did not intercept them, or stop them; and they passed me and turned round the corner to Watling-street; the prosecutor. Joshua Harrison, by the time they got to the corner, was within three or four yards at the farthest; when the prisoner turned the corner, I took no further notice; but by missing my friend, James Wheeler, who was running, with the prosecutor, after the prisoner, I ran about thirty or forty yards; I came up with them just at the time they had taken the prisoner; and, by Joshua Harrison repeatedly crying "watch, watch," a watchman followed; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170076"></xptr>prisoner stopped, and said, here is the watchman if you want the watch; Harrison said, I likewise want you, as well as the watch, "for," says he,"you have robbed me;" and he denied it; and said, he was not the person; he knew nothing of it; they gave charge for charge, and they went to the watch-house; when I came up to the prosecutor, and saw him in a dirty condition, I knew him, and went with them to the watch-house; I have done business for his master two years, and knew him perfectly well; I went to the watch-house, and can repeat what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at the time? - A. Yes; he was in charge, in the watch-house at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was it? - A. The constable questioned the prisoner, respecting the charge against him; what he was by prosession; and where he lived; he said, he was a horse-dealer, and that he was just come from Snow-hill; and that he lived in Barbican; the constable asked, what business he had in Bread-street, to go from Snow-hill to Barbican; he said, he had business there; he was searched; he had no money; he said, he had none; his having no money about him, caused a suspicion; and he asked him, if he had any friends to bail him from going to prison; he said, he had friends, but would not trouble them that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You said, you had a suspicion, because he had no money in his pocket? - A. The people had a suspicion of a man of his appearance having no money.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw these men they were turning into Watling-street? - A. The prisoner did; I cannot say which way the others turned.</p>
               <p>Q. After they turned the corner, the prosecutor was four or five yards from the corner? - A. He did not turn the corner immediately, but crossed the way; had he turned short round the corner, the prosecutor would have lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been to my sister's, in Red Lion-street; I was going into the Borough to Mr. Hurst, about a horse; in Watling-street I heard a man cry out</p>
               <p>"watch, watch;" he was very much in liquor; I turned round, and said, here is the watch, and he laid hold of me, and said, I had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Goodwin). Was the prosecutor in liquor? - A. He was a little in liquor, rather merry; he could run as well as if he was not in liquor; he gave a clear account at the watch-house; he said, they thought me drunk, but I was not so drunk as they thought for.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harrison). Q. Did you swear to any other man before the Magistrate? - A. No; being examined before the Magistrate, there was a person there, they had some discourse together; the Magistrate said, do you know that man; I said, I did not know him, I believed he was one that was in the company; the Alderman bid them shut the door, that none might escape; and he slipped out of the hall; the Alderman asked me, if I could swear to him; I said, I could not; I believed he was one of the men.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect being before Alderman Newnham? - A. Perfectly well; on Monday last, I had some little business in the city, for my master, a person asked me to go, through curiosity, to Guildhall, this man was standing at the door; I had a thought of a warrant being granted against me, for an assault, and thought it best to make my escape, and I went out; this gentleman gave the alarm of stop-thief; I did not stop, but when the alarm of stop-thief was given, I immediately stopped and surrendered myself to this man; the prosecutor, before I came in, said, that is the man, and I will swear to him; the gentleman desired me to step over the bar, and when I came within a yard or two of him, and unbuttoned my coat, he said, he could not swear to me; I said, if you could swear to me at fourteen yards distance, why cannot you swear to me now; the Alderman said, he must commit me till the next morning; I brought several persons to my character the next day, and the Alderman discharged me; I believe he would swear to any man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are servant to Mr. Bailey, a relation of your's? - A. Yes; a fruiturer in Covent-garden; Mr. John Bailey, for there are two in the market of that name.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did Harrison say, that is the man, and I will swear to him? - A. Not in those words; as we were bringing the prisoner back, the prosecutor pointed him out and said, I think I can swear that is one of the men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Davis said, that Harrison said, that is the man, and I will swear to him? - A. He pointed to him, and said, that is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Harrison.) Did you make use of those words, that is the man, and I will swear to him? - A. I never said such a word; I said, I believe that is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Goodwin.) Did Harrison say, that is the man, and I will swear to him? - A. No, he did not; he said, I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor out of the room at all? - A. I will not swear to that, it might be just as he was bringing back, he might be out a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Harrison go out of the room? - A. I did not know him then; the man was in the yard that said, that is the man, that is the man, that robbed me.</p>

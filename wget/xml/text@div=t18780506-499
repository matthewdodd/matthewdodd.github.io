I practise and live at Twicken<lb></lb>ham—on Friday evening, 22nd March, about six o'clock, I was called to the house in question and there found a child lying on the bed—my assistant was with me, and we examined the wound together—at first we could hardly tell whether the child was dead or alive—it had lost a very large quantity of blood—there was a very extensive wound across the throat about 5 inches in length—it cut almost entirely through the windpipe, and laid it bare but did not divide the large vessels on both sides—both the carotid artery and the jugular vein on both sides were exposed—heemorrhage was still going on and oozing into the windpipe—I succeeded in getting the child to swallow a small quantity of milk and brandy—ultimately we succeeded in saving the child's life—it very nearly died—mortification set in from the wound—I believe it will re<lb></lb>cover—I was shown this razor—it is the sort of instrument that would cause such a wound—about 10 o'clock the same night I was requested by the police sergeant to visit the prisoner in the cell—I examined her

               <p>and found that she had a little wound on the left thumb, and on turning up her sleeve her left arm was covered with recent blood—I could not say that she was drunk at the time, but she gave me the appearance of an habitual drunkard, a woman who was scarcely ever sober; she was quite capable of reasonably answering all questions put to her—I put some questions to her about the occurrence, and she also put some questions to me—she was able to answer questions rationally—she pressed me whether the child was likely to recover.</p>

             sworn. - I attend the Marlborough-street office: On the 10th of this month, between twelve and one, the prosecutor told me he had lost his waistcoat, and I went with him to Calomel-buildings; I desired the prosecutor to go up first, and if I found that he answered to his name, I would be at his heels instantly; he asked if William was at home, and I heard the answer, yes; I stepped up immediately, and saw the prisoner asleep in a chair; the prosecutor gave we charge of him; I then said, William, waken, I must see what you have got about you; upon that he got out of the chair, his back was to the fire-place; I put my hand into his waistcoat pocket, unbuttoned his breeches, and said you may see every thing; he then put his hand into his sob, and pulled out a duplicate; he endeavoured to throw it into the fire; I perceived it, and the duplicate dropped down at his feet; I said, those things will not do with me, my eyes are as quick as your's; I then picked it up, and took him to the pawnbroker's, in Chandless-street; the pawnbroker produced the waistcoat, and it was sworn to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PHILIP MULCASTER sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: The prisoner brought me this waistcoat about ten in the morning, he told me his name was John Williams, that he lived in Charles-street; I lent him one shilling and sixpence upon it, he asked two shillings and sixpence.(Produces the waistcoat).</p>
               <p>Grainger. This is my property, I know it by the make, and the colour of it; I had it given me by a gentleman, as a cast-off waistcoat; I have had it about three quarters of a year; I can swear that that is the waistcoat that I left in the stable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to see a young man that works with this gentleman, and as I was coming away, the young man came out into Park-lane, and gave me a handkerchief to carry to his washerwoman; I went home directly, down Brick-street, Piccadilly; I met a young man, an acquaintance of mine, who asked me to pawn this waistcoat for him, and he would give me a pot of beer, and I did pawn it for one shilling and sixpence; I took him the money, and offered him the duplicate, and he would not have it, he told me I might keep it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140027"></xptr>for myself; when these gentlemen; came to take me, they wrested the door open; I was going to give them the duplicate, and it jumped out of my fingers; I had no intention of throwing it in the fire.</p>

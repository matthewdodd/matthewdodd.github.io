The deceased jumped up in a passion, and by some means, the prisoner being in liquor, he fell upon him. They pushed each other about, the prisoner fell, and the deceased fell upon him; they then got up, and the deceased went away; he returned again in a short time, the prisoner was then in his former seat, and they had more words, the prisoner got up, they scuffled together, and the deceased fell against the table - I cannot say whether it was accidental, or whether the prisoner pushed him; the prisoner had not got hold of him - They were both in liquor. There were no blows struck on either side; the deceased's left side went against the table, he did not complain, but went out. I went out also, and saw no more.</p>

            . I was at the public-house; the prisoner was sitting by the fire, the deceased came in, and sat opposite him-the prisoner left his place, and the deceased took it. The prisoner came in again, when they had some words, and scuffled about-there were no blows struck - They both fell, and the prisoner was under the deceased; I got between them to prevent their quarreling. They sat down again and had more words, the deceased fell against the table by his left side, he was not pushed; he said he thought he had hurt his left side; he then went out, and the prisoner sat down. In about five minutes the deceased came to the window, and muttered something.</p>

            . I am the wife of the deceased. I met him at a quarter before three o'clock, returning from the public-house - He was very well before; he complained of being ill - He was leaning against the stile - He said, he had got his death-blow at the Wheatsheaf; he died on the 26th. He was always positive, after this blow, that he should die. He said he got into the man's seat by the fire, that the man came in and said it was his seat; he did not get up immediately; the man collared him, and threw him against the table. He complained of being hurt in his left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140022"></xptr>side. He went to bed directly-he was not the worse for liquor. Next morning he went to the hospital, and died there.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Bartholomew-close. On the 24th I saw the deceased at the hospital - He complained of a pain in his left side, his rib was fractured - He died on the 26th. I did not think him in a dangerous state at first; he appeared to have a disease in his viscera. I examined his body after death. The complaint would not have caused his death so soon without the fracture of the rib. The liver and spleen were very much diseased, and the lungs much disordered. The fracture of the rib certainly hastened his death.</p>

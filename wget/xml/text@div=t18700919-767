                  </hi>. I live at 35, Edward Street, Deptford—I was at my father's house on the 11th October, 1869—defendant is my father—I saw Moody there—the said "How are you?"—I said "Quite well"—he said that old Musgrave said he would come and take the furniture, and "I have persuaded your father to make a bill of sale"—I said "Father owes no money"—he said "You don't know what he might want; he will be able, by that bill of sale, to save his goods and get the deeds from Musgrava"—on the 17th December I visited my father again, and saw on the mantel—piece the bill of sale—my father's signature was attached to it, and Mr. Ives witnessed it—there were two red seals and a stamp in the comer, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—my father said it was only a friendly concern between he and Moody—on the 15th April I saw the bill of sale in my father's hands, and again on the 14th August—I advised him to destroy it, because I knew if Moody got hold of it he would not have it again.</p>

               <p>what I thought of my brother's case—he said "Me and your brother do our little friendly concerns together"—that was because I thought the case was going against him—he said it would be all right, it would be settled—he lost the action—we again adjourned to the Prince of Orange public-house to have some tea, and afterwards a conversation took place at my brother's house about the bill of sale, and I advised him to destroy it.</p>

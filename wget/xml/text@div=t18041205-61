               <p>Q. Was it in such a state that you could fit it to the place? - A. Yes, part of it.</p>
               <p>- NOKES sworn. - On the 14th of November I detected the prisoner in Queen Ann-street West, between seven and eight o'clock at night, and brought him to the watch-house; I asked him where he got the lead; he told me he got it at No. 24, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mr. Brown's house? - A. No; I asked him where he was going with it; he said, to Mr. Woods, in Pawlin-street; I brought him to the watch-house, and the next day we took it to the place; one part seemed to sit.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not venture to swear it was part of the lead that was on that house? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I was at the watch-house; I saw the lead fitted; this little bit fitted in to a piece of the roof at the end of the house; the whole of the lead had been taken from the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On this evening, going down Swallow-street, I met a person who I knew was a plumber, I don't know his name; I said I wanted a job; he said he was going to repair, and fetch some old lead from the premises; he desired me to wait at Berkeley-street, and he would go to a gentleman that he would recommend me to; he came with a piece of lead; he said there was another piece; he went in, and in ten minutes brought the other piece; I was going with him with the lead; I stopped to ease myself at Manchester-square, and he went on; the watchman stopped me, and asked me where I was going with it; I said, to Mr. Woods; he took me to the watch-house, and I staid there all night, and in the morning I was taken down to Marlborough-street.</p>

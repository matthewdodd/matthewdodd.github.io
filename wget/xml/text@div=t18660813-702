                  </hi>. I am a fish salesman, of Bethnal Green—I have known the prisoner about eighteen months—he owed me 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—proceedings were taken, and I was promised money, but got none—last Monday three weeks I was at 37, Silver Street, talking to Mrs. Wright about some money—the prisoner's wife was there—Mrs. Wright went out, and the prisoner came in and said, "Hallo, you vagabond, I have got you at last"—he had his hand in his pocket, pulled out a knife, and thrust it into my side—I called out, "Murder!" and "Help!"—I was not able to do any thing to him—he made a second stab on my shoulder, and I have my coat, here to show it—I was in the hospital till last Wednesday, and am still suffer<lb></lb>ing.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you had any quarrel with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not spoken to him for some time—there was no motive on his part that I am aware of—Mr. Wright's is a little fish shop—the prisoner did not pick the knife up from the counter—it was open when I first saw it—he came into the shop with his hand in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman). I was called, and took the prisoner going to the station—he said that he would have murdered the prosecutor if he could—I found this little knife on him—the other knife had been taken from him before.</p>

I live at Nottingham Court, Long Acre—I was outside Mr. Wright's shop, but did not see the prisoner go in, as I was serving an old lady—I saw him inside, and saw him hit Mr. Jennings with his left hand in the face—he then put his hand in his pocket, pulled out a penknife, and ran it into Mr. Jenning's left side—Mr. Jennings called out, "Tom, Tom, come and take the knife away," but I could not move—Mr. Wright's son came and collared him, and we took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him—a policeman came and he was taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Middlesex Hospital—I examined Jennings and found a punctured wound just below the ribs over the region of the stomach, which had been bleeding profusely—he was in a great state of collapse—he was in the hospital about a fort<lb></lb>night, and the wound was healed, but he suffered from loss of blood and shock to the system—his life was in danger for rather more than a week—I had very little hope of him—a knife would do it.</p>

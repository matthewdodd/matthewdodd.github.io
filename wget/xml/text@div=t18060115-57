               <p>Court. Who was that gentleman? - A. Mr. Earnshaw.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I saw Mr. Lucadou, we went into the back parlour; he treated me very rude, he said do you expect me to leave my business to come to serve you, he was very rude with me; I requested him to send the man down with the book, who had made the entry, that is the very declaration I made, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Court. I am sure if you had followed the direction of your counsel, you would have done right.</p>

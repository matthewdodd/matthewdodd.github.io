The plate mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name) was lost out of our house the 3d of February, at 2 in the morning, according to the confession of Triest; he was one that my Lord kept out of charity: he confessed it to my Lord. I tied his arms, and went with him to a field by Mountague-house wall, where he said Riviere went with him and buried it. When we came there it was gone. He cried a great deal. I took him back, and sent for a constable, and went with a letter to Sir

            . I was sent for on the 3d of February. My Lord Baltimore was examining Triest in French, and my Lord told me what the boy said in English. By his information I found Riviere lived in Church-lane. I and my Lord's porter went to the house; he was not there. The boy told us there was a cook lived in Hog-lane, perhaps he may be there, so we went there with the boy, and left the porter in Church-lane; the boy shewed me the door in a cellar: I peeped through the key-hole, and saw a man: I knocked at the door; they did not come to open it. I knocked again, and said I had a commission from my Lord Baltimore to come and search. I found Riviere upon the stairs; I asked him if he had any plate of my Lord's, for I had information that he was the man that took it. He said, he did not know, but he would see. I secured him, and drove him before me, and found some of the plate among some saw dust, and some behind the barrels. I found all but one salt and one half pint mug (the rest produced and deposed to by Mr. Broughton, as my Lord's property). One Grible here, an evidence, rents the house.</p>

            . Riviere came to my house to work for about three weeks. On the 3d of February, he told me that Triest had committed a robbery at my Lord Baltimore's, and said he would deposit them all at my house; to take them back again to my Lord, if he could find an opportunity to save the lad from being transported. Riviere brought part of them to my house about 11 o'clock one morning, and the rest about 7 in the evening.</p>

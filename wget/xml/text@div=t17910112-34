             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the conductors, on the part of the patrole, under the direction of Sir Sampson Wright: on the 19th of July last, at about half past seven at night, I saw the prisoner at the Swan with two Necks, Lad-lane, where he was in the capacity of a waiter; I was desired to go there in consequence of something which had passed, I called for sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and it was brought to me; I will not be positive whether this was the waiter brought it to me or not: I sat there some time after the brandy and water was brought to me: when I went into the room, I met two people coming out of the room; whether they were the people belonging to the house I cannot tell, but I sat there some time, and could see nobody, not any of the waiters: after some time, I saw this person come to a cupboard; whether he took any thing out or put any thing in I am not positive; I then asked him for change for half-a-guinea, and to take the sixpennyworth of brandy and water; he went and brought my change for half-a-guinea, taking the sixpennyworth out of it; in this change he gave me two bad sixpences, two shillings, and a half-crown piece: I sat there for some time after that, not having an opportunity of seeing him come back again: it is a dark coffee-room: I sat longer, and had threepennyworth of brandy and water more; I gave him sixpence, and he gave me threepence.</p>
               <p>Had you any altercation about this money with him? - I had.</p>
               <p>Where did he take it from? - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120051"></xptr>know. On the 22d I went again, merely because I would be satisfied of the plan; I got there nearly about half past six in the evening; when I went, I called for a glass of Holland's; I had it; another waiter brought it to me; I then called for some tea; and in the course of that time this waiter came; I had some other liquor after, and my reckoning came to one and eight-pence; it was near eight o'clock when I called for it; I gave this man half-a-guinea to change; I laid two on the table, and told him they were weight, but he would take which he chose; he said it was immaterial which, it was not much consequence; he took the change out of his waistcoat-pocket; he gave me my full change, and I gave him back 1 s. 10 d.; 1 s. 8 d. for the reckoning, and 2 d. for himself, and I came away; at that time he gave me three bad shillings, and four bad sixpences; I only informed Mr. Clarke of it; I did not apprehend him; Mr. Townsend apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You did not, on either of the occasions, object to any of the money? - Yes, I beg your pardon, I objected to a French half-crown, and he changed that.</p>
               <p>Was the second time as dark as the first? - No, it was not; it was an hour sooner.</p>
               <p>And later in the year? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man was indicted in September sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he came to be tried in October sessions, but the bill of indictment was thrown out; and in December sessions you preferred a new bill against him; the first bill was for uttering to you and others, I believe; do you know how many under-waiters there are at this house? - I do not know; I saw two; one was a waiter; I do not know as to the other.</p>

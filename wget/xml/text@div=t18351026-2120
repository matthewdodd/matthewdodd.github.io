                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Robins and Co., No.5 Wharf, Paddington. I have known the prisoner twenty years—he has been in my master's employ about fifteen years, and was discharged about two months ago drunkenness and bad conduct—he had been about our premises about ten days after he was discharged—I do not know what day this happened—he came into the adjoining wharf, where Mr. Meredith's stable is—I was in the stable, with Mr. Meredith at the time—the prisoner came against the stable door and said, "Mr. Hughes, you have done me an injury"—I said to him, "Wale, if there is any injury done, you have done it yourself, from your bad conduct and drunkenness"—I had scarcely uttered the words before he drew a pistol from under his cost and presented it at my head—he pulled the trigger, and part of the powder in the pan flashed and went off—I distinctly saw him pull the trigger; it only flashed in the pan—Mr. Meredith, who was in the stable, and myself, flew upon him, and wrested the pistol from his grasp—he then said he intended to shoot me; he would rather be hung than starve—a policeman was sent for, and he was given in charge—he had been dis<lb></lb>charged in consequence of my representations to his employers—for the last four years he has been cautioned—Robins and Co. are wharfingers and carriers—the pistol was examined before the Megistrate, but I was not present.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you had been as long in Messrs. Robins' service as the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not—I have been there five years and a half—the complaints against the prisoner commenced about four years ago, and continued up to the time he was discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you continue to complain of him all that while? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Occasionally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had seen him about the premises for ten days before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and conversed with him almost every day—I never saw him tipsy at those times—I was in the office from morning till night for the ten days—he had the same opportunity of doing the mischief then—he was the captain of one of the trading vessels in our employ—he would not be likely to starve if out of employ, there are so many trading vessels passing from Manchester—there is scarcely a week but some carrier is obliged to discharge a man—I should say the prisoner was not sober on the day in question—he was not sober, certainly—I do not mean to say he was drunk—he had evidently been drinking, but I should not consider him absolutely drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any other conversation preceded this act besides his saying you had injured him, as you have stated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a word was said besides—I never had an angry word with the man in my life, further than repri<lb></lb>manding him for his gross conduct and negligence—I was very much alarm<lb></lb>ed, but I am satisfied it was a portion of the powder that exploded—the conversation I had with him eight or ten days before, was little more than lamenting he had lost his situation—he made no charge against me—he always expressed to others that I was the best friend he had, and I en<lb></lb>deavoured to be so, consistently with the duty I owed to my employers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near was he standing to you when the pistol was dis<lb></lb>charged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you think it might be a greater distance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not; I have not measured the distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you said he was against the stable door, and you were in the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I am sure it was not more than five yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were any contents of the pistol produced to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see the charge till after it was drawn—did not see it drawn—the pistol was made for a ball and not shot—it was not loaded with ball, as far as I know—I never saw the pistol after he was given in charge—the policeman took the pistol also, and has had it ever since—I attended at the Magistrate at the seven o'clock sitting—I do not recollect more than one witess being examined then—the prisoner was examined and committed at the seven o'clock sitting—it happened at ten o'clock in the morning—the seven o'clock examination was the only one that took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before he fired the pistol, he said he intended to shoot you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; after he was given in custody, when the policeman had got him in charge, he said, "I meant to shoot him; I would sooner he hanged than starve"—he was sufficiently collected to know what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. The prosecutor was at my stable on the day in question, about ten o'clock in the morning—I was standing very near the stable door, just inside the stable—the prisoner came into the stable, and placed himself or stood very near to me, by my side—Mr. Hughes was in the stable, conversing with my brother, at a few yards' distance—the prisoner said. "Mr. Hughes, you have done me an injury"—Mr. Hughes replied, that he had not done him an injury, and what injury had been done, he had brought on himself by his own misconduct—Hughes had scarcely</p>

               <p>uttered the words, before the prisoner drew his right hand from under his jacket, and presented the pistol at Mr. Hughes's head—I should think he was standing within five yards of Mr. Hughes—I observed he pulled the trigger, and the pistol flashed in the pan—Hughes immediately went up and seized him to the prisoner and collared him—I immediately went up and seized him by the hand or arm, and wrested the pistol form his hand—I said, "You assassin, how dare you come here to shoot an innocent man? deliver up that pistol to me immediately"—I took the pistol from his hand, and said to him, "Are you aware of what you are doing? you have done enoght to hang you"—he very coolly replied, "I am born to be hung, and I do not care if I am hung for this"—I should say he was not sober at the time, but sufficiently collected to know what he was doing—perfectly so—he said he came on purpose to shoot Mr. Hughes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you aware that a man in a great state of excitement, very often affects to be cool? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It probably may be the case—I cannot say—I do not think he laboured under any excitement, but under the effect of liquor—I do not remember saying he was in a violent state of excitement—I should say he was probably in a state of excitement from the effect of liquor—I think I could undertake to say postitively that I did not say he was in a state of excitement, only from the effect of liquor—I never did say that he was in a very violent state of excitement—he appeared to me to have been drinking—I had not seen him during the ten days after he had been discharged—I am certain I saw the ignition of gunpowder—I did not attend at the station-house, but I heard Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, ask why he was not brought to the office in the morning—the inspector said he was too much excited by liquor, which was the reason he did not bring him till evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called in, at ten o'clock on the 12th of October, to the stable-yard, and the prisoner was pointed out as being the man who had attempted to shoot Mr. Hughes—I took him into custody, and the pistol was handed over to me by Mr. Meredith—I have it here—I examined it, and found some shot and pow<lb></lb>der in it—I drew the charge—the pistol has a swivel ramrod—I found powder and shot in the pistol, which I produce—it is common small shot, usually used for pigeon-shooting—there were two pieces of paper instead of wadding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been in the army? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have been accustomed to fire-arms—it is sparrow-shot.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine his packets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and found a quantity of shot and powder, and two flints in his pockets.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been in the habit of shooting with pistols? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I never use sparrow-shot—it is not usual to use them in such a pistol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Particularly when you wish to produce death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the shot is certainly not like the proper charge of this pistol—there is a very small proportion of powder—I found on the prisoner's person the means of producing a better charge both in powder and shot—I should not think it would produce death at fifteen paces of five yards distance, a<lb></lb>ccording to my judgment.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe it probable that shot so small, and discharged at such a distance, would be likely to perforate a man's coat and</p>

               <p>waistcoat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I should suppose the pistol would carry small shot ten or fifteen yards, if properly loaded—I suppose, loaded as it was, if fired in the air, it would carry eight or nine yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean it would not carry more than nine yards, or do you mean only to do a mischief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean to enter the clothing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by fifteen paces? do you mean feet or yards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By paces I understand yards—fifteen yards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you tried this pistol with small shot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not—in my judgment it would penetrate the elothing of a man at the distance of fifteen paces, loaded as this was—the prisoner was in a very excited state when I took, him into custody—it appeared that he had been drinking—that was clear in looking at him—he seemed both excited in mind and by drink—he was put on one side till the evening, because he was not in a fit state to answer questions, rationally, or give any ac<lb></lb>count.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I reside at 2, Creed-lane, Ludgate-street, and am the wife of William Carter, a timekeeper—I was in Fleet-street on 20th June, about twenty minutes to 4 o'clock, with my husband's mother—she was just on ahead—I had my purse in my left hand—I took it from my left, put it into my right, and put it into my pocket—I had my hand in my pocket, with the purse in my hand, and still had it so, when the prisoner was by my side, and his hand came into contact with mine in my pocket—I caught hold of his wrist and asked him for my purse, which I missed at that instant—he said he had not got it; and he gave my hand a tug in this manner, and my hand went back—I turned and looked, and saw another one about his own size, take something from the prisoner—I had his wrist, and my hand went with his hand, and when I turned behind, there was another young man about his own size behind me that received my purse—I was holding the prisoner's right hand, the same hand that took something from my pocket—the young man came up to the hand I was holding, and appeared to take something from that hand—I got hold of that man directly, and held him a minute or so, but he got away—he had a parcel under his arm—I retained the prisoner—I have not got my purse—there was no other person by my side at first when the prisoner was there—I kept him till the officer came up, and gave him into custody.</p>

On the afternoon of 20th June, I took the prisoner into custody in Fleet-street from the prosecutrix, who had hold of him—I took him to the station-house, searched him, but found nothing on him—he gave me an address—I went there but he was not known there—I do not remember the prisoner saying anything at the close of the examination of Harriet Carter.</p>

I think after I had finished my evidence before the Magistrate, the prisoner was asked whether he wished to ask any question of me—he pleaded guilty—he said, "When I come out I am sure to get into trouble; I am the most unluckiest fellow in the world"—when he was asked, he said, "Guilty."</p>

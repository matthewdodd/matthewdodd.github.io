                  </hi> I live at 71, Bethnal-green-road, and was in the employ of Mr. James Latham, a timber-merchant, up to 29th April—Allen was is his employment eight years—his premises adjoin Mr. Latham's—they com<lb></lb>municate by a door leading from the yard into his house—we used to use it as a shed to keep things in—I had charge of the premises—there was a large stock of rosewood and mahogany veneer—Hall has been in Mr. Latham's employment—on 5th May, a week after I had left the employment, Pether gave me some information, in consequence of which I went to Hall's house and found a bundle of veneers, the property of Mr. Latham—they were on the premises up to the time I left.</p>

On 5th May I was standing at the corner of Swan-street, and saw Hall coming in a direction from Mr. Latham's, and about twenty yards off, with a bundle of veneers—he went across Church-street—directly after I saw Allen following—I followed them to Sebright-street—Allen went in to No. 92, there, took the veneers from Hall, and Hall went back—I gave information to Mr. Lock, and he, I and a policeman went together to No. 92—I saw the prisoners there—I found the veneers there—they were the same I had seen Hall carrying, and are Mr. Latham's property—the policeman asked me in the prisoners' presence which of the prisoners I had seen carrying them—I said, "Hall"—Hall said, "That is right, <hi rend="italic">Sam."</hi>

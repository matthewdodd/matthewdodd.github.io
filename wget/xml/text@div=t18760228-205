                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer E</hi>). On the night of 24th January I saw the prisoner in Broad Street, Bloomsbury, with two other men—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them to Thorn by Street. Oxford Street, and saw them go under a lamp where the prisoner took something from his pocket and handed it to one of the others—it appeared to be tissue paper containing counterfeit coin—they all three went into the Old Crown in Oxford Street and I went into another compartment—they called for drink and the other man put down good money—I went into their compartment and asked the prisoner what he had about him, he said "I have nothing"—I said I believe you have some counterfeit money—he put his hand in his pocket and appeared to be in the act of dropping something, I siezed his hand and kept it clenched till with assistance I got him to the station and then found this bad shilling in his hand and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money on him—I told him he would be charged with passing counterfeit coin, he said "I met some men on the Dials and they gave me that money"—he afterwards said "I met a men in Oxford Street, you have taken the wrong one; if you had caught the one who got away, he is the guilty party"—I searched him and found another shilling in the pocket from which he had taken the coin and also three shillings in tissue paper—one man got away and one was not charged—I had seen the pri<lb></lb>soner that afternoon at the Grapes public-house Seven Dials with the man who has not been charged.</p>

               <p>Sarah Brown says, "On Saturday night I went to sell these bolts at Mr. Armfield's; I gave him these bolts into his hand; he put them into the scale; he had no sooner done that, than the constable entered, and he took the bolts from the scale, and held one in each hand; the constable said, 'Hand them over here; I am a police-constable;' he then said to me, 'Where is the money he has given you?" I said I had none, and he said he would swear he had seen him pay me, and how much was it; he paid me none; but he was to have paid me eightpence for them; I had my hand in my pocket at the time the constable spoke; I showed him what money I had; I had three half-crowns, four shillings, and fourpence three<lb></lb>farthings; farthings; I had not a sixpence about me; he then said, it was all d—d non<lb></lb>sense; he knew better; he then went round the counter, and wanted to know if Mr. Armfield had any more stowed away; he turned up a bag, and said, 'Oh, I see you have no more of them;' he said he was sure I had been carrying on the game a long time; he then said, 'Come down to the Poplar station with me;' I then did as he said; I offered him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. not to take me, as I had never been in a station-house before in my life; in going along, he pressed me to know how much Mr. Armfield had given me for them; I told him I had not a sixpence nor eightpence in any way; he told me the inspector would not keep me in the station-house; he told me to say that the man had bought them, and the inspector would let me go; he then said, 'Did he pay you for them?' being in hopes I should not be locked up, I said, 'He did;' and it was fear alone made me say so; but I never received a farthing from him; I told him my husband worked anywhere, and I gave him the direction at the station-house; I took my money out, and he laid it on the table."</p>

               <p>eight o'clock at night, when Sarah Brown came in with two bolts in her hand—she asked my master if he bought them—he said he did not know, where did she get them?—she said, from her husband, who was a ship<lb></lb>scraper—my master put them into the scale, weighed them, and had got them in his hand—he asked her again how her husband came by them, when the policeman ran into the shop, and took them from him—my master had not paid for them at all, and had not produced any money—I was about a yard and a half from the scale—I am sure I could have seen if my master had produced any money.</p>

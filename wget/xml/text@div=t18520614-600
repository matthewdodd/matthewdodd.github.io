                  </hi>. I live at Tottenham. On Monday, 24th May, I left my house between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, leaving my wife there; she had to go to town, and was to leave the back door open for me to get in, when I came home—I came home about twenty minutes past twelve, and found the prisoner in the house—I had known him before—he had worked for me two or three years—I told him he had no business there—he said he came to get a lucifer, to light his pipe—he went away—he was sober</p>

               <p>—my wife came home about five, and between eight and nine we missed a jacket, a blue coat, a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, a velvet coat, and a silk handkerchief—I went to look for the prisoner, and found him lying under a hay <hi rend="italic">kelt</hi>—I think he was in liquor—I found under him this coat, two pairs of trowsers, and waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine.</p>

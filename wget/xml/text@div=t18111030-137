I pulled out my notes, the prisoner and I had been drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much at that time you had about you. - A. I had eleven ones and two fives, I took them out on a bench, they were tied with a piece of pack thread across, he pushed me, or I pushed him. In the event I fell down, I did not suppose him a robber, in my getting up he got hold of my hand clasped, endeavouring to unclench it, and seeing me with this parcel of notes, he said, you could lend me some notes, I said I could if I liked, I am quite certain I did not lend him any, though it may be asserted hereafter that I did, I gave no consent whatever. Finally he took the notes away from me, I called upon him the next morning, supposing it was a joke, he disappeared from his lodgings.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. I recollect the circumstance of the two gentlemen coming into my house, they had been out spending the evening. Mr. Eades was very much intoxicated. Wesley was not. I recollect Mr. Eades lending the other four pounds, but he took the whole.</p>

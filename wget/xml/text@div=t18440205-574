                  </hi>. I am clerk to William Reid and Co., brewers—there are four partners, I believe. Some alterations were going on at the brewery, and the prisoners were employed there as carpenters—in consequence of what oc<lb></lb>curred, I directed Daniels to watch the oat-loft, and on the 23rd of Jan. I was called to a gangway leading to the loft, and found Daniels with the prisoners in custody—there was a basket on the ground between them, containing pump sling brasses—I have compared them with the slings, which they fit—they had been standing against the wall on the oat-loft—the prisoners had no busi<lb></lb>ness in that loft—there were no repairs going on there—there were some short bolts in that loft—the prisoners were not using such things—the basket did not belong to our firm—I know the brasses by their fitting this iron frame, which was also in the loft—I have no doubt of their being the prose<lb></lb>cutors'—they have been among the old stores for fourteen years, unused—I had seen them safe two days before.</p>

I saw Inman come into the loft with a candle—he went to the farther end of the loft, took something from the wall, laid it on the ground, and began hammering—I could tell it was metal by the sound—he seemed to put it into something which I afterwards found was a pan—he went out of the loft, and returned in about ten minutes with a basket on his shoulder, followed by Walters, with a light in his hand—Inman went to where he bad put the articles, took two pieces of wood out of the basket, then put the articles into it, and covered them with the wood—Walters was holding the candle to him, within five feet of him, lighting him to do it—Inman then put the basket on his shoulder and went out of the loft followed by Walters—I followed them into the gangway, stopped them there, sent for Overton, and they were secured—I carried the basket to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Maltese seaman, and lodge with Mr. Mitchell. I was out with him, a countryman of mine, and another person, on 30th Nov., in Ratclife-highway—I was walking with my countryman, and Mr. Mitchell in front with the other one—the prisoner came up to me, and said in English, "What are you talking about?"—I said, "Nobody was speaking to you"—I was not speaking to or about him—the prisoner left, and after that Mitchell said he was going home, and when he had got about ten yards away, the prisoner came again, and struck me on the side of the face, and ran away—I put my hand up, and it was bloody—Mitchell ran after the prisoner, and ray countryman called out, "Knife! knife!"—he overtook the prisoner in Princes-street; he is not here—Mitchell next came up to the prisoner, caught him behind, and I saw an open knife in his hand—Mitchell took it away, and gave it to the policeman—there was blood on it—I was taken to the doctor's—my face bled very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Lower Grove-street, St. George's, and keep a lodging-house for seamen. On 30th Nov. I was in Ratcliffe-highway with the prosecutor, another Maltese, and an Italian—I was with the Italian, and the others were following—the prisoner met us, and said to Camaleri, "What are you talking about?"—he said, "Nobody is talking to you; we are talking our <hi rend="italic">lingo"</hi>—we left, and when we had gone a few yards from Camaleri, some one <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Knife! knife!"—I turned back, and saw Camnleri's face covered with blood, gave him my handkerchief to tie it up, and followed him into Princes-street—I there saw the prisoner with the knife in his hand, holding it up, making room—I ran back to let him pass, I was afraid, and he ran into the Highway again—I ran after</p>

               <p>him, put my arms round him behind, shut him up in them, and laid him on the ground—I took the knife from him, and gave it to the policeman—the Maltese came up to the prisoner first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in New-road, St. George's. On 30th <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> the prosecutor was brought to me—I examined his face, and I found a punctured wound on the right cheek, just in front of the ear, nearly an inch and a half long, and more than an inch deep—the temporal artery and the cartilage of the ear were divided—there was considerable haemorrhage—the situation of the wound was dangerous, but the wound itself was not, except as to the division of the artery—it might have been inflicted with this knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not a wound on any part of the head be dangerous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not so dangerous as in that situation—it was near some very important arteries—if it had been an inch higher up it would not hire been so dangerous—the temporal artery is a very superficial one, you can feel its pulsations.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Horsford, a surgeon, in Ratcliffe-highway; the prisoner and a woman came in for a pennyworth of tamarinds; and while I was serving another man, a boy came in; I had served the prisoner, and went to look for the coat, and it was gone; I had seen the coat almost immediately before; the prisoner was near that part of the shop where the coat was; I called out, a gentleman ran out and took the prisoner and the woman about one hundred and fifty yards; I examined the man; he had a red cloak swung over his shoulders; I went to examine the woman; a gentleman came up and seized the prisoner, and he instantly dropped something; I saw the things taken up; they were the cloak which he had slung over his shoulders, and the coat with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Could not he have seen the coat if I had it? - I turned over the folds of the cloak, when I seized him, I did not see the coat; I seized the woman who was standing close by, for they were walking when I overtook them; I am positive I saw him drop it.</p>

               <p>How soon did the ship sail after this? - In two or three days; I do not know she staid more; I cannot be sure which.</p>
               <p>Did you lay any information before any Justice of the peace of this before you went? - No, Sir, because I could not find the man; I did not.</p>
               <p>Were these sold you as smuggled goods? - I do not know whether they are or not; they were sold me as such.</p>
               <p>Was this silk or gingham that you bought? - The chief was silk; I do not remember there was any cotton among it.</p>
               <p>Is this prisoner a Custom-house-officer? - I never heard he was; I never saw him before that night; I did not know his name positively at that time, till the next morning; then I found out his name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How far did he live from Mr. Swinney's? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Yes, you do? - It is in Fore-street; I am sure it is not half a mile.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you went to Scotland? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did not you do that? - Because I did not find it.</p>
               <p>How long have you been come from Ireland? - That was the last place I came from; I have been home since the 14th or 15th of August.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you take him up? - I did, a month ago; I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Is it a week ago? - It is more than two weeks.</p>
               <p>Is it three weeks? - I do not know; I could not find out his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - Many people know I was a farmer in Georgia; I live sometimes at Saltpetre-bank; there are more Americans there besides me; I lodge up stairs at a public house, and two of us have a room to ourselves.</p>
               <p>Did you go with the constable to this man's lodgings? - No, Sir, I did not; but I shewed him to the house.</p>
               <p>Now, another thing, upon your oath, did not he let him go, and the prisoner came back to him the next morning? - I did not let him go; I do not know what the constable did; he told me that he took bail of him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know that he let him go on his promise of coming back the next morning? - He told me he took bail of him.</p>

             was at the door when I bought the goods; the first time I saw Callagan was at the end of Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>What might pass between you about it? - I asked him if he had ever found out where Mr. Slimmon lived; he said, he had not.</p>
               <p>Were you and Callagan acquainted? - No, only I knew he was in the house the night I bought the things; he is a duffer; I was sober enough to remember every thing; I had drank some beer.</p>
               <p>How much might you have drank? - That is out of the question.</p>
               <p>No, it is not, it is in the question, it is the question? - I did not measure the mouthfulls I had taken.</p>
               <p>How much money had you got from any body for this gingham that you said you had lost? - Three pounds ten shillings; that was after he was taken and committed to gaol, I got it, and was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Who did you receive it from? - The tall man, that was his brother, and his wife; I was in distress for money; I was obliged to take some.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you have any thing from Government? - It does not belong to this question.</p>
               <p>Yes, it does? - Upon my oath, I had twenty shillings last year, and thirty shillings this year fro m Government.</p>
               <p>Have you got any of those ginghams that you bought? - I sold what was remaining of what I had left in my chest; but all I had about me he took; I had bought more on another day.</p>
               <p>And you took from this man three pounds ten shillings, what is become of that money? - I have laid it out; I never returned it back again.</p>
               <p>Court. I hardly think it right, Gentlemen, after a man has taken the price of his goods, to believe a story that he has been robbed.</p>

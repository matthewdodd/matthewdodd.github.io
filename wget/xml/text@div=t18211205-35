I left town on the 27th of October, and remained out of town till the 24th of November, my family were with me. I left my apartment locked up safe. I had two rooms, one opened into the gallery, and the other led out of that room into the bed-room. It was not connected with the Nag's Head, public-house. When I came home on 24th of November I found the lock prized open, and the locks of the drawers opened, and the articles stated in the indictment gone, which are worth above 3 l. I knew the prisoner when he was a boy, but had not seen him for years. Clemence produced the property to me in Branch's presence.</p>

            . I am a sawyer. I have the first apartment in the gallery; I saw the prisoner in the gallery, on the 18th of November, in the evening, at the prosecutor's door, going in. I watched him, and thought he wanted to break the door open, he came five different times up and down the gallery. I kept watching, and at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050021"></xptr>last saw him come out of the prosecutor's room with a large bag on his back. I stopped him and asked what he had, he said his own clothes, which he got from his mother, Mrs. M'Gray. I said it was false, for he brought them out of the coachman's room. I took him into Potter's room. When we got to Mrs. M'Gray's room which is in the gallery, he ran into her room and got under the bed, we secured him. I gave Clemence the same property as I took from the prisoner. I found the staple of the outer door forced back, and all the boxes and drawers broken open.</p>

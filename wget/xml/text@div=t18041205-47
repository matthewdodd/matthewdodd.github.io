               <p>Prisoner's defence, read in Court, as follows: I humbly beg pardon for writing these few lines. - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will excuse me; I was afraid I should not be able to speak in Court, being very ill, and knowing I am taken innocently by my own first cousin; I was very much distressed, my husband being abroad for three years, and having two helpless children, he pretended to take pity on me; I happened to call on him, and he and his wife were out; there was no one at home but his daughter; she told me that the bundle was left for me, and I did not know the contrary till my cousin came and took me up; he took me from my children, and told me he was going to take me to his wife, but instead of taking me there, to my great surprize, I was taken to the watch-house, and from there to prison; I begged hard for him to have mercy, as it was a mistake, and he owing me some money; I begged him to consider my helpless infants, who had no protector but myself and Almighty God; I hope, Gentlemen, you will shew mercy, as I am innocent of wronging him, and if I had, I did not think so near a relation would serve me so, when he knew the trouble and distress I have been drove to; I humbly beg pardon, and I beg for mercy, as I am innocent of over wronging my cousin, and he still knows it, if he will speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mary Jeffrey.) Did you tell her that bundle, or any bundle was for her? - A. I did not tell her any thing about the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain that there was not any bundle put up for her? - A. I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) What is the worth of that bundle - A. About 16 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner a family? - A. Her husband has left her; she has two children in Wandsworth workhouse.</p>

I was in company with the deceased and several others; I had been there from seven o'clock until that time; I had been drinking very little; I had had a pipe, and some beer; I was playing at cards with an elderly man, whose name I do not know.</p>

            When the prisoner came in, who did he speak to - 
               <persName id="t18161204-93-person733">A. </persName>
            He said he would challenge any man to play for 5l. I had ceased to play then; the cards were on the table;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040043"></xptr>I was picked out by a man of the name of Ingram to play with him. I said I did not want to play with him, as I did not know him. The prisoner appeared to be very little in liquor. When I said that I would not play him, he said I had got no money. I then said I would play him for 5l. He said he would play for 1s., and something to drink. I laughed at him, and said, then you have got no money in your pocket. He made no reply, and I said, I would play him. He borrowed 1s. of Mr. Knight, and put it down, and I gave my money into the custody of Rawley. The landlady then came in, and said, she would have no playing so late at night. I gave her my cards up, but the prisoner was not willing to give her his. The prisoner said, I think you will get drawn as you go home. I said, I do not think that you will draw me. In the course of the evening the prisoner addressed himself to the deceased. The deceased sat by the prisoner while I was beginning to play with him. The prisoner Anderson offered to play him for 5l. The prisoner spoke first to the deceased. The deceased was laughing at what we were saying; when I told the prisoner I was not afraid of his drawing of me. The prisoner offered to play the deceased, and the deceased said, what is the use of playing you, you have no money in your pocket. The prisoner then said, you bl-dy snot, I will produce 5l. within an hour. The deceased said, I will not play you for any thing; I see what sort of a chap you are. The prisoner said, d-n your eyes, I will bl-dy well lick you, if you talk in that way! The deceased said, it would take a better man than him to do it. The prisoner challenged him to fight; he said, will you go out to fight? The deceased said, no, I will not. Then he asked him to play at cards, the deceased said, no, I will not; and called him a foul-mouth-fellow, and said, he would call the landlady to bring a mop and pail to mop his foul-mouth out. The landlady came in by chance, and the prisoner got up, and said, d-n your eyes, I will cut your bl-dy head in two! They were both sitting down before this. The prisoner then made a blow with the pint-pot in his hand, towards the deceased's face, but he checked it; so that it did not hit him. The landlady then attempted to turn the prisoner out; he caught hold of the door, and would not let her. He came back and challenged the deceased to go out and fight; the deceased said, he did not want to have any thing to do with him. The prisoner repeatedly challenged him again, and the deceased said, I suppose I must have a turn-out; I must tight seemingly. They then both agreed to go out and fight. They both went out; the deceased went out first, and the prisoner followed, but not immediately. Nothing more passed after they agreed to fight. I know that the deceased went out first; I went out with some more, and left the prisoner coming out, as it were behind me. But when I got out, he did not follow directly; there might not be a minute between his coming out and mine. I saw the deceased out at the door. When the prisoner came out, he had his hands behind his coat; they were under his coat, behind him. The deceased said, I do not wish to fight here, it being muddy; I will fight you on the turf if you like. There was a field about two hundred yards farther on. The prisoner said, d-n your eyes, you b-r, you shall have it here, and ran at him! The deceased hit out immediately, and they closed; both fell; the deceased was uppermost. They got up by themselves; no sooner had they got up, than they closed again; they both fell again, after a little fighting, during which they were closed all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did that round continue - A. It might last better than a minute; the deceased was uppermost again. The deceased got up, and the prisoner laid on the ground. I saw the deceased get up, and stagger towards a shop, which might be about two yards from where they fell. He fell into the hands of Hutton; I did not hear what he said. Hutton called out that he was cut. I went up to him; the prisoner was laying on the ground all that time. I looked at the deceased, he made a noise as if he was fainting; I saw the blood running from him very fast indeed. He seemed to me to be fainting. He was then carried off to Mr. Taylor's, the doctor; I helped to carry him there; it is about one hundred and eighty yards. I did not hear him speak again; he died in Mr. Taylor's shop; I do not suppose that he lived above two minutes after he got in; it might be about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes from the beginning of the fight to his death. I then went to look for the prisoner, and found him standing near the place where they fought; he was all over blood, and the watchman was standing with him. I told the watchman to take him into custody for murdering the man. The prisoner made no reply. The watchman took him; others told him to take him as well as me. I did not hear the prisoner say any thing. We then went to the watch-house; the prisoner said, who is the man that will give charge of me? Mr. Knight came in, and said, I give charge of him. Mr. Knight had been with us at the public-house; the prisoner was left in custody. The deceased was a silversmith. I observed the prisoner with his hands behind him as soon as he got out of the door. The deceased then said he did not wish to fight; neither of them stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner had his hands behind his coat, could you form any opinion what he was doing - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. You had been playing at cards from seven till eleven o'clock, and had been drinking - A. I had; our spirits might be a little elevated; the company were my friends; the prisoner was known to some of them; he wanted to play for 5l.; I smiled, and said, he had no money.</p>
               <p>Q. You meant this as a taunting expression, or as a retort-A. I did. I was not warm in the least when I said, I was not afraid of his drawing me. I meant that as a taunting expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think that he meant to steal your watch-A. I did; and meant to convey that opinion to him. He asked me where I lived; I thought it strange. I meant to convey to him that I thought him a pick-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased called for a mop and pail to mop his foul-mouth out - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. They fought - A. Yes; they fought two rounds; there was no seconds, all were standing round, about a yard and a half or two yards from them. After the first round the prisoner fell undermost.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the deceased getting up did he say he had been cut-A. I did not hear him. They closed again in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040044"></xptr>stantly. If he had made such a complaint, I should suppose, we should have heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have seen it-A. No; it was dark. I observed the prisoner's head was cut when he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. The blood which covered him might be his own blood - A. No; because his clothes were all bloody in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound in the head given in the first or second round - A. I should think the second; for he fell tremendously heavy; he was undermost both times.</p>
               <p>Court. During the time they were fighting was any person near, so that they might have given the deceased a blow-A. No; I did not see them. There was no ring formed.</p>
               <p>Q. What length of time might the first round occupy-A. Near a minute; the second round was more than a minute, it lasted about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the prisoner be on the ground the first time he fell - 
               <persName id="t18161204-93-person734">A. </persName>
            About a quarter of a minute; as soon as they separated they got up.</p>

                  <persName id="t18161204-93-person735">Q. </persName>
            Had you your eye upon the prisoner when he was on the ground, after the first round - A. I observed them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the prisoner, after he was down the first time, take anything out of his pocket-A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he, without you seeing it - A. I do not think he could; if he had I must have seen it.</p>

            . I was at the Cart and Horse public-house on that day; I went there about eight o'clock. I was in company with Levy, the deceased - He was a silversmith; I had known him for two years. The prisoner came in between eleven and twelve o'clock. As soon as he came in, he said, I'll play any body at cards, for 5l.; several persons said, there is a young man who will play you, pointing out the last witness. I observed that the prisoner was a little intoxicated. Hollier said, that he would play him for 5l.; and the prisoner said, he would play him for a shilling, a glass of liquor, or a pint, I do not know which. They sat down together to play, and the prisoner borrowed a shilling of Mr. Knight; the money was deposited in Rawley's hands. The prisoner then said, Knight, lend me another shilling. Knight said, lose that first. The landlady came in, and said, that there should be no more playing that night; the cards were put up, and the prisoner turned to the deceased, I do not think they had spoken to each other before; the prisoner said, I will play you for 5l., speaking to the deceased, and I will make it good in an hour. The deceased said, how can you do that, you have no money, what do you talk in that way for? The prisoner felt himself agrieved, and made use of very bad language; he took up a pint pot, and said, d-n your eyes, you b-gg-r, I will split your bl-dy head open. The deceased said, do not do that, it will be a pity. The prisoner then said, he would bl-dy well lick him. The deceased told him it would take a better man than him to do it; and said he would call the landlady in to get a pail and a mop to wash his foul mouth out. He put the mug on the table again; the landlady came in at the time, and caught hold of the prisoner, and tried to turn him out; he put his hands on the door, and prevented her. The prisoner then said, several times, that he would fight the deceased. Levy agreed to go out and fight him. The landlady tried to persuade them not to go, but they would. Levy went out first, and the prisoner followed him. Several people went out with them; I was with Levy, before the prisoner. When they came out they walked a little way. Levy said, he would not fight there, it being muddy, but he would on the turf. The prisoner said, no, you b-gg-r, you shall have it here. They went at it directly, no ring was made at that time. The prisoner rushed at him, and they closed directly and fell, the prisoner being under the deceased; they both got up immediately, closed, and fell again, and the prisoner was then under the deceased. The deceased got up, between a stagger and a walk, and went to the other side of the way, against a green-grocer's shop; I caught hold of him, he said, my face is bloody; I took out his handkerchief, and while I was wiping his face, he said, he has cut me. The prisoner was on the ground, I do not know whether he heard him. I immediately helped to take him to Mr. Taylor's.</p>

            When they were on the ground the first time, did you observe any thing particular in the prisoner's con duct - A. No; nor the second time either.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had put his hands in either of his pockets, were you in a situation to see him - A. I was.</p>
               <p>

            If any instrument had been drawn from his pocket, could you have seen it - A. I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were the bye-standers from them - A. About two yards; they were quite separate from them.</p>

               <persName id="t18161204-93-person740">A. </persName>
            Nine or ten. The deceased did not live a minute after he was carried into Mr. Taylor's. He did not speak after he spoke to me at the green-grocer's door. I went back to the place the next morning, there was a great quantity of blood on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. How long had you known the deceased - A. One or two years; I did not know the prisoner more, than from seeing him once or twice. I went to the house about eight o'clock, and was there when the prisoner came in, which was about half-past eleven; he might be in liquor; a man was picked-out to play with him, whom the company thought was the best player.</p>

            He had several against him-A. No; the landlady endeavoured to persuade him not to fight. I went out with Levy, he went out before the prisoner.</p>

                  <persName id="t18161204-93-person742">Q. </persName>
            Did all the company come out of the room - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any come out with the prisoner - A. They followed after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner out, and the landlady trying to keep Levy in-A. No; the deceased was capable of thrashing the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner strike with both hands - A. He rushed at him directly, they closed, and the prisoner was underneath both times; his head was in the mud, I saw it afterwards, it was very bloody. I was about two yards off from them; when they fell their feet were towards me. I cannot say what the prisoner was doing with his hands; I saw nothing in them at any time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Did you hear any person persuade the prisoner not to go out to fight-A. That was Mr. Warder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before he left the house - A. It was at the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040045"></xptr>Q. Did Mr. Rawley persuade him not to fight also - 
               <persName id="t18161204-93-person743">A. </persName>
            He did; he had been playing with him, he sat at the same table.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Rawley and Warder persuade him not to fight before Levy left the room - A. It was before I went out; there was no person near them while they were fighting. I am sure nobody could have cut the deceased, but the prisoner; if they had, I must have seen them. I am sure no person was near enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your eye upon the prisoner. from the time that they began until Levy staggered; and did you notice, so as to be able to see if he did take any thing out of his pocket - A. It was impossible, the time was so short.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it impossible to take it from his pocket after they first began - 
               <persName id="t18161204-93-person744">A. </persName>
            Impossible; when he was down he got up directly, so that there was no time then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in your judgment, if the prisoner cut the deceased with any thing, it must have been in his hand, at the time he began fighting-A. It must, I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

            . I am a jeweller; I was acquainted with the deceased; I was in his company at the Cart and Horse, on the 9th of November last. I was there about eight o'clock. The prisoner came in about a quarter before twelve o'clock, to the best of my recollection. I had been drinking. We were all sober; we had drank about six pots of porter among seven or eight persons; we had been playing at cards. When the prisoner came in, I thought he was rather intoxicated. When he had been in about six minutes, he began talking to us. He challenged to play any one at cards for 5l. Some person told Hollier to play him; and Hollier said, he would play him. They sat down, and agreed to play for a shilling, and something to drink. The prisoner asked Knight to lend him a shilling; when the landlady came in, and said, that there should be no more playing. Hollier put the cards down. The prisoner rose from his chair, with the cards in his hand, and said, I will play any body for 5l. I thought he addressed himself to the deceased. Levy said, if I play you for 5l. you have no money. The prisoner then said, d-n your eyes. The deceased said, bring in a mop and a pail, that I may wash his foul-mouth out, for it is very foul. The prisoner then took up a pint pot, and said, I will cut your bl-dy eyes out; addressing himself to the deceased. The deceased seeing him coming, rose up, and said, do not do that, for it will be a pity; and put himself in a posture for defence. The prisoner said, I see you are fightable, are you? The deceased said, no, I am not; nor do I wish to fight. The landlady took hold of the prisoner's shoulders to turn him out, saying, you shall not stop; he came back to the place where she had drove him from, and insisted on fighting with the deceased. Levy sat down afterwards; he was in his seat when the landlady was turning the prisoner out. When the prisoner returned, he said, will you fight? The deceased said, he would not. At last the deceased said, I see nothing else will do, I will go out and fight him. He got off his seat to go out; he went out before the prisoner, I, and some others, went out with him. I saw the prisoner by the door, he stood with one hand behind him, under his coat, in this way (Here the witness put his right-hand under his coat-flap, near the waist); there were several standing by the side of him. I told the deceased he had better not fight on the stones. He said, I do not want to fight at all, but if I do, it shall be on the turf; the prisoner then said, you shall fight, and rushed at him; some blows were struck on both sides, and they got nearly into the middle of the road - They both fell; Levy was at the top; they both jumped up, they were not down a second; they rose directly; I did not observe whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand at the time; there was nobody near enough to strike them all the time-no person interfered to pick them up. They began fighting again; they closed as soon as they got up; I saw the prisoner had his left arm round Levy's neck, and his other hand as if striking him, when they fell again; Levy was uppermost; he rose of his own accord, and staggered about three yards-he said nothing in my hearing; they might be about a minute on the ground the second time.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there then time enough for the prisoner to take any thing out of his pocket-A. No; I do not think he could, I was near enough to see him; I do not think at that time he could; I went to assit Levy, and heard some person say that he was dying. I found him lying on the ground, bleeding very fast. The prisoner lay in the middle of the road; Mr. Knight ran and picked him up. I attended on Levy, and went to Mr. Taylor's with him - He died there very soon. I returned with Mr. Knight, to look for the prisoner, and found him standing near the place where we left him. Somebody said, "Why Bill, you have killed him." I did not hear him make any answer. The prisoner was then very bloody. I observed the blood run from the back part of his head; there was also blood on the front of the prisoner's clothes. He was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. You knew the prisoner; there was no pretence for any body to say, that he was a thief-A. Nobody said he was. I saw them the whole time that they were fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. If, at the commencement of the battle, he had a knife in his hand, you would have noticed it-A. No; I should not have noticed, whether he was striking or cutting.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-93-person746">Q. </persName>
            After the first round Levy sprang up-A. Yes; and as soon as both were up they began fighting; there was no time for any complaint; if he had been cut, I suppose, he would have desisted. They were down, the second time, about half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Half a minute was a sufficient time for a man to draw a knife from his pocket - A. I should suppose so; I did not see him do it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, then, that the thing was impossible to be done-A. No; I do not mean to say so.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see, that the prisoner took any thing from his pocket, from first to last-A. I am certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was possible for him to do it when he was fighting - A. I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to have done it when he was on the ground the first time-A. I do not think it was possible.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time - A. It was not impossible, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for the prisoner, during the time they were on the ground the second time, to have cut the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040046"></xptr>deceased in more places than one - A. He might have done it, and I not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was time enough while he was on the ground to have got the knife out of his pocket, and cut him - A. There was time; but I should think he could not have got it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-93-person747">Q. </persName>
            This might depend on the pocket it was in - A. It might, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it improbable, but not impossible - A. Not impossible.</p>

            . I was at the Cart and Horse public-house on the 9th of November; I have known the prisoner five or six years He came in about a quarter before twelve o'clock; I did not know that he was coming; he appeared intoxicated. I was of the same party as Levy. When the prisoner came in, he joined the party at our table, and said, who will play for 5l. A person of the name of Ingram pointed Hollier out; they agreed to play, and I lent the prisoner a shilling; he was, at that time, perfectly in good humour. The cards were produced, but the landlady insisted that there should be no playing at so late an hour. The prisoner would still keep challenging the company to play for 5l.; he addressed no one in particular, that I saw; there was a wrangle between the prisoner and the deceased, I was at the same table with them. I heard the deceased say, what is the use of playing you for 5l. you have not got a shilling about you. There were some expressions used by the prisoner, but I cannot say what they were; after that, the deceasad said, ring the bell for the landlady to bring a pail and mop, to mop his foul-mouth out. Then the prisoner said, I will cut your bl-dy head in two, taking up the pint pot at the same time. The landlady came in, or was in, and she took the pot out of his hand, and insisted on their not fighting there, and did all she could to turn the prisoner out, but she could not. The prisoner returned to Levy; I do not know what he said. It was the wish of the prisoner to fight - They agreed to go out and fight; the deceased went out first; I detained the prisoner at the parlour-door, and said, "Bill do not fight, for you are in the wrong, he gave you no particular offence, why should you fight?" He said, d-n me, I will fight. I then let him go; I went first, and he followed behind me. I stood to see what followed. When I got out the prisoner got before me, and stood before me. I heard the deceased say, I will not fight here - I will go upon the turf. The prisoner answered, d-n you, you shall have it here; and immediately set to. They fought, and the prisoner closed with the deceased in the first round. I saw the deceased fall, but did not see the prisoner fall. They had a second round, and were closed all the time. The whole of the rounds did not exceed two minutes and a half. They fell the second time-the prisoner was undermost. I assisted the prisoner in getting up, and placed him against a wall, my attention was chiefly directed towards him; I do not know whether he was bleeding at the time. Levy was against the door of a green-grocer; the witnesses were attending him - I assisted in carrying him to Mr. Taylor's, I observed him blecding very much, and there he died; I had left the prisoner at the corner of Sutton-street, I went back, and found him in the same place; his clothes were covered with blood. All the front of him, from his head to his boots, were all bloody. He was given in charge. Several persons examined the spot where they had been fighting, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was the prisoner searched in your presence-A. He was; there was no instrument found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the passage dissuading him from fighting, were you alone-A. No; there was somebody else, but I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the passage before him, did he follow directly - A. I stood on the step, and he got before me; it was all but going out together. I did not observe any thing in his hands at any time, nor did I see him take any thing out of his pocket. He had the appearance of being drunk; we persuaded him not to fight. I heard no complaint made by either after the first round; nobody went within a yard and a half of them. The deceased was shorter and stouter than the prisoner. When they fell I was on the prisoner's left side; his right-hand was out of my observation; I saw him at the watchhouse; he had a cut on his head, and his hair was discoloured with blood.</p>
               <p>Court. You was with him in the passage; can you tell whether he had, or had not, a knife in his hand -

            For any thing I know he might have had it. He had not got a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the cuff of his coat came over his hands - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. During the fight was there any body sufficiently near Levy to cut him - A. I believe not; I cannot answer that positively. I saw them all the time, and I do not recollect seeing any body sufficiently near.</p>
               <p>Q. From first to last, did you see the prisoner take any thing out of his pocket - A. I did not; I should think he could not do it without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that it was impossible he should - A. I do; for it must have taken up some time; I am possitively sure, that when they fell, the last time, there was nothing taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so positive - A. The time was so short.</p>

               <p>GEORGE PAYNE. I am a jeweller; I was at the Cart and Horse, on the night of the 9th of November; the prisoner came there, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock. I was not with Levy's party; I was in the same room; when the prisoner came in, he was rather abusive, and appeared to be in liquor. I did not particularly notice his conduct; a quarrel arose between the deceased and the prisoner; I think it was about cards; somebody advised them to go out and fight; they went out; I followed them; I believe I went out with them; when I got out I was on the side of the deceased; he said, he would fight on the turf; I did not observe the prisoner in particular; I am not certain, but I think the prisoner was out first; I believe I went out after him. When I first saw the prisoner, after I had got out, I believe he was standing; when the deceased said, he would fight on the turf, the prisoner said, he would fight there, and commenced fighting; I do not know how they began to fight; I did not see the prisoner take any thing from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there time enough for him to do it - A. There was, while they were fighting.</p>

            Could it be done, while they were fighting, without your observing it-A. I think it could; I do not think they were together two minutes; they closed and fell, and got up, and fell again; the deceased got up and staggered towards the shop; he was all over blood; I did not observe the prisoner, my attention was directed to Levy; he articulated something, I do not know what; I went to Mr. Taylor's with him. I saw the prisoner at the watchhouse, his clothes were very bloody in front; I did not see them behind; his clothes were very much stained with blood, rather upwards; I did not observe any blood on his legs. He did not complain; I was a stranger to both of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Did you see the whole of the fight - A. I did; they both fell, and got up at the same time; they closed, and made no complaint; if he had been cut, he had an opportunity of saying so. I did not observe the blows; when the deceased got up, the second time, I saw blood upon him. I did not observe any blow after the first round; I had no opportunity of seeing.</p>
               <p>Q. Though the prisoner had not time to take a knife out of his pocket, had he not time to take it up in his hand, if it laid on the ground near him - A. I think it might be so.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw no knife in his hand, before they began fighting - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the contest do you think the prisoner might take up a knife-A. While they were on their legs.</p>

I am a watchman, in Goswell-street, close to Sutton-street; I knew the prisoner; on the night of the 9th of November, I found the prisoner, leaning against a post, at the corner of Sutton-street; I said, hallo! what do you do here? - he said, I have been used exceedingly ill; there were nobody by at the time. I said, who has used you ill; he said, nobody, but a set of rascals have cut and beat me. I asked him who they were; he said, he did not know. I lifted my lanthorn up to see if there was any body near. I saw he was bloody; I said, you are covered with blood and mud, and have no bat on; he said, I am cut all to pieces; I said, where; he said, I am cut over my head, and bruised all over; a man came up and said, here is your hat; the prisoner took it, and said, it is not my hat, take it again; I asked the man, whether he knew him; he said, no; another man came up with another hat; I took the hat from the man, and put it on the prisoner's head; the prisoner was given in charge; I took him to the watch-house; there was a great quantity of blood on the pavement, where he was standing; this was about twelve yards from the Cart and Horse.</p>

There are about nineteen cuts or stabs in the coat, in different places; in the collar, back, and side; they appear to be done by some instrument; all the cuts appear to be done in the same way. (I produce both Levy's clothes and the prisoner's.) Levy's clothes have nineteen cuts in the coat; five in the waistcoat, and three in the pantaloons; there is also a cut in his neck-handkerchief; the cuts in the waistcoat and coat correspond.

I cannot say what sort of a knife it was; I only saw the blade, it appeared to be about two inches and a half long, like mine (producing one).

I went to the Cart and Horse, and said, that I had the handkerchief; it is the same handkerchief which I gave to Hutt, and in the same state as when I took it off the neck of the deceased.</p>

            . I live in Clarke-street, Sutton-street. I remember going to the Cart and Horse public-house, to look for my father; I went into the passage, and beard two men talking about fighting. I did not know them. I saw two men come out afterwards. I do not know what day of the week it was; it is a long while ago.</p>
               <p>JAMES BOW, Sen. I came home about a quarter before one o'clock, on the morning of the 10th of November; I do not know that my son had been out on that night; I left the key in the door, and found it in the same state.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Goswell-street. On Saturday night, the 9th of November, the deceased Levy was brought to my house; he was in a dying state when he was brought in. About a quarter of an hour after his death, I examined his body; I first examined his head, and found a transverse cut, of about three inches in length, which must have been done by a sharp instrument; a knife would have done it. Between the mouth and the ear, on the left cheek, there was a crucial incision, which, I consider, had been done by an instrument. There were several more wounds on the chest and other parts of the body, in the bowels and on the hip;(I did not observe any on the neck) and on the upper part of his right thigh there was a wound of about three quarters of an inch in length, and about one inch, or one inch and a half, in width; on the other thigh there was another wound of about half an inch in depth, but merely muscular. I have no doubt but that the wound on the right thigh was the cause of his death; the main artery of the thigh, which we call the farmicular artery, was cut through, which, if not immediately stopped, death is certain. A man would bleed to death in a quarter of an hour from such a wound. His dress was so muddy that I did not take any notice of it. His right-hand was wounded between the thumb and fore-finger; they were cut through, and separated. It appeared to be done by a sharp instrument being drawn through the hand; all these wounds appeared to be fresh, and all to be given by the same instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such a knife as that produced have made these wounds-A. I should have thought it was rather narrower than that blade.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a man to be fighting, might he have gone on another round without knowing that he was wounded-A. I should think he might, providing the wound in the thigh was not given, or the other wounds, altogether eight of them, might have been given without a man's knowing it. If he was fighting, he might have gone on, they would not be felt at the time. It very often happens when a mortal wound is given that it is not felt at the time.</p>

                  <persName id="t18161204-93-person761">Q. </persName>
            Would any of the wounds prevent articulation - A. The wound on the face would. I did not probe the head, as I thought it unnecessary.</p>
               <p>Court. The deceased could not have died from the breaking of a blood-vessel, or from apoplexy - A. He could not. The greatest depth of the wounds was an inch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. My feelings are so much hurt at this most dreadful calamity that has happened, that I cannot say any thing; I therefore leave it to the court.</p>

In consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation, last Monday night, I went to the prisoners' house, at Greenwich, and found them both there—I believe they are married—I took the male into custody, and gave him to another constable to take to the station—I then searched, and in a cupboard, under some clothes, I found a half-pint pewter pot (<hi rend="italic">produced),</hi> with "H. Lovegrove" on it; and under the table I found this can (<hi rend="italic">produced),</hi> with "H. Lovegrove" on it—they were at tea at the table, and the cloth over the table, so that I could not see the can without removing the cloth—I then searched under the bed, leaving the pot and can by the door, and when I turned round again the pot was gone—I asked the female what she had done with it—she denied having had it—I searched again, could not find it in the room, and seeing a pot boiling on the fire, I took the lid off, and found it there—the male had then gone to the station—there was no one but the female within reach of the pot.</p>

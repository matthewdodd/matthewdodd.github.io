I am shopman to Mrs. Fanny Stewart, a pawnbroker at Putney—on the afternoon of the 19th of December, at near five o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop to pledge a shirt, but I did not take it in—not two minutes after she was gone out of the shop, I missed the corduroy jacket now produced—nobody had been in the shop after she was there—there were several present at the time she was.</p>

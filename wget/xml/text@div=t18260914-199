On the 6th of July I missed the truck, and found it afterwards in the possession of Parker - I was with my apprentice in Union-street, Borough, and he pointed out the prisoner Chinn to me; Parker and Taylor were with me in a cart - we went up to Chinn, and asked him if he had had a truck from Hackney-road - he said No; I had the wrong man - we took him to Mrs. Parker, who said, "That is the man;" and, before I put him into the watch-house, he said he would tell me all about it - I had held out no promise or threat to him - he gave me this address, "T. Dyer, Lower-road, Islington," who, he said, was the man who sent him for the truck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What had he had to drink in the public-house before he gave you the address? A. He had some dinner, and we had about three pots of porter between three of us - we had no spirits - I treated him because he said he had no money, and had nothing to eat all day - I began to talk with him, and got this information from him - he gave me the address.</p>

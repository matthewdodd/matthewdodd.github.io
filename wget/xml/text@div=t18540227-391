                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 129). On 16th Feb. I was in Upper East Smithfield, about a quarter before 4 o'clock—I saw the prisoners following a lady, and Ellis put his left hand into her dress pocket—I watched them, and saw a second lady come along, and he put his hand into her pocket; and also a third lady—they then crossed the road, went behind a gentleman, and followed him—Ellis put his hand under his coat tail—the prisoners then stepped back, and spoke together—they went through Postern-row—I ran through Little George-street, and saw them again—they went to the Happy Family, and passed it—the prosecutor and another sailor came along, arm in arm—as soon as they passed by the prisoners, they turned and followed them, and Ellis went before them, and looked back at them; he then jostled back on the right side of the prosecutor, put his right arm against his breast, and put his left hand into his waistcoat pocket—Smith was close behind him—I caught hold of the prisoners, and called to the sailor, and asked if he had lost anything—he felt his pocket, and said, "I have lost a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—both the prisoners resisted, and tried to get away—I was surrounded, and several called out, "Let the boys go, you vaga<lb></lb>bond"—the prosecutor assisted me to get the prisoners to the Shipping-office, where I got assistance—I was surrounded by more than a hundred persons—I found no note.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of Octber, about half-past eleven o'clock in the day; I met the two prisoners in Swan-street, about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutors; they were driving two pigs - each of them had a stick; I went up to them, and Dye ran away, leaving the other with the pigs - Dye knew me; I went up to Cushion, and asked whose they were; he said they belonged to the father of the boy who had run away - he said he met Dye driving them, and he told him his father would give him 1d., if he would assist him in driving them home; I took Cushion to the watch-house, and drove the pigs to the Green-yard - I then went and took Dye at his father's house' before I spoke to either of the boys I heard a man ask if the pigs were for sale, and Cushion said Yes, for 12s. each; Dye heard that, and that was what struck my attention - when I went to Dye's father, I saw Dye looking at the side of the door, and when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230075"></xptr>saw me, he ran up stairs - I went up after him. and before I asked him any question, he said "The pigs did not belong to me, they belonged to the boy Cushion; and he asked if I would assist him in driving them to Mrs. Paget's;" I took Dye, and found the owne.</p>

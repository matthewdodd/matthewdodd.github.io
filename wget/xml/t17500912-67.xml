Then we found a hole made, by taking out about six bricks, close to the frme of the door, and my drawers strip'd of most of my linen. The servant maid can give a better account of the particulars.

            . My husband used to go out with these young men. On the 26th of May, my husband happened to be a little fuddled. We lived in Bell-yard, Chick lane. He would not go out with them. Between three and four the next morning they knock'd at the door, and my husband let them in; then George Taylor said, you dog, you would not go with us. I saw him take the linen out of a pillow bear, this apron was left in my drawers. Holding a baker's white apron in her hand, which the prosecutor deposed to. My husband said, let me be never so wicked myself, you shall not come into any trouble; and bid me go and pawn it, which I did, for six pence. On the Monday morning they carried the goods, which were shirts and shifts, and a child's frock all iron'd up well, to Duke's place and sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say where they got this linen?</p>
               <p>E. Cross. They said they had been into Coldbath-fields, and had broke open a baker's shop, they all three said so. I gave this information to a man who fetched the apron out of pawn by my directions. I was willing to clear myself, as my husband is transported, so I desired that person to tell the prosecutor</p>

I found the chairs displaced, which stood against the wall, and a hole broke in the wall close by the door in the kitchen; the drawers were open, and I found three or four shirts gone; five shifts, two frocks, and one white apron, which we had been ironing on the Friday night, were also gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 549). On 24th May, at 3.30 p.m., I was on London Bridge, in plain clothes—there was a crowd about three parts of the way over the bridge looking at a horse that had fallen down—I saw Mrs. Pitt and the prisoner there—I saw him go to her right hand side when she was looking at the horse, and put his left hand in her dress</p>

               <p>pocket, he then took hold of her dress with his right hand, and removed his left from her pocket—he was about to go across the road, and I saw him look at his hand—he was about a yard from me; I seized his left hand and his collar—I could not see what was in his hand—he wrenched his hand from mine and struggled a little—I then saw five shillings lying on the ground at his feet; I picked up two separate shillings and a little boy picked up another, and another constable picked up a florin—Mrs. Pitt was on the pavement, and I directed another constable to speak to her, and he did so—the prisoner was closely and heard what she said—she said "I have not lost anything"—on the way to the station he said "That money is not mine that you picked up," but at the station he said "That is mine"—I charged him with stealing five shillings from Mrs. Pitt—he said "It fell from my pocket when you caught hold of me," showing me his pocket which had a hole in it—I did not see it fall from him as I was struggling with him—the lady was at the station, and she there said she had not lost anything—she directly afterwards made a different statement which she repeated in the prisoner's presence saying she had lost five shillings, and describing the money—she had seen the money—the prisoner said "Oh, Christ, you have been speaking to her."</p>

I am the wife of George Pitt, of Manor House, Mitcham——I was on London Bridge, at 3 o'clock, on 24th May, looking at a horse whish had fallen; I had this money given me at 10 o'clock that morning, in Bishopsgate Street, for a poor family—I put it in this pocket; it is a a loose one, and I do not remember taking it out again—a constable spoke to me in the afternoon on London Bridge, I forgot at first that I had the money, I never thought of it again for five hours—I believe the five shillings consisted of three shillings and a florin—I remembered a few minutes after that. I had had the money in my pocket.</p>

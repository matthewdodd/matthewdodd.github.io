                  </hi>. I keep the Prince Regent beer-shop, in King's-road, Chelsea. On a Thursday morning, three years ago, I went in the garden adjoining my skittle-ground, and missed a large game cock—I went to the prisoner's shop in Orchard-street, and while there I heard the cock crow—I was acquainted with its voice—I could tell it from the voice of any other—I charged the prisoner with having it—he denied it—I went into the kitchen, and found the cock in a cupboard—the prisoner then said he had purchased it of a person the night previous—I took the fowl, and went with him to a man named Lee, in Bruton-street—the prisoner then proposed to go home and get his horse ready, and he would go with me to a man with a white hat, who he said he had bought the cock of—he then went away and did not return—he had before that asked me the price of the cock, so that he knew it was mine—I had a fowl-house in my garden—some of my fowls used to roost there at night, and some go in the trees.</p>

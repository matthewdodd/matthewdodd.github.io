            . I took the prisoner on another charge, and when I put him into the cage I went to Mrs. Osborne's for another article, which I found in her shop - she then told me of the mutton, and I told the prisoner of it; he denied any knowledge of it. I saw James Osborne take it out; I then told the prisoner so, and he said, "I had it, it is true - I put it there;" I asked what he meant to do with it - had he spoken to the person who had some other meat of him - he said he should have spoken to him first; that was all he said. I saw Osborne take it from a hole in the privy.</p>

In about five minutes, I heard a voice behind me, saying, Mr. Holloway, you are the man I want. As soon as I heard the prisoner's voice it terrified me, because he had frequently before threatened my life. I started round to my left, and I saw the prisoner close to me; he was then on foot, and had a pistol, which I then believed to be my own, that I had lent him some time before. It was under the flap of his coat; I could see it as far as to the cock; he endeavoured to pull it out with his left hand, but it was so entangled that he could not get it out immediately. I sprung round in order to get into my house, and was in hopes I should have got in before he disentangled it; but he got to the door before I could shut it after me, and got the pistol in between the door and the door post, so as to prevent my shutting the door. I endeavoured for the space of a second or two, to keep the door against him; I found he was too powerful for me. As I saw the kitchen door open, I quitted to door thinking to escape into the kitchen. As I was quitting the street door, he said, d - n you, I will have your life directly: and the pistol went off before I could get myself quite into the kitchen, and the ball went through my left arm, then I saw him go over to Mr. Peck's a founder.</p>
               <p>Q. When he d - d you, and said he would have your life, did you see in what manner he held the pistol?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I was making for the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation is the kitchen from the door?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The kitchen opens out of the wainscot on the left side of the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the road did you live on?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The same side as Bloomsbury; the door opens to the left, and the kitchen door is on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the street door been opened?</p>
               <p>Holloway. After I felt the ball, I turned round and saw him shutting the street door, which was then half open. The pistol must be brought upon a straight line to reach me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the ball found?</p>
               <p>Holloway. One was in the kitchen, upon a line with the position of my arm; another upon the head-way of the door of the passage that leads into the yard: it went into the brick wall.</p>
               <p>Q. You was executor to the prisoner's brother, I think?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard the prisoner threaten you at any time?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes, many times. About the Sunday fortnight before he shot me, he killed a hen of mine: I was out; the maid told me of it when I came home. I saw the prisoner at the door; I said, you are a blood-thirsty fellow; I am surprized you will be guilty of such blood-thirsty actions. He said, G - d d - n you, I would sooner kill you than your hen. - I sent to Mr. Sheldon, the surgeon, he was not at home; so I went to the hospital and had my arm dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason why he had malice towards you?</p>
               <p>Holloway. There was some money secreted, which I went and demanded for the benefit of the children and the widow; before that, he was as agreeable as any man; but, after that, he owned me a spleen. He came to me next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050013"></xptr> morning, and said, G - d d - n you, you have frustrated our scheme. I said, What do you mean; He said, We wanted to go to Barnet to buy cows. I said, If it is requisite, for the good of the children, to buy cows, you shall have the money again, and I will go with you to buy them. He said, No, G - d d - n you, I wanted to buy them in my own name.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the prisoner a man of a very weak understanding</p>
               <p>Holloway. I never held a great deal of conversation with him, so don't know the extent of his abilities.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not reason to think he is out of his mind, at times?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I never heard any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you threaten to have him pressed?</p>
               <p>Holloway. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistol was your own, was it not?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes. I had lent it him some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. What for?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The widow said she was robbed the night her husband died. The prisoner came and told me so; and, at the same time, asked for a pistol: I lent it him. He said, he was in danger of his life in going over the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the pistol went off by accident, or by design?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I believe, by design. [This is the pistol, producing a horse pistol.]</p>

            . I am all enameller, and live in Mr. West's Garden's, Tottenham-court-road. I was going by Mr. Holloway's house, I saw him and a man with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What man?</p>
               <p>Fournier. I am not sure that the prisoner is the man - I saw Mr. Holloway, his child, and the man together; they seemed to have words. Mr. Holloway, all of a sudden, made a push to get into his own house; the man followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish what off, the words were?</p>
               <p>Fournier. When the pistol went off, he said, D - n you. I saw him push the, pistol in at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the man when the pistol went off?</p>
               <p>Fournier. Close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you?</p>
               <p>Fournier. I was within about three or four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the cock fall? Or how did it go off?</p>
               <p>Fournier. I heard the snap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive whether the door was open, or shut?</p>
               <p>Fournier It could not be shut, the pistol was between the door and the door-post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive whether the door opened wide?</p>
               <p>Fournier. It did not open quiet; he held his hand up thus [describing the presenting of a pistol, elevated pretty high] The door was open thus much. [Describing it to be about five inches.]</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pistol quite out of sight when it went off?</p>
               <p>Fournier. No; it was about half of it out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Fournier. He went away directly. The child cried, My papa is killed. The child was shut out of doors; I knocked at the door; a woman opened it; Mr. Holloway came out that instant, he held up his arm; I said, Thank God you are alive. He said, I am wounded. I saw the wound in his arm, the blood trickled down. I saw the prisoner cross the way as soon as he had fired the pistol. I was in a great fright; I made haste home.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner's arm was hurt by the door?</p>
               <p>Fournier. I can't tell any thing of that.</p>

I ran down the road, when I came to the corner of Mr. Holloway's house the mob pushed back, and said he was going to fire again. Mr. Richmond and some more people brought the prisoner out. The people asked him how he came to do such a rash action.

Mr. Howard and I opened his arm next morning; there was a wound through his arm; the ball seemed to have entered the arm a little above the wrist, from the internal surface of the arm, and penetrated to the out-side a little below the elbow, obliquely upwards, the wound was 8 or 9 inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a wound occasioned by a ball.</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Certainly. It was under the elbow on the out-side of the arm.</p>

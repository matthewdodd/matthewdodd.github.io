                  </hi>. I live Bayham-street, and am a bleacher of linen. My wife is a laundress—the prisoner had been my servant for five weeks—we went to the play on Saturday night, the 13th of February—I had eighty sovereigns in the house—I went into the parlour, and secreted them in a bag in the fire place, and covered it with the ashes—I left the prisoner at home—I returned from the play, and found the room door quite safely locked as I had left it—I then had my supper, and went to bed—the next morning my wife went to the cinders, and came and said something to me at near twelve o'clock on Sunday—I missed five sovereigns—I spoke to the prisoner she denied all knowledge of it—I told her I missed five</p>

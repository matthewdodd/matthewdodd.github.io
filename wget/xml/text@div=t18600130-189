                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster living at Bower-street, Commercial-road-east—on the night of 12th January I retired to bed about 12 o'clock—before doing so I had locked and bolted She doors, and made the house secure—I took up a newspaper to my bedroom with me, and after reading it for some time I threw it on the floor—in about an hour, or an hour and a half, as I was between asleep and awake, I heard the paper crumpling—I listened attentively, and still heard it crumpling—thinking it was the cat, I</p>

               <p>Called out; and as soon I had done so I heard the footsteps of some person going down the stairs—I directly raised the cry of "Police"—I got a light and went down stairs, but did not see any body—the prisoner was brought in by a policeman soon after—I then examined the premises—there is a large area, ten feet deep, in front of the house, protected by an iron railing five feet high—I found a cord tied round the, bottom of the railing, having a small eyelet hole to it—that would enable a person to slip down the area—the fastening of the window had then been opened by some sharp instru<lb></lb>ment, and the sash thrown up—next day a pair of spectacles was picked up and brought to me—they had been in the kitchen the night before in a little workbox—I had seen them there at 10 o'clock.</p>

On the morning of 13th January, about a quarter-to 3 o'clock, I was on duty in Bower-street, and saw the prisoner running along bare-footed, with his boots under his arm—he was about 100 yards from the prosecutor's house, running from it—before I could speak to him he said, "He is gone up there; policeman, follow him," pointing to the Commercial-road—I said, "What do you mean?* he said, "On my word, it is quite true"—I asked him what he was doing with the boots under his arm—he said they were his own, that he had just taken them off—I said, "I will soon see what you have been up to"—I took him into custody, and took him down the street—in a few minutes I heard the prose<lb></lb>cutor's father hallooing out, "Stop him, stop him," and I took the prisoner into the house—I found on him a lot of lucifers, a bradawl, a knife, a purse containing 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a box containing some snuff—at the station I asked him what he was doing down the area—he said he supposed he was drunk, and must have tumbled down—the sergeant asked him what he meant by break<lb></lb>ing the window; he said he supposed he broke it with his toe—he then asked him what he was doing up stairs under the bed, and he said he went up there for curiosity's sake—these spectacles were picked up by a person living in the same street—I did not see them picked up—the prosecutor gave them to me at the police-court.</p>

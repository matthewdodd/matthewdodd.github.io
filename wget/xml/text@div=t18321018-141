               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are Yorkchambers an extensive range of buildings? A. I did not go into them, but rang the porter's bell - I had known the prisoner about seven years ago; he then bought a few articles, which he paid for; he called about fourteen months ago, and asked me to trust him for some tackle; I said we did not give credit - I did not recollect him till he made himself known to me; he said he had been abroad, and in Ireland part of the time; he was in a counting-house in Finsbury-square, I believe, when I dealt with him; he took these goods with him.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Jones, Lloyd, and Co. I know the prisoner - he had no account with us on the 31st of August; he had an account once, but drew his balance out on the 19th of March, 1831; the draft in question was presented to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Since 1827; he had a large account at our house; his returns might be 20,000l. in 1827, and in 1828, 40,000l.; that was not a balance; I did not know his father - this is his pass book (looking at it) - it goes from 1827 till the 19th of March, 1831 - his balance on the 25th of December, 1827, was 1095l., and on the 16th of May, 1828, 90l.; he drew that out by two drafts; he drew nothing in 1827 and 1830; the balance in 1829 was 4l. 10s. 3d., and he had the same balance at Christmas 1830 and 1831- the last transaction was on the 11th of June, 1828; the balance was against him then; he had overdrawn 35l. 8s. - he paid in something after that.</p>

About a week previous to the 9th of August, the prisoner came to the shop - he said his name was Landmann, and he had come respecting a debt that was in our books, in 1827 - I did not know him in 1827; he said, if I turned to the books, I should find it so - I did so, and gave him a memorandum of a book, which came to 1l. 8s. - he said, "That is right, I shall want more books, I will call in a week, and pay for them - you had better give me a catalogue;" he came on the 9th of August, selected books, which came to 2l. 5s., and after farther conversation respecting business, he said "Well,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180073"></xptr>I will be content with these at present; can you change me a ten?" of course, I thought he meant a 10l. note, but he handed me a 10l. cheque; I said I could not change it, but on looking into the till, and being led away by his address, I said I could advance him 3l. on it, if that would do; he said well he would take that, I gave him the 3l.; he left the cheque, and said he would call next morning for the balance - he did not call; I offered to send the books home for him; he said there was not the least occasion for that, as he was only at Searle's coffee-house, in Carey-street - he took them with him; I never saw him again till the 13th of October, when I met him on Ludgate-hill; immediately he saw me he ran away - I pursued; he looked round, and in his hurry, ran into the road, and slipped down - I secured him; the cheque was never paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you enough money to change the 10l.? A. Yes; if it had been a Bank note I should have given it all; I had strong suspicions; as I had no adviser in the business, I did not like to give the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you gave the 3l. rather from his genteel manner than from the cheque? A. No; I thought I should take more on myself than I ought if I gave the whole, as it was not a Bank note, and thought if it was not good, I should be no greater loser - I have not got the books back.</p>

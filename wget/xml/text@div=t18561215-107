                  </hi>. I am shopman to John Henry Tapper and another, woollen drapers, of No. 75, Bishopsgate-street. On 28th Nov., about 5 o'clock, the prisoners and another woman came—the one not present asked to be shown some black cloth to make a mantle—Mr. Long served her, but I was close by; he showed them three or four pieces, but none of them suited—I then assisted, in order to effect a sale—nothing was fine enough or glossy enough to suit them—when they were about to leave, Bashfield was five or six yards in advance of the other two, and on leaving the doorway I noticed something bulky about her person, which raised my suspicions; I followed her to the street, and saw her drop a piece of doeskin on the pavement—I raised an alarm, Long came out, ran after her, and brought her back—this is the doeskin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is Messrs. Tapper's property, and was within two or three yards of the door—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or guineas—I lost sight of the other women, but when I went to the station I saw Gray outside the door, and gave her into custody—they all three looked at the cloth.</p>

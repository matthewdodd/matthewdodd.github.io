The prisoner was in his service, and lived in the house. On Monday evening, the 24th of April, I put into the cash-box ten sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a crown-piece, half-a-crown, a 10l., and a 5l. note, a draft for 22l., two bills of exchange, for 37l. 2s. 6d., one for 24l., one for 5l, one for 40l., one for 50l., three for 20l., one for 22l. 17s. 10d., two for 24l. 5s., and one for 9l. 4s. 5d. I locked them in the cash-box, and put it into the iron-chest, about half past eight o'clock in the evening; the prisoner slept in the house at that time; I went home about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, returned about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and he was gone, and the property also; he did not return. I went to Kidderminster on the Wednesday week after, and found him in custody there. I found the iron-chest locked as I had left it: I had put the key of it into my own desk, which I locked up. I found my own desk broken open, and the key of the iron-chest gone - I have never seen it since. The prisoner had not intimated to me that he was going to leave; nobody was aware of it; none of the property has been found; there were other servants in the house, who still remain there. When I saw him at Kidderminster I told him he had made a bad job of it, and asked him where the property was. I held him out neither threat or promise - he denied all knowledge of it at that time, and did not account for his leaving so suddenly. The property amounts to 230l.; he was searched at Kidderminster, and some silver and a sovereign were found on him.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MUNN. I live at No. 33, Oxford-street, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone. The prisoner gave me no idea of his intention to leave; there might be a trifle of wages due to him. I was out of town at the time of the robbery. I have never found the key of the chest, nor recovered any of the property.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Munn, and sleep in the house. The last time I saw the prisoner was at a quarter past eight o'clock, or a few minutes after, on the night in question - Berry had then gone out - I did not see the prisoner leave the house - he was screwing up the bolts of the shutters at that time - he had given no intimation of his going away; I did not see him afterwards till he was apprehended; if any wages were due to him it was very trifling. I went out at a quarter past eight, returned at half-past eight, and he was then gone, and the door not fastened, as it usually is; he always used to lock and bolt it after me when I went out, but I found it not locked, and only the bolt dropped. I had told him to fasten it after me when I went out, and heard him bolt and lock it, but when I returned he was gone, and only the bottom bolt dropped - it is a double door.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Munn's service on the 24th of April. The last time I saw the prisoner in the house was a little after eight o'clock; I had not heard he was going to leave. I had a candle lighted when I saw him; he came inside the kitchen door, and wiped his hands - I asked where he was going - he said he was going to fasten the door after Smith, which he always did. I let Smith in, and found only the bolt slipped. I found all the house safe when I got up in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope your Lordship will take my case into consideration - it being the first time I was ever here, or before any Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. MUNN. He lived about three months with me - I took him without a character, as he was starving - he had 15l. a year and his board.</p>

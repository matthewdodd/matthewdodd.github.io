About a quarter past six I was at work on my shop board in the right hand shop, my wife had just come from the left hand shop, in which these things were, to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your passage door generally open. - A. It was. My wife in going out of my shop saw two men in the further part of the room; she cried out to me and pushed to the passage door to prevent the persons from getting out; I left my shop board and went to her assistance; I saw the prisoner and another man; the first man made his escape, he could not get the door back, it stuck against the mat; however, he squeezed through the door way; the prisoner could not get through so well; I collared him, we scuffled together, and the things dropped from under his great coat; I secured him, and with assistance I took him to the watchhouse; I examined the bundle; it contained all the articles mentioned in the indictment. I had seen all the articles safe in the room at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>MRS. ELLIS: Q. Did you go to your husband's shop to speak to him a little after six o'clock in the evening. - A. Yes, I went from the left hand room into the right hand, and I left no person in the left hand shop; I was speaking to my husband for about five minutes. on my returning into the left hand room, I saw two men at the further end of the room; when they saw me they attempted to run out; I tried to shut to the street door, but the mat prevented my shutting it close; I alarmed my husband; when he came out one had nearly squeezed through and made his escape; the prisoner could not squeeze through; my husband secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bundle fall in the scuffle. - A. Yes; it contained all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Market-street, St. James's; I was coming out of my house on this evening about six o'clock, I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw one man pass very swiftly by me, he came from towards Mr. Ellis't door; I ran to the assistance of Mr. Ellis; the prisoner and he were scuffling together. The linen that is now produced in court was laying under the feet of the prisoner and Mr. Ellis's, near the threshold of the door; they had fallen down in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into a public house in Broad-street, I saw this young man setting there; he said he was going my way. We went into Market-street; he said stop here, I am going into this house; he went in and came out, and said step in; I went in and stopped inside of the door a minute; I believe when he came out he had a bundle, I am not quite sure whether he had or not; the lady came out and made an alarm. That is all I have to say.</p>

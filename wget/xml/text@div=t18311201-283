               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q.When are you paid your wages? A. At uncertain times; I had then been at work for Mrs. Lewis, North-bank - I had taken 24s.; I was not very drunk: when I get a little liquor it takes my head, and I have been desired by publicans to stay away from their houses; I had another pint of porter at Maida-hill, and one at the Portman Arms, in the afternoon - I had had no ale nor spirits that day, and I had one pint at the Champion; I carried my silver in my coat pocket, because both my trousers pockets were torn - I went in behind the door of the Champion; I did not see any one but the prisoner - he sat between two women in a box in a corner; there might be other persons in the room; I sat by myself - there was no one in the next box- I did not want any man in the room to fight, that I will swear; I was not exactly asleep - I should have been asleep if I had not been disturbed; the prisoner's hand was in my pocket, and I caught hold of it - he twisted it from me, and went back to his seat; I told him I would serve him out - I went out in a moment for the Policeman; I do not know how many persons were there - there were several persons in the room when the Policeman came; I was very much agitated - I sent an Irish labourer for a Policeman; he was a stranger to me - I gave him a shilling yesterday morning - the prisoner did not attempt to run away, but staid in the room between the two women - I have charged several persons with robbing me; I never took any body up - I have been robbed there before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many persons were in the room when you went out for an officer? A. I did not take any notice - the prisoner and the women were there; there might be other men.</p>

I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010120"></xptr>to the Champion public-house, in Earl-street; the prosecutor stood at the door - he said there was a man inside who had picked his pocket; he appeared very fresh - he did not appear as if he could know if a person's hand was in his pocket - he did not appear able to take care of himself; I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and there searched him - there might be seven or eight persons in the tap-room; I did not search the prisoner till I got to Harcourt-street, which is half a mile from the house; I found on him a knife, a key, and 2 1/2d. - I do not think the prosecutor could tell whether he had hold of a man's arm or not.</p>

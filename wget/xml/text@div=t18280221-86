            . I am an officer. About half-past five o'clock in the evening of the 4th of January, I stopped the prisoner in Goulstone-street, Whitechapel, with this bag full of sugar on his shoulder; I asked where he was going; he said to a grocer's-shop round the corner, and a man at the end had given him 6d. to carry it; I said he must go with me to that man; as we went back he dropped the sugar, and said he would carry it no further: I took him to the end of the street - there was no man there; I again asked who he got it from, and he asked if I had not met a man just before him, carrying a hat; I said I had: he then said that man had employed him, and he was to have 6d. for it, and that he had helped him out of the cart with it - that man was then gone.</p>

I was employed by Mr. Dale to go to the docks, and receive the sugar; I do not know how many bags I received - I did not count them; I drove along Whitechapel - I cannot say what time I was there, but I think I got over to Tooley-street soon after half-past five o'clock; we are sometimes stopped in our journey - it rained very fast - the bags were covered over; I did not take much notice of them.</p>

            . I am a delivery-foreman at the West India Docks. I delivered to Thomas Smith, on the 4th of January, about half-past four o'clock, twenty-four bags of Mauritius sugar, in bags of this description - they were marked "S. and W. C. M.," numbers from 217 to 240; we have a great number of such bags in our warehouse; there appears to be the remains of an ink-mark on this bag, but it was a very wet day indeed - I believe this to be one of the bags.</p>

            . I am the proprietor of the sugar. I gave the order for its being fetched: I had bought the lot No. 195, which was twenty-four bags; I was at my warehouse when the cart came, and the man brought but twenty-three bags instead of twenty-four; there were no ink-marks on them then, for the sugar destroys the ink-marks on a wet day; we weighed the twenty-three bags, and found 2 cwt. deficient; we cannot compare the sugars, for they are of different shades - there is nothing beyond the number and weight that we can judge by.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming out of a house, when a man asked me to carry this load of sugar to a grocer's-shop at the bottom of the street; he went on first with my hat; the officer came and stopped me, and told me to carry it back - I could not carry it back very well, and I put it down.</p>

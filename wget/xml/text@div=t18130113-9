            . On last Sunday week, between eleven and twelve at night, I met the prisoner in Drury-lane; she asked me to go home with her; she said it was only a little way down <placeName id="t18130113-9-crimeloc47">Charles-street</placeName>

I told her, four shillings. She agreed for four shillings, and I was to stop with her. I sat down in a chair. She asked me to take off my top coat. I took my coat off, and threw it across a chair, which was a little distance from me, and in a minute or so after, the prisoner said she wanted to go out. She went out. She said she would return in the course of a minute. I waited in the room half an hour. She did not return. I then took my hat to go home. I went to the chair to look for my coat; it was gone. I looked all over the room; I could not find it. I staid in the room two or three hours, and then went home. The next day I went to Bow-street for an officer. The officer told me to look out early of a morning. On Tuesday morning, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner come to her door. I told her she was the woman that had taken my coat from me on the Sunday evening. She said that she never saw me nor my coat before that morning. She said, she had been at Wapping on the week before, and she did not return home till Monday night. I took her myself to Bow-street. She afterwards told me she had pawned the coat.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Armstrong, pawnbroker, Baldwin's-gardens. On last Monday week, the prisoner pawned a great coat with me for one pound. I am sure the prisoner is the woman. This is the coat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my coat. I made the coat myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the young man came up in my room I asked him, what he was going to give me. He said, he had no money. I said, I am an unfortunate girl, I must have money. He then said, he would leave me his coat. He took his coat off, and said he would call in a day or two. On Tuesday morning he came and said, come along with me to Bow-street. I took him to the pawnbrokers, where I had pawned the coat. I am innocent of robbing him of his coat.</p>

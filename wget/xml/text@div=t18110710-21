On the 6th of June, in the morning, I met the prisoner with my mare, on the Kentish Town Road; he was leading the mare towards Town. I had the mare before that at a field at grass, facing St. Giles's burying ground. I met him upon the road, leading the mare away. The prisoner let go the mare before I came to him I looked at the mare to be sure it was mine. He left the mare in the road; he said it was a moon light morning; he was leading the mare with an alter; as soon as he saw me he ran away across the road; we took him to the watchhouse. I am sure it was my mare. After we had taken him to the watchhouse, we put the mare into a field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the field whether the gate was open - A. There was a gap in the fence that a horse might escape through. The prisoner denied taking the mare out of the field but it was a man with a brown coat on.</p>

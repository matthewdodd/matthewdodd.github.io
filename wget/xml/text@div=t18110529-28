As soon as I had finished these words, I felt something come round me on my right hand side and I felt my watch go out of my pocket. I put my hand down and found it was gone. I looked round, and saw the prisoner close by my side. I went to catch hold of him, he made a small circle from my reach, ran up Sweet Apple Court, and went through a passage into Dunning's Alley, that is the only time I lost sight of him. He went across that alley as if to go through another passage, he then turned a little to the left and was taken by the watchman. I am sure he is the same man, I was close to him all the while. I never found the watch, he told the officer he throwed it away.</p>

            . I am the watchman. I was calling the hour of eleven, I heard the alarm of stop thief, I heard a foot running very quickly. I said, if you do not stop I will knock you down. The man stopped immediately without any resistance. I collared him and took him to the watch house, Mr. Fidler came up directly. I took him, and went with us to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SHEPPARD. I was the officer of the night. The prisoner on Wednesday night last was brought into the watch-house by Mr. Fidler and Watts, I instantly searched him; I found nothing upon him; he called me of one side, told me if the prosecutor would not hurt him he would tell me where the watch was. He said it was on a dunghill in Dunnings Alley. I took him and led him to Dunnings Alley and searched about there a long time, we could find nothing there; he said he was sure it must be there, because he heard the girls throw it away, and then I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence. When I was running through the court I told Mr. Sheppard that there were two girls running in the alley; I saw one of them throw something away, I am very innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were no girls in the Alley.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to be informed of the situation of the girls with you at the time you missed the watch. - A. The girl stood at my left arm and had got her arm in my left arm, on the wall side. The prisoner stood by my right hand, and none but him; there was none whatever but this girl.</p>

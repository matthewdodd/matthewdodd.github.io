                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge in Ratcliff-highway. The prisoner came to the house, on the night of the 8th of December, for a night's lodging, saying he had been cast away, and sixpence was all he had in the world—MRS. M'Farlane, the landlady, allowed him to sleep in the same bed with me—in the morning he asked for a needle and thread to mend his jacket—I went down and brought one up to him—I then went down and washed myself, leaving him in the room—he afterwards came down stairs, and said he was going to the Sailors' Home to get some assistance—I afterwards went up stairs, and all my clothes were gone, with 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in my waistcoat pocket—I met him next day at the London Dock, and asked if he had taken my things—he said he had not—I said there was nobody but him to take them—he said, "Well, I have, here are the tickets of them," giving me two, one of which was for my things.</p>

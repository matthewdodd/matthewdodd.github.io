My husband's name is Joseph; we lodged there: George Vose is the landlord, and lives there - we occupied the shop and kitchen. On the evening of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080004"></xptr>the 5th of November, at ten o'clock, I was in the shop - the door was shut, and the shutters up, there was a light in the shop. Mr. Murrell was with me - we heard a noise of the kitchen window going up and down; I went out into the street, saw the kitchen window open, and called the watchman; I came in, and met the prisoner on the kitchen stairs, caught hold of his collar, and said, "This is the thief;" he said, "Thief! where is the thief?" and struck me in the face, broke my ear-ring, and tore my cap - I lost my hold, but caught hold of him again; he slipped out of his coat, leaving part of it in my hand, and ran off; I went into the kitchen, and unlocked the door - he must have come out of another passage-door. I found the window open, and a carpet about six yards square half out of the window, and half in - I had left it on a chair, and am sure I left the window down, and fastened with the snap. I found three of the centre panes broke, and the snap pulled back - the carpet was ours. I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoner there. I had a light in my hand when I collared him, and saw his face. I believe him to be the same man who had come into the shop in the afternoon. He said, "Pray have mercy - I was in liquor - it was only a frolie." I found a hat in the area - it was not returned to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There is a passage-door, which was open? A. I think it was - he could go through that door, turn to the left, and get out into the area, and cut the glass - the kitchen door was fast: my char-woman had left about twenty minutes. I had been in the kitchen at seven o'clock, and fastened the window, but not after. I believe the charwoman was in the kitchen after me. I cannot say that I thought the prisoner in liquor; there was no appearance of his having been sick there. My husband has never lived there - he is in the country, for his health - we were married at Stepney-church.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you really married? A. My name is Simpson, and the property is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you really married to any body? A. No - it happened about ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They could not get into the area without coming through the house? A. No; he could not have entered the kitchen-door, for I found it locked; he must have gone through the passage into the area, and opened the window. I cannot tell whether the charwoman had done any thing to the window - she and the servant of the house had been in the kitchen together.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I was in the shop, and heard the window sash move up and down, and the glass breaking. Mrs. Simpson went out, and gave an alarm. I went to the door - a man presently opened the passage door, and came out without his hat - he passed me, exclaiming, "Where is the thief?" Mrs. Simpson, and the watchman caught him in the street; he slipped out of his coat; I followed, and saw him knocked down by the watchman; I had never lost sight of him, and am sure of his person; he got up, ran through another street, and knocked a woman down. A gentleman stopped him, and a watchman came up. I returned to the house - the carpet was partly out of the window; the sash was pulled down, and the glass broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not intoxicated? A. He did not appear so at all; he cried at the watch-house, and said he was intoxicated, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was he knocked down? A. By the watchman - he knocked a woman down by running against her; he had no hat on at the watch-house.</p>

            . I keep the White Hart public-house, Little Windmill-street. I have known the prisoner six months. On Saturday, the 5th of November, he was drinking at my house, all the evening, with his shopmates - mine is the house of call for tailors. I called him out about nine o'clock, and advised him to go home to his wife, as I thought him in liquor. I did not see him go out, but I missed him soon after.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to SIMPSON. Q. Was there not on one side of the window a parcel of tea things set in a tray? A. Yes; they were not broken. There is no back yard to my house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

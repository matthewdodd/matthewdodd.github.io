On the day he was to leave, the 4th of April, I asked to search his box, which was in the room he slept in, to which he agreed - I went with him to the room; he went to his box, turned different things about, and said he was not quite ready for me to see the contents - I waited some time; he turned different things over, and when I approached the box he said he was not quite ready - he then left the room, returned with a purple bag, and, I believe, the bag which was afterwards found; I had not then looked into his box; when he brought the bag he took it to his box, and filled, or partly filled, it from the box; I did not see what he put in - I suspected they were articles belonging to Mr. Foster - I went down stairs, and went for an officer; in my absence the prisoner quitted the room - I had left him in charge of one of the porters; I believe he had nothing in his hand then - when I returned he was in the room where the boxes were; several persons were there, and inquiry was made for a bag, which could not be found - the box was then searched; some black feathers were found, and some pink saucers, used for dying - the prisoner was employed as a dyer in a room under that; I made inquiries, and this bag was brought, which contained several white ostrich feathers and a piece of velvet; these are the articles - I believe the articles in the bag are the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe they are difficult to identify? A. I cannot say that I can swear they are Mr. Foster's - the prisoner locked the box when he left the room; other persons had access to that room - the prisoner's bed was there; I could not identify pink saucers - I have heard the prisoner has said that persons go down to Wapping and purchase feathers of sailors, but I do not know it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did any body but the prisoner sleep there? A. I cannot swear they did not, but no one but him usually slept there; I should think no one but him could have access to the box.</p>

            . I live in Wigmore-street. I was absent when this happened; it is impossible for me to say that these are my feathers - I had thousands of them; the prisoner had the dyeing of them, but they should not be in his bed-room; we use a great many of these saucers - I cannot swear to these white feathers; the last lot I bought of them was three thousand five hundred, and I cut some notches on four or five of them with my pen-knife, and delivered them to the prisoner to try an experiment; this is one of them that I notched - I could not swear to the others; I suppose they are worth 3l. or 4l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner employed to dye feathers? A. Yes; they should be kept in the regular place, which we call the dye-house, till they were dyed; he was not to keep any of them in his room - some of these black feathers are not well dyed, but they are finished.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could you not see what he put into it? A.No, I was not close to him, and the lid of the box was between us - I did not observe what he put in; I did not think he was so bad, and thought it might be dirty linen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not these waving feathers have shown? A.

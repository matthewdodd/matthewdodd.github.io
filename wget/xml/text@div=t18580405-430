                  </hi>. I was housekeeper to the late Mr. Whitnall at the time of his death, which happened on 13th Feb.—I know the prisoners; they lived in the same house, but were not upon visiting terms—Mr. Whitnall died my suddenly, about half an hour after his return home; he had been ill for some time, but was suddenly worse on that afternoon, and I called for assistance—Mary Stockman, the landlord's daughter, came, and Mrs. Robin<lb></lb>son and Mr. Middleton—the female prisoner was in the room both before and after his death, I cannot say how long—she was not in the room alone—Stockmanwent for the doctor—I remained in the room till the doctors came, and then I left—there were two boxes in the other room; I was in there after Mr. Whitnall's death—I cannot say that the female prisoner was near the boxes—Mr. Middleton was there most of the time—Mr. Whitnall used to keep his money in one of those boxes—I had not seen him put any money there shortly before he died—about a couple of hours after his death we searched the boxes; I had not seen anybody go to them between the time of his death and our searching them—they were locked; I had the key—I had not the key at the time of his death; it was in his pocket—he had not his clothes on at the time of bis death; he died on the bed—his clothes, at the time of his death, were in the room in which he died—I afterwards found the key in his trousers' pocket—when I and Mrs. Robinson searched the boxes, we did not find any money in them; Mrs. Bobinson gave me his ring out of a little box, and told me to take care of it, and it would pay my fare home; I put it into my pocket—Mr. Whitnall died on Saturday, and the boxes were sealed up on the Sunday evening afterwards; they were then in the room, still locked, and I had the key; I had gone to them in the evening—there was some search for some papers—Mrs. Stockman was present, and me, and</p>

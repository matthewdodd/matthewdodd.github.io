In the morning we found near the drawers, from whence the things were taken, in one of my rooms, a piece of a striped handkerchief, which was torn off. We got a search warrant to search Bates's house, but found none of my goods, only a small piece of silk, part of which I lost, and the woman prisoner had the handkerchef round her neck, which we have here, her own property, which tallies exactly with the piece torn off and left in my room. ( Produced in court the silk deposed to, the piece and handkerchief compared, and the piece exactly suited the handkerchief.</p>

            . I was at the taking of the prisoners. We knock'd at his door the over night, and he would not answer, so we nail'd up the door, which open'd outwards, having strong suspicion he was within.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you nail it up?</p>
               <p>Turner. About nine at night. Then the prosecutor was resolved to watch the house all night, fearing he should get away. We knock'd at the door several time and call'd him by his name, but he would not answer. At six o'clock the next morning the prisoner tap'd at the window, and said he'd come out if I would come to the window. We ask'd him if he did not hear a knocking at the door and his name called. He said, yes. We said, then why did you not let us in. He said, because he did not think proper to be put in the hole in the watch-house all night. Then the officer told him he had a search warrant to search the house. He said, he did not know where the key of the door was, he believed his wife had it. We ask'd him where she was. He said in Crooked Lane. We sent a watchman for her thither, as he had directed. Then we were informed that she and her daughter were in his own house, striving to open the door to get out. (A hammer and chissel produced, that were left in the prosecutor's house.)</p>

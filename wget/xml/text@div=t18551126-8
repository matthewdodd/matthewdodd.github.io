                  </hi>. I live in Paradise-row, Islimgton-green, and am a warehouseman. On 9th Nov., I was Grossing from Fleet-street to Ludgate-hill, about 5 o'clock—I saw a crowd at the obelisk—I stopped and there was a man selling gold rings for a penny apiece—a soldier was looking at one of them, which he had purchased—while I was looking at him I felt a pull at my watch chain—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket—I glanced down, and detected the prisoner taking the watch off the ring—I saw the watch in his hand—when he had got possession of the watch he darted across the road—I ran after him—he dodged amongst the cobs and omnibuses—I did not lose sight of him—I came up with him at the obelisk in Bridge-street—when I was in the act of seizing him, he gave me the watch and said, "Here you are, what is the matter?"—I attempted to seize him, but I missed him and he darted across the road—I pursued him—he attempted, to rush into the middle of the crowd—I cried, "Stop thief!" and he was caught by a man in the crowd—I never lost sight of him once—I got hold of him, and with assistance took him to the station—I gave the watch to the officer at the station—this is it.</p>

               <p>the main feature that attracted me was the soldier—it excited my curiosity—while I was looking on I felt the tug—the moment the watch was wrenched from the chain the person dodged in amongst the omnibuses—the man was in front of me—I was not standing next to the man selling the rings—there were persons between me and him—I was outside the crowd, there were very few behind me—I laid hold of the man at the opposite obelisk, in Bridge-street—directly he gave me the watch he darted away—when I seized him he was in the crowd——he had come back again—some person assisted me to take the prisoner to the station—the prisoner said at the station, "I am not the man, you are mistaken"—I was so excited that I cannot remember whether he said so in the crowd—the man who assisted me to take the prisoner to the station did not give his name in my presence—I do not know what has become of him.</p>

I beg leave to inform you, as I was going towards home, on the evening of the 12th of this month, I was passing along Eastcheap, and saw two persons walking before me, they turned round and made a sudden rush by me - one threw something from his hand, I did not know what it was till the gentleman collared me, and accused me of taking his handkerchief, which he took off the ground; he took me to the corner of Rood-lane, and I was immediately taken into custody; the prosecutor laying hold of me in so rough a manner, and ill treating me, I could not govern my temper; I acknowledge in an angry moment I struck at him, which I am sorry for.</p>

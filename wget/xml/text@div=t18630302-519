                  </hi>. I am a troop sergeant-major in the Military Train, Woolwich-common—the prisoner is a private in my troop, and acted as my servant up to 23d January—on 23d January, I went to the canteen, where I got change for five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Caroline Ritz; the change was princi<lb></lb>pally in half-crowns and gold—in counting it over I found one half-crown with a "W" on it—I took the money to my room and counted it over, after having paid all but 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it—the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. consisted of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in half-crowns, two sovereigns, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in coppers—I counted that, and seeing this half-crown with the "W" amongst it, caused me to look at it again—I had not paid that away—I placed the money in a cash-box and put it in my desk, which was on the table—on the following morning, the 24th, I went to my desk at 9 o'clock; the cash-box and money were there—I locked my desk went down to the stables, and returned to my room between 1 and 2 o'clock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020131"></xptr>
               <p>—I found that the desk had been forced open, and the cash-box and money taken away—I gave information to the police—two days previous to my receiving the money, I had discharged the prisoner from being my servant—as my servant, he had been in the habit of frequenting my quarters—he was there on the night of the 23d, and saw the money on the table—on 28th January, he was brought to the camp, and said to the major that the money belonged to himself—the major asked him how he came by this money that was found on him, and he said it was the money that he had saved up for three or four months—in consequence of that I looked at the ledger item and found that he could not have received that amount, and that I had not paid him that amount—I was not there when he was searched and the money found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Royal Artillery at Wool<lb></lb>wich—on 27th January, in consequence of information, I went, in company with Sergeant Holly, of the Military Train, from the Royal Barracks on Wool<lb></lb>wich-common to the Dockyard Railway-station—we followed the prisoner there in company with a man named Beasley, a private in the Military Train—we saw the prisoner in a public-house opposite the station—Sergeant Holly and I went to the prisoner when he was outside the station-door—we told him he had got to be searched—I searched him and found in one of his boots, I think the right one, a bag, which the policeman has now—the prisoner was very delicate in taking the boot off; we found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, principally in half-crowns—I told him I wanted the two sovereigns from him; I pulled off his sock and there were two sovereigns inside—I sent for the police from the dockyard station and gave him into custody—he was again searched in the police-station, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more was found on him, which made 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the bag and money afterwards handed to the policeman—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same—this half-crown, marked with the letter <hi rend="largeCaps">W</hi>, was amongst them—when we had searched, the prisoner said, "That is my own money; that is not the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I had never mentioned the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there may have been some talk in the camp about the lose of the money; I knew it because the sergeant-major sent for me and told me about it.</p>

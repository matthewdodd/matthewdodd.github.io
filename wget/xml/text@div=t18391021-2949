                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Thomas Brown, at Bowling-green farm, in the parish of Streatham. The prisoner was in his service—on the 4th of October I sent him to London to fetch a load of manure—I allowed one truss of hay and some corn—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the manure, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to spend—the truss of hay is worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in consequence of Richard Sparrow, my boy, making a communication to me, I sent for the prisoner on the 14th of October—I told him what the boy told me—he said he had not taken it, and then I said to the boy, "Tell the truth, whether he took it or not"—the boy said he did—the prisoner then said it was not a truss of hay, it was a little he might hold under his arm, and he sold it for a pot of beer, to the ostler at the King's Head public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carter's boy to Mr. Brown. I accompanied the prisoner to town to fetch a load of dung—we started about three o'clock—before the prisoner went away he got a truss of hay out of the loft, and cut one off the stack, and put them on the wagon—the one off the stack was bigger than the other—there were four horses—we stopped at the King's Head public-house at Tooting to water the horses—the prisoner put the truss he cut from the stack into the stable there—the horses had some of the hay taken from the loft to eat—we stopped at the King's Head public-house as we returned, and the horses had the rest of the truss from the loft, and the corn—when I got into the stable I saw the truss that had been cut from the stack there—it was up in the corner, where the prisoner had put it—I am sure it was the same—the prisoner told the ostler to put it out of sight—I got my dinner there—the ostler gave the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—we had a pot of beer there, which the ostler brought—I went out, and when I came back, I found some more beer before the prisoner, and the ostler was sitting with him—we had some gin when we left, which the ostler gave us—when I was going home the prisoner told me not to say any thing about the truss—I told Mr. Bates about this after I was discharged—I did not tell him before, because I was afraid the prisoner would <hi rend="italic">leather</hi> MR.</p>

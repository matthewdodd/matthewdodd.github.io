                  </hi>. I am in the service of Lea Wilson and two others, silk-manufacturers, Goldsmith-street. On the 18th of May the prisoner came to buy some handkerchiefs—I showed him some—I saw him putting a parcel into his pocket—after that I came to him, and said, "There are some other handkerchiefs which I wish you to look at"—he then asked me to show him satin ones, which he had seen on a former visit—he said, "I shall call</p>

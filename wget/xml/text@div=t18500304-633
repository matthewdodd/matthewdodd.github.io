                  </hi>. I am footman to Miss Gould—I have been nine years in her service—she is single. The prisoner was employed there as a char-woman—the plate, and knives and forks, were under my care—about six months ago I missed eight silver tea-spoons and one dessert-spoon—on 11th Feb. I sent for the prisoner, and asked her about the spoons—she said she did not know anything about them—I said, "You had much better own it, because I have got a policeman ready"—she then asked to be allowed to go away—I would not let her—the policeman came, and I went with him and the prisoner to Great Barlow-street.</p>

I went to Miss Gould's—I saw the prisoner there—I told her she was accused of stealing plate in the house—she said she had—I and Fowler went with her to her lodging—she got a light—I searched, and found thirty-seven duplicates in her hand—I did not see where she got them from—she pointed to a cupboard, and said all the duplicates she had were there; but I found none there—she said I had no occasion to show all the duplicates unless I liked—six of them allude to silver spoons.</p>

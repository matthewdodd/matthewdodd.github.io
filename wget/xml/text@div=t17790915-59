               <p>I keep a publick house at Shoreditch. I know the prisoner. Upon the 15th of August I had some dealings with him; he sold to me a piece and a half of farthings, at the rate of a guinea for 28 s. worth. I gave information to the officers of the mint; in consequence of which the prisoner was taken up soon after, and I have since seen the farthings he sold me.</p>

               <p>I went to the house of Sheen, who was in custody when Newton was apprehended; in his bed-room, in a closet, I found the coins now produced; there were 23 s. worth 8 1/4 d.</p>
               <p>To Newton. Are those the farthings you bought? - They are; I know them by the shape and make of them.</p>
               <p>Dixon. When I came to Sheen's house, I told him what I came for, he owned he had some farthings, he did not say where they were; he said he had them for a bad debt.</p>

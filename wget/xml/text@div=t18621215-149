                  </hi>. I live at 5, Little Chapel-street, Westminster—on the 19th November, 1861, I was in Mr. Cowen's surgery, Rochester-row—Mr. Cowen, Mr. Baldock, Mr. Rikey and the defendant were present—Mr. Cowan said that he had been fleeced by various lawyers, and that he hoped Mr. Pounds was a regular certificated attorney—Mr. Pounds replied that he was of forty years' standing or practice—Mr. Rikey said, "Yes; and his opinion is looked up to with deference by various members of the Bar, and his name in the profession is termed the walking book of statutes—I saw Mr. Cowen take a receipt which was written by Mr. Pounds—Mr. Cowen then went into the back surgery and brought out some money, which he gave to Mr. Pounds—I do not know the amount—I did not see the receipt that evening—that was all that passed to my recollection.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to be there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was attending Mr. Cowen as a patient—I was suffering from rheumatic gout—I was there simply as a patient on that occasion—I have been there in another capacity—I am very often there; not every day—I am a near neighbour and an invalid, and I go in there occasionally—I do not assist him in his business, I am no doctor—I write letters for him occasionally—he occasionally has a quantity of placards in front of his shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And has had for the last ten years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has not for the last three months, not during these proceedings, but up to that time he had—they are announcements of his opinions—I am not a judge of whether he has announced his opinions of the Queen and Prince Albert and the rest of the Royal Family pretty strongly—I write the papers for him, decidedly—I ought not to answer whether they reflect upon Prince Albert—he lives at the corner of Rochester-row, very near the Grey-coat School.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Large placards and pretty little pictures? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly large—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of one—it is a reflection on the Medical Bill—I cannot say whether there is something about procuring abortion for Lord John Russell—it is a photograph of one of my drawings—I have been acquainted with Mr. Cowen fourteen years—I have not been drawing these things all that time—it may be eight years since I tried my hand at it, but very few things have been done during those eight years—Mr. Cowen was not prosecuted by Government for the pictures or for the writing, but for giving away 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of food on the fast day—the indictment was for breaking the peace on the fast day—he had fifteen months—I do not know how long ago that was; he was in prison for twelve months, but I do not recollect the date—he pleaded guilty to exhibiting this paper, under Mr. Serjeant Parry's advice, but the merits of the thing were not gone into—I decline to answer whether I drew up the paper which he pleaded guilty to exhibiting—it will not incriminate me—I do not know the paper he was</p>

               <p>indicted for, but I object to answer the question—I remained at Mr. Cowen's after Mr. Rikey and Mr. Pounds left—they were there when I arrived, and they remained about three-quarters of an hour, because we went over the way and had a little refreshment—I have seen Mr. Morriss, the attorney, there, but never before this transaction—I think the first time he came was after last Christmas—I am speaking of the 19th November; I think he came shortly after that, but I will not be certain, because Mr. Cowen, after finding that a person named Morriss was entered on the brief, got me to write to every person named Morriss in the Directory of 1859, and Mr. Morriss of Beaufort-buildings, was not in the Directory, and had no letter sent to him—I received a letter from Serjeant Pigott's clerk, in consequence of which I found out Mr. Morriss, and he has since that been there frequently—he is, I believe, the attorney for the prosecution—I do not know it—I appear on recognizances from the police-court—Mr. Cowen came for me to go there—Morriss was there—I went to the Sheriffs' Court—I do not think Pound or Rikey were there—I went there as a witness for Mr. Cowen against Mr. Pound—I was not aware that Serjeant Pigott's name was on any trial of that sort—I was not aware that Serjeant Pigott was a defendant, but I am now, because Serjeant Pigott sent a distress into Mr. Cowan's house for costs—Mr. Morriss was present, but I do not know whether he was the attorney—I went to Lambeth Police-court—Mr. Morriss was not the attorney there—no one was attorney—an application was made there for a summons against Mr. Pounds, and it was granted—a second application was made there, and Mr. Elliott dismissed it, and Mr. Pound was taken in custody—these envelopes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all in my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you say you did not know that Serjeant Pigott was a defendant; did not you send these through the Post-office with this inscription upon them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This was after the trial at the Sheriffs' Court, and after the distress was put in (<hi rend="italic">One of these was addressed, Mr. Serjeant Piggott, M.P. and superscribed "Cowen v. Serjeant Piggott and other</hi>")—I did that under Mr. Cowen's instructions, for the letters to be more readily taken up and looked at—I do not mean to deny that it was for the purpose of calling public attention to the fact that there was an action against Serjeant Pigott—a report of the proceedings has been stuck up in the garden in front of the house—there is also, I believe, a placard about Commissioner Kerr, who tried the case at the Sheriffs' Court—I do not know whether it spells his name rather differently—I did not assist Mr. Cowen in bringing an action against the Judge of the Westminster Court—I had no means of assisting him—I was not a witness, I was present—I wrote no part of the proceedings for him—I very likely stuck up the Judge of the Westminster County Court in the garden—I do not know Mr. Ribton, or whether he was instructed to prosecute at the police court—I have not stuck up Mr. Ribton and Mr. Daley, who is now my counsel, in the garden, nor have I seen them up there, but there are a great many gentlemen of the bar up, and one may be mistaken for another—they are caricatures—perhaps my Lord and you will go up in the garden afterwards—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, of 3, Great C—street, Westminster—in 1859 I became acquainted with Rikey in prison, and when he came out of prison he called on me; that was about December, 1861, as near as I can recollect—that was a week or ten days, I think, before I paid Mr. Pounds—he was very kind to me when I lost the use of my arms in prison, and I told him if he came to me when he came out I would put him right—he found out that I had something to do with Government, and he</p>

Q.</hi> Did you never use the prisoner a your clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; you will please to put in a piece of paper which you have got—I was once unfortunately a prisoner in Whitecroas-street—there was an appoint<lb></lb>ment at 12 or 1; I could not go: the prisoner came in, and I asked him if he could manage to go before Sir Archer Croft, and I gave him an authority to go, which you have got <hi rend="italic">This being produced stated,</hi> "As I cannot attend before you, being confined at the suit of the prosecutor, I shall be obliged if you will hear Mr. Pounds, my clerk, and postpone it for a week"—I never did employ him as my clerk in the sense of the word "clerk" or paid servant, from day to day—I mean, I never employed him regularly—I called him my clerk, but that did not authorise him to put my name to paper—the date is May 27,1861—I have seen this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before; there is nothing in that—I have not employed him to act as my clerk in all sorts of legal matters, and paid him—I have asked him questions on legal matters; but as to employing him, I did not—I did not use his services except gra<lb></lb>tuitously; that was during the time this correspondence runs over, and these sums are all I paid him—I have looked through these papers; they do not extend pretty nearly through 1861.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just read the dates, I think you will find almost every month in 1861? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Allow me to tell you Mr. Pounds was clerk to Mr. Hyatt, of Lincoln's Inn-Fields, and not my clerk—I employed Mr. Hyatt, and I have his receipts for money paid him—I did not use the prisoner's services—I employed Mr. Hyatt, and I paid Mr. Hyatt—the first of these letters is directed to Rikey not to Pounds—I cannot say that here are letters addressed by me to Pounds about business going on in my office, and asking him to attend to certain details of it—I have not been in Whitecross-street so many times as your client behind you; my opponent—I think it is twice, and he has been three or four times a year—I was a bankrupt thirty yean ago, as a coal merchant—it was in 1839—I was not insolvent three times in one year after that, or twice in one year—I was insolvent in 1854, 1857, and 1860—the last time was for your client behind you, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a fictitious action which he brought against me—I have been insolvent four times besides my bankruptcy, and the last time was in 1861, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to Scotland once, but I cannot see what that has to do with it—I suppose I went there to take the benefit of the Act—I was in York Castle in 1860, at the instance of your client; you are no doubt here to do the beat you can for him—I have not seen the affidavits or the brief in this case—the name of Mr. Morriss is endorsed on these briefs, but he had no right to do it—it was not by my authority—I did not advise the proceedings in the Sheriff's Court—I was subpoenaed there, and when I got there they asked me to turn advocate, which I did as impudent as you are now—I was brought there by sub<lb></lb>poena, and then conducted the case as attorney—I was the attorney at the police-court, because the prosecutor had no attorney, and I was paid for it—I was not there the first time—there were two or three applications before they found out where my residence was—I did not take out these two summonses at Westminster Police-court, but I was there as a witness—I made the application, and in doing so I charged the prisoner with obtain<lb></lb>ing five guineas by false pretences—that was on Cowen's authority—I was not present when the application, as to the conspiracy summons, was made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150054"></xptr>
               <p>—I gave the brief to your friend, Mr. Ribton, with three guineas, and I gave him another brief against your client there, and he advised me to take a draught, and go home for a couple of days and compose myself—I did not—I did not tell Cowan that I had given Mr. Ribton sixteen guineas—Mr. Ribton is here to speak for himself—I know that the summons for con<lb></lb>spiracy was for five guineas only, Mr. Paynter, the Magistrate, took the receipt in his hand, and said that it had better be framed for conspiracy, and that the charge must be for five guineas—you have got the memo<lb></lb>randum there: no, his Lordship has got it—I have no previous memo<lb></lb>randa among the papers, I never heard of any more—here is one (<hi rend="italic">pro-duced by Mr. Daley</hi>)—it is for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for moving for a man<lb></lb>damus, and is Rikey's writing, and this is Rikey's writing on the back—I know his writing, because I have got about twenty letters here—I have served a writ for him—I never did anything more—I talked the matter over with the prisoner, and he attended to it on Rikey's part, not on mine—here is the indictment upon which he was sentenced at this Court—Pounds did not draw this—it is Rikey's writing—he worked for Pounds, not for me—Rikey was not my client—I only issued the writ—I delivered these instructions (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Mr. Gibbons, the pleader—that was twelve months before—I certainly ought to have scratched this out—I wrote to him, "This man is annoying me; do get his case done that I may get the declaration drawn; "because Pounds was acting for Rikey, not for me—I had issued the writ, and I wanted the declaration, and these are the instructions which he gave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never saw him till he brought Rikey to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "The appointment for you to go to Mr. Pounds to<lb></lb>morrow evening, Friday, cannot possibly be attended to"—what did you mean by that, if he was the friend of Rikey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He acted as the friend of Pounds—they wanted me to go there to talk the matter over, but I could not afford the time—Rikey thought that if his attorney at Newcastle had called witnesses he would not have got two years' hard labour; that is the pith of it—I told him not to keep the appointment with his own friend because I could not come—I could not bring him four or five miles, and I not be there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that this man never acted as your clerk, here is, "Johnson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Burridge, notice has been delivered; I shall be at the Queen's Bench at 11 o'clock; do not fail to be there at that hour;" and again, "Self at suit of Edwards. Bring the papers with you, or write them. I hope you have drawn the case for the pleader to draw the declaration from" I thought you said he had no right to put your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All I say is that he was not my clerk, and all your talking will not prove it—Self is me—he used to bring the papers though he was not my clerk, and I have given him a glass of grog, and he has said, "How do you get on with so and so."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came he to have the papers, if he was not your clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I met him in Fleet-street he used to ask me to let him have the papers, and he could give me some insight into it—he is clever—he is a good lawyer—he does know something about the Statutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was he to meet you at the taxation of costs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he said, "Mr. Hyatt has not got his certificate, and would you mind his sending the costs to your office, and let me know by a penny note;" and I took the costs and wrote him a note—it was only to benefit him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is "29th June. Do not fail to have the affidavit ready at 1;" and again iu July, "Bring all the papers with you, particularly the writ of</p>

               <p>summons;" and again, "You can deliver declaration," do you mean to say be was not your clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was not virtually my clerk—I gave him plenty of grog—I was very lax, and I dare say I wrote on 20th September, "I shall be at Beaufort-buildings if you want to see me;" and also, "Bring this with you that I may get on with it"—if he delivered the declaration, in that case it would have my name on it</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I acted for him throughout because he was incapable of doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you deliver a brief in Burridige and Johnson with your name endorsed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I understand the prisoner did—I called in at Guildhall on the day of the trial, as I usually do when I am in the City and trials are on—Mr. Hyatt was the attorney, not me—this is wrong; he has made oat his bill of costs, and received it—I was there at the trial when Serjeant Pigott held that brief, and Mr. Hyatt was there—he was the attorney—Pounds was there—I did not see the brief that was delivered to Serjeant Pigott in this case—I did not attend the taxation, but I forwarded the bill of costs to him that he might attend the taxation—I mean that the bill of costs was not delivered in my name—I did not send it to the prisoner—Hyatt was the attorney, and he delivered a bill of costs to Johnson—I saw this W. F. Morriss on it, at Westminster—I repudiated it—Hyatt was acting for the defendant; I was not—Hyatt was not a certifi<lb></lb>cated attorney for that year—he did not use my name—he deceived me—he took money of me as a certificated attorney, and I found that he was not certificated—I was not the attorney on the record: Hyatt was—a good many have their names on records who are not certificated—I do not know why it was delivered in the name of Morriss—I walked into Guildhall on the trial—I suppose it was quite accidental, I am down there every day—I did not wait during the whole of the trial, but I was in and out all day long for about two hours—I have explained to you that I met Pounds in Chancery-lane—he talked about various matters, and was kind enough to say that he would look through the papers; if I say to you, "If you will kindly look at these," you would do it—if I met Pound in Fleet-street and he wanted a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave it to him—I am a certificated attorney, and he is a better lawyer than me—I remember Walter Pratt Nine, who was convicted here, and had six months—I got into the box and repudiated him at my clerk—he was my paid clerk, but he left my office in June, and in July he received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at one place, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at another; and in August, September, November, and December the same, and I said to the parties, "If you do not pay me, I shall have to put you in court,"—I repudiated him because he was not my clerk then—he was an attorney who had not money to pay for his certificate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1861, was an action commenced of Edwards <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Morris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Edwards was not the real plaintiff; Mr. Hope was virtually—I met Pounds at the Judge's chambers—he said, "How are you getting on with Hope?"—I said, "Very badly"—he said, "Why do not you employ somebody; you know the old adage, 'A man who is his own lawyer has a fool for his client'; I will manage Hope"—Mr. Hyatt managed my business—he had two clerks; the other clerk is here—these papers are signed by Pounds, as clerk to Hyatt—my business with Pounds was as clerk to Mr. Hyatt, the attorney I employed—I did not know that Hyatt had no certificate—he deceived me—no offer of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs has been made to me since these proceedings commenced—this is the receipt for the money I paid, and here are two more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Serjeant Pigott—this brie was delivered to him on 11th November, 1861, and he moved in the Bailf Court in Hilary Term, 1862, before Mr. Justice Blackburn—the affidavits were offective, and the Judge ordered that it should stand over for them to be amended—I was in Court, and heard the Serjeant move, and I went and fetched Mr. Pound, that he might be there, and I looked after Mr. Cowen, but he was <hi rend="italic">nonest</hi>—after that the Serjeant still required the amended affidavit, which was not forthcoming; and, on 10th April, 1862, the Serjeant desired me to return the brief to Mr. Cowen, and write a letter stating his reasons, and returning the fee—the affidavits were to be made either by Cowen or Pounds—I know that Cowen saw Serjeant Pigott on 20th Decem<lb></lb>ber, 1861; Pounds was also present—that was before the moving—I do not know of Cowen seeing him afterwards—the brief being returned, I know no more of the matter, except that I met Pounds several times, and he seemed to be very assiduous—I believe these are some of the affidavits—there were five or six—this is one, and this is another—I have been clerk to Serjeant Pigott ten years—from my experience, Pounds did all the duty that was to be expected, from a person performing such a duty.</p>

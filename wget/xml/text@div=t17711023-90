On the 13th of August, I had been out a washing, when I came home about 9 at night, my mother was then, going out about other business; soon after, I went out on an errand for about ten minutes; when I came near the house I heard the door go, I had fastned it when I went out; I had left a candle in the window; I saw the light at the door; I called out who is there? and then I did not see her face, but by her shape and make, I knew it was the prisoner; I know her perfectly. Her cloak stuck out as if there was something under it; my mother came home in about five minutes, she missed the pot as soon as she came in. It was a copper pot, with a brass cover. She was not taken till about a month after: She was taken somewhere in Broker's-alley. When she was before Sir John, he asked her what she did with the pot; she said she sold it in Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Where you in the shop when this happened. - A. No, I was in the attic story of the house, I heard a cry of stop thief, it was nigh eight o'clock in the morning, on the 9th of October, I looked out of the window and saw several people running across the street about a stones throw from my door. I heard the words he has dropped the carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him drop the carpet yourself. - A. No, I did not, suspecting it might be from my shop I immediately went down stairs, and found the prisoner there surrounded by several people, he was brought into the shop, the prisoner said he hoped I would be merciful, he had done it through distress, that was before I spoke to him, the carpet was brought back and was in the shop then, I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never begged pardon and hoped the gentleman would forgive me. I said I was innocent.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Weight. On the morning the carpet was stolen I was sitting upon the sofa in the middle of the shop at work, it was about a quarter after eight in the morning, I did not see the prisoner walk in and take the carpet, but I saw him going out, he had a carpet with him, I had seen that carpet before in the window that morning; upon seeing this I got up and went after him, there was nobody else in the shop besides myself, I saw the carpet upon his left shoulder, he had just then got off the steps, I cried out stop thief, and the third door from the shop he threw the carpet down, when he threw the carpet down he attempted to run away, and in two or three minutes he was brought back again.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prison stop him then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had lost sight of him before he was brought back. - A. Yes, because I stooped down and picked the carpet up, he was brought back in about two minutes I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon having lost sight of him a short time, can you undertake to swear that the person brought back was the same man that you had seen drop the carpet, and that you had seen take the carpet out of the shop. - A. Yes I can, and that man was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You picked up the carpet, what did you do with it. - A. I carried it back in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Weight in the shop then, - A. No, not that moment, he came immediately almost. I heard the prisoner say he did it through sickness and distress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was at Marlborough Street Office the gentlewoman could not swear to my person at all, she said she only knew my back.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper of St. Pancras, the prisoner was brought to me about a quarter after eight o'clock, on the 9th of October, Mr. Weight gave charge of him for stealing a carpet. I have had the carpet ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The carpet is mine, it is Brussels carpet, it has the manufacturers mark on it, it is the same quantity and quality.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been yours. - A. Three months, it stood in the window, it is seventeen yards three quarters, it cost me more than five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You have none of the persons here that stopped him. - A. No. He was stopped by several of the neighbours that surrounded him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That morning I was looking for work. I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran round the corner, as I was running a man stopped me, he said I must go back with him, I had stolen some carpet, I said I was innocent. I went back without making any resistance. I know no more of it than you do.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

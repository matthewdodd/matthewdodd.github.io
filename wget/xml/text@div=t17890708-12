               <p>How came you to charge this as a capital charge, did any body tell you to do it? - No, nobody told me, I did it of myself.</p>
               <p>How came you to know it was a capital offence? - To be sure it was a capital offence.</p>
               <p>What is the distinction between its being a capital offence, and its not being so? - I am not so deep learned as that.</p>
               <p>Did not the officer or some person or other inform you that this was a capital offence? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to know it was a capital offence, to steal these articles in this way? - I know I was a sufferer by what I lost.</p>
               <p>What instructions did you give the officer about this indictment? - I told the gentleman that I had lost three gowns, valued at 40 s. a gown; a petticoat, value 5 s. another petticoat, value 5 s. a pair of laced ruffles, and a black silk petticoat.</p>
               <p>What did the officers say to you? - They said nothing to me, they asked me what I valued my things at? - I valued them as low as I could.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the things would sell at the value you put upon them? - A great deal more.</p>
               <p>Are there any other lodgers in your house? - No, I have nobody else, but myself and my daughter; the prisoner appeared like a gentlewoman, she locked the door when she went away; and took the key with her, which was about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>But during the time you saw your things last, in the morning; after the time you saw your things, was not your door left open occasionally, as it used to be before? - I used to shut my dining room door.</p>
               <p>But did not lock it? - No.</p>

               <p>I do not know the prosecutrix; about an hour ago she came with a gentleman to the Bail dock, and a person was standing at the window; she said, is your name Smith? She said, No, this is Mrs. Smith. Very well, says the prosecutrix, then we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080019"></xptr>shall know her in Court; and the goaler knows it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is this true that you went to the Bail dock? - Do you think she will not say any thing? No, my Lord; a Gentleman enquired for her.</p>
               <p>Was it in your presence, and at your request? - No, he came to me, and told me she was there, it was a gentleman, I stood upon the stairs, her name is on the list; I had no occasion to go to see her, I knew her face very well.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the woman? - I wish I was as sure of entering the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>I am quite a stranger; I have no witnesses, but there are women in the Bail Dock, that heard the prosecutrix make mention of these words.</p>

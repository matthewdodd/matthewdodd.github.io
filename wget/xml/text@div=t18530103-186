                  </hi>. I live at Burston, in Surrey, and am a bricklayer. I came by the railway to London-bridge on 15th Dec—I saw the prisoner there—he came up to me, and wanted to get into conversation—he asked me where I was going—I told him to Hackney—he said he was going that way, and he would forward me in the road—after we got over the bridge on this side of the water he took me up a narrow street which came into King</p>

               <p>William-street, and in that narrow street he picked up a silk bag—he opened it, and took out a ring, with a bill on it, "Paid, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said it was a gold ring, and said some one had been and purchased a ring, and given 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and as I was walking with him, I should go halves—he said he had no money, or else he would give me half the value of it—he said he was going to take the money for a load of timber he had sent in—we got to the end of the street into King William-street, and be pulled out the ring, and wanted me to give him half the value of it, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I pulled out my purse, and gave him a half-crown, three shillings, and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had no more small change—I had the ring, and he had the money—he put the bag in his pocket—he then pointed out the way to Hackney, and said he was not going farther that way—that was directly after he got the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I looked at the ring, went into a goldsmith's shop, and made inquiries—I had asked the prisoner if it was a gold one; he said yes, it was a gold ring, the stamp was on it—that was before I gave him the money—I found the prisoner the next morning by the railway station—I went up to him, and told him I wanted to see him—I had been searching for him—I beckoned to an officer, and he came and took him to the station—as the prisoner was going along, he said, "If you want your money you may have it"—I had parted with my money, believing what he said was true—I would not have parted with my money unless he had said what he did, and I believed him.</p>

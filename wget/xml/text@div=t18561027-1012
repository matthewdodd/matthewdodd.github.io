                  </hi>. I am a waistcoat maker, I live with my parents in Berners-street, Edgware-road Last Sunday week I was returning home, I was in Oxford-street about a quarter past 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner—I had not known him before—I was passing him—he laid hold of me—I laid hold of him, and put my hand in my pocket—I misled my pone, which tad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I asked him for it—he made usa of a very improper expression, and said if I did not let him go he would knock me down—he made a blow at me—I turned and caught the blow on the back of my head—he ran off—I pursued him, and the policeman took him.</p>

               <p>this place in Oxford-street—I have lived in the neighbourhood of Oxford-street a good while—there was no person with me—I knew the prisona had got my purse—I had no tustle or dispute with him before—the purse had been in the pocket of this dress which I have on now—I did not ask the prisoner to treat me—the first word I said to him was, "Give me my purse"—I knew he had taken it, because I felt his hand go into my pocket—I saw his hand in my pocket—my purse was a black one, it is imitation of leather—it had half a crown in it—he did not run away as soon as I made the charge, he said if I did not let go of him he would knock me down—he did not run till he hit me—he was twisting round to get away from me—he got from me and ran away—I ran after him and kept him in sight till he was taken—I walked by the side of the policeman to tin station—I did not appear against him the next day—I went there, and his friends got me away and gave me half a crown not to appear, and said if I did not appear he would get off—I did not stay at the station that night above half an hour—I had not been drinking, I had not had any—I did not ask the prisoner to give me something to drink—I had not my hand round his waist—I am not accustomed to be in the street at 12 o'clock it night, it is very seldom that I am there.</p>

I was on duty on that Sundtr night about a quarter past 12 o'clock—I heard a loud cry in a female voice, and screaming—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix struggling together—I went towards them, and just before I got to them the prisoner knocked the prosecutrix down and ran across the road—I ran and took him to the station—I found on him this purse, which the prosecutrix identified—it was open in his pocket, there was nothing in it—the piece of steel which goes inside the purse is broken away.</p>

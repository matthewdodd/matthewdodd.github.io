                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 20). I watched William Wester<lb></lb>dale's house, 68, Shoe-lane, for twenty days—(<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 1023)—during that time I saw the prisoner on several occasions. On 5th Oct. we followed him into the house, and this lead was on the scale by the side of him—about a quarter of an hour previously I had seen him come out of Westerdale's, and I followed him to some house in Salisbury-court—I then saw him again go into Westerdale's, and this lead was in the scale—I found three nails in the lead, and I found a belt round his body, which had been pulled down with the pressure of something that appeared to correspond with the nails in the lead—when I went in the prisoner was doing up his clothes—we searched Westerdale's house, and found a ton and a half of lead.</p>

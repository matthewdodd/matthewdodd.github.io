             sworn. - I went to bed about half past ten; I was the last up in the house; between eleven and twelve I heard some people in the passage; I thought they were the lodgers; I got up; we sleep down stairs in the parlour; it adjoins the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the shop, what state did you find it in? - A. I found a man standing behind the counter in the shop, with a lighted candle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was that? - A. The prisoner at the bar; I called out to my husband, and then he ran out of the shop door; my husband was very heavy asleep; I called him again, and when he got up he had a light of the watchman, and he came in to us; we looked about, the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence on the door? - A. I did not notice any.</p>
               <p>Q. Any lodgers in the house - did you leave the door open for them to come in? - A. No, I did not leave open the door for them to come in; the people that belonged to them were to open the door to let them in.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the housekeeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your shop to see if any of your property was lost? - A. I missed some bacon, pork, and some clothes; the bacon laid on the counter, the pork was in the shop, and the clothes were in a chest in the shop; I saw the man had nothing in his hand but a candle; I never saw any of my property again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to swear that the prisoner is the man - when you saw the man, you say you were frightened; he ran out immediately, and yet you say you are sure he was the man? - A. Yes, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was he taken? - A. I cannot exactly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. About an hour after; he was taken by Mr. Crow, and taken to the watch-house the same night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Kennedy swore at the Office that she went to bed at half past eleven o'clock, and that she saw me with the property in my hand.</p>

             sworn. - I know nothing more of the robbery than Mrs. Kennedy has related; the door seemed as if it had been opened with a key; there was about an hour's difference between this robbery and Mr. Crow's: I suspected where he lodged, he being tried last Sessions, and I went there with an officer, and searched it, but found none of the property.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Kennedy.) Did the street door open in the passage or in the shop? - A. In the passage, there is a door in the passage for the shop; I only saw him go out of the shop door; that door was fastened when I went to bed; the street door was fastened by a lock; there is a bolt, but I do not know whether it was bolted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Kennedy swore at the Office that the door was fastened with three bolts.</p>

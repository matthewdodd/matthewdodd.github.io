                  </hi>. I am clerk of the church of St. John the Baptist, Hoxton.

I became acquainted with the prisoner between three and four months ago—I was then a milliner—I knew him two or three months, and we were married at Aldgate-church, on the 11th of October—he represented himself to me as single—we lived together a fortnight, and he then went away—I expected him home on the Saturday night, and as he did not come I went after him to a public-house—I there heard he was married—I went to his father's the next morning, and found the pri<lb></lb>soner, and the woman that called herself his wife—she said she knew we were married.</p>

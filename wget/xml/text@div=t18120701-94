               <p>Q. Did you lose these things from your house - A. Yes, on Saturday was a fortnight. The prisoner had been a lodger in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of day were these things taken - A. In the morning I went to St. Paul's, for a load of wood for the turner. After that I went into the public-house, for a pint of beer. The prisoner followed me into the public-house. She said, she had a favour to ask of me, to borrow my key, to write a few lines. She said, she was very much distressed. I told her, she could do it at the public-house. She said, that would not do so well. I gave her my key, and when I returned home, and got into my room, I found every thing was gone; nothing was left but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010064"></xptr> the bare floor. The broker is here that bought the things, while I was out at hard labour.</p>
               <p>MRS. HYATT. Q. Did you give the prisoner liberty to take these things - A. No. I was not at home.</p>

            . I am a broker, No. 5, Monmouth-street. On the 20th of June the prisoner came to me. She asked me to buy some furniture: I went with her, and looked at the furniture. I bought the furniture of her in Carnaby-street, at Hyatt's room. I did not know whose apartment it was. I bought a stump-bedstead, a flock-bed, a deal table, and a deal box, of the prisoner. I gave her half-a-guinea for the lot. I asked her, whether they were her's. Yes, she said, and if I thought they were not, she would go to Marlborough-street, and swear it. I fetched the bed away at eleven o'clock, and at four o'clock I fetched the others away. I paid her before Mr. Berry, a publican, in Berwick-street. I sold the bed-stead immediately to a jack-ass man, going by. It was near a fortnight before I knew it was stolen. The officer came to me. I told him I had bought such things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I became acquainted with the prosecutor, through his wife washing some linen for me. When I met with him I was a little distressed. I wrote to a friend, who knew me in better circumstances. My friend sent me a two-pound note. The prosecutor asked me to lend him fifteen shillings; and the few things he had in the room, he said he would put in my possession. He told me, if he did not pay me the fifteen shillings by the Saturday following I might do with the things as I liked: and I seeing him spending money on the Friday, I asked him if he could pay me the money on the next day. He said, no, he had not a shilling. On the Saturday morning I told him I must have the money. I fetched Mr. Martin, the broker. He gave me half a guinea for the things. I waited the whole day. The prosecutor did not come in. Two or three days after, I went to look for the prosecutor. I could not see him. Afterwards the prosecutor took a warrant out against me. He claimed two pounds for his furniture. The broker came before the magistrate, and declared that he gave a fair price. He only gave half a guinea. After that he followed me to this prison, and said, if I would give a pound, he would let me free. I wrote to a friend for a pound. The friend would not lend it me. I have now to lament that ever I became acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never owed her a shilling.</p>

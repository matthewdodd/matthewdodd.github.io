               <p>I am a clerk in the Prerogative-office, Doctor's commons; I have the will in my hand; I brought it from the record-keeper, in the Prerogative-office, out of the proper place, where it is lodged in the Prerogative-office. (The will put in.) A probate was granted upon that will; here is the probate book; here is a book which contains the minutes of the court; I am the person that takes charge of this book; I enter the minutes in it; I enter the causes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What do you call that book? - This is called the assignation book in which all causes are set down that come before the Judge, and the register.</p>
               <p>Is there any other record than that entered in that book? - No.</p>
               <p>That is the record of the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then is that book the proper record of such proceedings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any other document whatever that appears to be the record of that court but that book? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the only record of the proceedings in the court in those causes? - Yes. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, Prisoner's Counsel. You do not write the minutes? - No.</p>
               <p>Are the minutes when entered signed by any body? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Then in fact the minutes made in that book, are made by somebody at the time the Judge is present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whether they are taken faithfully or, not, you cannot tell? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the book in which they are always entered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is no other? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you keeper of the book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it a genuine book, and does it remain in your hands unaltered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then credit is due to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. Is not there a rough book from which that is transcribed? - Not transcribed, there is a rough book which I keep myself.</p>
               <p>The register sits in court, and takes the direction of the Judge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you enter that direction into any other rough book or that? - No, I enter it in this book, and no other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Turn to the record of the probate having been granted, and the revocation, and point it out to the officer that he may read it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe you have happened to see the prisoner at the bar before this time? - I have.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when you did see him, whether Hickford was present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was this? - I can't speak exactly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were there minutes taken in writing? - I dare say they are in court.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did he sign the examination? - He refused to sign it.</p>
               <p>Court. In what way was the examination taken? - It was an examination not only of the prisoner, but the witnesses; and I asked the prisoner if what he said was true; he said yes, it was true, but that he would not sign any thing.</p>
               <p>(The Court ordered the rough minutes to be sent for, which was done.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Look at that will, Mr. Gale, what are you? - I am an engraver; I live in Crooked-Lane.</p>

               <p>Look at that will, to see whether that paper is not made from that plate? - I should rather suppose it was.</p>
               <p>What makes you rather suppose it was? - From the impression that the plate makes; here are some marks in the plate which correspond with the will.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say for a certainty that that will was made from that plate? - It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120032"></xptr>appears so, but it is possible to engrave a plate exactly like it, to make the same impression; provided they have the original to do it by.</p>
               <p>You could no doubt copy that plate exactly on another plate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing particular in that plate which corresponds with the will; are there any flaws in it? - Here is a mark or dent near the word executor, which seems to have happened from the stroke of some hard tool.</p>
               <p>Are there any flaws in that plate which appear on the will? - There is one which I have told you near the word executor.</p>
               <p>When was that plate engraved? - I can't tell.</p>
               <p>When did you repair it? - I can't take upon me to say, but I repaired a plate for Messrs. Mount and Page, on the 2d of April 1783.</p>
               <p>Now look at that plate, and see if you repaired that plate? - That is impossible for me to say; it was not my graving in the beginning, and therefore I can't swear to another person's work: I repaired a plate, but I can't take upon me to say that that was the identical plate; I remember one circumstance which refreshes my memory, there was to be some alteration in the motto, but I can't take upon me to say what the alteration was.</p>
               <p>Do not you know what the alteration was? - It is a Latin motto, and perhaps it might be in the word officii, but I cannot take upon me to say what the alteration was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect in that plate, whether you made any addition to that part or not? - I know there was some alteration, but I can't tell what the alteration was.</p>
               <p>Are you, as an engraver, able to say, whether from the examination of the plate, and the examination of the will, that the one is a copy of the other? - I take it to be so; I should rather believe so; it appears to be so.</p>
               <p>Does that appear to be an impression from a new plate, or a repaired plate? - This appears to be an impression from a plate that has been repaired.</p>
               <p>And the plate that you repaired was in 1783? - Yes, on the 2d of April 1783.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. The forms of all appear to be the same? - I believe they are nearly.</p>
               <p>Most capital stationers have a plate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the form of each of them is the same? - I should rather suppose so, but I cannot immediately say so.</p>
               <p>Court. What flaw is that you speak of? - If you observe, my Lord, it is between the word executor and the word of; there appears to be a small scratch; I doubt very much whether it would print now; I rather think it is too shallow; on looking at it again, I take notice that my mind is refreshed by some alteration; the word officii is made officie.</p>
               <p>On comparing this plate and the impression together, I should conceive that there can't be much doubt, whether that is an impression from that plate or not? - I firmly believe it is.</p>
               <p>Is there any doubt about it? - None, but that it is possible to make one so near as to be exactly alike, and to do that, it would be necessary for me to have the plate before me.</p>
               <p>If you were to copy the plate as an engraver, would you copy the flaws? - Most certainly not, without they were directed to be done so.</p>
               <p>From what inspection of that plate can you collect, that that is a repaired plate? - The work is not so clear; there are several things in it, which I, as a professional man, could point out clearly; but, which it would be difficult for me to make your Lordship understand.</p>

               <p>When a plate is once repaired, they work them down as long as they can before they are repaired again? - Yes, you can plainly see that that plate is much worked down.</p>
               <p>May not a person work an original plate as much down before they repair it? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>But still I do not collect from you, whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120033"></xptr>those particularities in the plate arise from its having been much used, or from its being repaired? - It may be seen from the hollows that it lies in, that it is a repaired plate.</p>
               <p>I should be glad if you would point out to me and the jury, how you know that is a repaired plate, so as to make us understand it? - From seeing the plate, it is very plain that the letters lie in those hollows, which could not have happened, unless it had been worked down and repaired; it is done by the wipe of the hand in printing; if you look at the letter S. in the last word before the blanks, that never could be graved so in the beginning.</p>
               <p>Why do you conceive that never was so graved originally? - Because no professional man would turn it out of his hands in that manner, and it is impossible that the plate could have been in the manner it now is, unless it had been repaired.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole then, you believe with certainty that that plate has been repaired? - I firmly believe it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Whether this is the plate you repaired, you cannot tell? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Any other plate in the same state would give the same impression? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great many stationers have plates? - Almost every capital stationer has a plate of the same kind.</p>

               <p>Whose is it? - It belongs to Mount and Page.</p>
               <p>Do you know when it was repaired? - I know we had one repaired in 1783.</p>
               <p>Had you any other? - No, I believe it is the same plate.</p>
               <p>Court. What reason have you for believing it is the same plate? - Because we have no other plate than this, and it is always left at the printer's.</p>
               <p>So whether he has returned you the same plate or not, you can't tell? - That I can't tell; I suppose he has; I give him the paper out to print upon.</p>
               <p>I suppose all capital stationers have plates of the same kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now suppose ten or a dozen different stationers sent paper, and sent their plates at the same time; is it at all unlikely that the printer may return not the identical plate, but another plate exactly alike? - I have never had any reason to think so; the plate is not returned at all; this plate has been in the possession of the printer ever since it was repaired.</p>
               <p>Who is your printer? - Mr. March.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - On Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is no evidence; when did you have it from him? - Two or three days ago, and last this morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You took the plate from Mr. Page's to Mr. Gale's to be repaired? - I suppose I might.</p>
               <p>What was the alteration to be made in it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Did you give the directions yourself? - No, I gave no directions.</p>
               <p>Court. Mount and Page had the plate repaired in 1783? - I know it from the book; I know it from nothing else.</p>
               <p>Where is that book? - The book is here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Is the entry your own? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose writing it is? - I am not quite certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it goes for nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Look at that plate, does that appear to be your plate? - I have no reason to doubt, I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Have you any other reason to think it is your plate, than because it was sent to the printer's, and not returned? - No other reason.</p>
               <p>Court. It has been above three years at the printer's? - Yes, since April 1783.</p>
               <p>You have not seen it during that time? - I don't believe I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120034"></xptr>Then what reason have you to suppose that is the same plate that went to the printer's at that time? - I firmly believe it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Are they alike, these wills; does every stationer have them exactly alike? - No, I have seen different ornaments; some with a ship at the top, some one way and some another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Suppose you were to see several bundles of wills at the Lord Mayor's Office, would you be able to pick out Mount and Page's? - No.</p>

            ? - I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Sir Sampson Wright: When this man was brought before you, he was charged by Mr. Knight, the solicitor to the Admiralty, with having forged this will? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Knight attend? - He did.</p>
               <p>He was charged with an offence supposed to have been committed in the city of London, as appears by the proceedings to day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was not charged with any offence stated to have been committed in the City of Westminster, or the county of Middlesex? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he had been charged before the chief magistrate of the city of London and discharged? - I really cannot recollect that particular.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know it of your own knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know how he happened to be brought before you? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knight examined by Mr. Shepherd. When did Ramsbottom first apply to you? - Some time in the course of last summer, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120035"></xptr>He applied to you, I believe, to know the reason of the stop having been put upon him? - Yes, he came to me about it.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, you informed him there was a stop? - He understood that.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him on what account the wages were stopped? - I do not recollect I told him whether the will was suspected to be forged, but I gave reason to understand that there were suspicions which prevented the payment of the money, but I did not give him to understand that in words.</p>
               <p>He applied to you several times after this? - He might be with me several times afterwards, but I cannot speak to the number, three or four I believe.</p>
               <p>Did not Ramsbottom understand from what you said, that there were suspicions that the will was forged? - No, I cannot say that he understood that any body suspected a forgery.</p>
               <p>Did not he offer to give you all the satisfaction he could? - He alledged it was a genuine will.</p>
               <p>Though he must have understood there were some suspicious about the forgery? - I suppose so, I cannot say what passed in his mind at the time.</p>
               <p>He came to you several times afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Knight, he was a little turbulent the last time? - I cannot say he was; he was rather noisy.</p>
               <p>How long was it between the first application and the last? - I am not capable of answering that.</p>

               <p>Was the last application before or after he had brought the action against the treasurer of the navy? - He brought his action in Trinity term.</p>
               <p>How far did the action proceed before you ever thought of making a charge against this man? - I believe it was in Michaelmas term following, that the charge was first made.</p>
               <p>Had not time for pleading expired, and time been granted you by his attorney to plead before this charge was made? - No, to the best of my recollection, the charge was made before the rule to plead was out.</p>
               <p>Had not Mr. Smith, the attorney for this man, given you time to plead twice before this man was charged? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not he once? - I do not think he had; I think it was early in November, about the 8th or 9th, and that the rule was not out.</p>
               <p>Previous to your applying to the Magistrate, you had applied to the Court of King's Bench, and obtained a rule to stay the proceedings in the action? - No, the obtaining the warrant against him, was in the beginning of November.</p>
               <p>Was that rule obtained, before the rule to plead expired? - I think it was not.</p>
               <p>Then with the warrant in your pocket, you went to the plaintiff's attorney, and begged time to plead, and obtained a consent for time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You met Mr. Smith? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Did he consent, or was there an order for time? - There was a consent perhaps, but I do not recollect whether the time was obtained before a Judge or not.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive a letter from Mr. Smith, giving you a second four days time to plead without going before the Judge? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to Mr. Smith about charging this man at the time? - I do not know that I did, nor do I know that I should; I told my opinion of the man.</p>
               <p>You applied to the Court of King's Bench to stay the proceedings? - I did.</p>
               <p>And the man was taken up under a warrant at the time? - About the time.</p>
               <p>He was examined before the Lord Mayor just before the day of the rule to shew cause, and discharged by the Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the rule to shew cause in the King's Bench was discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you whether at the time you said he was turbulent, you had not a quarrel with him? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120036"></xptr>You did not threaten to turn him out of your house? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you say this to him, that if he had not been an impudent man to you, the stop should have been taken off; but that you would care he should not have his wages? - Never.</p>
               <p>Do you deny that upon your oath? - I do, I might tell him he was an impudent fellow.</p>
               <p>Why did you call him so? - I thought him so, because he came several times, and was impertinent; he came in a very submissive manner once or twice.</p>
               <p>Did not he come, and offer to give you every satisfaction? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him as he had behaved so impudent, he never should have the stop taken off? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not you had a quarrel with him, and threatened to kick him out of the house, before you made the charge against him? - No; do you suppose I had any malice against this man? I was not privy to his being apprehended.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, whether before any warrant was taken out against him, you had not threatened to turn him out of your house? - I might call him an impudent fellow.</p>
               <p>Was not that before any proceedings were taken against him? - I believe it was, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it not in consequence of that quarrel that these proceedings were had? - No, it was in consequence of his urging the suit in the manner that he did.</p>
               <p>Then if he had brought no action against the treasurer of the navy, there would have been no prosecution against him? - I do not know; I have a hundred things to mind, and if I stop payment of the money; I think I have done a good act.</p>
               <p>How long after his first application was it that you took any steps against him? - Four or five months.</p>
               <p>How many times might you have seen him during that interval? - About three times I think, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>How long before the 8th of November was the last application, when he behaved so ill? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How many days before you went before the Lord Mayor? - I cannot say whether it was one, two, or three months.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was more than two days after the quarrel, that you went to the Lord Mayor, and got the warrant against him? - My opinion is, that it was much longer than days or weeks.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was a week? - I think it was more.</p>
               <p>How came you not to think of taking out a warrant against him before? - The man had been so impudent, that it was thought advisable to take some step against him.</p>
               <p>You had this warrant out the 8th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you execute it? - The 23d I believe.</p>
               <p>How came it not to be executed till the very day, or the day before, the rule to shew cause? account to the Jury for that. - I do not know that I had found out where he lived.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that was the reason, and that you had given it to be executed before that day? - I think I gave it to be executed on the 21st, and that it was on account of my not knowing where he lived, that it was not executed.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that was the reason? - No, I do not, I cannot give any reason; I did not take these steps without consulting my principal Mr. Dyson.</p>
               <p>I want some reason why for the space of five months this step was not taken, and why it was taken on the very day, on which the rule to shew cause was appointed to be heard? - On the declaration being filed, and the appearance entered, the papers were laid before counsel to advise what was proper to be done.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I believe so, and they advised the motion, to stay proceedings till he had surrended.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120037"></xptr>That motion was made at the beginning of the term, do you recollect that? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Was it made before, or after the warrant was taken out? - After; the motion was advised to stay the proceedings on the ground of the warrant being out first.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was taken before the Lord Mayor, he was discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken up again? - About seven months; we had not evidence sufficient to found a commitment the first time.</p>
               <p>Did not he come to you after he was discharged by the Lord Mayor, and offer to give you all the satisfaction in his power? - He never did give me any satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Did he not point out to you where you could find out information? - He did.</p>
               <p>After he had been taken up and discharged, did he not come to you, and suggest some clew, whereby you might find Hickford out, and where he was born? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he come to tell you this after you had advertized for him, with a view to this prosecution? - No, I think it was before.</p>
               <p>When did you advertize? - Upon my word I cannot tell; it was before the action.</p>
               <p>Did you not advertize after the discharge before the Lord Mayor? - Both before and after.</p>
               <p>Did not he after that come to you? - He came to offer to give satisfaction, and to say that it was a real will, and that he could prove it.</p>
               <p>How long after, and how many times? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you never know where he lived? - No.</p>
               <p>After this discharge, you knew where he lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After the discharge he came to you, and there was an interval of seven months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came he not to be taken before the Magistrate in the city? - I do not know, he was taken before the Magistrate in Bow-street, and sent into London to be examined, because the offence was committed in London.</p>
               <p>How came that not to be done the second time? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his presenting a petition to the Board of Admiralty, for leave to produce evidence to substantiate his claim? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I believe he was not taken the second time till after that? - No, it was in consequence of that petition that the Board gave orders, that whenever he applied for an answer to that petition, he should be taken up; we had endeavoured to take him up before; we were prepared with evidence long before he was taken up the second time, but could not find his place of abode.</p>
               <p>Did he attend for an answer to that petition? - I do not know that he did, I was out of the way at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Satisfy these gentlemen in the first place, in what capacity did you act? - I am agent to the solicitor of the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>You were pursuing the public duty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was it that you first knew any thing of the will of

            ? - I saw the will of Mitchell and three or four more, that were proved by this man in the Commons; certain suspicions arose in my mind, and in consequence of that, I wrote letters to the different pay-offices, to desire the officers to stop payment of their wages.</p>
               <p>When did he first apply to you, not till after the publication of course? - No.</p>
               <p>This man in consequence of some applications to you, had put this matter in a cause of civil proceeding, by bringing an action against the treasurer of the navy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you, as the solicitor to that Board, were employed to defend that action? - I was employed by Mr. Dyson.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120038"></xptr>If it had not been for the action being brought, you would never have thought of prosecuting him? - Not I indeed.</p>
               <p>But in consequence of that being set on foot, you searched about for further evidence? - I advertised immediately.</p>
               <p>Subsequent to the information before the Magistrate, had you got further evidence? - I had; when I found he still prosecuted his suit, I advertised again, and the deceased's attestation was sent to me from Portsmouth, upon that he was taken up again.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have you prosecuted him from any private malignity? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You had received some account from Portsmouth, that this man came from Little Brickhill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had told you that before? - Yes, but I had forgot it.</p>
               <p>Court. You have since found he was from Little Brickhill? - Yes.</p>

               <p>By what means did you come at this? - It was in consequence of a letter I sent to Portsmouth desiring them to search for the name of

               <p>Then if you had given credit to the information of the prisoner you might have found Hickford out before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you found Hickford out, he was brought up to town and examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The second warrant was taken out on his information?</p>

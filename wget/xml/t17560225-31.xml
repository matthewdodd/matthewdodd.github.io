I went by them, there came by a quaker, I stopt and saw them stop my wife, I thought they had been buying goods till I heard her make a noise; there came a soldier by, I said to him I'll give you 6 d. if you will bid my wife make haste after me; he said he would; he went on, and I on my way; my wife did not come to me that night, the next morning I went to Uxbridge and at the Sun I heard of her, but did not find the prisoner; this day 8 weeks I went there again and heard the prisoner was inlisted for a soldier, I took him up there. I charged him with robbing my wife; he said I beg my life, I will give you your goods back again if you'll forgive me; he owned he and another rob'd her, but said he had but 4 of the handkerchiefs, I told him I would forgive him, I thought him more a fool than a rogue; he confessed the same before the justice.</p>

This man came into the alehouse, I believe he did spend some money, but I never heard-before now, that my wife had gone into the field with a man; I did promise, if I knew how to save my bond I would not prosecute; I am sure, for I saw her, she did not go into the field with any body.</p>

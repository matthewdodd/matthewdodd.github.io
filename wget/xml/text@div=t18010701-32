             sworn. Q. Are you a customer of Mr. Wright's? - A. Yes: On the 25th of May, my wife, in my presence, paid the prisoner sixteen shillings and ten-pence; here is a receipt for it, which I saw him write. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, It is customary, in the baking business, for the master to make out the weekly bills; on Monday, the 25th of May, I carried out bills, and received money to the amount of near four pounds, but having the misfortune to lose two seven-shilling pieces through a hole in my pocket, and ashamed to tell my master I had lost them, I meant to conceal it from my master till I received my wages; on Tuesday, through the vexation of losing the two seven-shilling pieces, I went out, and got intoxicated; the next morning, going out to have a pint of beer, being at work without my clothes, meaning to come back immediately, but seeing two persons in the house who knew me, and being a country person, and easily persuaded, I got drinking with them till between eleven and twelve; I left the house very much intoxicated, and went to a neighbour's house, and laid down to sleep, but my master got intelligence where I was, and came to me, and through teasing me to wake, I rose and struck my master, which I am very sorry for, having lost my senses; I told my master I had received the money, but had lost it through a hole in my poc ket; at that time, my master held eleven shillings in his hand, wages due to me; and my friend would have paid him the rest, but my master is determined to prosecute me, because I struck him; I hope it will appear that I did not mean to wrong my master, or I should have kept the whole I received that day.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Wright). Were there any wages due to him? - A. There were seven or ten shillings, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to let you take that as part of the money? - A. Not till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you at any time that he had lost the money through a hole in his pocket? - A. He never mentioned that till he came up for re-examination at the office, and the Magistrate asked him if he had learned that since he had been in Bridewell. <rs id="t18010701-32-verdict182" type="verdictDescription">

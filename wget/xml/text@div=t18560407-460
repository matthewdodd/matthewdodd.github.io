                  </hi>. I live at No. 52, Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell; I am stoker to some baths and washhouses. I was in Shoe-lane on 1st April, about 10 o'clock—there was a fire there, and a crowd—I was close by the end of Harp<lb></lb>alley—I saw the prisoner come across the road, close to me, and stand against me—he stopped close against me too long, and I put my hand against him, and pushed him away—I stood back as well as I could, and I found my watch guard palled—the chain was round my neck, and the watch in my waistcoat pocket—I heard the guard snap, and I seized the prisoner—he struggled to get away, and stooped down, and while he was doing that I saw the watch in his hand—he got his hand away, but I kept hold of the collar of his coat—I had seized him by the hands first, and he struggled, and got his hands away, and while he was struggling I saw the watch in his<lb></lb>hand—the crowd pushed about, to see what was the matter—I kept the prisoner till the policeman came—I have not got my watch—I do not know what has become of it—the crowd was so great and so close that he might pass it away—when I looked at my watch guard the ring was gone.</p>

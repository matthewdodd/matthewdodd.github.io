I wrote the name and address on it, and put it into the till - (looks at one) - this is it. My master was behind the counter. I found we had not change enough in the till, and asked Mr. Buckthorp for some silver. The prisoner then said he might as well take the tea from our shop. He had a quarter of a pound of 10 s. tea, and a pound of sugar, which came to 4 s. 7 d. together. My master gave me the silver, and I gave the prisoner the change. My master then took the note out of the till, and said he did not like it - the prisoner took it out of his hands, and said he did not see where the deficiency was; he asked Mr. Buckthorp how he could tell? - my master said he was satisfied it was a bad one, and that he should not let it go out of his possession. He took it out of the prisoner's hands, and asked what Mr. Greaves was? he at first said he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010037"></xptr>a gentleman - my master asked him afterwards, and he said he was an East India merchant. He then asked him where his counting-house was? he said in Lothbury, but he did not know the number - that the cook had taken the note of a butcher in Guildford-street, and upon my suggestion, Mr. Buckthorp went out with him to see if the address was right - they returned in five or ten minutes.</p>

               <p>"Do you live with Mr. Greaves?" he said he did, but had not lived long there. He appeared to be trying to get from me - I collared him, and said,</p>

               <p>"I am sure you do not." He caught hold of the iron rails and said,</p>
               <p>"Pray let me go, and I will tell you." I said he should not, and took hold of him. Two men, who were standing by, refused to assist me. I took him back to my shop - several of my neighbours asked me to let them see the note. I never lost sight of it - they gave the note into my hands. The prisoner arose, made a snatch at it, and put it into his mouth. My lad, who was by, made a snatch at it, pulled a piece off, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got the number!" Mr. King, who stood by, caught hold of him by the throat, and we wrenched the note out of his mouth; the prisoner caught hold of it with his hand, I got it from him, pasted it together, and gave him in charge. I marked the note. He was searched, and four keys, 2 3/4 d., and a piece of leather found on him. This is the note - (looking at it).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went to the grocer's for the tea and semolina, I did not conceive I had a right to put my name on the note, but thought I might put any other as well as my own; I did not know that was a breach of the law - I did not know it was forged. He said he would compare it with another - I asked him where the deficiency was? he shewed me, and held them both in his hand; I could have taken them both from him if I had been inclined. Does it appear likely that I should stand close to the door. and not have run away rather than subject myself to a prison.

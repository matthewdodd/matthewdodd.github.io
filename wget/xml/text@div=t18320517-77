               <p>ANN SIMMONDS. I am the wife of John Simmonds. My daughter, Elizabeth Ann Simmonds, had a necklace on on the 16th of April, and was playing at the next door to my house, in <placeName id="t18320517-77-crimeloc449">Devonshire-street, New North-road</placeName>

               <p>JOSEPH WARE. I am the son of William Ware, of Dean-street. On the 16th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was standing opposite Devonshire-street; the two prisoners ran past me, and Brown gave something to Parton - I ran after them, and saw Brown taken at the top of the bridge; I saw a white ball in his hand while he was running, but it was not that which he gave to Parton - he had that when he was taken.</p>
               <p>DAVID GORDAN. I am servant at the Robin Hood and Little John. About noon, on the 16th of April, I was at Bridport-place, about fifty yards from Devonshire-street; I took Brown to the station-house - I saw some beads afterwards picked up in a garden in Hyde-place.</p>
               <p>PHILIP REGNARD. I live with my father in Bridport-place. On the 16th of April I was in the North-road; Mrs. Simmonds came out of Devonshire-street, and said some boys had stolen her child's necklace - I saw the two prisoners running, and Parton ran by the garden wall, where the beads were found; as he ran close by the wall I saw him take the beads from under his jacket, and throw them over; I took them up.</p>
               <p>JAMES MILLER (Police-serjeant N 8). I took the prisoner into custody; I found this ball in Brown's hand, and received these beads from Regnard - I had known Parton before; he at first denied this, but afterwards said he did it for want.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH ANN SIMMONDS. I am six years old. I was by my mother's door; Brown came and gave me some chalk, and then snatched my necklace - Parton was with him, and they ran off together; I told my mother - this is my necklace.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I had nothing to do with it.</p>

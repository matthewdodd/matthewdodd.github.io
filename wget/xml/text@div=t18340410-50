On the 6th of March, a little before one o'clock, he took a candle, and went down into the nail cellar - he very soon came out, and went out to go to his dinner - observing his pocket stick out, I went after him, and desired him to come back - I met an officer, and we all went into a smith's shop, in Westbury-street - I found two papers of nails on him - I afterwards went to his lodging, and found six pictures, seven pair of tongs, three cleavers, and a great many nails and screws - I know them to be mine by the mark on them - he lodged at the corner of Lawrence-lane<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100036"></xptr>- he was allowed to lodge there rent free, on my recommendation - (articles produced) - the papers have my mark on them, made by my young man; and many of the articles at his lodging had my mark on them - the greater part of them are marked.</p>

            . Q. Is your young man in your employ now? A. Yes; some of the things found at his lodging have my mark - there were other goods with them which did not belong to me- he has not been in the habit of purchasing ironmongery on his own account, not to my knowledge - if I had known it, I certainly should not have kept him - he lodged in an empty house - I found the goods in a closet, between the room he sat in, and the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. With his hat on? - A. Yes; I said, pardon me, sir, what have you there; he said, it is only the string of my hat; whether in my hurry I knocked his hat off, or whether it came off by touching the band, I cannot say, but the hat fell, and I think the prisoner caught it, for it did not fall to the ground; I then saw a gown in the crown of his hat; I said, that is my gown; he then threw it on the bed in the other room; the door which goes out of one into the other was open: he said, I am a man of honour, and a gentleman, you cannot suppose a person of my appearance would be guilty of taking a gown, I merely did it out of a hit of fun; I then laid hold of him, and brought him down stairs, and when he was on the first floor landing, he called out, Jack, Jack; the street door was open when he came down; I still had hold of him, and called, stop him, stop him; a little girl who was in the house hearing me scream, came up from the kitchen; she screamed, and at that time the prisoner broke from me, and went out; a young man, of the name of Joseph Simpson, was standing at the door; I said, stop him, stop him, he has stole my gown; he then went after him; the prisoner was brought back by Simpson in about five minutes, and then he was taken to Marlborough-street; I am sure the prisoner is the same man; I saw nothing more of the elderly man.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the room was your gown lying? - A. In a drawer belonging to the wardrobe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270012"></xptr>in the back room of the second floor, I had seen it there on the Sunday morning, this was on the Monday; it is a Japan Muslin gown.

             sworn. - I am a bricklayer, I was employed at Mr. Renaud's; I was standing at the door, and saw an elderly man ran out of the house; about two minutes after the prisoner came to the door, and the lady said, stop him; I was going to stop him, and he went back to the lady, and the lady directly laid hold of him; the elderly man was then outside the door; the prisoner said, Jack, Jack; the man said, d - n you, and immediately ran away; the prisoner then got away from the lady; he got a few yards off, between a run and a walk; the lady desired me to run after him, for he had stole her gown; I immediately ran after him, I ran into Bond-street, and there I saw a mob before Mr. Dalby's, a silversmith; directly that I went up to the door, the prisoner came out, clapped me on the back, and said, I will go back with you to the lady myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him? - A. No; I immediately laid of him, and when he got into Brook-street, he said, I will go and fetch the other man, he has got the gown; I said, never mind, I will take you first, and fetch the other man afterwards; I took him to the lady's house, and from there we took him to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came down stairs with the gown in my hand, it was lying on the bed; the lady said, I was going to stealher gown; she seemed very timid and frightened; I told her she need be under no apprehension of my taking it, it was not my intention; I then threw it on the bed in the first floor, and told her not to be a alarmed; I desired her to sit down, and be perfectly reconciled; I went down stairs, supposing she was perfectly reconciled, having her gown left there; when I got near the door, the brick layer's boy was standing at the door; the lady immediately followed, and took hold of me by the arm; I stopped a considerable time, and then she called, stop him; she let go my arm, and I was walking on; I went as far as Mr. Dalby's shop; when I went in, Mr. Dalby was very much surprised at seeing such a mob round the door; seeing the bricklayer's boy standing at the door, I came to the door, and told him I should return back with him to the lady very quietly, and I returned back to the lady's house; some people came into the parlour where I was, and they sent for a constable; not finding a constable, they proposed going to a Magistrate, and I was taken to Marlborough-street. <rs id="t18021027-25-verdict137" type="verdictDescription">

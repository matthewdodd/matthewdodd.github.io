                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Burton-street, Walworth. On Saturday, the 7th of September, the prisoner came to town in the same wagon with me from Barnet fair—I met him there—he assisted me on my arrival in town in taking my things into Favell's livery-yard at Islington—I did not allow him to remove any of these things afterwards—I missed an iron boiler and some joints of meat, and a coat—the boiler contained beef, mutton, and ham—he had taken these things these the night before—I missed them the next day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I assisted you at Barnet fair in building your booth, and to get away without paying your rent—you were obliged to put your things in a coal wagon—I went to Favell's, and asked permission to leave them till next morning, as my own property, and next morning I fetched them with an intent of coming to your house, but on the way I met a person, and got intoxicated, and whether that person took. them or not, I can<lb></lb>not say. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I had not run away—I brought the things in a coal wagon—the prisoner was not a partner with me in any way—we did not mention any name when the things were left, only he assisted me in taking them—it was his thought to take them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler at Favell's yard. On the Saturday night after Barnet fair, Baker and the prisoner brought a number of things there, and left them—on the following morning the prisoner came, and said be came from Mr. Baker, who was with him when he left the things—I got the things, and lifted the boiler and its contents on his back, and he went away—I did not see the coat—Baker's name was not mentioned when the things were left.</p>

            . I am a shopman to the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner coming into the shop between the hours of six and seven, on the 25th of last month, she and another woman came together, she bought a small quantity of muslin of the value of one shilling and ninepence. Mr. Clively came down in the mean time, and suspected them, and soon after they went out he followed them; I had not missed any thing at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Clively. You followed the prisoner - A. Yes, I followed them home to her house; after they went in, in consequence of suspecting them, I went to the office, got an officer, and searched them. When we came back both the women were gone, the prisoner after some time came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you when you first went there - A. No, not till I followed them. When she came home we searched the house, and found a piece of print, which I knew to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that print before the time that is was taken - A. I had seen it in the day; Jones had taken the print down just before they came in.</p>
               <p>Jones, The print was on the counter at the time the prisoner came in; I never missed it until it was brought back to the shop; the shop mark was taken off, it was a fag end.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be yours - A. It was on the counter when they came in; I looked on the counter and missed it; when the print was taken there was more in quantity: the fag end was taken off; when it was brought back it was seven yards, and when the print was taken it was fifteen or sixteen yards. I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it - 
               <persName id="t18150215-6-person117">A. </persName>
            Seventeen-pence halfpenny a yard; there is seven yards and a half of it now; that is the cost price.</p>

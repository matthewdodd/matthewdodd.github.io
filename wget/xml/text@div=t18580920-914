                  </hi>. I am a carpenter of Victoria-terrace, North Woolwich. On the night of 25th August, I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I was given to understand that my premises were fastened—I fastened the window myself with a nail—I was awoke in course of the night by hearing a noise</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185809200057"></xptr>
               <p>at a little after 1 o'clock; I called to know if it was Miss Izod, and she called out, "It is not me,"—I got up, put on my trowsers and shoes, and went down stairs—I went in the back parlour and saw the prisoner there—he had got in at the back parlour window—there was not a regular fastening to that window, but I had put a nail in at each end, and the nails had got in between the two sashes—I asked the prisoner how he came there; he said he came for a night's lodging—he could not have got in there if he had not been sober—a chest of drawers stood before that window, on which was a jug; I could scarcely have got in without knocking it off; a drunken man could not.</p>

I was called in by the prosecutor about 1 o'clock on the morning of 26th August; he gave the prisoner into my custody—I asked the prisoner what he was doing there; he made use of very abusive language, and said I should not take him in custody—I took him to the station; he had been drinking, but he knew what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the foot-patrol. In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I went this month to the Boar's Head, Barnet, which is kept by David Jones—the prisoner lives there—he was ostler and carter—he is father-in-law to Jones, who has a farm at Bently-heath, South Mims, about two miles and a half from the public-house—I went to the Boar's Head on the 15th, and saw Jones and the prisoner—I was asking Jones if he had got any harness that came from some person at Whetstone—he said "No, I have not-do you know anything about it, Wilson?"—Wilson said, "I do not"—that was all that passed at that time-Jones and I were in the yard, and Wilson was in the stable, at the door—I went into another stable on the opposite side of the yard, and noticed there a chaise-bridle-Jones was with me—I took such notice of the bridle as to know it again—I should think that was seven or eight yards from the stable the prisoner had been in—I then went to look for Mr. Bass that he might look at the bridle, and while I was gone, the bridle was removed—I came back in half an hour and found only Jones—I looked into the same stable where the prisoner had been when I was there first, but I did not see him on the premises—I saw him the next morning at the Boar's Head-before that I had found a chaise-bridle, a pair of hames, a collar, and the other articles, in a pond in the farm at Bently-heath—they were in a sack, and had three large stones to sink them—that was about seven o'clock in the evening of the same day—the bridle was the same that I had seen at the stable—the following morning I went again to the Boar's Head—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in company with Jones—I said, "You are both my prisoners, I charge you not to say anything to me except you please, whatever you say now may go in evidence against you, I have found the property in a pond at your farm, and I understand it was put there by Wilson"—Wilson was for some time still, and then he said, "They cannot do any<lb></lb>thing with me, I only carried it to the farm"—Jones said, "I sent it away to make things straight"—when I first went to the premises, I said in the prisoner's presence, I came about some harness which had come from Whetstone"—had they had any from any person there?</p>

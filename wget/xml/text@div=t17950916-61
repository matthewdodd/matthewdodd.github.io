I heard some coffee fall as though it fell out of his pocket; I did not hear any thing of him for some little time, and I concluded that he had made his escape; I desired the foreman of the warehouse to go down to see whether he was gone or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he go down into the cellar for? - To take it down to the cellar to return it. His being quiet in the cellar, I concluded that he was gone. When the foreman came down he was not there, he had made his escape out of the loop hole door; at his coming up he told me that the prisoner was not there, and by accident be put his hand on the hogshead where the blue jacket lay, and found eight or ten pounds of coffee in that jacket. The prisoner acknowledged it was his jacket in my presence, but first of all he denied it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - No, nor any thing of the kind. The foreman went in pursuit of the prisoner; the coffee was taken our of his jacket and put into a handkerchief, and it weighed eight pounds, in the presence of Mr. Pearson, the proprietor, the constable, myself, and foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the warehouses from whence this was taken, all under the Bull porters? - Entirely.</p>

I then went after the prisoner, and took him in Thames-street, in about five hundred yards; I went up to him and took hold of him, and desired him to come along with me down to my master's to take his money, for I told him I thought he was a man not sit to work among us; he seemed very much agitated; he did not make any resistance, but he kept walking on, and passing the Steel house coffee<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160168"></xptr>house, I see master, and I backoned to him, and he came out, and we took the prisoner.

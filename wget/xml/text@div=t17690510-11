I went there. Lion soon came in and said, Here is my partner, meaning me; then Cook went with us to Lion's house. The cloth was laid upon the table and opened; we looked at it. I asked Cook what he asked a yard for it; Cook said, Is it not worth a Bull?</p>
               <p>Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Keys. That is a crown. I said I thought that too much; then he said it is worth a Kick, that is four shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know this language?</p>
               <p>Key. I was deputy-keeper of the Poultry Compter twenty years, and have been pretty much used to such sort of gentry. I then asked him where he made it; he told me he made it at Kensington, and that there were about five or six-and-forty yards more of it of different colours. I then pulled out my staff and took him by the collar, and told him he must go along with me. Then I went and took Morris, and put them both in the Compter. I then applied to my Lord Mayor, for leave to carry them before Sir

Then Morris said it was as much Cook's as it was his, for they made it together. I advertised it, and went and enquired at Kensington, but could not find an owner. It is superfine black cloth. ( Produced in Court.) After that Morris said he was a watchmaker, and had made a watch for a man that came to four pounds ten shillings for this cloth, and the man was gone abroad.</p>

            . Mr. Lion came to me some time in April, and said there were two men had brought some cloth to his house to sell, and that he did not care to but any more. We agreed to secure them. He sent me to the Raven and Ship in Leadenhall-street; there were the two prisoners drinking with two women; then in came Lion and Keys. Then he and Keys went out with Cook and left me to take care of Morris. I heard Cook say they got it at Kensington. The rest of his evidence as Keys had said before.</p>

               <p>On the Monday night before I went through a house in Red-Lion-square, Holborn, where was Morris, and he asked me whether I could make half a day, saying, he had some cloth that he had of a gentleman on board a ship, and if I would go with him he would pay me what he owed me; he came to me the next morning, and we went to the Ship in Leadenhall-street, and spoke to Lion and asked him if he would buy any cloth. Lion said, it should be very safe if he would leave it there while he went to the synagogue. We left it. Lion came again in about a quarter of an hour, and these two gentlemen were there: he desired me to come along with him, so I went with him to his house. Then he said, he must turn his wife and children out, as he did not care<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100012"></xptr> to let any body be in the room. Then he asked me what I asked a yard. I told him it cost the young man twelve shillings a yard. He said it was very coarse; and first bid me four shillings a yard, then four shillings and sixpence. Then Keys took me by the shoulder, and said he was an officer, and pulled out his staff; he took me to the Compter, and the next morning before Sir

               <p>"I want you;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Go down to the kitchen Carter, and I will come to you immediately;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I will stop here." I gave the child to the girl immediately - he said,</p>
               <p>"Let us go into the yard." I was walking in the yard, and just as I got out at the back door, the pistol went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you guess whether it was loaded - A. Yes; I found myself struck on the shoulder, it could not be a bullet, for I was struck in more than one place, it must be shot, or something of that sort, they did not lodge in my flesh; he was quite close to me, when it went off, it made my shoulder black, that was all, it did not injure me in any respect whatever; it was a kind of a horse pistol, I asked what he was about, I do not know his exact words, but I believe he said I had been a great rogue to him, I heard no shot pass me - he had been in my employ about nine months, he dismissed himself; he came and asked for money, I said I could not get it, and he summoned me - I had been arrested and could not pay him, and at this time I owed him 2 l. 17 s. 6 d.; he was most likely in great distress, he was a sober, honest man, I never noticed any thing wrong in his mind, I think he was not above three yards from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He had applied for the money, and said he was distressed - A. He did not say he was distressed, I have been good friends with him since, and forgive him for what he has done.</p>

I heard the report, and came down stairs, it was not very loud; I found the prisoner standing by the clock, and fetched an officer; since that, I have seen Beeson and him shake hands and forgive each other, and say what had passed should be buried in oblivion - I believe Carter to be an injured man, there could not be much powder in the pistol, or it would have made more noise.</p>

I received a cheese of twenty-five pounds weight, on Saturday the 21st of September, at my master's house; I placed it with thirty-five others under a shed, about two o'clock in the day; I did not see it again till half-past six o'clock, when the beadle told me something; I then missed it - I went with him and saw it- this is it, it is marked G. S., and is worth 10s.</p>

            . I am a beadle. On the evening in question, I was in Queen-street, Cheapside; I saw the prisoner with this cheese on his back; I followed him for some time; I came up to him, and asked where he was going with that cheese? he said, to Hill-street, Finsbury-square; but he did not know the number, nor the man's name, who he was going to; he said, he brought it from Mr. Parker's; I asked if he had any note? he said"No" - I followed him till I got to Guildhall-yard, and there took him into custody; he there said he took it through want.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the water-side to look for work, but could not get any; as I was coming back, a man asked me to carry the cheese to Finsbury-square, and said he would pay me for it; I went up Queen-street, and the officer took me.</p>

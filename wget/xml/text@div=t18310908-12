               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had or not? A. I should say I had not - I know them to be mine; he had a pair of trousers in the bag, and they were mine - I had seen them the night before, and left them in the front kitchen; I examined the premises, and found he had got in at a back window, over a shed in the yard - it was the fourth morning I had been robbed, exactly in the same way; it is a sash window, but does not throw up - it was made fast; I found three panes broken - there was a sufficient hole for him to get through; I had seen the window over night - the panes were whole then; the prisoner had been in my service once for four years; I lived in that house all that time - he has left me about six months - (looking at the goods produced by Agate and Young) I know this bag, and all the articles of it to be mine.</p>

On the 12th of August, at five minutes before six o'clock, I went down the Savoy, by Mr. Willows' and saw a man coming out of his back window, on the first floor - he dragged a green bag out; I called Agate, the Policeman, who was in sight- the man then got out of the window, and got into the back yard; I got over the wall by the shed into the prosecutor's premises, and found the prisoner down in the cellar- he had got into the cellar from the yard, and was secured; he had got the green bag in the cellar - the Policeman took possession of it.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLOWS. I had seen the trousers in the front kitchen the night before - I had seen the green bag in the first floor back room shortly before, or the day before, and I had left this wine-glass in the back room.</p>

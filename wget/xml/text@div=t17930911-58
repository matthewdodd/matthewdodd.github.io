               <p>Q. Is there any of your servants that did? - No. I went to Mr. Cary, a basket-maker, in Oxford-street, the prisoner's lodging, and there I found twelve brushes, he lived with me some months in the winter; nine of these twelve brushes I knew to be my property by my private mark, and one by a defect in making the brush; the private mark on them is R: the other two I cannot swear to. This was on the 7th of August, about six or before seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Mr. Cary's? - Mr. Walker, the constable of St. George's, and Mr. Marsh, the Sadler, called on me, in consequence of which I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in that house? - I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. And before this you had not missed them; can you, by these marks, swear that these were brushes you never sold? - I cannot positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had the care of these brushes ever since? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was four months that this man had left you before you received this intelligence? - More than four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever a better man in your service, so far as you had an opportunity of observing his conduct? - He was a very valuable <rs id="t17930911-58-deflabel314" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. This man having left you four months, you had not missed any brushes? - Never till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has been employed in selling brushes since this man has left you? - Five or six persons have the power of disposing of them if a customer calls,</p>
               <p>Q. From the number of your stock, and from the state of these things in your stock, you did not know that any were missing, therefore whether any servant had disposed of these brushes it is impossible for you to tell? - It is so.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of St. George's, Hanover-square. Mr. Robinson who was the master of the prisoner, came to me on Tuesday with a search warrant. to search the apartment of the prisoner, at the biscuit baker's, the upper end of Oxford-road, Mr. Cary's; the search warrant was for a cravet; we went and did not find it, and in searching the box I found sixteen brushes, which Mr. Wilson termed horse brushes, but some were differently covered have them here, I have kept them ever since (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. At the time you took these brushes, did any thing pass between you and Mr. Wilson, and the prisoner? - The prisoner was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were the prisoner's lodging? - Because I went to to Mrs. Cary's, and she took me up, and he went home, and he confessed it was his box that contained the things where the brushes were; I broke his boxes open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about them at any time? - Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where was this said that he said about the box? - It was said in the apartment at Marlborough-street office, not while he was present before the the justice, or before the justice's clerk, he said, did you open the other box, because there is money in it? says I, I opened both the boxes; says he, it is my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he spoke as easy as if I was to ask you whether the shirt on your back is your own, and you would say yes?</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you ascertain at all whether there was any brushes missing in your house? - No, not at all.</p>

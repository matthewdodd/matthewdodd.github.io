On the 13th of June, while I and my wife were at Vauxhall, a ring, which had been stolen from our bedroom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300040"></xptr>a few nights before, was replaced; we missed three ear-rings and a pair of ear-drops from a small box, at the same time - in consequence of this, on the 15th of June, I gave out that we were going to the theatre: I placed Morris and Beasley in my room to watch at half-past eight, and we went to sup at my sister's, in New-street, and were fetched at half-past ten.</p>

            . I and Beasley concealed ourselves in the prosecutor's bed-room; I was behind the curtain, and about half-past ten o'clock I heard a gentle noise at the front room door, and in a minute the prisoner entered the bed-room at the door between that and the front room - she opened the door - the gas shone through the window, and I think she saw us, for she was retreating, when I seized her - she lodges in the next floor over the bed-room: I said</p>
               <p>"We have got the thief at last - how came you here?" she said she thought she heard some one in the room, and came to see who it was: we had made no noise: Beasley took a key out of the door and delivered it to me; I took her up stairs to search her room - she turned round, and locked me into her room, took the key out, and ran down stairs; I called out of the window, and the watchman stopped her - I found nothing in her room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had been in the room some time? A. About two hours; I searched her before she escaped - she had none of their property. The Magistrate admitted her to bail - she was indicted and taken up on the bill.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner running in David-street, stopped her, and brought her back to Head's, as Morris was calling Stop thief! she said if I would let her go she would allow me something for my trouble - that it was only a few words which had occurred - her husband lives in the house with her.</p>

             re-examined. She lodged twelve months in the house: after she was bailed she returned and lived there with her husband, till she was taken on the indictment. I requested them to leave, but I could not turn them out. I have been married six weeks; I have often been into her room for a light, and different things, before I was married; and she often made my bed on a Sunday, before I was married - I then lived in the attic - she never had the key of the room she entered - it was on the first floor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If she heard a noise it was natural to go and see who it was? A. Yes, but my room door was locked, and the key in my pocket - the front room door, and the door on the landing place, were locked - the door between the two rooms was not locked.</p>
               <p>MORRIS. She came through the front room into the bed-room; I took a strange key out of the lock.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you both in the room at the same time? A. Beazley went out of the bed-room into the front room at eight o'clock, to see that the door was fast.</p>

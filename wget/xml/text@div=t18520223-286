                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. James Flude; he keeps a book shop, in Postern-row, Tower-hill; he has books outside. On 18th Feb. I saw the prisoner take some books from there—I had not known him before—he went off; I ran after him—he had got three or four doors from the shop—I asked him for the books he had stolen—he said nothing, but threw the books down, and ran away—the policeman came back with him—I am sure he is the same person I had seen take the books—these are the books—it was about half-past 6 o'clock in the evening.</p>

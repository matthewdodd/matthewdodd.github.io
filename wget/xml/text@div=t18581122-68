                  </hi>. I am a private in the Woolwich division of Royal Marines. On 23d October last, about 1 o'clock in the morning, I was going home to my barracks, along High-street, Woolwich—I had had a little drop to drink, not much—I could stand and walk—I knew what I was about—I turned down Bell Water Gate-court, near there, to make water—there is an opening at the end of the court where you can go down to the river—you must come back the same way that you go in—when I had got there four men came up behind me—they must have gone into the court after me—I had seen them a short time before at the Coach and Horses, all the four of them—the prisoner is one of them—they asked whether I had got any money on me; and I said, "No, not for you"—upon that the men divided—the prisoner returned to the top of the court with one other—one of the other two then put his arm round my neck, at the back, and tried to throttle me—whilst he was doing that, the other man pulled a knife out—I saw it—he cut my right hand trousers pocket out with it—the pocket contained 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a purse—the other two men who had gone to the top of the court were about twenty yards from me—they could see what was going on—they stood there watching—they appeared to be watching in case a policeman should come—I heard one of them call out, "Take his life, he is only a marine"—I cannot say whose voice that was—I knew the prisoner knocking about Woolwich that week—I knew nothing of the voice that called out—upon that being said I struggled and got away from them—as soon as I got away from them I called out, "Police," and then they ran after me—in the course of the struggle I had succeeded in getting away the pocket which the man cut and took—it was in his hand before I got it back again—I found blood coming down my shirt from the middle of the left breast—it was not near my trousers pocket—there was no wound where the pocket was cut—I had a cloth military jacket on—after they ran after me I went to the police-station—they were all coming after me to catch me again—they tried to catch me, but could not—they did not come all the way to the police-station—when I was at the police-station a few minutes afterwards a policeman brought in the prisoner—when I saw him come</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live at 53, Powis-street, Woolwich. On Saturday morning, 23d October, about 1 o'clock, I was passing through Hare-street, in Woolwich—I saw a soldier passing up Hare-street, running as fast as he could—there were three or four persons who appeared to be following him—I cannot say positively—I recollect the prisoner as one of them—he was following last—I went then in the same direction as I was when I saw the soldier, towards High-street—at the time, I took no notice of what I had seen—I walked towards High-street, and two or three minutes afterwards came back and saw the prisoner in the hands of the policeman—I am sure he is one of the men who were running after the prosecutor—the prosecutor was rather tipsy, but he could run very fast; when I saw the prosecutor, the blood was flowing very fast—his coat was open and his breast exposed—it was a light-coloured coat, a sort of white—I could see the blood distinctly flowing down.</p>

About 1 o'clock on the morning of October 23d, I was on duty in High-street—from some information I went up Richard-street towards Powis-street—as I went I met the prisoner running towards me—I am sure he is the man—I asked him what he was running for—he said, "I am running away from a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with some soldiers; I want to get out of it"—I took him back to the station—the prosecutor was there—he said, "That is one of the four men, that robbed me and stabbed me"—that was the moment he saw him, without the least hesitation—the prisoner said, "I was not there at all"—he said he lived at East Ham—I searched him and found only a penknife and a pawn-ticket—the prosecutor gave me a pocket which he said had been cut from his jacket, and a purse, and a sixpence—they are here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have examined the pocket—it looks as if it had been forcibly taken from him and had been cut but not by a very sharp knife—the divisional surgeon examined the prosecutor—I saw a cut on his left breast, just below the left nipple—it was bleeding then profusely—there is a hole in each of these two shirts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and they correspond.</p>

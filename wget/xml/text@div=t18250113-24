            . I was serving the prisoner with a yard of galloon; he gave me 6 d., and I gave him change. I did not notice any handkerchiefs near him - I said he must owe me a farthing, as I had not one, and then I found I had given him a halfpenny short - I went after him to give it him, and saw him go behind a coach; I did not then know that he had taken any thing; I went up to him, and he ran away to the next street - I still followed him, and saw the handkerchiefs on the ground near him; they could not have fallen from any other person - I took hold of him; he was too strong for me, and got away; I pursued him, and did not lose sight of him, except for a minute, while he turned the corner - I am certain he is the person.</p>

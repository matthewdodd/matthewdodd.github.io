                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jules Gautier, and live at 62, Cannon Row—on 1st November last, I advertised, in the "Daily Tele<lb></lb>graph," a piano for sale, made by Collard &amp; Co.—between 1 and 2 o'clock on that day a gentleman called, and my husband went to the door—the gentleman asked to see the piano, and my husband said "Will you attend to this gentleman for me"—I went into the warehouse and shewed him the piano—he said "That won't suit me"—he looked over the stock and elected one of our own make—the price was 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I ultimately accepted 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he tried the piano and as a friend of mine called who is a nice player he tried it—the gentleman said that he had bought many in his time—he aid he was in the provision line, and he would send for it—I asked him whether he would leave a deposit—he said "No, there is no occasion, I will send for it about 3 o'clock with a cheque"—I asked for his card—he said that he had none, I gave him a pen and ink, and he wrote "Harris, 47, london Wall"—just before 4 o'clock a cart came with "Harris and Co." on it in large letters—a man and a lad came in and handed me an envelope with this cheque inside for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. and Mrs. Gautier, pianoforte makers, and am seventeen years old—I was at dinner on this day, and came and saw Harris bargaining with my mother—I was there again about 4 lock and helped to put the piano in the van—two men came for it and there was a third on the bridge who was looking over towards our house very suspiciously, in a manner which attracted my attention—the two men went away with the van, and the third was at the bottom of Great College street—I followed the van as far as the College Arms, it stopped there, the two men went inside, and four men came out' one of whom was the one I saw on the bridge, and another was the one who purchased the piano—they all four got into the van and went through Pancras Road, Pentonville and, Old Street, Hackney Road, Lomax Street, and down Bethnal Green Road, I went into the Devonshire Arms public-house in Devonshire Street—I remained outside—they all four came out, got into the van and drove back</p>

               <p>part of the way which they had come, they went up Whitechapel, and stopped just before they came to the Minories, about 20 yards from Cohen's premises—Harris got down and spoke to a man at a gateway for about a minute—he then got into the van again and drove down Whitechapel Road, Devonshire Street, and St. Peter's Street, to Cohen's house—I did not lose sight of the van at all; I ran after it—the horse was trotting they drove up to Cohen's house and Harris got out and walked a little way down St. Peter's Street, and came about 3 yards from me and looked at me very hard—I looked at him and then the three men in the van got down and took the piano through a little gate into a stable where there was a wagonette—the lad went to the private door first, which was opened, and then the gateway was opened—that was about 8.30, but I did not look at my watch—Harris took no part in the delivery; he walked down St. Peter's Street, to the bottom—after I had seen the delivery I followed the van, and two of the men got down and spoke to Harris—two young ladies received the piano, one of whom I recognise as Cohen's daughter—they were at the gateway—Harris joined the two men, and the three walked up Devonshire Street, and went into the Forresters—I went home and told my father what had become of the piano, and he and I went to 47, London Wall, and found that no such person as Harris was known there—we then went to St. Peter's Street, and I remained to watch while my father went to the police-station, and in a little over an hour he rejoined me with Sergeant Cole, when all three stood talking some time, and then, as Cohen's iron gate was locked, and we could not reach the knocker, I got on the rails and knocked at the door—a young man opened it, and my father spoke to him—I heard, him speak to somebody, and then he shut the door, and I heard it chained and bolted—we all stopped there about half an hour longer, till 12 o'clock, and then left the sergeant there to watch—before I went away, the man who opened the door came out and leaned over the railings and watched us, and went in again, shutting the door after him—I left, and my father went back—I returned at 6 o'clock next morning, and my father then went away—I was there alone till 7 o'clock—during the time was watching the premises I did not see Cohen go in or out—next morning I saw the man who had opened the door come and speak to my father, and after that I saw Cohen, that was about 8 o'clock—I went, away and got ray breakfast, but only two minutes' walk off—when Cohen had had some conversation with ray father he went in again—I remained there the whole day till 5 o'clock, and Cohen came and spoke to me two or three times—the first time he told me I looked cold, and asked me to come in and have a cup of coffee—I declined that, and told him I had had my breakfast—he said "Come in and have a look at the piano, and see if it is yours," and I went in and saw it—that was after I had spoken to my father—it was in a ground floor bed-room; it had been removed from the place where the wagonette was—I had seen it from the street—I got up on the window-ledge—there was a man sleeping in the room—I said "This is our piano, here is the name on it"—he told me to take it away, and said "It is no use your trying to catch those men, they are out of London by this time"—he again asked me to have a cup of coffee—I de<lb></lb>clined, and went into the street again, and after that I saw the man with the van talking to Cohen at the corner of St. Peter's Street outside Cohen's place—the man left Cohen, and about ten minutes afterwards he came with Harris to Cohen's street door where I was watching—Harris nudged the other, and they turned round and walked sharply down St. Peter's Street</p>

               <p>one wanted to go one way and one another—one said "Straight on," and they both kept on the same way—I followed them, overtook them, and said to Harris "You are the man who bought a piano in Camden Road yesterday"—he said "No, I am not"—I said "Oh, yes, you are"—he said "Oh, no, my boy, you are mistaken"—I said "No, I am not"—he said "I have got no time to speak to you," and away he went—I did not then know whether the cheque was good or not, so I took no steps to stop them—I was afraid that the piano would be removed, so I went back and remained till the police removed it in the evening—I am quite certain that the man who came up to the door and nudged the other man was Harris.</p>

I am a pianoforte maker—I remember the men coming about the piano, my son came back in the evening and told me something, and 1 went to 47, London Wall, to ascertain if any person named Harris lived there, and not finding him I went to St. Peter's Road, where Cohen lives—I left my son there to watch, while I went to the station to report he case—I afterwards went with the sergeant to Cohen's house, about 1 o'clock or 11.15—my son was lifted up on to the rails in front of the door and knocked, a man came to the door—I said I want to see Mr. Harris—he said "Mr. Harris don't live here, this is Mr. Cohen's house"—I afterwards said "I have come to see the piano that was brought here this evening, I should like to buy it if there is a chance"—he said "No piano has been brought here at all, there is no piano here"—I said "Oh nonsense, the piano is in that room," pointing to the room where the piano was—he said Well, I am sure I don't know, I have not been here long, I know nothing at all about it"—I said "Then make inquiries of the people in the house, because I have fully made up my mind to hear something about it to night"—he turned round, partly closed the door, and immediately after<lb></lb>wards I heard him conversing with some female voice or voices; I could not near the conversation—he did not speak to me again, I was waiting for his answer, and to my great surprise he shut the door, and I heard the bolts being pushed and the chain put on—I then rejoined the sergeant and remained there till 12 o'clock, with my son—we then went to the police</p>

I gave him a full description to the best of ray ability, but I had not taken much trouble to notice his appearance—we have a great many people at our place—I first heard that the pianos were sent to the Minories on September 21—ours is a large warehouse, and my business is principally confined to the office—we bought the lining the same as other goods, for shipping—I know that a Mr. Arnold was introduced to my father I believe the pianos had the word "Paris" on them.</p>

I am a German, and am in the prisoner's service at the Minories—I slept at the house at St. Peter's Road, Mile End—I remember the day the piano was taken to Mr. Cohen's private house—I shut the warehouse that day at 5.50, and Mr. Cohen gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to go through the short way to Bermondsey—I got back to his house at St. Peter's Road at 8.30—I believe there was a piano in the house when I arrived, but I did not see it till 10 o'clock; it was then in my room—soon after someone came and asked whether Mr. Hams lived there—I said "No"—he said "Who lives here?"—I said "Mr. Cohen"—he said "Is Mr. Cohen within?"—I said "No"—he said "When do you expect bin home?"—I said "Before long"—I knew that the piano was in the house at that time—I did not know where it came from, or who the person was who enquired for it—Mr. Cohen came home at 12 o'clock—I made a communication to him—I went outside the door, but could not see anyone—Mr. Cohen did not go out—I saw him go out next morning and speak to Mr. Gautier, and I spoke to him also—I asked him if he would step over, as Mr. Cohen wanted to speak to him—he said he could not, and Mr. Cohen went to him—I did not hear the conversation—I remember Mr. Souchong coming into my master's warehouse several times—I remember a conversation between them at the warehouse about eighteen months or two years ago about Hart—Cohen called Souchong into the back warehouse, and said "Who is that man?"—he said "He is a commission agent, and a respect<lb></lb>able man; you can do business with him," and since then I have sometimes seen Hart coming there and selling goods to my master.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother—on 2nd November, a little before 8 o'clock, I was passing his house on my own business, and saw him in communication with the man who turns out to be Mr. Gautier, and a boy—I heard my brother say "Mr. Gautier, if you don't take that piano out of the place I shall put it on the sideboard, and I shall go to the police first"—my brother went to the police-station, and they referred us to Arbour Square, where he made a communication to the police, and the inspector gave directions to send a detective to my brother's house—we then went back, but the man had not been, and we went to Charrington's brewery, at the corner of St. Peter's and Mile End Roads—that is five minutes' walk from my brother's house, where a person who said he was a detective sent from Arbour Square, tapped my brother on the shoulder and asked him about it—from the time we left Arbour Square to the time he was tapped on the shoulder, my brother did not speak to anyone else, except going in to a man named Abrahams, and then we went together to the Minories.</p>

I will assist your father all I can in making enquiries who brought it here"—Cohen also said "Have you seen the men?" and young Gautier said "Yes, I saw them both this morning at our house"—he said "Why did not you stop them? why did not you catch hold of them and give them in custody?"—he said "How could I old two men?"—Cohen said "Why did not you hold one of them?"—he said "I could not,"—another constable, named Dorset, was present and heard the conversation.</p>

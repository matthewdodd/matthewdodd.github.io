                  </hi>. I live at 10, Little Russell-street, and am a pastry-cook. I drew a bill of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Mr. Thompson, of Leadenhall-street—it was dated 4th Oct.—I gave it to the prisoner on the night of 5th Nov., to show it to a party to get it cashed—if he could not get it cashed, he was to return it to me; I did not mention at what time—he came to my shop on the Wednesday morning, and went down to Mr. Thompson's to see whether it was right or not, and I went with him to 10, Leadenhall-street—when he came back, I asked him several times for the bill; he gave it me—I had got it in my hand at the table—he snatched it out of my hand, put it in his pocket, and ran away—I went after him, and asked him for it—he said he had the bill, he would not give it me—I followed him to a public-house in Bow-street—I heard him ask for the water-closet</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Smith-street, Westminster. I know Mr. Gibson—on Tuesday evening, Nov. 5th, he showed me a bill for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Mr. Thompson, Leadenhall-street—this is a copy of it—it was endorsed by him and by me—the next time I saw it was in Mr. Thompson's bakehouse, in Leadenhall-street; it was in the prisoner's hand—I was to meet the prisoner at ten o'clock that morning, at Mr. Gibson's—he was standing waiting for Mr. Gibson—he was not at home—I went out—when I returned, the prisoner was gone: he had left word he would be back as soon as he could—I afterwards went with the prisoner at his request and Mr. Gibson's, to Mr. Thompson, to see if the accept<lb></lb>ance was right—the prisoner went down into the bakehouse, and pro<lb></lb>duced the bill to Mr. Thompson—he asked him if that was his signature to the bill—Mr. Thompson said it was—Mr. Gibson, the prisoner, I and another witness then left Mr. Thompson's—when we returned, I heard Mr. Gibson say that the prisoner had got these bill—he left, and went to a public-house; Mr. Gibson and 1 and the witness went after him—previous to that, I heard the prisoner say that the bill was at home, that he had not had it the whole of the day—I said, "What use is it your saying that, when I saw the bill in your possession at Mr. Thompson's?"—I saw the prisoner go towards the water-closet at the public-house, and Roberts returned in about a minute, after he had shown him the way—when the prisoner came back, Mr. Gibson said to him, "You had better give up that bill that you stole from me"—he said he had not got it; it was only a copy.</p>

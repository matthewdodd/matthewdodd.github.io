                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a glue-maker in Grange-road, Bermondsey, in partnership with Mr. Raymont. On the 28th of October, Bonnell came to my house and gave an order for 12cwt. of glue, to be sent to No. 21, New Church-street, Lisson-grove—I did not know him before—he said he should pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and the remainder within the month—he referred me to Mr. Good, of Banner-street, St. Luke's—my partner Mr. Raymont went to make inquiry, and in consequence of that the goods were supplied—he said he should want more glue—the value of the 12cwt. was I believe 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the following day a person of the name of Clark came to the factory, he brought 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Bonnell, and said he was his traveller—he said he travelled for other people, as one commission alone would not pay him in London—the goods were sent in pursuance of the order—on the 12th of November, Clark came to the factory again and produced a letter—he never left it at all—it was addressed to Clark from Bonnell—I did not read the whole of it—Clark pointed out what referred to the glue—I read what he pointed out—as far as I recollect, the contents were, that Bonnell had sold 10cwt. more glue in the country, and that he wished to have the dark glue—he said it would suit the country market best—Clark I asked me to have it ready for him that afternoon, and said he would come for it himself at the time—I said it should be ready—he went away and came about an hour before the time mentioned, and brought Isaac Anns, and a horse and cart, on which was the name of Sarah Martin, Wheat Sheaf-yard, Farringdon-street—the glue was packed in bag and delivered to him—he and Anns went away with it—there was 10cwt.—on the 9th of November Clark came again and produced this letter (No. 1,)—(<hi rend="italic">Seethe letter No.</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 1000)—and told me that the glue was to be sent to Lisson-grove immediately—I did not refuse the order that time—after he left I turned to Bonnell's account, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of the state of that account I determined not to execute the whole I of the order—we sent 5cwt. to Lisson-grove, with a view of getting the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that we received a caution from a gentleman named Sewell—in consequence of which I went to the house of the defendant Davis, in Brick-lane, the next day, after I had sent the 5cwt of glue—I believe it was sent the same day the order was given—this is the entry in our day-book—I copied it from it—I have no doubt I entered it myself—when I go to Davis's I saw the very 5cwt. of glue that I had sent to Bonnell by Clark's direction—(I took no further steps until the credit I usually gave, had expired—the amount then due was I believe 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never got that paid from Bonnell—I never could find him)—I waited a considerable, tune in Davis's shop—he was engaged with a person—it was a chandler's shop—I asked Davis if he was a buyer of glue—he said he was not—he said he had bought some glue, or I made the observation that he had some glue there—he said he had bought it—I said, "Yes, you have bought it either from Clark or Bonnell"—he said he had bought it from neither—I do not know any thing further that I said—something further passed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not give this reason for calling at his shop, that a person at Paddington had sent circular letters to the glue manufacturers in Bermond<lb></lb>sey, respecting Bonnell, cautioning them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think I did—I cannot swear I did not—I was aware that such letters had been sent, but I have no recollection of having such a conversation—I was with him but a very short time—I had one of the letters at that time—I had not then been to Paddington, to the person by whom they were written, and did not tell Davis so—I will not swear it, but I believe I had not—it was within a day or two that I went there—I told him it was in consequence of the information that the writer's servant had watched the glue to his shop, that I called on him to ask for an explanation—I heard from the writer that he had sent his servant, who watched it—I do not know that I said the writer's servant, but Sewell's servant—Sewell had not told me that, but he had written—I cannot recollect whether I saw Sewell before I saw Davis—I believe I went to Paddington on that day, but that was after I had been to Davis—I will not swear that I did not go before—I never went before or since that time to Davis's shop, and held any communication with him—I left the glue behind—I did not write down the address of the person who gave Bonnell a character before I left the shop.</p>

               <p>—not of that parcel of glue—it was of the last parcel—I am not aware the horse was ill at all—I told the carman as an excuse for not delivering the 20cwt., to say that the horse was ill, hut nothing had been said about the horse being ill before the third parcel—we did not get the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was to be paid—the 5 cwt. was delivered in New Church-street—I have issued a writ against Bonnell for the amount due—after I had been to Davis I caused Clark to be taken into custody—I charged him with having obtain<lb></lb>ed these goods by forged orders, but not in the name of Bonnell—he was tried and acquitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known Mr. and Mrs. Davis for ten years—I was never regularly in his employ—I have been in the habit of selling goods for him and portering, for the last five years—I had no connexion or participation with him—if I sold any thing I had a commission, but no profit—I have known Mr. Bonnell two years, or two years and a half, by his coming to Davis—I never knew him before—I believe the first time that he came he sold some shirt-buttons in grosses—I believe Bonnell did not keep a shop, he was travelling—the buttons ran from 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a guinea—I have seen him there almost every week, with haberdashery, cheese<lb></lb>mongery, paper, grocery, and bottled ale—various persons bought tthese things—Mills was Mr. Davis's carman upon pretty nearly all occasions—I remember Bonnell going with ale to Ascott Heath races—I believe Davis took it—Bonnell went to live at Paddington, I understand—he had taken a shop to open in the general line in Church-street, Paddington, but I never was there—I remember about the 2nd or 3rd of November last year, Clark coming there—I never knew him till I saw him with Mr. Bon<lb></lb>nell, about six months before—he kept a public-house in St. John-street—after that he let that house to Mr. Bonnell, and I believe the ale they took to Ascot Heath came from that house—I saw Bonnell come to Davis with a van full of ale—Clark and Bonnell were always partners together in busi<lb></lb>ness, as I have seen them divide the money after they went oat—I remember some glue coming to Davis—I cannot say the day, but it was just at dusk—I believe it was half a ton—it was not brought by Mills—I do not know the man who brought it—I saw the cart—I did not go out, but when Clark got out of the cart, he came in, and Mrs. Davis said, "Well, Clark, you have got it, then?"—he said, "Yes, I have; I am just the boy to fetch, if I go after it, I am sure to get it"—Mrs. Davis said, "What carman have you got?"—he said, "I have got a new carman"—she said, "I wish you had had our old carman, because we can put some dependence in him, I don't like new carmen, we had better had the old one, as he would never <hi rend="italic">split</hi>"—Mr. Davis was behind the counter at this time—he made some observation himself—Clark said, there was no matter about that—Mrs. Davis said, "You have not brought it directly from the glue man, have you?"—he said, "Yes; what odds is it?"—she said, "We have got into some trouble before, and you had better have gone round with it"—Clark said, "O, never mind; I took care there was nobody <hi rend="italic">touted</hi> us"—Mr. Davis said, "It is no odds, Clark, whatever; what you bring here, I will buy of you, bring what you like, I don't care where you get it"—the carman then put the goods down by the side of the counter—Davis said, "Clark, I believe I have got no money to-night"—he said, "Never mind;</p>

               <p>Bonnell and I will be here in the morning, that will do"—Clark and Bon<lb></lb>nell came the next morning, I believe, about ten o'clock—some mention was made about the glue, and Davis said he thought they had given too much for it—some more conversation took place—Davis proceeded to pay—I saw some sovereigns—I believe he said he had given 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—he paid the money—Bonnell, I, and Clark, went to the Coach and Horses, and several more persons, who were in the habit of selling goods to Davis—there was something had to drink, and Clark said, "I suppose you have got the money?"—Bonnell said, "Yes;" and took it out of his pocket, and laid it on the counter, and they proceeded to divide it—I came out—I had a glass of gin—in answer to the observation about too much, Bonnell said, "I think there is a sacrifice enough as it is"—Davis said, "You talk as though you were going to pay for it; it is all profit to you"—while they were in the house, there was some conversation respecting the glue—I said it was enough to give any person the yellow jaundice, seeing so much gold—Mr. Bonnell said, "We have got 200 more of them at home"—I did not see any receipt given—I think, nine or ten days after, in the morn<lb></lb>ing, a cart came with some glue, but a smaller quantity—I understood it was a quarter of a ton—there was half a ton the time before—it was unloaded and brought to Davis's shop—the cart did not come to the shop—it stopped two doors off—a man brought it up, and put it down by the side of the counter—it was in the same sort of bag that the half ton was in—I saw Bon<lb></lb>nell and Clark half an hour afterwards, with Davis—there was conversation about the glue, and Davis said he would not give such a price as he did be<lb></lb>fore—he proceeded to pay him for the glue, and I think some other things which he had before—I believe it was carpet-bags, but I cannot say—I do not know how long before they had been brought—I did not see them—Mr. Davis said, "I may as well pay you"—I believe it was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw a £10 note and some sovereigns—Davis took that out of his cash-box—he went over to the public-house again—Bonnell and Clark and I went with five or six more dealers that I knew—we then all went to the public-house—it was said there was more glue coming, and then it would be over, as all the fat would be in the fire—Clark said, "We have done pretty tidy with him, but he can afford to lose it, as he is worth from five to ten thousand pounds"—after Clark was given in charge I went to Union Hall, and saw him—I was sent by Mr. Davis—he was remanded, and a summons issued against Mr. Davis for his apprehension—I came back and told him of it—Clark said he was astonished that Bonnell did not come forward, whatever he had done, he had acted fairly and honestly, and he expected he would come forward and pay his share of the expenses—Mr. Davis did not appear to the summons—I went and brought him word that there was another summons—he said he would not appear to any sum<lb></lb>mons—I went again, and the Magistrate issued a warrant against him—I went and told him—he put on his hat, and said, "I will not be at home all night"—he went afterwards and met the officer, and surrendered—he was discharged, and Clark held to bail—I have heard Bonnell and Clark say that they paid some money—Clark told me that he took 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Harrison—I was here when Clark was tried—he was acquitted—I remember Bonnell and Clark bringing some stationery to Davis before this transaction of the glue—there was writing-paper, account-books, copy-books, ledgers, day-books, wax and wafers—Bonnell was living at that time in Pad<lb></lb>dington, I understand—the things were brought sometimes in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—some<lb></lb>times in a cart, and sometimes under their arm—Clark and Bonnell used to</p>

On the 29th of August I was sent for to go to Davis's, in Brick-lane—I went and saw Clark, Bonnell, and Davis there—I went there to look at a lot of books—Bonnell said they had got a lot of goods there to sell—I cannot say whether Davis heard that—the goods were in a box at the front of his counter—they were day-books, ledgers, memorandum-books, ciphering-books and copy-books—they were taken over to the public-house, by a couple of men—I think Vincent was one—I bought them—Clark was along with them—I do not know whether he helped to carry them—they were taken to my warehouse on Bread-street-hill, by Vincent, and Mrs. Punchard paid for them—I have found this note of it, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., beside the expenses—it was given me by Clark, who walked down with me—(<hi rend="italic">see document No.</hi> 4.)</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the New York Coffee-house, in Sweetings<lb></lb>alley, and met Bonnell there promiscuously, calling for half a pint of beer—I had got a lot of goods going to Whitechapel—I think he went out before me—he asked me, as he knew I was in the stationery line, if I knew any body who. would buy some new account-books—I went and said there is no harm in looking at them—Bonnell sent a person I never saw before, of the name of Clark with me—I introduced Mr. Punchard to the gentleman Bonnell sent with the goods—we went to Davis's—Clark and Punchard went with me—I walked behind them—Bonnell was there nearly at the same time—I think the books laid by the side of the counter, in a box—I have said I saw them in Davis's cellar, but it was a mistake—I said Mr. Punchard went down stairs—I was not inside.</p>

                  </hi> I am a labourer, of 4, Pump-court, Philip-lane—on Saturday night, 22d June, about twenty minutes past 10, I was with my wife in Whitecross-street, going from Cripplegate on the right side of the way—I saw a woman crossing from the prison side—the prisoner was before her—they were quarrelling, and he came across the road where I was—she followed, with something in her hand and struck him with it, and he turned and struck her a violent blow with his fist on her head, and she came down with her head on the stones—I took her up and kept her till two policeman came, and my wife told them to take her to the hospital—a lot of women said that she was drunk, but I said that she was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—the deceased was brought there on Saturday night about 11 o'clock—I thought at first that it was concussion of the brain—there was a small wound on the left side of the head two inches above the ear—she died the following morning about 10 o'clock—I made a post mortem examination on the Monday, and found an effusion of blood pressing upon the brain; but I could not find a ruptured vessel—such a wound would most probably be caused by a fall.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Fleetwood—I am house-keeper at Barge-yard Chambers. On 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Feb., between two and three o'clock, I sent Elizabeth Morton to Mr. Harrison to get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I did not receive the money—from information I went over to the Borough, and found the prisoner in a house in Red Cross-street—she had been in my service, and had left my place without bonnet or shawl the same day—I asked her what she had done with the money that Betsy gave her to bring to me—she said, "So help me God, she never gave it me"—I said, "It is nonsense to say that, you know Betsy did give it you"—she then said, "I have not the money about me, if you find it about me you may have it"—I said she must go back—she swore she would not go over the water again that night—I got a policeman and gave her in charge—she said she had put the money behind the door in the coal-cellar—I looked in there, and in the water-closet, and could not find it.</p>

I</hi> am servant to Mr. Fleetwood. On Saturday, 3d Feb., I was sent for some money to Mr. Harrison—I went and got two sovereigns, one half-sovereign, a half-crown, a sixpence, and four half<lb></lb>pence—I had a bill—I gave the bill and the money to the prisoner as she was going up stairs, and asked her to be so kind as to take it up to my mis<lb></lb>tress and get the bill signed, and she did.</p>

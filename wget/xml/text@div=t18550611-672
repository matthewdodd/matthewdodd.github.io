                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Lower Grosvenor-place, Pimlico. On 12th May the prisoner came to lodge at my place—I am sure he is the person—I have seen him several times—he said he had just come from Paris, and was staying at an hotel; he could not give a reference, but was quite willing to pay the money when demanded, and he hoped we would take him without—I let him an apartment weekly, and he came in the evening of the same day, and brought his box, and took possession—he stayed about fifteen or twenty minutes, and went away—(while he was there he was alone, up stairs)—after he was gone, I was called up by my cousin, and I missed from my own bedroom, which was the room below that he was to have had, a gold watch and chain, a seal, two gold bracelets, two gold rings, a hair bracelet, and from the room which he had hired, two large carved whale's teeth—this bracelet is one that I missed, and this ring—my wife wore the bracelet, but I am able to speak to it—I saw these things on the morning of that clay—my front door is closed against all strangers—it has an alarm bell attached to it—I got this ring and bracelet from the policeman—the prisoner gave the name of Edward Renapoint—I saw the box, which he brought to my house, opened, and it contained fire<lb></lb>wood—these articles are my property, and that was my dwelling house—the value of all I lost was about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live with my father at No. 19, Southampton-street—I have known the prisoner by the name of Oringo—he represented him<lb></lb>self to me as an Italian—he gave me this ring and bracelet three weeks or a month before he was apprehended—I gave the same articles to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of Stratford. On 15th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in a crowd in the Broadway, Stratford, it was at the election—I had a handkerchief in my pocket, which I had seen safe, and used a few minutes before—I felt a tug at my pocket and turned round, but did not see the person who had taken it—in consequence of information, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I went to the station house at West Ham, where my handkerchief was shown me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—there are several stains on it which I can swear to—I have had it about three months, and</p>

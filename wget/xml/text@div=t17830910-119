               <p>But have you in fact lost any? - I suspect losing it, but it is impossible for me to tell, because I have such a quantity in different states.</p>
               <p>Court. But you must say positively? - I believe the silver that was found at the place where the prisoner sold it, was my silver.</p>
               <p>I must have a direct answer to that, whether you have actually lost any silver? - The silver that was found was my property.</p>
               <p>Court. That is in other words, saying you have lost it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then why cannot you say so? Now why do you suspect the prisoner? - I was informed that the prisoner was selling silver at a suspicious place; suspecting I had lost silver, I got a search warrant, and went and searched the house of Mr. Parlyman, in Brick-lane, and there was found a quantity of silver: the silver and Parlyman were brought to my house; Parlyman pointed to the prisoner as the man that sold him the silver; one piece appeared to be drawn out, and one to be cut off; the prisoner said it was my property, he was taken before a Justice, and he signed written confession; which I saw the Justice and the prisoner sign, there were no promises or threats made use of.</p>
               <p>(The Silver deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The prisoner signed that confession you say? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was any thing all said to him before he signed it, was he asked if it was his voluntary and free confession? - Mr. Triquet asked him what he had to say.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be under any tremor of mind? - I do not know, he was flustrated very much.</p>
               <p>Then he was not perfectly at ease when he signed that confession? - He certainly was in his proper senses and knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>You have a great number of men? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>And you had not positively taken any notice, that you had lost any thing to any of your men; you had not said so in your shop? - I had communicated it to my men, that I suspected that I had been robbed, because there was a quantity of silver taken from the shop and concealed in a room; I suspected the prisoner, because he was very idle, he appeared very well and had a great deal of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100152"></xptr>Then you would discharge him I should think: did you miss any particular filings? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the silver in the paper any where else, and had no suspicion respecting this man at all, should you have known it from other silver? - Had I seen that silver and examined it as I have now, I believe I should have been able to speak to it.</p>
               <p>Why you do not swear to it now? - I desy the whole trade to produce one piece of wire like it with the threads in it.</p>
               <p>Then all the evidence you have respecting this arises from the confession? - I have evidence that he told it to, and I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Where did he make the confession first? - In my shop before a number of people.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I only asked him whose property it was.</p>
               <p>Nothing else? - Not in the least.</p>

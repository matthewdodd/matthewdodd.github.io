               <p>Henry Hollis, I have nothing to say, but only I lost my Watch, and the Prisoner told me with his own Mouth, that he could help me to it again if I would give him a Guinea, a Shilling, and a full Pot of Beer.

               <p>Q. Did he say that he took it, or only that he could help you to it again.</p>
               <p>Hollis. He said he could help me to it again, - and that it was in a Woman's Hands.</p>

            . I took the Watch out of a little Cupboard in the Kitchen, where the Prisoner was drinking with other Company; they all look'd at it to see what it was o'Clock. Some Company coming in, I put it into the Cupboard again, and stepp'd into the Parlour, when I came back the Prisoner and his Company were gone, and the Watch too.</p>

            . I saw the Prisoner have the Watch in his Hand the Day that 'twas lost; he took up the Flat of his Coat, as if he would have put it into his Pocket, and said, - if I was to take this Watch, I'll be d - n'd if Hollis would know it again. I went into the Parlour, and saw no more of it. About a Week after, as I was going with Hollis's Daughter to School, I met the Prisoner in a Lane, and he asked me if I was to return Home that Night? I told him I could not tell. Because says he, if you were going to London, you may see a Man who will produce Mr. Hollis's Watch; but at present, 'tis in a Woman's Hands.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner too long; ever since he was 14 Years old. He is my Sister's Son, - a poor unfortunate Fellow, and what makes him more so, he's eternally drunk. The Watch to be sure was lost, but I have subpoena'd a Man down who own'd that he himself took the Watch, and afterwards put it into the Cupboard from whence it was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. In other Respects, is the Prisoner look'd upon to be honest?</p>
               <p>Fowler. I don't know that he was ever guilty of Thieving. I never heard any Thing of that, but he's a most abominable Drunkard.</p>

               <p>Fowler. He as much believed the Cunning Man could help him to the Watch, as I believe I am alive; and that was the Way in which he thought to get the Shilling and the Guinea. <rs id="t17370907-57-verdict294" type="verdictDescription">

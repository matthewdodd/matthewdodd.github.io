               <p>Q. Are you a house keeper. - A. No. On the 15th of October, about seven o'clock at night the prisoners called where I was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them. - A. I know Wilson. I took them into my house to shew them a jack; I lit a candle, and put it down on the dresser; they took the candle and blowed it out. I had no fire, we went out after that; when I came home again, I went to look what o'clock it was by my watch; it hung by the dresser, just by where he stood; it was gone. I had locked the door, and had got the key of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent. - A. About an hour and a quarter, or thereabouts, when I returned my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the only reason that you accuse these men. - A. Yes, because there was nobody in the house, when these men were in, and while they were there I looked to see what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Wilson call upon you after you had accused him of stealing the watch; did he not tell you that he would bring an action against you for defamation of character. - A. I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after that, that you went to Hatton Garden. - A. I thought he had taken it in a joke, and would return it again; he came and offered me a guinea and a half if I would make it up with him.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their counsel.</p>
               <p>Wilson called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hughes called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

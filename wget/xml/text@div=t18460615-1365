                  </hi>. I am a wine-cooper, and live at No. 3, George-street, Greenwich. On the 30th of May, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was walking along Church-street, Greenwich, and saw the prisoner with his back against a post, and two women near him—he ran up against me, and knocked me down—I got up and asked him what he did that for—he said he was a Spaniard, and would stab me—I saw a knife in his hand—it seemed a large one, with a large blade—he took an aim at my head—I put up my left arm and warded the blow off as well as I could, and it just grazea my face—when he found he could not do as he wished with the knife he struck me in the mouth, and I fell to the ground, I called for assistance, and Rees and the policeman came—my face bled very much—I saw him throw the knife away.</p>

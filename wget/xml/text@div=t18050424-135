             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You either did live or do live now with a card-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any direction that you received from Mr. Estcourt, or any officer of the Stamp-office, did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 16th of February any where? - A. Yes, I think at No. 7, Butcherhall-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you that day? - A. I wanted two packs of cards of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any and what conversation with him, before you asked him for these packs of cards? - A. No conversation with him; I had seen him with Maydwell sometimes, and knew him on that account.</p>
               <p>Q. What cards did you ask him for then? - A. Part of the cards which Maydwell had left for me; he gave me two dozen, which I wanted at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you apply to him and not to Maydwell, when Maydwell was to have given them to you? - A. Maydwell was gone out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been at any time any conversation with the prisoner; had he given you to understand that you should make application to him -</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q Had you any conversation with the prisoner about this? - A. The last time that I saw Maydwell, before he went out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before the sixteenth of February? - A. I think that was on the last parcel that I got from Maydwell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. That was on the sixteenth of February? - A. It was. Maydwell told Knipe to let me have the three dozen at different times; when he wanted he said he would if he could; he parted from us and I saw no more of him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again on the 21st of February? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you saw him? - A. At the Bull and Mouth I saw Knipe.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed with you and him on the 21st? - A. I went for the purpose of purchasing two dozen packs, one of these dozens was part of them which Maydwell had left for me; he said he had not so many.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who said so? - A. Knipe, he said he had only ten packs which he would get me, and he went up stairs and fetched them.</p>
               <p>Q Where was he then? - A. At the Bull and Mouth; he went from the Bull and Mouth to Butcherhall-lane to get them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding Q.Where did he deliver them to you? - A. At Butcherhall-lane, I went with him from the Bull and Mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for them? - A. Twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the money that he asked for them? - A. I agreed that I would make up for that when I had two dozen more; I was to make it up in the next purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to pay him by the dozen? - A. Twenty-two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240106"></xptr>Court. Q. For what? - A. A dozen packs; I got them, and parted then with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding Q. On the first of March had you any other transaction with him? - A. I went for the purpose of getting two dozen and two packs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go? - A. I went to Butcherhall-lane, to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live there? - A. He had a lodging there.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him that day? - A. Yes, I told him I wanted two dozen, and two packs to make up the other dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive them of him? - A. Yes, I gave him two pounds seven shillings and sixpence, at the rate of two and twenty and sixpence per dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon these different parcels, in what manner were the aces of spades made up? - A. The aces of spades were made up as far as corresponded with the proper number of cards, but made up by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you had the conversation with him respecting the cheapness of the cards; was that between the 16th of February and the 1st of March? - A. Yes, it was; we were conversing upon that and other things; upon which he asked me about the cards, whether I knew that they were forged, or whether I thought that they were forged, I cannot say which, it is a very hard thing to swear upon; I answered, no; I think he said, well, but they are; I was very much flurried at the time he mentioned that they were forged; I think that was the word.</p>
               <p>Q. You then looked at the ace of spades, you saw the manner it was stamped upon the cards, you observed the name of the card-maker; what stated you to him about the name of Hart? - A. I never mentioned that to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received your directions from the gentlemen of the Stamp-Office, directing you to purchase cards, did you know any thing of the forgery? - A. I did not know any thing of the forgery, but I suspected it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I think you told us that you were at Mr. Wheeler's, a card-maker, are you in his employ? - A. Yes, as clerk, from the beginning of January.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had a great deal of knowledge in cards from the beginning of January - Does he deal in a large way? - A. Not very large, equal with others.</p>
               <p>Q. You undertook this on purpose of serving Mr. Wheeler, and now you hope, or you are expecting, to serve yourself, how old are you? - A. Nineteen.</p>
               <p>Q. A promising youth, the prisoner must have been an old acquaintance of your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not acquainted with him, when Maydwell introduced you to him he was a man that put his life into your hands; there was something so inviting in your face, and you would have us believe, though you went to him twice, and purchased cards of him, that is the story you come here with, and you not being acquainted with him, you had been buying of him, and buying of Maydwell, and you did not know they were forged? - A. I did not know they were forged.</p>
               <p>Q. You had bought of him the aces of spades separate from the other cards; you likewise knew what the duty was upon a pack of cards; that it was half a crown a pack; you being conversant with card-making, you knew that the sheets came from the Stamp-office not in this way; that the duty was half a crown a pack, and this came from the Stamp-office in this manner, and was so used by card makers, and put up together, and you did not know that they were forged? - A. I did not know that they were forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe then that the stamp upon the aces of spades that you bought, came from the Stamp-office? - A. I did not believe it; I suspected it to be wrong, I did not positively know that they were forged, I suspected they were wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected there was some fraud, and therefore you could not believe them to come from the Stamp-office? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I want to know if you did not believe them to be forged, and not to come from the Stamp-office, what third place there was? - A. I could not tell, I suspected them to be forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not believe them to be forged? - A. I could not tell, I suspected them to be forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you believe them to be forged? - A. I believed (if believing is the same as thinking) them to be forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any question was asked you, who was conversant with cards, by this young man, who is rather younger than yourself, did you give him any information on the subject - If he ever asked you how people could afford to sell them so cheap, did you ever give him any information on the subject? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask him how they could make these cards in France, and afford to sell them so cheap? - A. I have not the least recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not recollect that you ever did? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have been telling my friends at my left hand that he took you to Butcherhall-lane - Upon your oath, was not that Maydwell's lodging, and not the prisoner's - Will you swear it was his lodging? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was his lodging; the prisoner told me that he kept cards there, and that he had a room for the purpose of keeping them.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was that the same house that you went to with Maydwell? - A. There were two houses, one No. 15, and Mr. Knipe and the people of that house removed to No. 7.</p>
               <p>Q. The place that you have described, was that the place where Maydwell lodged? - A. No, Maydwell lodged at No. 6, Lovell's court, Paternoster-row; Maydwell went and got them from Knipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to repeat the same thing, that you do not expect any sort of reward for all this? - A. I never expected it from the first; I expect to be paid for my time.</p>
               <p>Q. That you heard from my friends speech, I wish I had put you out of Court at the time; then you would have us to believe, that you went for the purpose of bringing Lee to justice; that was what you bought the cards for, not expecting any sort of reward for yourself? - A. Upon my oath, I did not,</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding Q. The first object which you set out with, was to bring Lee to justice? - A. It was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes, I apprehended the prisoner on the sixth of March, at the Bull and Mouth, Bull and Mouth street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What part was it? - A. In a room, in the Bull and Mouth inn; I gave those cards to Mr. Chetham, he was also with me, and I searched in Butcherhall-lane, No. 7; I found some cards there; I produce them; they are in the same state as I found them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What quantity of cards are there? - A. Nine packs.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the last witness to the prisoner's lodging? - A. Yes, I did, and to his lodging-room at the Bull and Mouth inn.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was the book-keeper at the Bull and Mouth inn? - A. He was one of the book-keepers in the coach-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the last witness give you any thing when you were there? - A. I was present when the box was opened; I asked him whether that was his box; he said it was; I then desired the officer to search it; Cartwright searched it, and found one pack of cards, and he delivered them to me; these are the cards, I have had them ever since in my possession; I marked the ace of spades with my initials.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Beresford.) This impression was made at your office, from a plate prepared by the authority of the Commissioners, for Hart, the card-maker, and look at the other aces produced by Thew, what is the number upon that? - A. No. 116.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you searched the documents of your office? - A. Yes, and I find no one higher than 80.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Merchant) Will you look at the first parcel which Thew produced? - A The numbers are all higher than 80; they are from 112 to 116.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to be a general imitation, and to have a general resemblance of the genuine one; you are the engraver at the Stamp-office? - A. Yes, they are in imitation.</p>
               <p>Q Look at that Mr. Chetham found? - A. They are all forgeries.</p>
               <p>Q. What numbers do you find upon these? - A. They are all higher than 80; they are from 112 to 116.</p>
               <p>- PRITCHARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the overseer, you deliver out these things to the card-makers? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a card-maker of the name of Hart? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. For a considerable while have you delivered out any in his name? - A. None since the year 1797.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you know of your own knowledge how high his number went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that from the Stamp-office? - A. I have no hesitation to say it is forged.</p>
               <p>Q. The plates are delivered to the makers whose name they bear? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the plates of Lee would not be delivered to Hart, nor the plates of Hart to Lee? - A. No, they have been delivered by me for a great number of years, and I never delivered one to the name of another card-maker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Thew was introduced to me as a mere stranger by Maydwell; I should have been very imprudent to have told a person I had never seen before that the cards I sold were forged; I never acknowledged to any person that they were forged, because I never knew it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

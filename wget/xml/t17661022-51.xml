I drive the waggon for Mr. Manning of Gloucester, that goes to Bristol; we took up two boxes the 24th of June; they were directed to Mr. Norton, and delivered by Mr. Swain to me, at the Three Cups in Bread-Street; they were double corded and locked, and put into the waggon; the prisoner came out of a public-house, the Coach and Horses at Isleworth, with a three dozen hamper; he was dressed very well in black; he asked me whether I would carry the hamper for him; he said there was nothing in it of any account; he desired me to carry it to Slough, this was between four and five o'clock; I put the hamper in the waggon, and he went with me to Slough; he said he could drive; so he drove the waggon two or three miles, and I got up in the waggon; then I got down and drove; before we got to the Magpye at Hounslow every thing was safe then; and he got up in the waggon, and did not get out till we came to Slough, at the sign of the Rein-Deer; there he took away the hamper.</p>

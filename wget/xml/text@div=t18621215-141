                  </hi>. I am a jeweller's assistant, and live at 17, Holles-street, Haverstock-hill—on the night of 12th November I was returning home, a little after 11—I had to go through Maitland-park—as I was going, the prisoner spoke to me, and asked if I would please to relieve a poor distressed fellow—I told him I had no money to give him—at the same moment he clasped me by the neck with both hands—I also received a blow from behind at the back of my neck, and my arms ware pinioned from behind—the man behind placed both his hands over my arms, and in my pockets, and took out a purse, containing two sovereigns and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a pair of coral earrings, and some coral ornament—the prisoner caught hold of my chain with one hand—he still kept one hand at my throat, and with the other he clasped my watch-chain—the chain broke—there was a struggle—I saw something glisten in the prisoner's hand, but I could not say what it was—he drew it across my throat—it cut my collar through, and just grazed my neck—it did not out me seriously; it bled a little—I called out, "Police! police! murder!"—I called loudly—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the collar I had on—it is cut through—it was under my neckcloth—I struggled before I could get released from them, and called out, and they both ran away—the prisoner kept in front of me all the time—this happened close under a lamp-post—he kept one hand hold of my throat all the time this was going on—when I began to struggle he released one hand—I had an opportunity of seeing his face the whole of the time—I gave information of this to the police the same night—the prisoner appeared to have on a fustian jacket or coat, from what I could see of him, and a smock-frock underneath it—it was not a dark frock-coat; I should call it a fustian coat—I was not quite certain whether it was a fustian coat or not; it had all the appearance of one—I gave a description of the man, as soon as I was able, at the police-station—on the 25th I went to Kilburn with Mr. Thurlow, a builder, and saw the prisoner at work there, with from ten to a dozen other men—I pointed him out, and said, "That is the man that attacked me"—I have since seen my</p>

I am servant to Mr. Manning, of Maitland-park-villas—On the night of 12th November, about half-past 11 or a quarter to 12, I heard cries of "Police!" three or four times—I was in bed at the time—I got up, opened my window, and looked out—I was awoke by the cry—I saw the prosecutor going by, crying for the police—I still looked out a little while longer, and I then saw two men, one ran one way and one the other—the one I saw was just underneath the lamp-post, right opposite my bedroom window—I can see by that any one that goes past—the prisoner is in the same dress that the man had, that I saw run past the lamp-post, but I cannot swear to his face; it is only by his clothes—I did not see his face—he is about the height of the man—I had no light in my room—next morning when I got up I found this purse in the garden on the pathway.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my father—I work for Mr. Stone, who carries on business as a greengrocer, at 39, Duke's-terrace—I, my father, and my mother occupied a room in that house—I have got some little brothers and sisters; there are four of us altogether—I am the eldest—I go to market early in the morning three times a week—I don't remem<lb></lb>ber my father being taken in custody on this charge—he always slept at home—he has been sleeping at home lately; every night I went up he was in bed—he was not sleeping there last night—I go up to bed sometimes about 11 or a little after—Mr. Stone shuts up the shop about 10, after that I go and help him do his horse, and alter that I go up to bed—I sleep in the same room with my father and mother—I tell my father to call me up every market morning—he gets up early, about 5 o'clock, before it is light sometimes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What market is it you go to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Covent-garden—I go on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time does Mr. Stone generally close his shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 10 or a little after—I then go and help Mr. Stone do the horse—he used to have two horses, now he has only got one—we do that in the stable; it takes us a little more than an hour sometimes—I am never very late only on a Saturday night—it is sometimes past 11 when I get to bed—my father is always in bed when I get there, and I always tell him to call me—we have a clock in the room, but sometimes it stops—it is always pretty right—I look at it when I come in of a night—I have sometimes found it after 11—there is always a light there—my father never goes out of a night at all, only when he comes home, he has tea, and goes out for a little while, and then he comes home and goes to bed—he goes out to meetings—I don't know what time he comes home then—I am not sometimes in bed first—he is always in bed when I get home—I see Mr. Stone fasten up his doors—the front door he locks, bolts, and puts two great half-hundredweights against it—nobody can get out at the back doors because they are bolted inside—I can always tell the time by looking at a clock; it is a little after 6 now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer at 39, Duke's-terrace, Maldon-road, Kentish-town—the prisoner has lodged at my house over nine months—he occupied the top front-room—I sleep on the first-floor back room—the little boy has been in my employment a little over five months—he generally goes to work about 5, sometimes a little after, sometimes a little before—he comes home about 6 or half-past—I shut up shop about 10, or a few minutes after, and then go and clean up the pony, and see after him, which takes me about an hour—I then fasten up my house—there are two locks, and I put two half hundredweights against it, and bolt it besides—I re<lb></lb>member going before the Magistrate at Marylebone, and giving this evidence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150042"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not before that ascertain that the prisoner was charged with com<lb></lb>mitting a robbery on 12th November; I heard that said at Marylebone—on the night the robbery was committed I saw the prisoner about 9, or it might be a little after—he came in doors—I saw him go upstairs—I never saw him come down after that—he could not have come down after 11, after I had shut up. without my hearing him—I put the half hundredweights the last thing before I go to bed, after I have done the horse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does it take you more than an hour sometimes to do the horse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might by a few minutes—I have a back door to my house, which goes into the yard—that yard is covered over—there is no back entrance—there is no wall out into the street—it is covered over—you could get over other people's gardens and walls, if any one was so inclined—the back door was fastened inside—I was first spoken to about this, pretty nearly a fortnight afterwards, when the prisoner was taken—I cannot say the date—I did not put it down—I know it was on this night that he came in at the time I state, because I heard there had been a robbery committed in Maitland-park—I recollected it a fortnight afterwards—I have never known him to be out later, except on Thursday and Saturday, when we have gone to a teetotal meeting—it is a teetotal meeting on Thursday, and a harmonious meeting on Saturday.</p>

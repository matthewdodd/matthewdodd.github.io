               <p>RICHARD FREIND. I'm a gardener, I live at Hortsey. I bought these three sheep of Mr. Billings, on the 23d<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130049"></xptr>of May in Smithfield, I gave him a guinea each; I put them on the common. On Saturday I lost them; on the Sunday I found them in Tottenham parish, they strayed there; I brought them back, and washed them; I marked one of them on the near hip. I lost them again the same afternoon; on the Monday afterwards I found them at Tooley's: I told Tooley they were my sheep, he said they were his; I saw the prisoner at Hendon, he broke out of the cage at night; I did not see him again till I saw him at Hatton Garden.</p>

             in Smithfield; I have never seen the sheep since the day I parted with them; they were Southdown taggs. I took the prisoner up about the latter end of May for taking away these three sheep from Finchley-common; he owned that he took these sheep, and he wished to make us any recompence. He made his escape out of the cage at Hendon; I did not see him after till the 10th of December at Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. When you are giving us what the prisoner said, you should give us exactly what he said - was it not said by him that some sheep joined his drove as he was going over Finchley-common, it was dark, he did not see them. - A. No, he said, he had them off Finchley-common, but whether he took them or they joined the drove, that I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say at the time he was going over Finchley-common, it was dark, he was driving a drove of sheep some joined his drove, he did not observe these sheep till he got to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did he say that, sir. - A. He did say that, and he wished to make us any recompence.</p>
               <p>Q. You stick to that like a parrot - he wished to make any recompence - did not he say when he came over the common, it was dark, he did not see them till he got to Holloway. - A. When he had his hearing, he said he come over the common in the dark, he did not see them till he got to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say when you first took him. - A. He owned that he had taken the sheep, and he would return the money back again; he said I will make you any recompence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he took the sheep from Finchley-common. - A. He did not say where he took them; when I took him at Sandrich he said, I know what you come after, I will return you the money back and make you any recompence; before the magistrate at St. Alban's, he said it was dark, he did not see the sheep till he got to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought these sheep of Osman. - A. Yes, I am sure that they are the sheep I sold to Friend.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of these three sheep that were purchased by Mr. Billing. - A. On the 15th of May, he brought several lots of sheep and lambs for sale to me; he told me these three sheep were his own, he would be glad if I would sell them for him; I sold for him these three sheep to Mr. Billing, they were Southdown tags. I sold them on the 15th of May, for sixteen shillings and sixpence each; he never said how he came by them. We took him in his garden at Sandrich; he said, Mr. Osman, I know what you are come after, it is about them three sheep I brought to you to sell; Mr. Billing laid hold of him. I said Smith how do you you do, he immediately said what I have related; we did not tell him for what purpose we came. I told him he must go along with us; he said, he meaned to give the man the money for the sheep, if he come after it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that before you took him to the magistrate that he did not say that they had not joined his sheep, that it was dark, and he had not seen them till he came to Holloway. - A. He never mentioned a word of that till he came before the magistrate.</p>

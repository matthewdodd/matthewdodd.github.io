                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Mr. Swain's office, the defendant's solicitor—this is the signature of Thomas Hetherington; I saw him sign it—I accompanied him to Mr. Parkinson's room to have the oath admin<lb></lb>istered—Mr. Swain has been solicitor to Messrs. Edwards and Hetherington for two years—they have been carrying on the business of commission agents and warehousemen, 21 and 22, Gutter Lane, Cheapside—they placed all their papers in the hands of Mr. John Finney, of the firm of Collinson and Finney, the accountants—I do not know whether it was the month of May or April Mr. Field commenced his action—after Messrs. Edwards and Hetheriugton had called their creditors together, an assignment of assets was made at a meeting to Mr. Finney by the advice of the largest creditor—an offer was first made of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—every creditor signed the assignment by which Mr. John Finney was to get in the assets and dis<lb></lb>tribute them, except Mr. Humphrey Field—the estate is now in the hands of Mr. John Finney for the purpose of distribution—on the writ being issued, Mr. John Edwards (not the defendant in the action) came to our office and brought with him a quantity of letters and correspondence from Humphrey Field to the firm of Edwards and Hetherington, and a copy of the writ—this is the original writ of 16th May (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I don't know whether these are all the papers—they may have brought another letter afterwards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170151"></xptr>
               <p>—a disputed account as to commission is shown in the correspondence—Mr. Edwards told me on that occasion that Mr. Field had appointed the firm of Edwards and Hetherington in the month of February their London agents on Yorkshire terms, which means 2 1/2 per cent commission, not only on orders personally transmitted, but all orders in London, either directly or indirectly sent to Field—he called my attention specifically to letters show<lb></lb>ing an order from James and Pike for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of woollen cloths—this is one of the letters: "February 26th. Gentlemen,—Humphrey Field to Edwards and Hetherington. Yours of the 24th enclosing order for twenty pieces at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that refers to James and Pike's order—this is another, 10th March, 1877—this is a copy of the order 10/3/77; 1,000 pieces at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is another: "28th March, 1877. Gentlemen,—Humphrey Field to Edwards and Hetherington. I have six patterns in work for James and Pike which can be sent next week. I hope you will get some orders for Winter goods to go on with."—this is a telegram also of the same date: "Harry Field to Edmunds and Hetherington" that is the son when he was in London "sixteen pieces get to send James and Pike in work; deliver next Thursday," meaning that they were going on—this memorandum from Pike was brought to me by Edwards: "April 5th. Humphrey Field to James and Pike. Gentlemen,—I enclose a copy of order I received from Edwards and Hetherington on the 10th March. You will find that the delivery was up to the 10th of this month. I have six<lb></lb>teen pieces now ready to send to you, but if order given as enclosed copy you are in honour bound to take them "This is "Humphrey Field to Messrs. Edwards and Hetherington April 6th. Gentlemen,—You should not have taken the pieces in. I shall return the invoice by the post to James and Pike. All goods were passed when I was in London. The pieces in dispute were the sixteen which I have here"—on the same date there is another one to Mr. Edwards, personally, blaming Messrs. Edwards and Hetherington for allowing James and Pike to leave the goods on their premises: "Humphrey Field to Edwards and Hetherington Sir,—You must send back the sixteen pieces to Messrs. James and Pike as I shall see them," &amp;c., Mr. Edwards claimed the full commission on the order of 1.000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Mr. Edwards explained to my firm on what the com<lb></lb>mission was due and I then advised him that he was entitled to commission having regard to the correspondence; they accepted the order for 100 pieces and say they will supply them according to order"—March 22nd refers to another, Chappell and Humphreys; then there—is another letter which Chappell and Humphreys appear to have given to Mr. Edwards, addressed to Chappell and Humphreys by Mr. Field—I don't know that this is a copy letter that was with the correspondence; it is a copy, I imagine, sent to Messrs. Chappell and Humphreys—it may have been in duplicate: "Gen<lb></lb>tlemen,—I beg to return you enclosed invoice as I shall return you the goods and not take them in. When you received my invoice you said nothing about their being too late," &amp;c.—then a letter of May, I think, refers to issuing a writ against James and Pike for the amount—I prepared the draft affidavit afterwards sworn by Mr. Hetherington—there was also a. letter saying the commission due must be left until James and Pike's account is settled—Mr. Edwards said to me that he had made several applications for the commission, I also heard reference made to Mr. Devas' order—this affidavit I dictated to a shorthand clerk and he afterwards drew it out, and I considering the draft was not exactly as</p>

               <p>wished it, altered it as interlined—throughout this matter Mr. Edwards, the gentleman who communicated with me, was Mr. Hetherington's partner—the affidavit was engrossed for Mr. Edwards to swear—the explanation why Mr. Hetherington came to swear the affidavit that Mr. Edwards was intended to swear is, that there was a peremptory judgment—we went before the master four or five times, Sir Frederick Pollock, at Chambers, and there was an adjournment for a week, or two; and there was on the second occasion an adjournment of the summons peremptory and I sent round to Mr. Edwards on that occasion to say he must come and see me at once—I saw him afterwards and then told him he would have to attend at 10.30 the following morning to make an affidavit—it was a peremptory order which must be disposed of on the 8th June—adjourned peremptorily for an affi<lb></lb>davit—when I attended Mr. Edwards was out about 10 to 11 o'clock, and I explained to Mr. Hetherington that I had been through the whole of the matter with Mr. Edwards—Mr. Hetherington said that Mr. Edwards had better make the affidavit as he attended to all the business of the counting-house and arranged with Mr. Field—I said "It must be made and if Mr. Edwards was not in you can make it just as well"—it—was 10.50 and the summons was returnable at 11 o'clock—I said "Mr. Edwards has seen it and says it is all right"—and he said "All right if Mr. Edwards has seen it," and then I made the alteration and struck out the name of Edwards and put in Hetherington—there were meetings of the creditors in June—I did not attend any, this letter of the 4th July, threatening proceedings unless the accounts were paid in full, was given to me by Mr. Edwards afterwards—it is from Humphrey Field on the same form as the other letters: "July 4th, Gentlemen,—The matter is in the hands of my solicitor, and I have instructed him to take out a summons against you for perjury, as you have sworn to a false document &amp;c."—this postcard of 21st August, 1877, was after the ad<lb></lb>journment at Bow Street, Mr. Humphrey Field to Mr. Jones, Huddersfield: August 21st, 1877—Sir, "I instructed my lawyer here to telegraph my agent in London last Tuesday, to make out the account and be prepared to settle with Mr. Hetherington, as from your letter I expect he wants to settle, my lawyer says here to-day that he has never been and proposes to settle up, the case comes on to-morrow (Wednesday). I am surprised at this after what he said; if he wished to settle and pay expenses he can do so now"—we instructed Counsel.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SWAIN</hi> has acted as solicitor for Messrs. Edwards and Hetherington for about two years, it might be eighteen months—they have been in business about eighteen months—Mr. Edwards has been at our office for about that time—I cannot say whether they were clients; I imagine so—I have been in Mr. Swain's employ two years next November—the firm of Edwards and Hetherington has not been in existence the whole time I have been there, but for more than one year, certainly—I will not swear that they have been in business for one year—I said they had been clients about two years—one meeting of creditors was called in May—I was not present; Mr. Hetherington told me of it—one meeting was on 10th or 14th June, I think, shortly after the affidavit was made—the writ in the action was issued on May 16th—a meeting may have taken place before; I don't know of any—at the meetings with Mr. Edwards he did not show me any document to satisfy me that he had been making frequent applications for a statement of commissions—he made a statement to me that he had made requent applications to Mr. Field himself and to his son when he was in</p>

Mr. Humphrey Field for the goods supplied to them on the usual Yorkshire terms.</p>

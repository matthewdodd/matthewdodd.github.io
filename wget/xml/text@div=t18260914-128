            . I am waiter at the Black Horse, Titchbourne-street. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor come there on the morning of the 1st of September - the prosecutor was intoxicated, or very stupid, and the prisoner led him in - he sat down and went to sleep; the prisoner had a small glass of gin and water, and went out - he returned in about a quarter of an hour - I saw him feeling about the prosecutor's pockets, and as he drew his hand from his pocket, I saw a bit of paper in it - I went round, and saw it was a note for him to attend some society; I awoke him, and told him the prisoner was searching his pockets - he took hold of him, and found three sovereigns, half a sovereign, and half a crown, on him; he said, "I have no more of your money; the half-crown is my own;" the officer was sent for, and a canvass bag was found in his hat - he said he had been to a shop with Fay, who left the bag there, and he took it up; the prosecutor said he had 17l. 10s., and had lost the whole of it - but at the watch-house he found the rest in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS to FAY. Q. Why did not you tell us you was led in by him? A. I did not know it; I was sober when I got out of the watch-house; and I drank nothing till I got to the public-house; I swear I did not give it to him, but cannot say whether I was at a grocer's shop - the prisoner was there.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was in the Black Horse, Titchbourne-street, about half-past seven o'clock on this morning, and saw Fay asleep - I saw the prisoner put his hands into his pockets - the waiter awoke Fay, and he said, "That rascal has robbed me of 17l. or 18l.;" he put his hands into the prisoner's pocket, and took the money out, and then we found the bag in his hat; the prosecutor said, "I will swear to that bag;" the prosecutor did not appear drunk.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I had Fay in custody - he was sober when he left the watch-house, and I took him to his own door - he promised to go home, but he went into the wine-vaults, I believe; I went to the watch-house again at eight o'clock, and then I found Fay there, and the prisoner, who appeared a little stupified; Fay was very tipsy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor, and had a glass of gin in Windmill-street, and then he said he wanted half a pound of sugar; we went to a grocer's shop - he pulled out this bag, which was empty, and laid it on the counter, and said "Take it up," which I did, but I never touched his pocket or his money; we then went to the Black Horse, and fell asleep; I went out for a few minutes and when I returned he was still asleep.</p>

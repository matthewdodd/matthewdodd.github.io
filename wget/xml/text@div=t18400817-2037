                  </hi>. I live in Fletcher's-place, Islington. On the 8th of July, between five and six o'clock, I was in Cross-street, Islington, and saw the prisoner with a hurdy-gurdy—he was heaving stones at some boys, and they were heaving stones at him—after that I observed my little</p>

               <p>brother, who is nine years old, I saw the prisoner hit him and kick him—I had not seen whether my brother had thrown stones at him—he ran towards me—the prisoner followed him, and hit him—I asked what he was going to do, and held my arm to him—he then drew a knife from his side-pocket—he had a string to it—he tied the string round the knife, and came towards me, and cut me—he held the knife to me, and struck at my breast, but I held up my hand and received the cut in my thumb—I did not strike him, nor attempt to strike him—I held my arm up to keep him off my brother—I then ran away from him, ray thumb bleeding a good deal—I staid till the policeman took him, and then went to a surgeon.</p>

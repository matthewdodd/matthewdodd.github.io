               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q.When did you become acquainted with me? A.Eight months ago; I saw him at different theatres and places: the commode is three or four feet from the bed - I had left the key of the commode in the bottom drawer, but apparently he did not know that, for it was broken open; the door between the drawing-room and chamber was closed while he was alone in the bed-room - he stopped in the chamber alone for about two hours and a half; he fastened the door, so that I could not get in.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the room door was locked? A. He shut the door himself: one door leading to the staircase is always closed - the door between the two rooms is generally closed, but on this occasion he shut it himself: I remained in the drawing-room - I heard some kind of noise in the bed-room, but thinking I had an honest man in the room I took no notice of it; it was like the wash-hand-stand being moved, no other person was in the house but the master, mistress, and servant; there are no children - no person entered that room during the three days he was there.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 26th of December, on another charge - I took him to the watch-house and found a duplicate of two rings, pawned at Norman's, Princes-street, Leicester-square, on him, which the prosecutrix claims: I produce the duplicate.</p>
               <p>ARTHUR JONES. I am shopman to Mr. Norman, of Princes-street, Leicester-square. On the 19th of December I took two rings in pawn for 5s., from a person like the prisoner: I cannot swear he is the man - it was a person very much like him; he asked for 6s. - I took them to the foreman who valued them; here they are - this is the duplicate I gave him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say I am the individual? A. I think you are; I do not swear it - it was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening: many persons come to our shop - the person came into the boxes, kept at the end, and hid half his face with his hand; he stood quite to the left of the boxes - that is the very reason I do not swear to you - I took you to be a gentleman, and would not bother you with any questions; I should have asked you where you lived, but did not - I did not take notice of you particularly; I judge by your height more than any thing.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marylebone. The prosecutrix gave me information of her robbery on Friday evening, the 23rd of December - I went next morning to her apartment, and examined her drawers: I found the right hand top drawer had been attempted to be broken open - I then received from her the handle of a knife, and compared that with the marks; it appeared as if it had been used to force the drawers, and also that something like a pair of scissars had been used -I noticed that the lock had not been forced, and remarked that to her; she said she had left the key in the bottom drawer, and supposed he must have found it there at last, for the lock had not been forced - she delivered me these five notes; I endeavoured to apprehend the prisoner, and found him in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say the lock was not forced? A. No, it had been attempted; it was a small pen-knife - the prosecutrix said she found that knife in the room; the marks matched exactly with the broken part of the blade in several places, and there are other marks, as if a pair of scissars had been used - I have been in the habit of examining places which have been broken open for the last thirteen years; there had not been force enough to get the drawer quite open - she shewed me the drawer the things had been taken from; it was the top drawer on the right-hand, close by the wash-hand stand - I never saw you about, though I looked for you a great many times; the prosecutrix said she had seen you several times on horse-back, and in a yellow-bodied cabriolet, in the Parks, Regent-street, and Pall-mall.</p>
               <p>MARK POLACK. In November last the prosecutrix lodged in my house, which is in the parish of St. Mary-lebone: I saw the prisoner coming down stairs one morning as I was putting a nail in the carpet - it was towards the latter end of the week, and five minutes after that the prosecutrix told me of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.You can swear to me? A. Yes; I saw you twice - you were dressed in a brown frock-coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you point me out from half a dozen others? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (Partly inaudible.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Not having pecuniary resources to command the aid of counsel, I hope you will make every allowance for me. Fully aware of the perilous and awful situation in which I stand, I shall use the best ability I possess to erase from your minds suspicion of my guilt. In a land of strangers, removed far from friends, being some thousand miles from a single relative, I have not the means of procuring counsel or witnesses; I no doubt appear before you in the semblance of guilt, but hope to satisfy you I am not the individual I am represented to be - I hope you will ponder well before you give your decision, and will be perfectly satisfied; I have but little doubt but you are endeared to your homes by the endeared members of your affectionate family, and will not consign me to an ignominious death; at all events to the degrada<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140022"></xptr>tion of banishment from country, home and friends; to be stigmatised for ever as a felon, and doomed to companionship with the myriads of vice and infamy that colonize that unhappy country, and will give due allowance for my situation and feelings. I will endeavour to make such few comments on the evidence, as my feeble abilities will allow, - first, it is sworn by the prosecutrix, that I called on her, and remained three successive nights and days, and on leaving her I abstracted from her drawers or bureau, jewellery, money, and cash, to the amount of what constitutes a capital charge: that on the morning previous to my leaving her she had examined the jewellery-box, and on being questioned, she says she did not examine it, but went to the drawer to take a towel out - It is not likely an individual going to take out a towel, which would require no looking for, would see every thing in a jewellery-box; I feel satisfied the whole affair has been brought against me with the most vindictive feelings - I have not been spared in any way. With regard to the pieces of paper, I certainly confess I did give them to her; but not accompanied by any observation; I did not say it was money - I did not hand them to her, but placed them in her bosom on leaving the house. The evidence of the pawnbroker must be preposterous; he says he knows me by my size; that I hid my face with my hand, and he did not get a glimpse of my face; then he says, "I think I know the individual" - that of course you will not receive as evidence. A pawnbroker's shop is a receptacle for every individual; many hundreds may call there every day, and unless he knew a person it is scarcely possible he should recognize him. As to Mr. Polack, I have no reason to doubt he observed me on the stairs. I admit having been there, and stopping with the lady three nights; but deny having in any way or shape taken her articles. I have not been in London six months, and am certain I have not been eight months in England. A conversation occurred during the short time I was waiting in this Court where the prosecutrix and her friends stood, which showed a great deal of the callousness of their feelings. I heard them observe, "D-n him! we will finish him this time;" or something of that sort; it shows they did not care whether they swore false or not. The officer says, no lock was broken, but there appeared an attempt to force it - if you will examine the knife, you will find a man must be a very great novice to attempt to force a drawer with such a knife, and it is not my property.</p>

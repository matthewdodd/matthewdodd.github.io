                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 2, East Church Road, Lime-house—on 1st January I visited some friends, and left at about half-past two on the morning of the new year—as I was going home I spoke to a constable, and then the prisoner spoke to me—I knew him, and he said, "I will go home with you"—it was not ten minutes' walk from my house, and I allowed him to accompany me—I was glad of his company—he walked about a dozen yards beyond where I spoke to the policeman, and then I received a blow on the right side of my head, which stunned me, and another on my wrist—I became insensible, and know nothing more—it must have been the prisoner who gave me the blow; I could see nobody else—there was nobody with me but the prisoner—I had two rings on my fingers, a wedding ring and a keeper, and a handkerchief round my neck, and they were all gone—the prisoner remarked in the policeman's presence that I had the rings, and told me to take care of them—my son came up and took me home—the value of the rings was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave the prisoner in charge a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go to terminate the old year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yea, at my daughter's—I had no spirits to drink; only ale—my daughter lives three-quarters of a mile off—I do not know whether I walked straight—the policeman did not tell me that I was handled by two—I did not see two; if there was a second party he kept at my back—my son told the prisoner to come and settle with me, and if he had paid for the rings he would not have been before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">K</hi> 107). On the morning of 1st January I saw Mrs. Quick lying on the pavement drunk—I picked her up, and stood with her about two minutes, when the prisoner and another man came down Moran Street and said, "Hold hard, old lady, you have got a drop too much"—I said, "Yes, she has"—he said, "I will see her home, if you have no objection"—I said, "I shall be very much obliged to you if you will, if you know her"—he said, "Yes, I do know her"—I looked at her hand to see whether she was married, and saw two wedding rings—I told the prisoner to be</p>

               <p>careful of the rings, not to lose them—he said that it was all right—the prisoner caught hold of one side of her, and the other man of the other; they went up Church Bow, and I saw no more of them—about ten minutes afterwards I saw the prosecutrix in the rope ground, and no one near her; I looked at her hand and saw that her rings were gone—I stood by her till her son came for her (I had seen him previously and told him his mother had gone towards the rope walk; he ran before me)—he ran on and brought the prisoner back—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the rings which were on the woman's finger—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "You are aware that they were on when I left her with you"—he said, "Yes"—I asked the son if he was going to give him in charge for stealing the rings—he said, no, his mother was not in a fit state to go to the station, and he should not take the responsibility upon his own hands—the prisoner was given in custody on, I think, the last day in January.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the old lady was drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was—it was hard work to pull her up; it wanted two to lug her along—I do not know the other fellow—what the prisoner said was, "I do not know any<lb></lb>thing about them"—I did not search him—he did say, "Feel my pockets," and he seemed quite ready to open, his pockets and show everything.</p>

I am the prosecutrix's son—I was with her on the night of the old year—she left before me—I afterwards went home, found the was not there, and went down to the bottom of Moran Street—I had a dog with me, and the policeman asked me where I was going—I said, "To look for my mother"—he said, "There is an old lady tipsy, going to he taken home by two gentlemen"—I ran up the rope walk, saw two men running, and saw my mother fall back; whether they struck her I cannot say—the prisoner is one of them—I pursued them—my dog followed the prisoner under some dark arches and under some trucks—I said, "Come out; I shall not leave you till you do"—he came out, and I said, "Halloa? <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, is it you? I should not have thought it was you; come and see what you have done"—he said, "I should not have run, only I thought it was the policeman"—I took him back to my mother, and the constable, who was standing by her, said, "When I left the old lady in charge of you she had the rings on her finger, and you said you would take charge of them: what hare you done with them?"—he said, "I do not know"—the constable said, "Will you give him in charge?"—I said, "No; I will leave it till morning, to see what mother has lost"—I saw the prisoner frequently afterwards, and said, "Mother has been to the station and told the police<lb></lb>man to lock you up when he sees you, and if you go and make her some recompense perhaps she will not lock you up"—he said, "I have not seen the other man since."</p>

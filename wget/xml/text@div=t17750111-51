            . I saw the prisoner at large this day week, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when he escaped?</p>
               <p>Parker. The last day of the session I believe: I saw him at the Nagg's Head Court, Drury Lane, at the house of one Wallace: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110028"></xptr> had an information he was there; I went in and took him there.</p>

               <p>As I went back to Newgate the door was open; the transports were going the next moning, as I was told; seeing the door open I went away, and went to my friends, they fitted me out to go to sea: I thought it better to transport myself than to go as a convict, and I was found in this room.</p>
               <p>Question to the witness. What place was that in Nagg's Head Court?</p>
               <p>Parker. It was a bad house; he took-up the poker to knock me down, I had a case knife or I should have had my skull split, I suppose .</p>
               <p>- Prisoner. I asked what he wanted with me; I went quietly along with him to Sir John Fielding's.</p>

I met him in North Audley-street - he said he was distressed, and wanted victuals. I took him home with me; I gave him some meat and bread. After tea he said he must go. I then missed my things; he was opening the door. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mate, you have got more than your own property." He denied it. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have got my night-cap on your head, and a handkerchief of mine." He went down stairs - the people up stairs asked what was the matter. Instead of going out at the door, he he went into the back kitchen - it was dark. I suppose he lost his way.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take the cap off - A. I did not like to take the law in my own hands. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the Magistrates you were in liquor - A. I walked home very well.</p>

            . I am landlord of the house - I had a few friends at my place, and about six o'clock, the prosecutor, and my lodger, came down, and said he was robbed. The stair-case was dark. I suppose the prisoner missed his way. Daniels said he was gone into the kitchen. I found him behind the door - I took him up. He dropped a tea-canister, and the flannel was found on him. I do not know whether the prisoner was drunk - the prosecutor appeared drunk.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Defence. He was drunk - he took me home. I was going backward, and missed my way.</p>

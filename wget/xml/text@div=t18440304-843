I was lying in bed and heard Ball go out—the clock had struck six—my wife said something to me, and I heard somebody try to open the lock of the pri<lb></lb>vate door up the gateway—I got out of bed, went down stairs, bolted the top bolt, and returned to my bed—shortly after I heard the moving of a chair in the shop—I jumped out of bed, and went down with a candle in my left hand into the shop—there is a little projection in the shop—as soon as I got past that, I saw Alfred Bevis, Joseph Murray, and, I believe, James Bevis, standing in the shop facing me—I had known Alfred Bevis before—he has a sister living in my house—I said, "In the name of God, what are you doing here?"—Murray directly put his hand into his side pocket, and drew out something short and black, about fourteen inches long—he struck the candle<lb></lb>stick out of my hand with it, then turned the thing round and gave me a blow on this side of my head—the candle laid on the floor, and burnt for half a minute—I then took Alfred Bevis and the other person by the collar, held them out at arm's length, and drew them back as far as I could into the passage—they had hats on—as soon as I got through the little door in the passage, I knocked their hats off into a dark corner against the cellar door, and then Murray came up to me, and gave me another blow with the same instrument on the top of the head, which filled the handkerchief I bad on full of blood—I put my hand up, twisted the instrument out of his hand, and kept it in my own—I laid it on the table in the kitchen, and one of the officers took it to the police-station—this now produced is it—it is a life-preserver—my head bled very much indeed—there was blood all over me—as soon as this was done I took hold of Murray by the arms, and pushed him up in the corner along with the other two men, then ran up stairs the best way I could, and called "Murder!" out of the first floor window—it was between light and dark—I could not distinguish people exactly in the street—it was getting towards dawn—I went down again into the kitchen—the policeman came in a minute or two after<lb></lb>wards—the prisoners had gone out of the front door, and left it open—five pairs of boots and four pairs of shoes were removed from the shop window on to a bench at which my son cuts out—I have been attended ever since, almost every day, by Mr. Walker—one of the inspectors took the hats from my house, with the instrument—when I went up and called "Murder!" out of the window, I did not see either of the prisoners—I did not see them go out, because our lead is too wide—when they were gone I found the pri<lb></lb>vate door unbolted, and the front door open.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector G.</hi>) On the morning of the 7th of Feb. I was called to Mr. Neville's—I found him bleeding very much from the head—I received two hats there, which I have here—after Alfred Bevis was in custody one of them was shown to him—he said it was his hat, but he had sold it to a Jew on the Tuesday previous to the felony being com<lb></lb>mitted, which was the day before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 224.) On Friday, the 16th of Feb., I took Alfred Bevis into custody at a public-house in Westminster—I told him he must consider himself in my custody for being concerned in a burglary at Mr. Neville's, in St. John-street—he said, "Oh, that is it, is it?"—I was present at the station when he stated the hat had been his—on the day after I took Alfred into custody at Mr. Neville's, he and James were shown to Mr. Neville—he identified Alfred, and said he thought James was the other—on coming away from Mr. Neville's, Alfred stated that Mr. Neville was wrong I in respect of his brother, he said, "He was not there, but I was, and I was the first the old gentleman collared"—at the police-court he said, "I never struck Mr. Neville, my brother was not there; it was Joseph Murray, that goes by the name of Bevis, that struck Mr. Neville; he found the keys, he found the life-preserver, and if you find him you will find plenty of housebreaking in<lb></lb>struments and another life-preserver"—in consequence of information, on the 18th I went to No. 19, Wych-street, Strand—I found Murray there in the second floor front-room in bed with a female—I told him the charge—he said, "Oh, that is all"—as I was taking him to the station he asked me if the other parties were in custody—I told him two—he said, "What names did they give?"—I said one gave the name of Wilson, but his name was Bevis—he said, "Has any of them turned King's evidence?"—I said I did not know—he said, "There are a d—d set of rascals in the world, and I must get out of it the best way I can"—in his trowsers pocket I found a skeleton key—I saw another constable find another life-preserver and a bunch of keys in his coat pocket, they are nearly all skeleton keys, and pick-locks, with files, and crow-bars—they were all found in his coat pocket but this knife, which would serve for a stock of a small gimlet or any thing, so as to be used as a handle—all these instruments are used for the purpose of house-breaking—at first he said, turning round to the female, "The coat is not mine"—she made no answer—it was the coat he has on now.</p>

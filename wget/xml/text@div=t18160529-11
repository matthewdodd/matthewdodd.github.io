On the evening of the day in the indictment, when my daughter went up stairs, she missed a great many things, and hallooed out at the top of the stairs, that the house was robbed; I immediately ran up stairs, and found the prisoner there; I accused her of having stolen the things, and she made no answer at all. I then called an officer out of my parlour, and then she said, the things were not out of the house. By her direction, the officer went into the back yard, and there he found a bundle of things; he said, he had got them out of the sand-hole in the kitchen. She was taken to Queen-square office.</p>

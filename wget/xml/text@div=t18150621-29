            . I am beadle of the parish. I went to the lodgings of Taylor, on Sunday morning, or Saturday night. I went then. I went up stairs, and he was in bed, I asked him if he had two gowns, he said, he had no gowns, I said you must have them, because Blower immediately lifted up the gowns, saying he supposed that I told him to get up and dress coat along with me, which he did really. I taken Blower before. The woman, B appear, was suspected of having stolen them, Blower told me to go to Taylor, for had the gowns, and that would clear the gift. Here is the gown.</p>
               <p>Priscrilla Sharp. That is my gown.</p>

             with me, she said she was going to see her brother; she wanted to stop all night at my quarters, but the people of the house would not suffer her. She was up stairs in the house. The woman went away when these gowns were missed. I was suspected, and I told them I was very willing that they should search every thing I had. This girl was frightened and told me she had given the things to Taylor.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. What my commonside says is very true. This girl came on to London with us, I carried her bundle for her. On this night, she came and gave me two gowns, which she told me were her's and asked, me to take care of them with the rest of the things. When I went to bed, I was so tired, that I put them under my bed, and did not put them in her buddle.</p>

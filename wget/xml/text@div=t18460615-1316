                  </hi>. My husband's name is Robert—he is a shipwright—at this time we lived at No. 2, Ebenezer-place, Commercial-road, is the parish of St. Ann, Limehouse—it was a lodging-house, kept by Mrs. M'Kenzie—we had two rooms to ourselves—there were other lodgers—there was only one door which went into the street—that was kept shut at night—nobody could open it outside—it opens into a passage, which is open to all the people in the house—the other people living in the house could not come bto our rooms unless we liked—on Sunday morning, the 17th of May, about seven o'clock, I went into my sitting-room, and missed a gown, flannel petti<lb></lb>coat, and shawl, which I had seen sale about half-past ten o'clock On Saturday night—they were not in drawers, I had just put them off—I gave information—the policeman come to me on the 21st of May, three day after—he afterwards produced this shawl to me, which is my property—I know nothing about the prisoner—the outer door was bolted inside the night before, at eleven o'clock, but one of the lodged west out at seven, and we were not quite certain whether he shut it or not</p>

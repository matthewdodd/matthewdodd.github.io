The prisoner was in my service, and was employed to thrash in my barn—the policeman showed me this wheat, which I firmly believe is mine-there are a few beans mixed with it—I have compared it with the wheat in my barn—they are of the same description exactly—the prisoner would have access to it by thrashing in my barn—he had the key of the barn, but he ought to bring it home to me every night—if he had any other key of that barn at his house, he had no right to it.</p>

I was on duty at Ealing, about five o'clock at night, on Tuesday, the 12th of Nov., and met the prisoner with a few potatoes in his pocket—I was afterwards engaged in helping to search the prisoner's house—I found there three bushels and a half of wheat, and two sacks—I afterwards searched the prisoner, and found on him a bunch of keys, one of which unlocks Mr. Griffiths' barn-door—the wheat I found in the prisoner's house has some beans in it, and there were some beans in the wheat in the prosecutor's barn, where the prisoner had been at work.</p>

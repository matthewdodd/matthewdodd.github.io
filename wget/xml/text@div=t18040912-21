               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Sunday, the 8th of April last? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day? - A. Between nine and ten o'clock in the forenoon; he and another person came to my shop to purchase a waistcoat; I shewed him some waistcoats, and he fixed on one which had been made for myself.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a waistcoat was that? - A. A buff-coloured marcella, something like a diamond cut.</p>
               <p>Q. What price did you ask him for it? - A. I asked him thirteen shillings and sixpence for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he approve of the waistcoat? - A. Yes, he approved of the waistcoat, and the price likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he pay for it? - A. He asked me if I could give him change for a note; I told him I could, and he presented me a Dover Banknote.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that note in your hand, and tell me whether that is the note he presented to you? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed on his producing that note? - A. I asked him how he came by this note; he told me he received it at Deal barracks; I asked him if he worked at the barracks; he told me, yes; I asked him if he knew Messrs. Minet and Fector, or whether he ever was at Dover; he told me that he had been at Dover; I told him I knew Mr. Fector very well myself, and I asked him whether that was his hand-writing, or whether it was the hand-writing of young Mr. Fector; I told him I knew old Mr. Fector very well; he told me it was young Mr. Fector's hand-writing, for old Mr. Fector was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time happen to know whether Mr. Fector, senior, was alive? - A. I did not; I asked him why he did not present this note for payment there; he told me he came very late into town last night, it was too late to present it.</p>
               <p>Q.After making all these enquiries, did you then take it of him? - A. I then, by his mentioning that old Mr. Fector was dead, took it; I did not know but it was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Your suspicions were then immediately lulled, and you took it? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you have said thirteen shillings and sixpence was the price of the waistcoat? - A Yes; and when I came to look for change, I saw I had not change sufficient; I then told him to call the next day, and I would give him the change; he had a person along with him that said it would be the best way to take the note, and go somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the person that came in with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did the prisoner give? - A. The answer that he made was, that he had change enough in his pocket for that day, and he would leave the note, and call the next day for the change; I then desired him to tell me what his name was; he said his name was

            , No. 14, Pitfield-street, Tottenham Court-road; I inquired what time he would come for his change, and he said, about nine o'clock to-morrow morning; I told him I should not be at home at that time, nor all the day till six o'clock in the evening; he agreed to come at that time. On Monday morning, I went to Mr. Minet to tender this note for payment; the clerks looked at it, they were in the accompting-house; they asked me how I came by it, and said that it was a forged one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come at that time for the change? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You told them exactly the account you have given to day, how you came by it? - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same note? - A.(looking at the note) Yes, there is my hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name you put at the back of it? - 
               <persName id="t18040912-21-person313">A. William Jones</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. How came he not to put his name to it? - - A. Because I always put it down from their mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the note after you had been to Mr. Minet's? - A. It was left there; when I came home, I found some gentlemen in my house making some inquiries, and those two gentlemen and I went up all the streets in Tottenham Court-road, in order to find Pitfield-street, and William Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you find any such street as Pitfield-street there? - A. No, no such street.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you did not find such a person as

            ? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had made this fruitless inquiry, what then? - A. Then there came the Solicitor of the Bank to me, to know if I should know the person again, and when I found he did not come for his change, I took his features so much in my mind, that I should know him for fifty years to come.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go to Bow-street? - A. I went to Bow-street several times, and never saw him till about a month or five weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you go, that you could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120028"></xptr>not fix upon the person? - A. About three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. About a month or five weeks ago the prisoner was there? - A. Yes; the Office is up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a good many persons in the room? - A. When I came into the room, there were two prisoners in the room with fetters on, and two men without; immediately there came in another prisoner, and another person; I was left in the room about five minutes, and I looked at the prisoner, and knew him immediately; I looked at him very hard, and was ashamed to look at him any more, because he looked at me so very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any doubt about the prisoner being the person? - A. Never any doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the waistcoat that he bought of you since? - A. I saw it this morning; I have got a piece of the pattern, it exactly corresponds; I have no doubt but that it is the waistcoat, though I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that made the waistcoat? - A. He is in Court, his name is Turner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you sworn on the Old Testament? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in St. Giles? - A. Yes, I have lived there twenty-four years.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have lived there so long, you know it is very nigh Tottenham Court-road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you should know all the streets round about there? - A. No, I do not in my own neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you go abroad? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never walk out? - A. Yes, I walk out about my business, the same as you may.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present in your shop when the prisoner and the man in company came in? - A. Nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons have you serving in your shop? - A. Only Mrs. Marks, besides myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mrs. Marks here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your parlour situated? - A. It adjoins the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a glass door adjoins the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. Between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do your children go to school? - A. They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they on the morning you have been speaking of? - A. They were in the yard playing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they play on Sunday morning? - A. Yes; they say their prayers before they play.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you breakfast? - A. Sometimes nine, and sometimes ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen at this time your children were at play? - A. They were not in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your wife? - A. She was not down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife very bad? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you indulge her to lie in bed till that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gets the breakfast for your children? - A. The servant.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose she must have been in and out of the shop and the parlour; is there a kitchen? - A. Yes; it lies from the shop, behind the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would have me to understand, that your wife was not down stairs, and that your children were not there, nor your servant? - A. No; the servant was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was the other man? - A. I took no notice of him, my conversation with him was when he spoke, and desired the prisoner to take the note back again, as I had not change enough; that is all the conversation I had from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the house of Minet and Fector? - A. I have been there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been at Dover? - A. About twenty years; I have a sister that lived there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any correspondent at all at Dover now? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any notes before? - A. No; never in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have not seen any for twenty years? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence thereof, no sort of suspicion could have arisen upon that note? - A. So far, in consequence, it is signed at the bottom J. M. Fect, and not Fector.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no opportunity to judge, in your mind, that it was not one of the notes that they generally issue? - A. I could not; I had no suspicion at all at the time, else I should not have taken it.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a good many neighbours about you? - A. I have many neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. And you, having lived there so long, might have got change? - A. It being Sunday I did not send for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you, that it would be better to get change, rather than lose the custom? - A. He immediately answered he had change enough in his pocket, and he would rather take the waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. It did not strike you at all then, when he said he had change enough, that he did not pay you with it? - A. Not enough to pay for the waistcoat; he said he had enough to serve him that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you wrote the name upon it yourself? - A. I did; I always put it down, that I should know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the firm, and discovered that you had got into an aukward situation? - A. I did; I knew him again, at the office, when I looked at the people's faces; I was not examined the same day.</p>

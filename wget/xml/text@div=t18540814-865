                  </hi>, Jun. I am in the office of my father, a publisher, of Salisbury-square, Fleet-street. I know Mr. Castle—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to our office for papers, for which we always expected the money—the prisoner did not come for papers on 2nd March, nor did he pay me any sum of money that day; but Brown came and asked me for the papers; they had not been paid for, and I did not give them to him—somebody else came afterwards and got them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you the only person who receives the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have been there four years—I have frequently received money from the prisoner—there is no one there to assist me—if I am not there, my father receives the money; that happens one or twice a year—I was not out of the way on 2nd March; I can say that, because I was told that the prisoner had robbed his master, and I made a memorandum that I was not out all day.</p>

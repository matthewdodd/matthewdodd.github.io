               <p>The case opened by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am counsel in this prosecution against the prisoner, who is charged as you have heard, with the offence of wilful murder. Gentlemen, of course, when that is stated to you, you will fell that it is a subject that calls for your best attention, and if cases of murder generally call for attention, the present peculiarly calls for it; I am aware from what has passed before the Coroner, that the question will be, whether he has been guilty of murder; or if not, whether he has been guilty of a very bad, and a very unprovoked manslaughter, at the least before the Coroner; there has been an enquiry, and the Coroner's Jury have returned, that this man killed the deceased in his own defence. Gentlemen, you are by no means bound by that finding; if they had found him guilty of murder, you would have been bound by that. Gentlemen, I shall call to you, all the witnesses, persons that will tell their own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240048"></xptr>story to you; and the only object of those that sent me here, is, that public justice may be done, after a full, and a fair investigation between the parties. I need not tell you, that in order to constitute the offence of murder, there must be in the mind of the perpetrator of the act, some malice, some actual, clear, palpable malice towards the person, the object of resentment, or some implied malice from that sort of gross misconduct that has a tendency to the prejudice of his fellow-creatures. I have it not in my power to lay before you any circumstance, from which I can state an inference of any malice pre-subsisting; as far as it came to my knowledge, they were entire strangers to each other; but still, the case stripped of actual malice towards this man, demonstrates a savage and brutal disposition, a brutal and unprovoked attack. My Lord will tell you, I apprehend, that such a case might under the particular circumstances be constituted a murder.</p>


               <p>Gentlemen, I proceed to state to you, the circumstances as shortly as I can; I do not affect to state them with great particularity, because, I would wish you rather to hear them from the witnesses. Gentlemen, the prisoner was <rs id="t17871024-38-deflabel210" type="occupation">gardiner</rs>

I own, I cannot bring myself to see any thing like a justification; any thing that shall reduce this to what the Coroner's inquest have found it: My Lord will tell you, that if in the street, a coachman was to meet me and beat me, I am not justified in drawing out my sword, I must retreat and avoid the danger; I must be in eminent danger of my own life; in order to do that, you would have this to enquire; whether one unarmed drunken foolish man, coming to claim with circumstances of disorder, the possession of his wife, could have been an object of terror, to two or three men armed with fire-arms, in a neighbourhood, where they might call in other assistance from the patrol and the neighbourhood? whether the deceased had assaulted the prisoner? whether the prisoner had been in danger of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240049"></xptr>his own life? whether there was any thing that in the mind of a man of common fortitude could have induced him to fire? if you think it was wanton, if you think it was unprovoked by necessity; it will at least be your duty to find him guilty of manslaughter; if you think a man, could be in circumstances of actual danger; from such an armed man, of which I have no conception, you will find your verdict accordingly. There are circumstances in this case, which seem to shew that the prisoner found no such necessity; I am told that he actually desired that the prisoner would not fire, and he replied, here are enough of us, we will take him neck and crop, and bundle him out of the house; that will make it extremely difficult to say, he is not guilty of some offence; it is very clear, a very melancholy accident has happened; it is necessary that accident should be enquired into; as for myself, I and the rest of the public will be satisfied with your judgment. Gentlemen, I will call all the witnesses, and you will act according to your consciences.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter and joiner, in Duke-street, St. James's; I sleep at present every evening at Kensington-house; the steward is in France, and I go by way of safeguard to the house. Last Tuesday was a fortnight, about half past ten, I got to the house of Mrs. Drake, when I crossed over the road, I found the deceased on the outside of Mrs. Drake's gate; he was rushing in a very violent manner; he had got hold of the handle of the gate, and was pulling it backwards and forwards to force himself in; he took no notice of me; says I, my friend, in the name of fortune, who do you want, or what do you want here; says he, I want my wife; are you sure she lives here; he came two or three steps from the door, and said, my wife lives wet-nurse to the Duchess of Devonshire; says I, this is not the place; I told him where the Duke lived; then he went to the gates, and rushed in the same violent manner; I went up to him, and desired him to desist, he was certainly mistaken; in the mean time, the prisoner came up with a blunderbuss in his hand; I saw them come from Knightsbridge; then the prisoner rung at the bell; Mrs. Drake, watchman, opened the gates; the prisoner went in; the deceased man rushed in after him in a violent manner, and put his foot over the gate; he looked over his shoulder, and said to me, come in, Sir; I did not go in directly, till the prisoner, and the house-watchman intreated me to go in; when I stepped within the gates, I found the deceased going up the steps to the front door, there he knocked in a violent manner with his hand; there was no knocker there, and he swore that this was the house where his wife lived, and he would go in; then I persuaded him again; I found all was to no effect; says I, it will be of no use to go in, if you will not go away, we will take you by the shoulders and turn you out; the deceased made no more to do, but he hit me a very violent blow on the under jaw and stunned me; then he ran down the steps again, stripped himself naked, and swore that he would lather me, them were his words; I went to Mrs. Drake's watchman, who had a soldier's piece with a bayonet fixed to the end of it, and desired him to lend me that piece that I might defend myself; and told him, I should be able to keep him off at arms length by it; he lent it me; the deceased by this time was stripped, and the prisoner told him; if you do not go away, you may depend upon it I will I will fire upon you; by this time I had the watchman's piece, and I told the prisoner, by no means do not fire whatever you do; then the deceased ran with his breast against the bayonet that I had fixed on the piece, and he says, fire away and be d - n'd, for I am the lad that can stand twenty balls; fire away, blast you!</p>
               <p>He was at this time naked? - His jacket and his shirt were off.</p>
               <p>He had some arms? - I saw none; I said then, my friend, if you do not desist,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240050"></xptr>I will make you; he took no notice of that, but immediately struck at the bayonet, and knocked it on one side from him, and then I moved on the opposite way to keep myself in opposition to him; then he struck it backwards and forwards two or three times, and in this struggle, the prisoner fixed, I apprehend, the intention of the deceased, was, to obtain the piece from me; he knocked my piece backwards and forwards with his arm; at that time without any thing said to the prisoner, he fired; the last words I said to the prisoner at the bar, was, whilst the man was stripping himself; I desired the prisoner not to fire; after the blunderbuss was fired, I perceived the deceased not so violent as before; so, I immediately said to him, my friend, what a silly man you must be; had you gone about your business, nothing of this would have transpired; he said nothing, but went and sat himself down on the steps; I took up his shirt and jacket, he up with his left hand, and hit me another blow on this side the face, and says, yes, b - st you, I am wounded in that manner: I left the prisoner; I saw the blood on the steps; I apprehended it came from him; I left word with the watchman and the prisoner, where I slept, and that I should be ready to appear; I went away then; I never saw the deceased before or since, nor never saw the prisoner before that night.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing at the time this man fired, that made it necessary to discharge any piece? - Yes, I certainly did; because I had every reason to suppose, that if this man, the deceased, had got possession of the piece, every man would have been in danger; he pushed it to and fro' in that manner, with intention, as I supposed, to take it from me; I thought so by his manner of conducting himself, swearing and blasting; he swore vengeance to every body; I cannot say whether he was sober or drunk; I thought he acted very indiscreetly; he must be either drunk or mad, but which I could not say.</p>
               <p>How many of you were there present? - When the prisoner fired, there was me with the soldier's piece, that was all the armed men that was there; the watchman had no arms; his name is Davis; the other watchman came, but as soon as he found the man was troublesome he went away, as he says, to fetch another watchman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This was about half after ten? - As near as I can recollect; nobody was armed, but me with this musket which I have in my hand, which I suppose was loaded, and the blunderbuss which the prisoner had in his hand; I apprehended he was going to take this piece from me; I had no other reason to suppose it at at that time, he was vowing vengeance against every body; I do not know, whether he was hit on his thighs as he lay; I saw the blood on the steps; I cannot say how the prisoner's piece was fired.</p>

               <p>- MONTAGUE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon belonging to St. George's hospital; I attended this man when he was brought in, about half past twelve on Wednesday morning; the morning of the accident, he was brought to the hospital, and every thing necessary was done for him; he was put to bed, he had lost a great quantity of blood, it was not necessary to take any more from him; I saw him at half past twelve, he seemed as if he had been asleep and recovered from a drunken fit; I asked him how it happened, he could not tell me; he continued on Wednesday and Thursday, and Friday he died; there were three wounds, one on the left thigh, and one on the right, gun shot wounds; I extracted the balls the day after his death.</p>
               <p>In your judgment did these wounds occasion his death? - Yes, it was not thought necessary to extract them in his life-time, I had the advice of other people.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I have a vast number of witnesses here to the humanity of this man.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is not, whether this is a murder or no, I think it is very clear it is not; here was a scuffle, and in consequence of that the deceased was slain; but the question is, whether it was a manslaughter; he was justified in killing him, if he either thought him to be a thief attempting to break open the house of his mistress, or to preserve his own life, or the life of the person who came to his assistance; in either of those cases it reduces it to self-defence; if you think that that firing was rash, and that that violent measure need not have been made use of, you will find him guilty of manslaughter.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of the watch. The prisoner was given into my charge by Pearce, who said he had 36s. in his pocket before he met her; I found he had 10s. left in his pocket - I asked the prisoner particularly what money she had about her; she said a sixpence and 2d. - I searched her very minutely as I thought, but found nothing; he was positive about it - I touched her cheek, and heard the money jink in her mouth; I took hold of her throat, and immediately she discharged from her mouth a sovereign and 6s; she endeavoured to swallow it as I thought - Pearce had been drinking, but was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can safely say he gave me the money going along, and said he would go with me - we went up a court, and he afterwards wanted to take it from me; I would not let him have it, and put it into my mouth to take care of it - he thought it was in my hand, and bit my finger.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 39.) On Saturday night, the 24th of Sept., I was on duty in Lower-road, Islington, about half-past twelve o'clock, just opposite the Golden Fleece—I found a great crowd creating a great disturbance, and using ill and threatening language—I endeavoured to disperse them, and persuade them to go away quietly—I saw Marsh, another officer, there—he was also persuading them to go away—while I was engaged in this, one of the crowd struck me across the arm—I seized him by the collar, and struggled with him—he tried to get away—the mob interfered, and got between us, and tried to loose him from me—my hat fell off in the scuffle—I called to Marsh for assistance—he was kept back by some part of the mob—I saw the prisoner, who I knew before, about three yards from me, opposite the Golden Fleece, standing just by the corner or edge of the curb—when I looked round to call Marsh, I saw him stoop down and pick up a stone, and throw it at me—it wounded me on the head—there were</p>

               <p>some broken granite stones laying in the road—the blow made me giddv at first—it knocked me down on the ground—I lost my hold of the man, and pointed the prisoner out to Marsh, who collared him—he was very violent indeed—he struck Marsh—I afterwards took hold of the other side of him—he struck and kicked me several times—Kelly afterwards came up—his com<lb></lb>panions rushed on me—I succeeded in getting him to the station at last—I was taken to Mr. Semple, the surgeon, and have been under his care ever since—the stone was thrown straight at me, purposely to hit me—it was a sharp stone, nearly as big as my fist.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Sebbon's-build<lb></lb>ings, Islington. On this Sunday morning, about half-past twelve o'clock, I examined Lawrence's head—I found a wound on the right-hand side of the forehead, about three quarters of an inch long, and half an inch deep—I probed the wound, and found it penetrated to the skull, which was denuded of the pericranium, and I detected a fracture or fissure of the skull—it may bare been occasioned by a sharp stone—it must have been thrown with con-liderable violence to break the skull—it was a dangerous wound—he has been off duty until this time, and under my treatment—his health is not quite established.</p>

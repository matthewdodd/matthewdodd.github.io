                  </hi>—I am a tailor of Turnham Green—the prisoner was in my service for seven months previous to December—in consequence of what took place on 17th December, I communicated with the police, and Sergeant Rogers was instructed to watch the premises—on the morning of the 5th January I was called up by the police—I went with Sergeant Rogers to the bath room—we there found the prisoner sitting on a box, pretending to be asleep, and he had got a screw-driver—I asked him what he did there—he said he had come from Birmingham, and wanted a night's lodging—I found the shop window broken—there were marks on the shop door which corresponded with the screw-driver—the shop was secure about 9 o'clock, when I went to rest.</p>

From a communication made to me by the last witness, I watched the premises on the 5th January—between 12 and 1, I heard a noise of glass breaking—I waited about half an hour, and I then heard some one at the back door; the wood was break<lb></lb>ing—I cried out for assistance, got over the back fence, searched the premises, and found the prisoner in the bath room, with this screw-driver—he pre<lb></lb>tended to be asleep—I saw him not ten minutes before he went into the bath room, in the yard—on searching the premises, I found a piece of wood broken out of the back doorpost, and the wire blind which covered the window bad a hole through it, which exactly fitted this screw-driver—I believe that was taken out of a closet in the bath room, which was left open—the prisons could get to the bath room by getting over the fence; then he would get the screw-driver to force the door—there was a side window—he could not get in at the doorway, there was a long bench nailed against the door; part of the wood was broken away, but he could not get in—he told me he wanted a night's lodging—I took him then to the station—there were marks of violence on the shop doorpost.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that he was drunk on 17th December, when he committed the robbery; that he then went to Birmingham for work, and while there he wrote to the prosecutor for forgiveness, and received a letter from the pro<lb></lb>secutor's wife forgiving him; that he walked almost all the way to London, and, being very tired, and having no money, went into the house to deep until he could see the prosecutor in the morning; that the charge was made against him because the prosecutor was jealous of the attentions paid him by his mistress.</hi>

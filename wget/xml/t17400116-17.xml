            . Styles, Pattison and I, on the 18th November, stole nine Pair of worsted Stockings; (some of them had red Clocks, and some of them white) we stole them out of Mr Ridler's Shop-window in Little Suffolk Street, near Great Suffolk Street, in the Haymarket. Styles (being the biggest Man) went into the Shop for a halfpenny worth of blue Thread, and stood before Mr Ridler. I stood at the outside of the Window to watch, and Pattison whipp'd in, and took the Stockings, while Mr Ridler reached down a Bundle of Thread. When Pattison was got out of the Shop with the Stockings, he gave them to me; I had Pattison's great Coat on at that Time, and I clapped them under the left Side of the Coat, and he and I went to the Corner of the next Street, and waited 'till Styles came up to us. Then we all three went to Margaret Ellis's, in Parker's Lane, and went up into her one Pair of Stairs Room: she came up to us there, and bid us 7 s. for them all. While we were talking to her, Styles snatched up four Pair out of the nine, and ran down Stairs with them. Out of what was left, I had three Pair, and Pattison had two. My three Pair I sold to Ellis for 3 s. but Pattison said, he would not sell his at any such Price, he would sooner pawn them. - We all went out with a Design to get what we could get, and seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160013"></xptr> these Stockings lie in a Bundle in the Window ready at Hand, we agreed that Styles should go in for a halfpenny worth of Thread, and stand before Mr Ridler, while Pattison whipp'd away the Bundle. Ellis (the Prisoner) knew us before this Time; Pattison and I, lodged in her House, and we used to go out every Night, and what we got we used to carry to her. She knew how we came by the Goods we brought her, and that we had stole these Stockings in particular.</p>
               <p>Pattison. There was no Body in this Robbery but the Evidence (Weblin) and I. We were coming that Night thro' Leicester Fields, and meeting

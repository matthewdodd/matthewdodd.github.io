On this Saturday I was assisting to take Tyssen to the station—we were surrounded by a mob of about 150 persons—I saw the prisoner violently assaulting the prosecutor—I went to his assistance, and Dutnell turned round and dealt me a fearful blow in the back, which knocked me down—the prisoner was knocked down by a brother constable, and then I got up and secured him—it appears that I was stabbed in the back with a knife—the knife lodged in my back till I got to the station—I am sure Dutnell is the man who struck me—he only gave me one blow—I was dressed as I am now, and the knife penetrated into my left shoulder—as we were going to the station he said "If you put me away this time, I will do for you."</p>

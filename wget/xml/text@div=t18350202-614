                  </hi>. I have a partner in my business in Oxford-street, named Griffiths Thomas—I have another business in Duke-street, Manchester-square, of my own—Thomas and I are linen-drapers and haberdashers—my business in Duke-street is a linen-draper's—the prisoner was in the occasional employ of our firm as clerk and book-keeper—he came about twice a week, in the evening, to keep our accounts—he has been much better off—he was in a very respectable business in Friday-street, and married my first cousin—I believe he has four children—he has through misfortunes been reduced in circumstances—we dealt with Messrs. Lainson and Co., Bread-street, wholesale Manchester-warehousemen, for goods—we owed them 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is our custom to have a discount off our accounts—I gave the prisoner this cheque (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) for 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 30th of October, and I took the precaution to cross the name of Jones, Lloyd, and Co, on the cheque in large letters—I told him to pay it to Messrs. Lainson and Co.——the names of Jones, Lloyd, and Co. on the cheque are now struck through, and "Bank of England" written over it—that was not on the cheque when I gave it to him—I knew nothing of that being written on it till the cheque was returned from my bankers, which was about the beginning of January, directly after the bankers balanced—on the 17th of January, I called on the prisoner—it was after I had received the cheque from the bankers—I had drawn his attention to those words being struck out a week or ten days before that, when we were going over the cheques which had been returned, at my house—the cheque was then before me—I said it appeared strange that "Jones, Lloyd, and Co." was marked out, and "Bank of England" was written across it—he said he dare say Lainson and Co. had an account with, or might have bought money in the Bank of England—I said, "This cheque appears very strange not to have come into our banker's until the 23rd of December," which was marked on it, when I had given it to him on the 30th of Octobers—he said Lainson and Co. were rich people, and he dare say it was locked up in their iron chest, they not having occasion for it—I believe my partner called on Lainson and Co.—I had not the least knowledge that the cheque had not reached Messrs. Lainson's before I called on the prisoner on the 17th of January, and asked him to pay me for some flannel, which was a private transaction be<lb></lb>tween him and myself—he said he was very sorry, he had certainly sold them and received the money, but had no money to give me, and said he had made use of the money—the amount was between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he appeared to be very much agitated, and said he was very sorry, he had been guilty of great ingratitude towards me, and he said he supposed I was aware of other circumstances—I said I certainly was aware I had given him a cheque of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Johnson and Bulmer—he said he had not the money to pay me for the flannels, but he had a bill in his pocket for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and he should have another at the beginning of the week, and I was welcome to that—he put it on the table—a little time after I said, "You had better put your name on the bill before I take it"—I told him it was better for him to tell me the amount at once—to confess what he had taken at once—he said he would write the particulars down—he took a pen in his hand and then said, "I am very nervous, indeed"—he said his hand</p>

               <p>shook so much he would be obliged to me to write it down—he called over several names—I have a list in my pocket, which I took down from his dictation—this is it—that was the first time I learnt that this cheque had not been applied to its proper purpose—here is the name of "Lainson, 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." on the list—that is one of the sums he mentioned having re<lb></lb>ceived and not paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You deal in a variety of articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Principally linen-drapery—I never dealt in French watches in Oxford-street—Brooks and Thomas keep blonde lace—my father and I have been in business at least thirty years—the prisoner has been in the Manchester line—I am not aware that he lost 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the failure of another house—I was too young at that time to learn the particulars—I have heard he lost enough to ruin him—I have given him many cheques before this—we have employed him above two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what passed between you, do not you believe he had reason to suppose that, for a time, he might have appropriated the cheque to his own purpose, and afterwards make it good to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not the least idea he could have contemplated that—he has never appropriated cheques, and afterwards repaid them, with my permission—I remember, last October, giving him a cheque fox 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in favour of Morley, of Gutter-lane—I did not learn afterwards, from himself or Morley, that he had ap<lb></lb>propriated that cheque to his own purpose—I was not aware of it at all, up to this moment—I never had any conversation with him afterwards about it—Morley sent up to me for the account, after I had given him the cheque—I sent a young man to call on the prisoner and know why he had not paid that cheque, and he said he would go directly and pay it—I be<lb></lb>lieve that was a transaction of my own—I have no entry of my own trans<lb></lb>actions in this book—I believe about two days elapsed between my giving him that cheque, and finding it was not paid—I expected he would pay it at his convenience, in a day or two—I was not particular to a day—to the best of my belief, it was less than a week—I swear, to the best of my be<lb></lb>lief, it was not more than a week—I will not positively swear it was not three weeks—when I brought it to his mind, he did not say, "I will go and make it good—I will go and pay it directly"—I have no book here in which that cheque was entered—this did not happen, in any other instance, ex<lb></lb>cept Morley's—the next transaction which occurred, was on the 4th of January, this year; a bill from Lucock and Co., of Leeds, was presented at Brooks and Co's. for payment—it was drawn by Lucock and Co. on Brooks and Thomas—it became due on the 4th of January, and was pre<lb></lb>sented to Brooks and Thomas—the amount might be 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it had been presented before for acceptance—it was presented for payment, al<lb></lb>though we had not accepted it—we had refused acceptance because it was not correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in September, 1834, give the prisoner a cheque to pay into Glynn's, on account of Lucock, of Leeds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have it down in my banking-book as the 25th of November—it was 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure it was in November—Mr. Hardy, the agent of Lucock, applied to me in January respecting it, and said he was sure the cheque had never been paid—in consequence of that, I went to the prisoner's the first thing on Monday morning, but he was out, and when I saw him, he said he had just been down to Mr. Hardy to take the money—I spoke to him about his not paying the cheque in November, as he ought to have done, and he told me it was the fault of his clerk—he said his clerk had misunderstood him, that he told him to go and pay it into the bankers', instead of which, he</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You got a letter from Forrester, which was found on the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was a letter I had written to the pri<lb></lb>soner—I am almost certain I destroyed it—I have looked every where for it, and cannot find it—I do not know whether I destroyed it directly, or what has become of it—I did not copy it—I thought it was of no conse<lb></lb>quence to any one—I might have destroyed it the very day Forrester de<lb></lb>livered it to me—he gave it me just before the examination on the 21st of January—(<hi rend="italic">the notice to produce it was dated the 4th of February</hi>)—I after<lb></lb>wards, from memory, wrote out what I thought it was—I cannot say they were the exact words, but I wrote the purport of the letter as near as I can possibly recollect. He gave me the £20 bill, and said he did not think it was worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I did not think it was—he agreed to give me an<lb></lb>other bill, but no list of the debts—I cannot say whether the bill was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not mention the amount of the bill in the letter—I will swear I did not mention any sum—he said he should have another bill on the Monday or Tuesday, and would give me that—I rather think now it was 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I cannot say whether it was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you swear there was no bill referred to in the letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I said there was no amount mentioned in the letter—when I took the letter from Forrester I read it over, and noticed particularly that there was no<lb></lb>thing of any consequence in it—I did not apply to him for the letter—we were looking over the prisoner's duplicates and things, and Forrester said, "Here is a letter of your writing"—I took it and read it—I am certain that is a copy of it, as near as possible, word for word—he gave me the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on Saturday, the 17th of January, the same day he gave me the list I have handed in, in which list this very cheque is included—I was there from ten till one o'clock—I think I made out the list about twelve o'clock—he laid the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on the table—and I took it up and put it into my pocket after I had made out the list, as I was going away—he had at that time apprised me that he had misappropriated this cheque—I took the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill because he had not any money to offer me for the flannel—he was taken up on Tuesday, the 20th of January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you given him any advice as a friend—on your oath? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had said something to him—he begged me to be merciful to him—I said I thought the best thing he could do was to go off to America, as my partner, if I was not willing to prosecute him, would do so, when he came to know it—he said, "No, I will rather stop and serve you"—I was not aware of the misappropriation at the time he offered me the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—it was left on the table at my side—I considered it then my property—he had given me the statement before I took it off the desk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are asked whether you had or not taken the bill after the list was made out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took it off the table afterwards—I wrote the letter on Monday, the 19th, which was after I had taken the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Perhaps you will repeat the letter now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "Will you have the goodness to send me a statement of the particulars of the different names of the parties, and the separate amounts for which I gave you a cheque of sundries, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" I think—and at the bottom I said, "If you have the bill you named, please to send it by the bearer"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020147"></xptr>
               <p>that does not refer to the bill I named, but to the bill which was to be either 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was after I was aware of the misappropriation he had made—I told my partner of this on Monday evening, the 19th of January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he mentioned the amount of the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he had—he named either 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about one or other sum—I think he said I should have a bill for about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I did not pay much attention to it, expecting it would be, like the first, not worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you desired it to be sent to you by bearer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It came into my mind just as I was writing—I thought it might be worth something.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you made up your mind to prosecute him at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you an unwilling prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left it entirely in the hands of my partner—if I am to state whether I am or not, I certainly would rather not prosecute—my partner insists on the prosecu<lb></lb>tion being carried on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had your conversation with the prisoner, on the subject of the flan<lb></lb>nel, reference to that transaction, or had it any thing to do with the misap<lb></lb>propriation of the money of Brooks and Thomas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing—it was quite a separate and distinct matter—I was not in a condition to forego a prose<lb></lb>cution without the consent of my partner—I never allowed the prisoner to misapply cheques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This letter speaks of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is that the amount of different items of that sum furnished to you in his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was the answer he sent in the letter, and that was all I received back—these items were sums belonging to Brooks and Thomas—that was for many small sums he had made payments of for Brooks and Thomas—I was never aware that he had misapplied cheques I had given him for any specific purpose, on account of Brooks and Thomas, before the discovery of the transaction—I never permitted him, directly or indirectly, to do so—I had done all I could to serve him up to the time in question—he acknowledged his sense of his ingratitude towards me when he confessed his guilt—I have in my bankers' book an account to show when this cheque came to them—it is written on this cheque, "23rd of December"—I never heard a word about its misappropriation between the 30th of October and the 23rd of Decem<lb></lb>ber—I should not have suffered him to retain it if I had known it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave you a bill, at all applicable to any thing but the flannel which you speak of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I did not receive it towards the turns he had misapplied, but on my own private account for the flannel; and the bill he promised to send was to be in payment of the flannel—I have neve r accepted any sum as security for any of the items on this paper, among which is the 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave that cheque to him to pay Lainson and Co., and for no other purpose—I did not direct him to receive the cheque, but to carry it to them, to pay them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Brooks. About Christmas last I asked the prisoner for an account of the debts we owed in the City—he afterwards supplied me with this list—among others is the name of "Lainson and Co. 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I think that was about the 18th of December—he gave me the accounts, I believe, the same day as I asked for it—there was at that time 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to Lainson and Co., besides the 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. supposed to have been paid—I thought at the time we owed them no more—I did not know the 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not paid.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Harris, a rigger, of No.3, Collins-place, Poplar. The deceased, John May Harris, was my son—I saw him on Wednesday, the 18th of Aug., about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, in very good health, coming from school—I next saw him at eight in the evening, when I came home, on the bed, at my house, in ter<lb></lb>rible state, very bad indeed—he had dirtied himself—I went up stairs again, as near as I can say about nine o'clock—he was very bad, he never spoke after the first time I went up—I then asked him where he had been—he was quits in liquor—he had not power to make a complaint—I saw him at nine, and again about eleven, he then appeared asleep—I saw him again, I think,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200045"></xptr>
               <p>about half-past two in the morning; he was then in fits—they were quiet fits, but every limb was in action, his eyes were wide open, his hands and mouth were at work—his hands were opening and shutting—I sent for medical assistance, and he was put into a warm-bath—he continued in that state till he died, at seven in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> On the 19th of Aug. I was with Auty and the deceased—I recollect their bathing, and coming out of the water—they began to run about the field; I did not, I sat down—Auty dropped his waistcoat—the pri<lb></lb>soner were there—Johnson picked it up, and said to Auty, "Pick out which one you can fight, and then you shall have your waistcoat"—Auty picked out Eagleton first; he would not fight, and then he picked out Harris—they began to fight—Auty knocked Harris down twelve or thirteen times—he pulled Auty down on the top of him four or five times—the prisoner were sitting on the grass, saying, "Go on, go on, the teetotaller will beat I"—that was Auty—one of the men gave Harris some beer in a half-pint pot, in the middle of the fight—he took it, and then went on fighting—the fight was going on half an hour—I and Eagleton tried to take Harris away—the men would not let us—Harris had beer twice—after the fight he kept tumbling about—the men proposed that there should be a race—Auty and Harris ran—Harris kept up running, but not fast; he kept tumbling about—I went home then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the race? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I ran a little way—four or five of us ran—Harris was not so big as me—I could run faster than he—he was one of the least, and did not run so well as some who were bigger—there were some bigger than me—they ran faster—Harris was in a very goods humour, and lively during the race—it was after the race was over that he got drunk—I did not have any beer—I saw some given to Harris once during the fight.</p>

                  </hi> I am a medical man. On the 19th of Aug., between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was called to examine the deceased—I found him in convulsions, and in a very collapsed condition—my assistant had seen him before, and reported that it was a case of urgency—he had done every thing which I should have done myself—I found deceased lying on the bed insensible—the pupils of his eyes were dilated—he moved his hands about like a person in convulsions—his pulse was hardly perceptible—those were indications of an affection of the brain—I had occasion to see another patient not far off—I told the mother to make application to the child—when I came back he was dead—I had considered him hopeless—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination, and from the appearances, death was caused by conges<lb></lb>tion of the brain—I did not find any bruises on the body, it was in a healthy state—the brain was as it usually is in congestion—the white parts had a great many <hi rend="italic">points</hi> of blood, proving that is was loaded with blood—I have heard the evidence, and from that, and from my examination, my opinion is, that the general excitement of the day previous brought on the convulsions, but it is difficult to give a positive opinion.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Collin's-place, Poplar, and am ten years old. I was in Abbott's-field on the 18th of Aug., and saw Harris, Auty, and the four other prisoners there—when I first went into the field, little Harris said, <hi rend="italic">"Jem</hi>, I am drunk"—he was then against the men—Auty was with them—I saw the boys fight—I had not been bathing with them—when I first came they were all lying down in the field—the boys were dressed; all their clothes were on—I think Harris had not quite all his clothes on, he did not have his waistcoat on—the men made Auty take his waistcoat off—Harris had no waistcoat at all, he only had his jacket—I saw</p>

               <p>them fight—while they were fighting, the men were trying to make them fight, and said that they would give them some beer, and make them <hi rend="italic">drunker</hi>—they said that to one another—I tried to take Harris away, and one of the men caught hold of me—I do not recollect who it was—they held me about five minutes—the boys were not fighting then—they fought after that—they were fighting about five minutes—I saw the fight from the beginning to he end—I only saw them fight once—they began to fight after I came up—after the fight Harris, was <hi rend="italic">spewing</hi> in the field—he was drunk, lying in the field—Auty fetched some water, and it was put to his face—I took him home.</p>

                  </hi> I am the daughter of the last witness—on the 18th of Aug. I took some beer to the prisoners in Abbot's-field—the boys were not fighting then—that was about twelve or one o'clock—I staid there about an hour—Harris and Auty were not there when I first went, but they came soon after—I stopped there an hour the first time—I then went hours for a gallon of beer—I saw the boys come up while the men were there—Johnson went and took the little boy's waistcoat away—then two of the boys came to Johnson, and he said if they would fight they should have their waistcoat—the men were then all together—I do not know whether they said anything or not—the boys did fight for about ten minutes while I was there—I saw them fall once or twice—nothing was done or said by the men while that was going on that I recollect—they were there sitting down and looking on—I saw some beer given by one of the man—I do not know which.</p>

Q.</hi> Some of them were asleep, and some awake, were they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I cannot tell whether any of them were asleep or not—I was close by them—they were very good-natured with the beer—they gave our baby some, and I ha some, and bread and cheese too, and a women had some in Abbott's-field, and one that passed by—they gave their beer</p>

I am a civil engineer—I was carrying on two magazines, the <hi rend="italic">Artizan,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Freemasons' Magazine,</hi> at 19, Salisbury Street—the prisoner was in my service about four and a half years—his wages, latterly, were 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe—I have been engaged in a good many joint<lb></lb>stock companies—on 13th August last I was arrested and put into Whitecross Street—whilst I was there the prisoner came to me, almost daily—his duties then were the same as they always were—he was publishing clerk in the office of the <hi rend="italic">Artizan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Freemason's Magazine</hi>—it was his duty to receive money when tendered at the office, receive all letters and hand them over to me, and if I was absent, to my wife—with reference to cheques drawn to order, it was his duty to hand them to me, or, if I was absent, to Mrs. Smith, to be endorsed; that is, if they came open—he had no business to open a letter—he certainly had no right to endorse my name on cheques; they should have been handed to me in the same state he received them—I was in Whitecross Street nearly three weeks, that would include the week ending on 4th September—this sheet, headed "Statement for the week, ending 4th September, 1869," is the prisoner's writing; it includes sums received and disbursed—the disbursements appear as 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this is a receipt given by him to my wife for that amount—I discharged him on 7th October—I did not know at that time, nor for a considerable time after-wards, that Messrs.

Q.</hi> Were you a bankrupt in 1850? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was; it was in connection with some partnership proceedings; it was not on my own petition—I swore last August, when I was being examined about the state of my affairs, that I had no books, and I still say so—I have, before this, charged a person in my employ with forgery and embezzlement; he was acquitted—Mr. Lewis interceded for him, and it was upon that I consented not to press the charge; Mr. Payne read him a lecture, and told him he had a very narrow escape, and had to thank me for it—he was acquitted after the evidence had been given.</p>

               <p>for me, by my authority, in the name of George Duncan, engineer, Liver<lb></lb>pool—I have no recollection of the name of Duncan—he may have accepted such a hill, but I never authorized him; he certainly did not do so by my inducement or authority—I did tell him to accept a bill in the name of C. J. Taylor, engineer, Glasgow—they were not fictitious bills; I had an authority to have bills accepted—he did not accept another bill in the name of Taylor with a different initial; the bill was payable at 5, Adam Street, Adelphi—I don't remember going to Deacon's house after he left me; I certainly did not go there in a cab, and take him to my place, and want him to sign a paper to the effect that he had never signed bills for me—I swear that—he was asked as to certain bills of Taylor's, and if he ever signed any other bills, and he said "No"—I think that was at Messrs. Bambra &amp; Some-body's office—I am a bankrupt to the amount of nearly 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a propo<lb></lb>sition has been made to pay 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—I am opposed by the gentle-man who instructs you—I have not got to come up for a further examina<lb></lb>tion, that I am aware of—I am an Associate Member of the Society of Civil Engineers, and have been so fifteen years—there was a company carry<lb></lb>ing on business in Salisbury Street, called the National Cotton Cultivation Company of Greece Limited; it is not carried on now—the name is not up against my door, that I am aware of—the name was painted out some time ago—I was engineer to the company, not one of the directors, as far as I remember; it is seven or eight years ago—to the best of my belief I was not a director—I should fancy there were seven or more directors, according to the Act of Parliament—I can't, at this moment, recollect any of their names—I attended some six or seven of their meetings—I did not promote the company—I was interested in its operations—there is another company that has its name up at my door, "The Public Works and Credit Company of Italy; "I am the engineer of that; it is the engineer's office; I don't know where their offices are—there has been no business done for some time past, like a great many other companies—the "Agricultural and General Machinery Agency Company Limited," has its name up on my door—I don't remember the day the prisoner was arrested, we had a difficulty in finding him, and I went with the detective sergeant to point him out—I did not go to his rooms and carry away all his papers; the sergeant did—I know that there were some letters from my agent at Glasgow, addressed to the prisoner's private house; also some other letters announcing the payment of money on account of the Freemasons' Bank, in which he acknowledges to taking money—I do not know whether he is indicted for that; I am not a lawyer—I appeared against him at Bow Street, and I acted under advice—I have no doubt that forging the cheque was one of the forms the charge took at Bow Street—whether it was embezzlement or forgery he is being tried for, I do not know—I do not know that a witness who was called at Bow Street is not to be called to-day—I do not know the name which was struck out—I heard Mr. Rogers examined at Bow Street—the prisoner was taken in custody on a Saturday night, or 12.30 or 1.0 on Sunday morning; he did not come home till that time—I knew of this cheque being paid some time in the middle of November, a fortnight, or it may be three weeks, before he was taken in custody—I will not swear it was not five weeks; you have the means of ascertaining very much better than myself—the gentleman who instructs you drew an affidavit, and it was sworn to by Mr. Rust; I heard it read out, and it was full of untruths—I did not go to Mr. Rogers on 30th October, and ask him about this</p>

               <p>cheque, or at any other time—he called at my house, I think, about 13th November, and apologised, and explained the circumstances under which he gave the prisoner change for the cheque—there were two reasons why he was not taken in custody before; all his friends told me he was sold up at his house, and I did not look for him; but when I ascertained that he was at a public-house, I sent to inform the officer—I never heard of his being employed at the Carbon Oil Company, at Westminster, till afterwards—I gave no instructions that he should be searched for, because I was advised that until the evidence was complete I should not be justified in giving him in custody; but when we found another case of fraud, and that he him falsified the books, I was advised to give him in custody—I never saw or spoke to Rust at the Bankruptcy Court—I have not read the affidavit he signed, but I know it is so full of untruths, because statements have been made by the gentleman instructing you upon the contents of it, which, if they represent the contents, it must be full of untruths—this "National Masonic Calender, Pocket Book, and Diary for 1870," is advertised to be edited and published by me, but it is not published—subscriptions and advertisements have been applied for—I cannot tell how many advertise<lb></lb>ments have been ordered to be inserted—it is usually published on 31st December—no advertisements have been paid for, as far as I know—it is the advertising agent's business to receive the advertisements and the money; he has very likely received some, but none has been paid to me—if you see in print, "Post Office order and cheques payable to Henry Her<lb></lb>bert Montague," that must be the case, but whether that applies to 1869 or 1870, I cannot tell you—Henry Herbert Montague are my son's Chris<lb></lb>tian names—he is nine years old—it is a common plan to use a name—the prisoner had not a right to use money which came into his hands for office purposes, excepting for petty cash—he had no authority to pay wages, unless the money was handed to him for that purpose—he had authority to disburse the moneys he received for petty cash, and stamps for newspapers—I describe him thus: "Post Office orders payable to John Rust, publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Freemasons' Magazine</hi>"—on 4th September he came to see me in Whitecross Street Prison, on two occasions during the day, in the morning, early, and at nearly 3 o'clock in the afternoon; I told you so before, at the Police Court—he also called a third time, in the evening, but I did not see him—I raised a question about the petty cash, when he called at 3 o'clock—England's payment, in the ledger, is entered on 1st July—I had not given him instructions to enter cheques on different dates to what they were received on—a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from Taylor &amp; Co., of Birkenhead, on 31st August, is entered in the prisoner's writing, on 1st September—I did not tell him to enter it on 31st July, it would be perfectly absurd—this enve<lb></lb>lope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—I see several pencil marks on the back of it—I see no initials on it; I see some on the letter of advice—they are not mine; one is a very good imitation, and the other a very bad one—I never asked Mr. Rogers to attest signatures which he had not seen written; but in the case of a specification for patents, a person will come in and sign, and if it cannot be attested then, he attests it afterwards—the stamps of our newspapers posted vary; here is one account, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., another, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and another, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the service in 1867? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my salary was raised, I believe, a shilling a week without my asking for it—the signature to this document is like mine; it bears date 8th July, 1867—I do not remember whether that was the time my salary was raised—it has been raised more than once—I borrowed money, from time to time, from my master—I had one loan, and I might have borrowed half-a-sovereign or a sovereign—I had not twenty loans; they were generally accorded with very bad grace—I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1867 (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I made excuses for not repaying it, and I explained it to Mr. Smith at the time, and part of it has been paid back—the letter of 11th August, 1869, is my writing—I do not know whether Mr. Smith was attending to business at that time—I say here, "Will you oblige me with the loan of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be paid as follows: 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Saturday, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 21st; and the balance on the 28th; the fact is the poor rates have been collected sooner than I anticipated, and I have to pay them, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to day"—I do not mean that I have seen Rust sign Mr. Smith's name on a cheque—I had an interview with Mr. Smith on 30th October, about my passing the cheque through my banker's—I do not remember saying, at that interview, that I had never known him to sign Mr. Smith's name before—I might have said that, I was indiscreet—there was a debt of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me from September 2nd, and this cheque repre<lb></lb>sents it—all these cheques are taken from the same book—I hare not got the counterfoils—I buy twenty-four at once—this cheque of the 2nd was not drawn on the 12th, or the 22nd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Hold it to the light, and see whether there was not another figure before the "2" originally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see what you mean; it is drawn with a very bad quill pen, and the prisoner said that they would not cash it—it is possible I might have written "1st September"—I have not got the cheques preceding, or the counterfoils, or the pads-book; but the cheques show that they have been through the London and County Bonk, by the stamp—the cheque of 4th August is from a new book, which accounts for the difference of 500 in the numbers—when I said that the cheques came from the same book I referred to these two—I had had a banking account there for six years, and yet I was borrowing to pay by instalments—I will explain that; I had not a large balance at my banker's, perhaps 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I was bound to keep, and Rust said, "I shall have money on Saturday, and you can pay in this cheque to meet the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I went to my bauker's and bogged them to</p>

               <p>pass it through, so that it should be paid on the Saturday, although the usual course is to do it next day—I was in a hurry, because I thought it would meet the cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was coming in—I got my master's cheque on Satur<lb></lb>day turned into cash to meet my cheque on Monday, and left his service on the Saturday night, without notice—I bad nothing to do with the books—I find in the prisoner's statement, "Cash received, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the <hi rend="italic">Artizan</hi> office," and "Cash paid to Mr. Smith, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I may have put down 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for wages on Saturday night, but that is a mistake; it should be 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is not in the prisoner's writing—I find the items on this side, and on the other side, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I do not see 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not understand the account—I find 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but not 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know nothing about the accounts whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a common thing, or was it a very rare thing indeed, that the office should be hard up for money, and the clerks obliged to supply it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard the prisoner say so many times and that he did not even know how he was to get the stamps to post the magazines—I left, I believe it was on the 4th, because I did not wish to be mixed up with this matter at all—he knew where to find me, but he pre<lb></lb>tended not to know my address—his solicitor has not communicated with me—a summons was left at the residence, on Friday, which I occupied when Mr. Smith employed me—I never absconded, or tried to run away—the "Instruct Rust," on this envelope, is, I have no doubt, in Smith's writing, and the "W. S." is very much like the way he used to sign his initials—I should certainly think it is his writing, without swearing to it, because I did not see him write it—I should also say that the prosecutor wrote this "Enter" on the back—it would have been inconvenient to me to have paid the loan of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid back the first week, not 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because the prosecutor said it would come easier to me afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BKSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been shown the envelope, and the pencil writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have had them in my possession once—I do not remember whether that was at the Police Court—it was not just before I was examined as a witness—I did not hear my late master examined there, I was not in Court—I heard him examined to-day, and swear that this pencil is not his writing; I do not swear that it is, but as near as I can possibly go without seeing him write it—I do not pledge my oath that it is his writing, but I certainly think it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever mention the transaction of the cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on 13th October—up to that time I said nothing; I had left—I did not let him know; the prisoner was so much mixed up in the prosecutor's matters that it was not necessary—I did not think it wrong or suspicious in any way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer; my office is at Adam Street, Adelphi—I have known Mr. Smith for the last ten years—I was articled to him, and was manager of his branch business—I have fre<lb></lb>quently seen him write—these words on the envelope, "Instruct Rust; entered July 31," are, to the best of ray belief, in Mr. Smith's writing, and the initials on the letter of advice are, to the best of my belief, the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been subpoenaed to attend this trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on Saturday afternoon; unwillingly—I did not say, to-day, that I had not been subpoenaed; I said that I came down for my own conveni<lb></lb>ence, having met the case before, and came down to see the issue—Mr.</p>

               <p>Smith and I have had disputes—I had an action against him—he did not bring an action against me—he won the day, and I had to become insolvent because I could not pay my costs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Margaret Jackson, who keeps the George and Dragon public-house, at Shadwell. On the night of the 14th of April, the two prisoners came into the house together—I put a pint pot on the steps in the passage—the prisoners were in the passage—I went into the kitchen, closed the door, and looked through the key-hole on the top of the kitchen stairs, and saw Johnson stooping—I opened the door, and they both walked into the tap-room—the pot was gone—I went into the tap-room, and saw the prisoners—I asked them if they had seen the pint pot, and I told them where it had been—the woman said no, she had not seen it, and the man went to the bar for half a pint of beer—I told the woman I should insist upon looking into her basket, as no one else had passed out—she said she had nothing but what she had been shopping for—I opened the basket, and saw the handle of the pot—I took it out, and it was the one I had put down—the woman looked at me and said, "Say no more about it"—I took it to the bar, to my mistress, who took out three quart pots, and one pint—one of the quart pots wit my mistress's.</p>

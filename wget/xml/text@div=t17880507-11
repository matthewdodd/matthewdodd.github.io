               <p>I am coachman to the Hon. Mr. Urbie; last Sunday night I was very much in liquor; between twelve and one o'clock, I was standing fast asleep against a door in <placeName id="t17880507-11-crimeloc48">Oxford-buildings</placeName>

               <p>GEORGE CUMING sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a baker; I live opposite where this man lay in Oxford-buildings; on Sunday night my wife and I had been out, we returned about one; the prosecutor sat with his hands in his coat pocket fast asleep; I called the watchman, and left him with the man; the man was asleep then; my wife said, the man is drunk and the watchman will do him; I opened the door a little way, and saw the watchman pull the watch out of the man's breeches pocket, and put it within-side his own great-coat; he then went off calling the hour; we went in search of the prisoner, and found him next day, by means of the beadle; he would not let us in; it was a quarter of an hour before we could get the door open.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take him that night? - I was afraid, because we had had a dispute with him that night; and I thought as he was a watchman, I should find him in the morning; it was a thing I did not know very well how to do.</p>

               <p>I am a beadle; the prisoner is a watchman; I and the watch-house keeper, and Cuming, went to search the prisoner's lodgings for a watch; he pretended he was drunk, and could not open the door; it was a long time before we got in; when we got in, I charged him with stealing the watch; he asked who the watch belonged to; but never denied having it, that I recollect; I found it among the ashes under the grate in his lodgings; Cuming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070013"></xptr>described before I went the string of the watch, and the seals of it, very perfectly.</p>

               <p>When I cried the hour ten o'clock; I found the prosecutor laying drunk in the buildings; the next time I came my rounds, I found the watch lying near the place where I saw the man; when I came to the watch-house next morning, there was nobody there, and so I took the watch home; my wife put it in the ashes for fear I should play any games with it, and she locked me in. The beadle knows my character.</p>

               <p>To Biddington. What character does he bear? - I hope I shall be excused, as I am upon oath, I should hurt him.</p>

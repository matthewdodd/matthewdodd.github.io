I am stationed at Paddington—on 18th August Jane Giffard and her husband were tried here for an offence against the Mint—I was the officer in charge of the case—her husband was Sentenced to seven years' penal servitude, and she was acquitted on the ground of being married to him and under his coercion—on the 19th August she came to the Paddington police-station with her mother for some property I had taken from her—I received a communication from her, in consequence of which I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., marked money, a half-crown, and a Shilling—on Thursday, 21st August, I went with her and her mother to Tottenham Court Road—I waited outside the Crown public-house—the prisoner came out of that public-house about 12. 20—I followed him and Giffard some distance, they parted and I followed the prisoner towards the Borough—I saw him again about 3 o'clock, with Giffard, at a second puhlic-house, the Crown, in Bloomsbury Street—I was then with Detective Smith—I went into the public-house and saw Smith in the left compart<lb></lb>ment and the prisoner and Giffard in the right—I left the compartment where Smith was and went into the right-hand compartment—I saw the prisoner and Giffard sitting opposite each other on two high stools, about a yard and a half apart—I said "Young man, I want to speak to you; we are two detective officers, and we shall take you into custody"—he threw his left hand back—I caught his right hand and Smith caught his left—I asked if he knew the female, he made no reply—I saw Smith take a half<lb></lb>crown and shilling from his left; hand—that was the half-crown and shilling I had previously given to Giffard—there are two marks on the shilling and one on the half-crown—it was done with a sort of punch, which I produce—I asked Giffard what she had received from the man and took from her this blue paper which she held in her hand with her purse, which contains ten bad half-crowns—she said "That is all I have received"—the prisoner called out very loudly "Call a police<lb></lb>man! this woman has got half a load of bad money!"—I said "It is all right; we are police officers"—he said "See that she does not get away"—I said "I will see to that; I have got the money here"—we took him to the station—when Smith caught his hand he said "What have you got here?"—the prisoner said "This is all I have got," and he gave two packets to Smith, done up in blue paper, with a piece of brown paper, in the same manner as the other coins—he took them from his left-hand coat pocket—he said he thought there was something wrong in his pocket, and put his hand there, and the female must have put them there—the prisoner made a long statement, which the Inspector took down—I was present—the Inspector asked him if he wished the statement taken down, and he said "Yes; I should like it taken down," and he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "The female brought in here to-day with me I have known some six months on the Seven Dials. Her husband was sentenced to seven years at the Central Criminal Court on Monday last (she was acquitted) for uttering counterfeit coin; after her husband was convicted on the Monday, she came to see me on the Dials, at the Clock House, and told me she had got off, and that she was very hard-up. She asked me did I know, or could I tell her where she could part with some counterfeit coin that she had planted; I said I did not know then; but as I had known her husband I arranged to meet her</p>

               <p>tomorrow. I do know counterfeit coins through knowing her husband. I arranged to meet her to-day at the public where I was arrested. I did meet her. When I came in she was in the house, waiting for me. She said 'Have you found any one to take them?' I said 'No; its no use; there's nobody about. 'She said 'Speak slow, there's somebody watching in the opposite; bar;'she spoke in a low tone of voice, and caused me to bend over to hear her; she then said 'Do try, I am so hard-up I have not a stitch to my back;' she then said 'I'll retain half a load, meaning ten, and do try and sell the rest, so I shall have a <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to do the rest. 'I said 'I can't.' She said "Do come here" (bending over to me more); I had scarcely regained my position when these two gentlemen came in, and said 'Have you passed any parcel to this female?' Something struck me that all was not right; I put my hand to my side, and found something in my pocket which I knew ought not to be there, and which I thought was put there by the woman; they said 'What have you got in your hand?' There was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it in good money. I told the officers to take the female into custody, as I believed she had got some bad money about her. I live with a female named Mary Ann Wilson, at 12, Short's Gardens, on the first floor, in a back room; the landlady's name is Mrs. Keefe. (Signed) Henry Williams.—I wish further to add that when the officers took me I said 'What do you want with me?' They said 'We shall take you into custody for having counterfeit coin. 'I said 'I have none; but I believe that woman has, take her. '"—I searched the prisoner and found two sixpences and 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I received the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change from Giffard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner about five years—he is my cousin—I have seen him frequently—I won't swear that I saw him in the year 1870—I will swear that I saw him in January, 1871, and February—I don't remember all the months—I can't say that I saw him in October, 1869—I don't know that I saw him in 1869 at all—I heard that he was convicted of passing bad money, and got two years; but I can swear I saw him in January, 1871—I have cohabited with him for nearly two years—I have not supported him by walking the streets—I received money regularly every week from gentlemen friends—I only received money from one; he seduced me, and he gives me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I had seen Giffard three or four times before—I have been on the streets of late—I was not here at the last Sessions, but I know this occurred on the Wednesday—it might have been later than 5 o'clock when I parted from her—I have heard the prisoner called the <hi rend="italic">Captain</hi> frequently—I have not always been on the best of terms with him—I put some counterfeit coin between the bed and the mattrass, and charged him with having the bad money—it was a lie from beginning to end—I have given evidence for the prisoner here before—he was charged with having counterfeit coin—he got off, but not on my evidence in particular.</p>

I was with the last witness in St. Andrew Street on the Wednesday evening, between 3 and 4 o'clock—I was standing outside the public-house and Giffard came and touched Wilson on the shoulder and asked her how she was—Mary Wilson asked her to come in the public-house and have somethiug to drink, and gave her some port wine—she showed a</p>

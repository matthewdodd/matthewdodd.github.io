                  </hi>. I keep the Rose and Crown, Berner-street, Edg<lb></lb>ware-road. On the 25th of September, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, there were two or three people outside in the lobby—a Person named Vine asked for change for a half-crown—I took one shilling and three sixpences out of the till, and laid it down—the prisoner</p>

               <p>took it up, and I asked for the half-crown—he said, "I have given it you"—when Vine saw the prisoner take it up, he said, "Give me the change"—I said, "This man has taken it up"—the prisoner said he had given me the half-crown—I said I had received none, and would send for a policeman—the prisoner wanted to go into the yard—I would not let him, and he remained till the policeman came, and as he was taking him from the house a shilling dropped from him, which they picked up—they took him to the station-house, and found one sixpence in his pocket, and two dropped from him—he had some more money in a bag, I think it was fourteen shillings and sixteen sixpences.</p>

               <p>MR. ROBERTS. I gave Higginson the order on the over night; I saw the coals in the barge, but I did not see him take the barge away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you deliver to him the ship's certificate of the quantity - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He was to deliver the coals to Mr. Roberts - A. Yes, the prisoner was. They were my master's coals.</p>

            . Q. You purchased a score of coals of Messrs. Davey and Sawyer - A. I did; I saw the coals in the barge the Gilbert; I was determined to watch this barge in its way to Hammersmith; I went to Milbank on the 16th of January, they were to be sent me there were two men to proceed towards Fulham with this barge; I took a boat and went up the river towards Fulham I came up to the barge that I supposed to be the Gilbert at <placeName id="t18120219-2-crimeloc11">Wandsworth</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner so as to be quite sure of him - A. I did not know him before; I was quite near enough to know his person; I am sure it was him. There were two men besides Higginson on board the barge and there was a boat lashed to the stern part; I observed the two men, one held up a sack and the other put coals in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the boat - A. Nobody then; I saw one man holding up a sack, and the other man putting coals into it; that was on board the Gilbert; Higginson was one of these men, he was steering the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the coals - A. The men went and moved the boat from the stern of the barge to the side, and put the sack with the coals into the boat. They got into the boat, and rowed off, and I after them. They put their boat ashore at Wansworth; we put our boat ashore likewise and attempted to go to the boat. My son and the waterman went to the boat, we attempted to go near the boat when on shore. They pushed off, and would not let us come near them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it evident that that was done for the purpose of avoiding you - A. It was, apparently. We pursued them all the way up to Chiswick; there I lost them; they were two hearty strong young men, they rowed away in a light wherry; I lost them on the other side of Chiswick.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw the coals handed over the barge into the boat was the barge on the Middlesex side or the Surry - A. The barge was on the Middlesex side when the coals were taken out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was not that day the dark and foggy day - A. No, it was not; I could perfectly see the men.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other barges on the river at the same time - A. Yes, there were.</p>

I have known Newbury some time—he is not really deaf; he could hear very well at the police-station, and nothing had to be repeated to him at the police-court—on 24th Sep<lb></lb>tember, about 8 o'clock, McGrath came to me, and said "Sergeant, there has been a stabbing case down at the Strangers' Home, and they say I have got something to do with it; I struck one of them with my belt"—I said "What did you want to strike them for?"—he said "I thought they were going to stab me, one of my mates said 'Look out, Jack, he has got a knife,' and I struck one of them in self-defence"—he took off his belt, twisted it round his hand, and showed me how he used it—what I call a belt is a strap which he uses instead of braces—I took him to the Home, where the three Arabs were, who made me understand by gestures that he was one of their assailants, and McGrath went upon his knees, in an attitude of prayer, and said "So help me God I know nothing about it"—I took off his belt and examined it—there were no blood-marks on it—he made a variety of rambling incoherent statements to the effect that he knew nothing of it, and used the belt in self-defence.</p>

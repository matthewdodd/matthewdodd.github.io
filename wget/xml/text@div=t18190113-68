On the 15th of January, I shut up my house and went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock at night. About one o'clock I was alarmed by a knocking at the door, and somebody calling for some hot wine; I called out of the window that I could not serve them, and went to bed again. In about five minutes I was alarmed again by a knocking; I did not get up immediately, but in about a quarter of an hour, as it continued, I got up; and observed two persons standing outside; I did not know them. In about five minutes the watchman came - I went down stairs, and found three or four watchmen in the shop. Three staples of the door were drawn out, which I had fastened safe the night before; I found the till taken out of its place, three sixpences and 1 s. 2 d. in copper, gone. The till lay on the floor.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Aldgate. On the 15th of January, about one o'clock at night, I saw the two prisoners and two others in Rosemary-lane, near the house; they passed my box, and turned up a turning opposite my box. I went round to cry one o'clock; turned up a turning, put my lanthorn behind me, and went into a dark court to watch them - and saw them all four come down the turning where they went up, and go towards the prosecutor's house. They stopped about the door, walking backwards and forwards, until half-past one o'clock. I am certain the prisoners were two of them. They were tossing halfpence with each other under the gas-lamp, which is over the prosecutor's door - I did not see them do anything to the house; I went away, called the hour, put my lanthorn in my box, and went there again. I slipped up the street, keeping close to the houses, and stood at the corner of Derby-street; I saw Sullivan leave the other three, and come down on the opposite side. I then saw one of them standing at the prosecutor's door watching; he saw me, immediately turned round, and said, there is the watchman; Driscoll, and another young man bounced out of the house, and ran across the street; all three of them ran into Blue Anchor-yard. I went over to the house and found it open - the staple was drawn, and the till laying on the floor; I heard the patrol call - we both went in together, and the prosecutor came down. I took Sullivan about two o'clock the next morning, coming by my box, and pretending to be in liquor; Driscoll was taken next day about ten o'clock - I have known him two years, and am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am the prosecutors wife. The prisoner, Sullivan, has been at our house three times. On the Thursday before the robbery he had a ring in his hand, and offered it to me for sale; it was exactly like the one produced - but I will not swear this is the same. I believe it to be so. I refused buying it, as I noticed it, and told him it was not gold.</p>

John Pearson depos'd that on the 30th of Nov. at Night, happening to be in Company with Wells at an Alehouse opposite to the Prosecutor's, they staid till 11 o'Clock, when Wells appeared very uneasy, and said he had no mind to go home; and after some other preparatory Discourse, he told this Evidence, that he should be glad of his Assistance if he could keep a Secret. Never fear me, (says Pearson) what is it? - Could you dispose of a Coat or Pair of Breeches cleverly? - Ay, or any thing else that you can bring me. - Indeed! Why, I'll tell thee then - My Master's Shop is very well stock'd - and - you understand me. - Yes, yes, you mean that he cannot easily miss an odd thing. - Right. I know it to be so, for

Why then here's my Hand, I'll make the third Person; appoint the Time. - Let me see! - to morrow Night about this time; - My Master will be gone to Bed, and I'll wait for you at the Door. - They agreed, and parted; and Pearson the next day informs the Prosecutor of all that had past between'em. He desired Pearson entirely to fall in with the Prisoners Measures, and to carry whatever Goods they stole to Mr. Long's the Pawnbroker, to whom he would discover the Secret, and desires him to lend Money upon'em. The Plot succeeded, Pearson betray'd all to the Procecutor and the Prisoners were apprehended. - Marriot in Hounsditch deposed, that 3 or 4 Weeks ago, about 11 at Night, he was sent for to the Bell Tavern at Aldgate, where he saw the two Prisoners, and Swanson taking up a Scarlet Roquelaur, desired him to lend two Guineas upon it, for he said he was a Taylor, and had made it for a Gentleman, but he was gone out of Town.

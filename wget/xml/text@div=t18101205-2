On the 9th of October three men came to my house, one of the young men had lodged in the house in my husband's time, a twelvemonth before, and the prisoner was another of them; one of them sat down, and said they must have something to drink, but they did not send for any thing; they staid in my house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I was standing with my back towards them at the washing tub. I knew the other two men for two years past; the prisoner I had seen but three times before, one of these men was a sailor, and the other had been a footman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before these men came to your shop had you any watch there - A. Yes; I had a watch hanging at the mantle shelf while they were in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your back towards the mantle-piece, or your face - A. My back. There was nobody in the room but the three men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any silver tea-spoon about the room - A. I had a tea-spoon in the cups and saucers, on the mantle-piece. When the man had been gone out five minutes I missed my watch and spoon, there was a silver sixpence on the blue ribbon of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the watch - A. I cannot say. When I missed my silver watch and spoon I immediately went out, I saw neither of them in the street. From information I went to the Yorkshire Grey public-house and took one of them. About eleven o'clock at night; I gave him in charge of the watchman; the other two I could not find that night. The prisoner was taken up upon another charge. I went to the prisoner and saw him, I just saw one eye and his side face, I could not swear to him then; he was in a sailor's dress when he came to my house, and when I saw him in prison he was differently dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him now and tell me whether you can safely say he the man - A. I can take my sacrament oath that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your watch again - A. No, I have not.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember being near this woman's house in October last - A. Yes; I cannot recollect the day of the month, it is about two months ago; I was spinning a top on the pavement about a quarter past two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body go into Mrs. Woodgear's room - A. Yes, I saw three men, one in a sailor's dress, another in a groom's dress, and the other in a blue coat and a pair of corderoy breeches; they staid in the house about a quarter of an hour; I saw one come out first, the other two came out in about five minutes, and Mrs. Woodgear came out five minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the hands of the man that came out first - A. The man in the corderoy breeches came out first, and then the sailor and the groom came out; the groom had the watch in his hand, he gave it to the sailor, and they all ran off together; the prisoner was one of these men, he was in a sailor's dress.</p>

The prisoner gave me no acount of them. The prosecutor came and took them away, I cannot say the day. I did not know the prisoner before, I thought he was a horse-dealer; he would not tell me where he lived. I am sure it is him.</p>

               <p>Smallbourn. Jordan has the oversight of my sheep, on the 21st of September he informed me, I went the Friday after, and saw the sheep in Mercy's possession.</p>
               <p>Court to Mercy. Are you positive the prisoner is the man that brought them to you? - I am positive, he offered to sell them as his own property, two ewes and one lamb for three half guineas, and one lamb he took away.</p>

               <p>I live at the Swan and Two Necks on Finchley Common, I bought them of a drover on the road, I gave twelve shillings a piece for the ewes and six shillings a piece for the lambs, and I took them to Mr. Mercy, to grass; I should be glad to put it off till Saturday, as I employed a Counsel and an Attorney, and my brother run away with the money.</p>
               <p>Court. It is too late now to put off your trial.</p>

            . I was in Eagle-court on the 8th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening - I live at No. 5, Peter Street, Saffron-hill; I was sent for by a lodger of ours, stating that the furniture was being taken out of the window of <placeName id="t18330516-45-crimeloc236">No. 23, Eagle-court</placeName>

               <p>Q. You don't mean to say the prisoner stole your bonnet? A. He took it off my head, and used me very cruelly.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of January, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner, in company with two more, in the Haymarket, attempting several gentlemens' pockets, as they passed. I followed them into Piccadilly; he went about half-way up, and returned, following a gentleman; the other two covered him, while the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket. I was on the opposite side of the road, the prisoner crossed, I laid hold of him; he threw it down. Forbes ran after the gentleman.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was with Thompson, and saw the prisoner with two more - They attempted several pockets. I did not see him take the handkerchief; I saw him cross the road, and ran after the man; I saw him throw the handkerchief down. I went after the gentleman, he returned, and promised to come to the office, but did not.</p>

About 7 Weeks ago my Mistress sent me out with a Sieve of Oysters to sell in Petticoat Lane: When I was coming home, I saw the Prisoner hulking about our Door, and he pretended to be making Water, but I thought he was pushing against it. When we came home, we found the Door broke open and a great many Things were taken away.</p>

            . I lodge in a Ground Room in Mr. Smith's House. On the 18 th of October I went out about 4 o'clock, to go down to Billingsgate, to get some Oysters for the Girl to go out with that Night. I returned home about Seven, and found a Door of my Room broke open; not the Set Door, for that is left open for the sake of other Lodgers, but a Door in the Entry, near the Street Door, which we never made any use of, and as we always went in and out at another Door, this which was next the Street Door, was fasten'd up with two Bolts and three Nails, and a great Looking Glass hung upon it. This Door we found broke open, and a Chest of Drawers was broke open likewise, and a Calamancoe Gown, three Pair of Sheets, a white Apron, and a Muslin Hood, were taken from hence; the Candlestick and one Apron were taken out of the Room. After my Surprize was a little over, I said to my Husband, - '' I fancy the Man that was transported a '' while ago with my Brother, has done this, - '' I fancy 'tis Bullingbroke.'' And accordingly, I got a Warrant the next Day, and took the Prisoner; then search'd his Room, and found one of my Shifts. Upon this he was carried before Mr. Justice Farmer, and there he own'd the Fact, telling us his Wife was the Occasion of his committing it; but he would not sign a Confession in Writing, nor would he tell us where the rest of the Goods were. His Wife said she knew where they all were, but she refused to tell us. I am sure the Goods I have mentioned to be in the Drawers, were all there when I went out, and that the Drawers were lock'd.</p>

            . I search'd the Prisoner's Room, and there we found an old Shift, which Mrs. Hodsdon swore to. She came to me with a Warrant to take the Prisoner, on the Eighteenth of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060008"></xptr> October, about twelve o'Clock at Noon, but they desired me to take Care of myself, for he was a vile, desperate Fellow. Upon this, I thought proper to wait till between 5 and 6 o'Clock for the Assistance of another Constable, and about seven we took him. He told us, he was guilty of the Fact, and could not help it now. Says he, '' I have nothing to do, but beg my Life.'' Why says I, you have very lately been transported  Says he, '' I was transported about fifteen or sixteen '' Months ago, and am but very lately returned: '' My Wife has been the Ruin of me.'' I never saw the Prisoner's Wife till she came to make up the Matter, and then she told them, her Husband's Life was in their Hands.</p>
               <p>Hodsdon. She solicited us to make a Debt of it, and promised to pay so much a-week till we were satisfied.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. They accuse me very wrongfully. My Wife deals in Rag Fair, and this Shift, which they found in my Room, might be got there, for aught I know.

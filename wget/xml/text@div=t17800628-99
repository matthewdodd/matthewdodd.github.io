My house was attacked, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon of Wednesday the 7th of June. I was in my garret. I heard a tumultuous noise; I ran down stairs; the first person I saw coming in at the door with that multitude was the prisoner at the bar; he had a bludgeon or stick in his hand, with which I saw him break the windows; he was the next person to me. I went out of the house and left him breaking the windows; and I saw no more of him. The mob demolished the furniture; they broke the closets and shelves down.</p>
               <p>Did they break down the wainscoting? - The house has very little wainscoting in it; what there was they demolished.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - No. I saw the prisoner again on Wednesday the 26th; I was coming home from Old-street; he was in White-Cross-street with a pea-cart; I immediately knew him again; he is so remarkable I could not mistake him; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you mention that to any body before? - I mentioned it in my own family that one person struck me more than the rest.</p>

               <p>I keep an eating house in Grub-street; my father employed the prisoner to bring his goods from the Fleet; my father is in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280231"></xptr> Fleet; he came home and desired me to get some body to help to move his goods, as the Fleet was threatened to be set on fire. I went up to White Cross-street and got a cart. The prisoner was asleep in the stable; I waked him; that was a little before two o'clock.</p>
               <p>What stables were they; - I do not know the name of the stables; there is a box maker at the corner of the yard. I drove the cart and he rode within side to Fleet-lane; it is a little potatoe cart.</p>
               <p>Was the cart his? - Whether it was his or his master's I do not know; he mounted the cart while I went into the Fleet and helped to bring the goods down; when we had loaded the cart and came from it, it was past six o'clock; I believe the mob were then breaking Mr. Langdale's windows, because as we came to the top of the market we saw two men on the leads.</p>
               <p>How far is Grub-street from the Fleet? - About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Was he with you all the time? - Yes; from before two till almost seven o'clock; then I unloaded the cart.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with him before? - No; my father bespoke the cart, and I went a little before two for it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What evening was this? - Wednesday evening; the same evening the Fleet was on fire.</p>

               <p>I was a prisoner at the Fleet; on the Wednesday when this happened I was afraid of losing my little property; I ran to my children who were able to help me. I met my son William. I said come down and help me, as the Fleet is threatened to be set on fire; that was rather before twelve o'clock. I told him I had spoke to a man who keeps a little cart. I went back to pack up my things as fast as I could; about an hour or two after my two sons William and Thomas came; they helped to lead the things into the cart; I knew nothing of the prisoner before, only he was employed to carry my goods; he is a carman; he was employed from two o'clock. I did not get out of the Fleet till near six o'clock; I walked along by the cart all the way; the cart, I believe, belongs to one Armston; I know nothing of the prisoner; I spoke to Armston for the cart.</p>

On the 29th of October, at eleven o'clock at night, I went out to fetch my wife's things from her stall, at the top of the street, as there was a piece of work there. I left my daughter Mary, who is thirteen years old, in the front room; two younger children were in bed in the back-room - I left the front room door open - I returned in three minutes, and sung out for Mary, to take a basket of me - I got no answer from her - put my hand to the lock, to feel for the key of the door, and found the door open, with the bolt of the lock shot out; I then went in and looked at my box - I found the lock of it wrenched off, all but one screw - I went into the back room and found the blankets rolled up towards the foot of the bed, off the children - my daughter came in from the top of the street; I then went and fetched the rest of my wife's things from her stall, then looked about and missed these other things from the back room - I had seen them all safe that evening - I had been in the back room half an hour before - the blankets were then spread over the children - they could not have kicked them down in the manner they were - Gibbs, the officer came to my house before I missed the things.</p>

            . On this Saturday night my father went to fetch my mother's things, and in about a minute I went out of the front room, locked the door, and went after my father, because there was a disturbance at the top of the street, and I was afraid my mother would be ill-used. I am sure I locked the door, for I shoved my knee against it after taking the key out - nobody could have come in before I went out, for I stood facing the room door, which was open; I heard my father call me - went back with the key, and found the door open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does the front room door open into the passage, near the street door, or a good way from it? A. A good way from it; when I went out I left the street-door open, close against the wall - nobody could have been behind it.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Swan-street - twenty-five or thirty-yards from Lane. On the 29th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I was going along the street and saw the prisoner, Needham, and Warren, coming from the Church-street end of the street; I knew them all three very well; I was within fifteen or sixteen yards of Lane's house - they came from the end of the street where Lane's stall was, and all three came up to his door - I stopped at the Swan (which is right opposite) for a necessary purpose - they all three went in, as I thought, to purchase something - they came out in about a minute and a half - Warren first, Needham and Goddard close after him - I could perceive, by the light on the opposite side of the way, that Warren had something under his arm, and when Goddard came out there seemed something bulky under his coat - he had nothing under it when he went in - he wore a fustian coat - I walked on the opposite side of the way towards my own house, in the same direction as they went - I then saw by a strong gas light, that Warren had something under his arm - I met Stapleton, who went with me - they were rather before me, on the opposite side- I walked on to my own house - there is a strong gas light, and the public-house at the corner has another gas light - I could see, for ten or fifteen yards, the two sleeves of a shirt dragging on the ground, and Goddard's toes nearly on them; I told Stapleton to follow them, while I went in to put my coat and boots on, which I did, and then went over to Lane's; the girl made a complaint, and I went after the prisoners directly and returned, not seeing Stapleton nor them; I examined Lane's door and found the box of the lock nearly wrenched off - I went into the back room and found the bed clothes folded up carelessly, and on the hinge side of the door there seemed to have been a small incision made with a small crow-bar - it was a very clear night - I told Lane I knew them. and I saw them all three again on the Sunday evening - I gave information to several officers, and on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, I was told Goddard was in custody; I believe I spoke to Goddard on Sunday - I went out to fetch another officer, to take all three; I saw them enter the prosecutor's passage - the room door could easily be forced. I have known Goddard eight or nine years - he lives about a minute's walk from me - they are all well known in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It struck you that they were going to buy something? A. I could not suppose they were going to rob such a poor man; I have been a constable several years, but did not wish to belong to it any more; the prisoner's father is one; I was always on good terms with him; I had no dispute with him about his having more of a reward than I had, for he was allowed none of it; I never said I would injure him; I was a witness against one Redman, tried here three years ago; I was not told that I prevaricated in my evidence, nor desired to leave the Court; I employ Stapleton to work for me at times- he has come from the House of Correction to-day.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Turk-street, Bethnal-green, and am a cordwainer. I lived at No. 8, Swan-street, about four months ago. I lived in Turk-street on the 29th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be described as "William Stapleton, of Swan-street, Bethnal-green," so late as the 16th of November, when you were before the Magistrate? A. I suppose the mistake happened because I worked there then, as a journeyman to Gibbs. On Saturday night, the 29th of October, I saw Warren, Goddard, and Needham, standing against a coal-shed in Church-street, consulting together - I had been to the baker's, at the corner of the street, for a loaf, and saw Goddard turn into Swan-street; I left them there, and on returning towards Gibbs' house, I met Gibbs - he told me to follow them; I saw them two or three doors from Lane's - this was hardly ten minutes after I had seen Goddard go into Swan-street; I went after them down Bacon-street; Goddard had something bulky under his coat - Warren was close to him - a shirt sleeve hung down on the pavement from Warren's-arm - they walked on to Club-row, went through an alley there, and then stopped. I saw Goddard give something like a gown, away from his arm; there was a whistle from the bottom of the court, but I saw nobody. Goddard answered "Is it all right?" After giving the gown to somebody, he took hold of me by the shoulder, and turned me round twice; he would not let me go through the court; the man he had given the parcel to had gone up the court; I said if he did not let me alone I would tell my father; there was a whistle again, and he asked if it was all right; Goddard directly said to his companion, who was running,"Cut it, Dick; a nimble ninepence is better than a slow shilling;" they went on before me - I followed them into York-street, and into Church-street, again, and into Nicholl-street, where I met Gibbs, and told him they were gone into one of the houses there, but I did not know whether it was a public or private house - it might then be twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock; I went with Gibbs and one of the Bow-street conductors, to see if I could trace them through an alley which I thought they were gone into; we went to a public-house but saw nothing of them - this was on the same night; I went home to Turk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your usual hours of working at Gibbs'? A. Sometimes till ten or eleven o'clock; I was going to Gibbs' with the loaf - it was for him; he told me he had been over to Lanes while I followed the men, and after going to the public house I went and told Lane I knew the party, but did not tell him their names. I told him next morning that Needham was one; I have now come from the House of Correction, where I am for a misdemeanour, for leaving my master's work - he is Mr. Samuels, of Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you ever go by any other name? A. Yes - William Glover. I am a chance child, and do not know my father nor mother; they call me Stapleton, Smith, and Glover - I do not know my right name.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sent to the House of Correction for leaving you master's work, nothing more? A. And not taking all the stuff back again. The three men were together when I came up to them in the court; I said I would tell my father, because it would frighten him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who was your father? A. I do not know - he is dead; they tell me his name was Tipson, or something.</p>

            . I have known Gibbs seven or eight years, and have heard him say, within the last two years, that he would be revenged, as far as it was in his power, on the prisoner's father; I think it is much less than two years. I am a labourer at the East India House, and keep an evening school.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was this conversation? A. One evening, about two years ago, at the Flower Pot public-house, in Brick-lane - I saw Gibbs and the prisoner's father there; a trial had taken place in this Court; the parish had allowed some remuneration to the officers, and Goddard said Gibbs had taken some money which should have been his; he spoke rather strongly about it, and Gibbs said he would do for him some way or other. I would not believe Gibbs on his oath, for I have acted as an officer with him; his conduct was such the church-wardens would not allow him to be sworn in again; they objected to his character the year before, but some friends spoke for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would you not believe him on his oath? A. I have been with him when we have seen things at night, and in the morning his evidence before the Magistrate has been completely contradictory.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 140, Minories, and am a doctor of medicine—the officer Oliver was brought to my house on 28th may, about a quarter before 1 o'clock in the morning—he had five outs on his back, and three on his head, and several others, eleven or twelve in all—three of the wounds on the back I considered very serious—he was in a weak and fainting state, and was ordered to be put to bed—a knife like this produced would have inflicted those wounds.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here nod as follows:</hi>—I was the slave of a man of the name of Berto, at Lagos, in Africa, who took me on board a ship to work, and afterwards sold me to a white man of the name of Captain Capello. Captain Capello told me that he was, my master, because Berto had sold ma to him; I don't know how much he paid for me. I was more than a year in Captain Capello's service, but he never gave me any pay, nor did I ever sign or make any agreement as a seaman. Captain Capello brought me against my will in a ship to England, which ship was burnt at Yarmouth, in England; and I was brought to London, put on board another ship, and taken to Genoa, where Captain Capello wanted to sell me, but no one would buy me. I was then taken back to Africa, and brought again to England. When the ship arrived, I told Captain Capello that I would not go again to Genoa, and begged him to put me on board a man-of-war, that I might be free and learn English. He sent me on board the Hospital-ship, where I told one of my countrymen I was a slave. From this I was sent to a house on shore, where I met another of my countrymen, whom I told I would no longer be a slave, but work and get wages. After this, I was taken to another place, where I was made to work; but I told them I would not be a slave any longer; and I was told that if I worked they would give, me clothing and money, but they gave me nothing but food, and wanted me to go to some other place, and so many people were sent after me I thought they wanted to take me to burn me, so I shut myself up, and then got out of the window on to the top of the house. When I was seized I had a knife in my hand; and whatever I did it was in self-defence. I never intended to hurt any man. <hi rend="italic">"The above statement was taken through an interpreter, Miss. M. B. Servano, a native of Yorubah, and educated in England, and was handed by the prisoner as his defence."</hi>

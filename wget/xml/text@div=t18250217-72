The prisoner lodged in the house. My seven sovereigns were in a box, in my bed-room, where he and his brother slept. I saw them safe on Sunday, the 30th of January, and missed them on Wednesday night following: he still lodged there. Upon missing them, I went to the officer, who took him over at the public-house opposite. He was searched, but nothing found on him. While we were taking him, the pot-boy at the public-house said, he had bought a handkerchief of him, and produced it to my father-in-law: my sister afterwards claimed it. I charged him with taking my sovereigns - he denied it.</p>
               <p>ELIZA BROWN. My brother lost his sovereigns. The prisoner was taken up. I had not missed any thing; but my brother asked, if I had lost a handkerchief. I then searched, and missed one. My father-in-law brought it over from the public-house: the officer has got it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of February, about 20 minutes to eleven o'clock, I was applied to by the prosecutor, who said, he had lost seven sovereigns out of his box. I accompanied him to the Portland Arms public-house, Portland-town. The prisoner was there asleep, in company with two more men. I tapped him on the shoulder, and his companion said, "Bill, here is your master wants you." I said, "I want to speak to you, my good lad." He was unwilling to come. I sat down by him, and said, I had a charge of felony against him; he said, he would not go, and resisted. I handcuffed him: he struck me a violent blow. I took him over to Dodsworth, and Mr. Dodsworth came over with a handkerchief, which he gave me. Eliza Brown searched her box, and said, she had lost one: she described it before she saw it. I think he was intoxicated.</p>

            . I am the pot-boy. I bought a handkerchief, on the 2d of February, of the prisoner, and gave it to Dodsworth that night when he was taken. I am sure I gave him the same as I bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>ELIZA BROWN. I saw it in the officer's hands that night: it is mine. There is some dirt in the middle; my brother had worn it round his neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said, at the office, that there had always been somebody in the house, from Sunday till Wednesday. I can prove, the house was left for three hours on Monday. He came to me in prison, and said, he had strong suspicions of another person. I can prove, I had liberty to go to Eliza's room whenever I pleased, whether she was in bed or not. She lent me a handkerchief, but this is my own.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I did not then know the house had been left, but find it had. I did not suspect any other person. I told him. I did not wish to prosecute; he said, the way I could get off was, by saying I had strong suspicion of other people.</p>
               <p>ELIZA BROWN. I have lent his brother a handkerchief, but not him.</p>

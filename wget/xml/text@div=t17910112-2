               <p>How soon did you see the prisoner again after this accidental meeting? - The next day.</p>

               <p>You have had no conversation at all with the prisoner? - No; I saw him in gaol this morning, and just spoke to him; I was here last night, and did not see him; but the prisoner knew I was here, because my master sent word to the prisoner that I was come to speak what I knew.</p>
               <p>Not one of this company was you at all acquainted with? - Not one, to my knowledge; I suppose there might be twenty or thirty round; my master knows the prisoner by using his shop, but I did not know him; I only came from on board ship last Christmas holidays; before that I lived at Stratford, at one Mr. Balcher's; I had been seven months on board ship: I had not betted at all myself; the prosecutor was there about a quarter of an hour before he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120008"></xptr>offered to lay: I went in this morning to see if I knew the prisoner, and finding I did, I came out again.</p>

               <p>Did you ever point out the two men in drab coats? - No, I pointed to the man in the blue jacket.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say to Mr. Dawson, or any body else, that the two men in the drab coats had first got the watch, and then gave it to the man in the blue jacket? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see the two men in the drab coats? - Yes, I saw several run; but the whole of my pursuit was after the man in the blue jacket; I had no notice of the apprehension of the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120009"></xptr>You do not remember speaking to Dawson? - No, I do not; he might speak to me; several did.</p>
               <p>Dawson. Ask him if he did not describe one of the men in the drab great-coats to have lost an eye? - Yes, I did; but not to this gentleman, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What did you say about him? - I described the man in the drab coat, and that he had lost his left eye, who ran away at the same time that the other ran with the blue jacket, but I gave no information against any man in a drab coat, only that he ran away at the same time.</p>

               <p>I live at the Guy, Earl of Warwick, in Gray's-inn-lane; I have known the prisoner about 12 months; he has been a <rs id="t17910112-2-deflabel12" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>What is his business? - He was a porter.</p>
               <p>What sort of a porter? - I do not know; he was a porter to a house in Middle-row, No. 9; he always used my house.</p>
               <p>What business is it? - I do not know what business it is, the house is shut up now.</p>
               <p>Jury. The corner of the court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is a lottery-office? - When it was opened, it was a leather-dresser's, but the prisoner was porter there since.</p>
               <p>Then what business was carried on since? - I cannot tell; it might be a lottery-office: he was a very honest man; he always behaved so in my sight, at my house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two more witnesses to his character.</p>

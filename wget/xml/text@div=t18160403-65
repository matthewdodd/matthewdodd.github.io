            . In the evening of the 26th of March last, I went out between the hours of seven and eight o'clock, leaving nobody at home. I locked the door; the back door was fast, and bolted with two bolts; the windows were also all fast when I left the house; I left no one at home. I returned again between nine and ten o'clock, I can't speak exactly to the hour. My husband returned first. When we examined the house, we found the drawers were open and things gone.</p>

               <p>MARY HART. On the 26th of March in the evening, I passed the prosecutor's house, near the hour of ten, and saw the front door in the court open. Mrs. Homan gave me a light, and I went into the house; the back door was wide open also; I did not examine the locks; the back door was wide open. I went up one pair of stairs, and saw the the door of a press bedstead open; I dont know whether there was any thing taken from that; I shut the bedstead door; the up stairs drawers were wide open. There is only one room on a floor. The drawers were wide open, and completely empty. The bed was tumbled, and the bolster, and pillows, were gone; the sheets were gone, and the blankets laid on the floor at the foot of bed, as if they had been thrown off. I fetched Mr Fgg, the publican, who also saw the state of the house. I then went and told Mr. and Mrs. Davis what had happened; she was at her mother's close by.</p>

            . I heard that my house had been opened at about half past nine, a young woman of the name of Hart informed me; she found me in a public-house. When I went, I found that my house had been opened, and the drawers were empty, and all the things gone; there was a mark by the lock of the door, as if a chissel had been used to force the lock back. The next time I heard of any of my property was when a man had them on his arm; that was in the afternoon; but I can't tell what time, because I was in a hurry to run to see my property; he had two pair of sheets, three napkins, and a waistcoat of mine; it was Joseph Emanuel; Mr. Gleed, the constable, was with me. Emanuel was in Mr. Cutler's house in Rag-fair.</p>

I immediately sent home to my brother-in-law, to acquaint him that I had detained some of his property. Joseph Emanuel said, don't be afraid that I want to run away, leave me in the care of your friends, and go and get a constable, and go round into Petticoat-lane, and there you find Joseph Myers. I left him with my friends, and the property likewise, and he made no attempt whatever to get away.</p>

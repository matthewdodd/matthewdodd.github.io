                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Collingwood &amp; Sons, of 46, Conduit Street, and I was so in 1872—Mr. Collingwood and myself principally attend to the business in the shop—it is part of my duty as articles of jewellery come from the manufacturer to put the mark on them before they go into stock, and we keep a record of that mark in our books—on the 25th January, 1872, three diamond half-hoop rings came into stock, manufactured by Messrs. Pallisier, of Brewer Street; they were marked 2,082-3, and 4—on 6th February we received a necklace which was marked 627, value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 20th February we received two telescope pen and pencil cases, with a ring at the end, they were both marked 343, and the price wholesale was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—on 2nd March, 1872, stock was taken, and the five-stone half-hoop ring, 2,083, value 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the necklace, 627, and one of the pencil-cases, 343, were missing—the other pencil-case, 343, was still in stock, and that was ultimately sold to Lady Majoribanks on 24th May—the prisoner had been a customer of my master's from about the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Collingwood has a son, but he scarcely ever serves in the shop—he might do so once in six months—I have known him do so—there were two other assistants besides myself, one named Barford and the other Searle, who was a clerk; he never served, but Barford did occasionally, if we were busy—he is dead—whoever sold, an account of the sale would be entered in a book which is kept on the counter in the shop—the entry would be made after the completion of the sale—I identify this five-stone diamond ring by the mark, the initials of the man who made the ring, and the appearance of the ring altogether, and being a facsimile to the other two rings which I have in stock—there is no peculiarity about it—I tried it with a very powerful glass, and I think I made out a portion of the mark, but it is a very difficult thing to do—I recognise the chain by my mark, which has been scratched on the snap-Mrs. Gosling was not a customer; I never saw her in the shop until August—she addressed Mr. Collingwood first—I went with the detective to the defendant's father, who is a clergyman, living in the rectory-house, and I believe at the time she was dressing to go down to dinner—she said she wished to keep it from her father—she said "Pray don't let my father know anything about it"—that was after the questions were put to her—I did not suggest before that that she should send for her father or her friends—she came to us in the butler's pantry—Butcher said he was an officer, and had a warrant for her arrest—I am quite sure the chain was</p>

               <p>in her jewel case—there might have been a pin-cushion there which opened, but the chain was not there—when the application was made for the warrant it was refused on the first occasion—I have a list here of all the property that we lost in 1871 and 1872—there is no suggestion there of the loss of any watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was a reward of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after the stock-taking, in 1872—the value of the articles in this list is something like 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were all missed in 1871 and 1872, during the time Mrs. Fitzgerald was a customer at our shop, and we have missed nothing since—we were downstairs at the rectory, and sent a message that some one wished to see her—she came down; no pressure was put upon her to answer the questions—the warrant was refused at first because there was no information from Mrs. Gosling as to the purchase of the pencil<lb></lb>case.</p>

I carry on business at 46, Conduit Street, as Collingwood and Sons, and have done so for fifty-six years—in the months of January, February, and March, 1872, Mr. Walters and myself were serving in the shop—Barford would also serve in the shop, but he was ill at that time, and was scarcely in the shop at all—I did not sell any of the three articles that the defendant is charged with stealing to her, or to anyone else—I saw Mrs. Gosling on the 21st August, when she came to the shop—I had some conversation with her, and she showed me a gold pencil-case—it was afterwards shown to Walters, and he identified it.</p>

I am the wife of Colonel Gosling, late of the 49th Regiment—he has now sold out—he is in very delicate health and unfit to be moved, and I have a certificate to that effect from Sir William Paget and Dr. Gull—we are at present residing at 47, St. George's Square, Pimlico—Mrs. Fitzgerald, is the wife of Major Fitzgerald, also of the 49th Regiment—my husband and he were quartered at Mhow in India, in 1872, and before that—I was in India from 1870, till April this year—Mrs. Fitzgerald came home in 1870, and went out again in 1872—she came out to Mhow again at the end of April, 1872—we had been on terms of great intimacy—she told me at the end of April, that she had brought some pencil cases out, and I could have one if I wished it—I said my husband's birthday was in a few days, and I wanted to give him one, so I bought one—this is the one that has been produced—she said it had cost six guineas, and I could have it for five—I left Mrs. Fitzgerald in India, when I returned in April, this year—in 1872 she showed me an empty setting of a ring, and said she had bought it of a lady for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had lost my own diamond ring, and of course there was a great search made for it; the inspector of police came up and Mrs. Fitzgerald said if I showed that to him it would be a guide to him, as the settings were similar—in July, this year, in consequence of a communication I received from India, from Major Fitzgerald, I went to Collingwood's shop after I had spoken to my husband, who was not in a condition of health to go himself—the 21st August was the last time I saw Mr. Collingwood—I think I first went at the very end of July, but I am not certain of that.</p>

Warwick &amp; Sons, and have been for a great many years—at the end of 1672, I received a package from Mrs. Fitzgerald from India, containing a chain, five loose diamonds, and a brooch without a pin—I had received a letter before the parcel came, and I also received this letter afterwards, in consequence of which I had the five stones set and a pin put to the brooch—I have seen the pin and ring since in the possession of Mrs. Gosling. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "December 13th. Sir,—Will you be good enough to have the fivestones I sent some time since set in a ring. I should like them set open, with tiny stones on each side, similar to mine. I wish it to look as good and handsome as possible. I suppose it will be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the size small I should think one that would fit my little finger. The brooch please to clean up, and put a good strong gold pin; also the chain to be sent back, and all enclosed in a registered box, and directed to T. W. Aubin, 49th Regt., Mhow. Don't send the bill, but enter the same to my account, as I shall probably require things in the course of the year, and will send a cheque."—There was a letter before that—this is it: "Nov. 15. I am writing a few hasty. Hues to catch this mail. I received your letter, and thought I could do any business transactions with you at your own house, but quite understand what you mention. I forgot to say the agent to whom the money is to be paid is Cox &amp; Co., the regimental agents. Will you pay it in to T. W. Aubin. I am quite sure you will always act and do anything to help me when I ask it I am so grieved to hear you have been so poorly. Don't trouble to answer this as I shall hear from Mr. Aubin when the money is paid in"—I have known Mrs. Fitzgerald a number of years—the box that was sent came to my private residence, and not to the shop—I destroyed the letter which accompanied it, but she wished to know on account of a friend of hers in India, what we could allow for the brooch, the five loose diamonds, and the chain which came in the box, and whatever the amount was it was to be placed to the account of Mr. Aubin, but she omitted to put the agents—I should have allowed about 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was an old-fashioned chain—all the articles were sent back to India.</p>

I knew him long before Major Fitagerald"—I thought it was a very extraordinary statement for a customer to make, and I have not mentioned it to anyone till now—one day I saw her, and she gave her orders very distinctly, and a day or two afterwards she said "Keally I don't know what it was I said to you, for my head has been so turned from the effects of the return of that Indian fever, that I don't know what I said to you."</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I live at Marlborough, and am one of the medical gentlemen at Marlborough College—I first became acquainted with Mrs. Fitzgerald about the 14th, 15th, or 16th March, 1870—at that time her two half brothers were students at the College—the younger one, Herbert Steele, was lying dangerously ill of scarlet fever—he brought it to the school, and she came for the purpose of nursing him—I saw her the day of her arrival, she looked so ill that I asked if she was well—she said she had come home from India to recruit, after suffering the most severe attack of Indian fever—she said she had constant headaches on the least exertion, and could not attend very well to things, and was apt to be somewhat confused and muddled—the elder boy was taken ill soon after her arrival at Marlborough, and she was constantly attending the two boys, especially the elder, of whom she was most intensely fond—she was most unremitting in her attentions to him, but he was not ill when she arrived—he sickened soon after her arrival, and then her sorrow and grief was increased to such a degree that I thought she would be ill—the elder boy died after four days' illness—she was then in such a state, that I thought she was on the verge of a very severe illness, but she kept up to nurse the younger boy, who survived his elder brother nearly a fortnight—the younger one died on 14th April, the elder on 22nd March—she sat up with the younger boy, and I frequently sat up with her, and I saw her both by day and night, and her state was then such as I have had to designate erectomania, which is a mental disease, analogous with pyromania and kleptomania, that means the concentration of all the powers upon one object—it may be an object of great esteem, great love, but that taking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187310270069"></xptr>
               <p>possession of the mind is as much a mental disease as kleptomania or pyromania, and other manias which I do not choose to mention—she went to the funeral, and afterwards on going to the inn where she was staying, she was found lying on the hearthrug, senseless, without a fire—she was got on to a sofa, and eveutually got to bed—I was sent for afterwards, and found her in a state of absolute prostration and delirium—I did not think at the first sight of her that she was actually in danger, because then the delirium under which she laboured had more the character of the delirium of mania than the delirium of disease: the delirium of mania is not a necessary fatal affection, but the delirium of disease is generally indicative of such a failing in the powers of life, that the prolongation of life is decreased—I continued to attend her from that time until 16th April—I was afraid she had disease of the brain; two things were open, one that she might lose her life, and the other her reason—I may explain that the delirium and the disease are two different things, but what struck me then was, that she might be suffering from a latent disease of the brain—she was delirious, as far as I can remember, four or five days, but on or about the third day of her delirium, most intense diphtheria set in; she could not swallow, and her neck was swollen—as she was getting a little better, she was so prostrate she could not get up, and her state of mind was most unsatisfactory; imagining that she was holding conversation with Charley, who was the eldest boy—on 16th April, she went to her brother at Weymouth—I had her under my direct eye for about a month, and the whole of these horrible events occurred within that space of time—when she left she still exhibited symptoms of that erectomania.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The shape which the delirium took Mrs. Fitzgerald led me to the conclusion that she had latent disease of the brain—one particular thing was the state of her pulse and the symptoms generally, and the knowledge that this Indian fever does affect the brain, because that is a well-known fact—I know Dr. Tuke very well by name—if there is any branch of human disease upon which it is more difficult to form an opinion, without doubt it is with reference to this disease of the mind—I did not see anything that led me to believe she was a kleptomaniac, but I know that persons in her state have become so—she sat up a good many nights with the two boys—she did not have an attack of scarlet fever—scarlet fever does not begin with delirium; Mrs. Fitzgerald's attacks did—my impression is that it was symptomatic of mental disease, aggravated by tremendous worry.</p>

I was in the 49th regiment—I am now residing at Plymouth—I left India in 1870—I knew Mrs. Fitzgerald there most intimately—I lived in the opposite bungalow—while I was there she suffered very severely from fever, more severely than any other lady in the regiment—it came at broken periods, and she was very weak after the attacks, and used to rally more than most people do in India—I noticed that she seemed childishly fond of jewellery—I noticed that the first night I made her acquaintance, which was in March, 1869.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Rev. John Steele, of Great Hawkesly Rectory—my husband, the prisoner's father, is in such a state of health as to be unable to be here to-day—when the prisoner came from India in 1870, she went to Marlborough for the purpose of nursing the two boys who died, and when she came back she was in a very sad state of mind and body—she was an entirely different woman after coming back from Marlborough—I believe she was in the habit of wandering about during a greater portion of the night—she went to Weymouth after attending the boys, and after that, in consequence of the state she was in, I went with her myself to Hastings—I was not able to go to my boys who were dying at Marlborough on account of my husband's health—the prisoner was a lady of strong feeling, and very much attached to the boys, especially to the eldest—she was in a very sad state at Hastings, at times I thought her mind was deranged, and I was led to that belief by the change in her manner and actions—my opinion was that she was a person who ought to be restrained, so much so, that I watched her constantly—that was in 1870—I think I was at Hastings with her a month, and from that time till she went to India she was always with me at the rectory—her husband came to her in 1871, and my husband was taken worse, and I did not see so much of her—she went back to India in 1872—her husband was with her a whole year at our house—during the whole of 1871, in my judgment it was necessary to watch her, and myself and my servants did so constantly.</p>

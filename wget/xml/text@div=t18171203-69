On Saturday, November 29th, the prisoner Reed pledged a gown at our house, which is about a quarter of a mile from Clement's-lane-there are no other pawnbrokers nearer than our house. He came alone, I lent him 4s. on it; Mrs. Bindon saw the gown the same night - He redeemed a hat which he had pledged before for 1s., at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you in the habit of taking such things in of boys - A. His redeeming another thing made me not question him. He pledged the gown in the name of

            . I live in Upper King-street, Bloomsbury. I know the prisoners, I used to play with them. About half-past ten o'clock on the Saturday before last, I saw Reed coming down Swan-yard, in the Strand, alone; he asked where I was going, I told him I was going home; he said he was going the market way, and would go as far as that with me. We met Jones with his sister's pye-stall; he asked me to take it home for him, which I did. When I came out I found him and Reed waiting for me; they asked me if I would mind a bundle for them; Jones spoke, Reed heard it; I said I did not much like it-before this Jones offered me 3d., and Reed 2d. I agreed to do it; they took me to the corner of Exeter-street, Catharine-street; Reed gave 
               <persName id="t18171203-69-person576">Jones</persName>
             a penny, and he, Jones, went to fetch the bundle - He was not gone above three minutes; they asked me to go and get them mangled in Vere-street; I went and got them mangled at a chandler's-shop; Reed waited at the door, and when they were done he gave me two-pence halfpenny to pay for them. He told me to carry them, they asked me to go to Mr. Carr's with them, which I did-Reed went in by himself; I was carrying the bundle, Reed opened it just before we got there, and took the gown out. Jones was standing by, Reed took it into Carr's; when he came out he told Jones he had got 4s.; Jones asked to see the ticket, he shewed it to him. He took a hat out of pledge at Carr's. I went with them to another pawnbroker's, in Bridges-street; Reed took the bundle from me there; we waited at the door until he came out; he then said he must go home; Reed told me to go and ask a woman at a greenshop to let me leave the bundle; I said, "What should I ask that for?" he said, "Never mind, go." I went and left it there. I afterwards went to the watch-house to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030033"></xptr>prisoners; Jones asked me to go and sell the bundle, I said I would not. Mousey, who was there, said if I would go and get the bundle he would sell it; he got it, and sold it in Baldwin's-gardens. When we got to the green-shop, I saw the contents of the bundle; there were some shifts, childrens' pinafores, and a child's plaid dress.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEAN. I apprehended the prisoners and a boy, named Wright, that night; Bindon was introduced to them about half an hour afterwards - We awoke him out of his sleep, and took him to the watch-house. I did not tell him what it was for, his father might have told him. I put the three together, and he pointed out the prisoners particularly, and said they were the two boys who knocked him down, and took his bundle from him. I asked him if he knew any thing of the other boy? he said, No - They denied it. When I apprehended Reed, I found a hat in his mother's house; he said it was not his, and that he knew nothing about it; he afterwards said he found it. I found four shillings and three-pence halfpenny on him, and the duplicate of another hat.</p>
               <p>REED. Q.Did I say where I found it - A. No. I told him I wanted him for a robbery, and if he would go to the watch-house he should be cleared if he was not the person.</p>

               <p>REED'S Defence. I was in Blackmoor-street, Jones came up and said Stevens had found a bundle, and he would take it to a fence (meaning the green-grocer's). The woman would not buy it; he then took it to be mangled. I said I would pledge the gown, as I was going to take the hat out. I gave Stevens the money; he said he would leave the other things at the shop until the morning. The officer took me while I was at supper - He fetched the little boy, and said he would do for us. The watch-house keeper kept kissing the boy, and asked him to say which were the boys.</p>

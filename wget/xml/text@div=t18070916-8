            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a <rs id="t18070916-8-viclabel41" type="occupation">publican</rs>

On the day of this indictment I had occasion to go to Mrs. Macarty's, she keeps <placeName id="t18070916-8-crimeloc42">the Bell public house, Ratcliffe-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. When you went into the house had you any property in your possession. - A. I had fifty-two guineas in gold in my left hand side coat pocket, and I had sixty pounds in bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a twenty pound, a ten pound, two two pounds, and a one pound bank note. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose had you that money in your pocket. - A. I was to pay my brewer the next day; the notes were in my left hand breeches pocket, and there was a letter from Boyle, a seaman, that lodged with the prisoner. As soon as I came into the house, Bell came into the house directly, and said the room would be vacant just now, and he would settle between him and me; there were some money accounts between him and me. We went into the private room and called for a pot of ale. Me and Boyle and another man were together then.</p>
               <p>Court. Not the prisoner. - A. No, he came in shortly after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in that room. - A. The best part of the night; I was going to come away at twelve o'clock at night; Boyle stopped me at the parlour door and said he would toss me for a bottle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160007"></xptr>wine; we tossed, there was a dispute in tossing, and Boyle called for two bottles of wine. When we had finished one bottle the prisoner came in the kitchen, and there were other persons there at the time; the prisoner remained a quarter of an hour, and had a glass or two with us.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they remain with you. - A. The prisoner called Boyle out between one and two o'clock in the morning (as I understood) to speak to him about some business; when they went away I had no one to keep me in conversation, I laid my hand to my head and went to sleep; I was alone during the time I slept.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. While the prisoner was there, and the other men remained with you, did you take your money out. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity of seeing where you put it. - A. Yes. I awoke between six and seven in the morning, I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had lost twenty four guineas and thirty-five pounds in notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was then in the place at the time you awoke. - A. Nobody but myself, only the maid servant sweeping the room.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the next day had the prisoner been drinking at your house. - A. He and Boyle had two pots of porter; the prisoner gave me a one pound note, I gave him change, and put the note in my pocket; as soon as the prisoner went out, Boyle said, be particular of that note, I know the prisoner had no money (the prisoner did not hear him say it.) I looked at the note I said I cannot swear to the number, I should soon recollect the indorsement; it was endorsed RAB; then it came to my recollection that it was one of the notes I had lost the night before. On the second day after I received the one pound note from the prisoner, I went to the prisoner's apartment; the landlady and Burke shewed me his box, I asked him to let me search his box, he replied that he had got none of my money; I told him if he would not let me search, I would send for an officer; in consequence of that he let me search it, and underneath the new clothes there was taken out a purse; I told him if there was not a Queen Ann's guinea, 1713, with a dent on the edge of it, I would lay no claim to the money. The landlady examined the purse and found the guinea in it, in the presence of the prisoner in the purse there was twenty three pounds, chiefly in guineas, and all in gold. I found no notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered these new clothes and money did you ask the prisoner how he came in possession of them - A. I did; he gave no answer. This is the one pound note, it is marked A R B; that is the note he gave me in payment for his porter. On the day of the second examination, before the examination, he said he would make restitution for the rest of the money. I have got a watch and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not find them upon the prisoner. - A. I found the handkerchief in his pocket; this pocket book and that card I found in the prisoner's hat, he confessed that he bought the watch with my money; I went to the shop, and here is the gentleman's hand writing that he changed a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am a Spaniard by birth; I served in his Majesty's navy thirteen years; I was discharged from the Superb. Since then I served in the Invincible of Deptford. The prosecutor alledges the money to be lost at a public house where I lodged; I was with him on the Tuesday evening, where he gave me change of a one pound note; he did not assert that it was the one that he lost untill three days after, when he could have found me on any day or hour at that house. It is not probable that I robbed him, and called at his house and changed the money that he lost; I had money of my own also, I had seventeen pounds prize money, and nine doubloons I brought home with me, which I saved up during the time I was abroad. Under all these circumstances, I trust you will acquit me; and at the time he charged me with the robbery, the prosecutor said if I would give him all my clothes and watch, he would not prosecute me, or else he would hang me. I am innocent of the charge; here is a letter that will shew where I received the money.</p>

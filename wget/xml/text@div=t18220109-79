I was going to the door, and fell into a fit. I had a watch about me; when I came to myself, I missed it. On Saturday morning, I was ill in bed. I came down in the afternoon, and heard her blaming every body in the room for stealing my watch; she accused the landlord and landlady of it. I said I would give 5 l. to any body to get it back. I said if it was not brought back, I would be severe, as it was a family watch. She trembled, and then went to the privy. I suspected her, and went backwards, as soon as she returned. I found my seals in the privy; but have not found the watch. I found her in the tap-room, and held them up and said,</p>
               <p>"There are the seals." She said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind; I shall only have a twelvemonth and a day." I had her taken; she said then she was innocent; but was an accessary.</p>

            . I keep the public-house; the prosecutor lodged with me; he had a fit - the prisoner and several others were surrounding him. When he came to himself, he missed his watch; this was Thursday. On Saturday the prisoner came to the house, she said to me,</p>
               <p>"I am accused of taking his watch." I said,</p>
               <p>"Nobody accuses you; go about your business." She kept abusing us; and charged Collins with taking the watch, and handing it to me. She came again in the evening, and accused every one in the tap-room of it. She went to the privy; the prosecutor went after her, and found the seals; he then charged her with it; she burst into tears, and said it would only be twelve months and a day.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 26th September, signed by Mr. Commissioner Goulburn, stating that the said Court sat at the time and place mentioned, from 11 to 3 o'clock, to receive the surrender of the said bankrupt to pass his last examination, but the said bankrupt did not surrender himself</hi>)—I know of my own knowledge that the Commissioner did sit—I procured his signature imme<lb></lb>diately after; I proclaimed the bankrupt on that day; this is the London'Gazetle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is dated Friday, 23d August, last—it contains an advertisement requiring him to surrender on these dates—I inserted it immediately after the adjudication—I gave one of our men named Freeman, who went in possession, a duplicate of the adjudication, and he served it by posting it up—I examined the document with others—they are always in triplicate, three adjudications are always made out—I made out the summonses to surrender, myself.</p>

               <p>property into the safe—on that Saturday night I was sent by Mr. Smith to Billingsgate for some fish; I left him at the shop, and no one else; when I returned to the shop, the goods were all cleared out of the window and put into the safe, according to the usual custom—Mr. Predicaux used generally to have the key of the safe, and I had the key of the shop door—I left at half-past eight that night—I went again on Monday morning; I did not see the prisoner afterwards—when the safe was opened on the Monday, and the things came to be looked at, some of them were found to have been taken away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the indictment must fail, inasmuch as the statute upon which it was founded, the 12 and 13 Vic c. 106, had been repealed by 23 and 24 Vic. c 134; and the only arguable point in favour of the indictment would be, whether section 230 of the later Act continued the offence under the former Act, and prevented the repeal taking effect; for there were numerous cases which established that if an Act of Parliament was repealed, the offences contained in it fell to the ground; this same question had arisen in every Bankruptcy Act that had been passed; it arose when 6 Geo. 4 repealed 5 Geo. 4, and again, when that was repealed by 12 and 13 Vic. (Lord Brougham's Act). The learned counsel referred to the cases of Reg v. Swan and Reg v. Nairn, reported in 4 Cox's Criminal Cases, pages 108 and 115, also in the 31st vol. of the Sessions Papers, pages 227 and 279. The <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> inquired, whether in those Acts there was any section at all equivalent to the 230th section of the present Act. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> replied, that the words were almost identical with those used in 12 and 13 Vic.; if the 230th section had stated, that the offences committed under the former Act should still be offences prosecutable by law, his argument would fall to the ground, but it was confined to "proceedings pending;" the word "penalty" might be relied upon on the other side, but in the cases quoted, the word "penalty," which was used in 12 and 13 Vic, was held to refer to pecuniary penalty, and not to penalty of imprisonment or penal servitude; it could not, therefore, be contended that there was any word in the present Act which preserved the offence, or entailed upon the prisoner the possibility of a conviction of it; for though the penalties were preserved and the proceedings kept alive, the offences were not mentioned, and according to the authorities the offences must be preserved in the clearest and most express terms before a conviction could take place.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">the words were most general, and he submitted must receive a general construction, and a construction even which went to fix upon a person a crime, which clearly was a crime at the time the Act passed; then would arise the question whether a warrant, duly granted upon a sworn information, was a proceeding pending, and whether there was an act done or a penalty incurred? the act done was the non-surrender—that act was done on 26th September, and the offence was then complete—then was there a penalty incurred, what was the meaning of the word "penalty?" strictly speaking, perhaps, it had no legal definition, but that it was not confined to pecuniary matters was evident from the common expression of the "penalty of death," the highest punishment known to the law; it was defined by Locke, in a note to the word in Johnson's Dictionary, as a "judicial punishment" and if it was sought to restrict the meaning of the word to pecuniary penalties, some authority jor such restriction should be produced; it appeared to him that those who drew this Act of Parliament intended, by the use of large and general words, to include both civil and criminal proceedings; as the question was one of considerable im<lb></lb>portance, if any substantial doubt existed on the subject, it might be reserved for the Court of Criminal Appeal.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TINDAL ATKINSON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on the same side, urged that the word "penalty" must be taken in its largest sense, as it was still preserved, notwithstanding the offence itself was by the new Act reduced from a felony to misdemeanour.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was heard in reply: he inquired, if "penalty" applied to imprisonment and punishment for an offence committed under this Act; whether that offence was a felony or a misdemeanour? but for the reservation, the former Act was repealed; that Act made the offence a felony, by the present Act it was a misdemeanour; yet it was contended that notwithstanding the offence of felony was taken amay, the offence was continued because the penalty remained; that tended to show that if it preserved anything connected with it, it ought to have kept alive the offence eo nomire.</hi> (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">They are bound to prove a felony; unless it is a felony you have an acquittal.) How did they show this to be a felony? they urged that the penalty for a certain thing was kept alive; he contended that the offence was not kept alive, because the words "shall be deemed a felony" were swept away, and if the penalty remained, there was no power which preserved the right of indicting for this offence. In the Criminal Law Consolidation Act, passed contemporaneously with this, not only were the offences preserved, but the power to try and determine was all to continue as before; here there was no such thing; and supposing "penalty" meant, as was contended, the power of transporting, as well as of inflicting a fine, where was the power to indict or sentence, or what was to be the mode of getting at the parties; he submitted that all that was preserved was the penalty in respect of any matter or thing done; there were no words that were equivalent to an offence, or which showed that it was intended to keep alive criminal proceedings.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">"I must say that I am very much impressed by the last point put by Mr. Metealfe; I am inclined to think that the penalties are pre<lb></lb>served and continued, but I am doubtful whether the offence of felony is continued; and it is necessary for the prosecution to show that a felony has been committed; upon that point I entertain so much doubt that I feel disposed to reserve it, as a similar question may occur in other cases."</hi>

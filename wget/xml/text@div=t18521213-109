On the 2nd of Dec, I was on duty in the Strand; about half past 12 o'clock I saw the prisoners coming together from Hungerford-street—I knew them, and followed them to White Hart-street, Drury-lane; they went into a public house there—when they came out I went in—I then continued to follow the prisoners; they went to the farther end of White Hart-street—I then missed Kemp—the woman remained at the top of the street—I saw a constable, and I told him her character, and in a few minutes Kemp appeared again—he put his hand in his right hand coat pocket, and as he drew his hand out again I took hold of it—I took a small piece of paper from his hand; I asked him what it was—Sullivan came up to me, and tried to get his hand away from me—she said, "What are you about with the man—let him alone"—I took the paper out of his hand, and in it were five counterfeit shillings—I took him in custody—he said he had picked the shillings up—Sullivan was taken in custody at the same time—when she was at the station, she said, "If they had been good we would have had a drop of rum"—I asked her what she meant—she said,</p>

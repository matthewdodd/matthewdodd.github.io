I came home a little after six o'clock on the 8th of February, and as I was knocking at the door I looked at the shutters, and perceived that they were closed. They were not fastened. The shop was shut. I then went down into the kitchen; the family was alarmed by a noise at the parlour window. By the alarm that was given, I ran up stairs. I opened the parlour door myself, and saw the parlour shutters open. The window was open, and the glass-case was gone. That glass-case stood within the window, and it is near a foot longer than the window is wide. When it stands within the window, the window is shut. The glass-case was gone, together with its contents. I am sure the window was open when we came up into the room. At about a quarter of an hour after that I saw the glass-case again, together with the contents, at the prisoner's dwelling, Mr. Upton, an officer who took him, was there, and Mr. Avery, another officer.</p>

I did not go up at all, but Mr. Appleby's daughter followed him. I recollected that I had shut the window that evening, and I heard a noise as if it were thrown up. The glass case was always kept withinside the window.</p>

             shut that window. I had noticed the window and the shutters that afternoon. I went into the room about ten minutes before I heard the noise. The window was shut, and the window shutters were shut, and the glass case was there quite safe. I was alarmed by the noise about ten minutes after that. The family were all sitting below in the kitchen. My brother was at the top of the house in the shop.

            . I am a Police officer. I remember the 8th of February. I was in company with my brother officer Avery. It was about ten minutes before seven o'clock. I met the prisoner in Lamb's court. I had gone there to watch his motions. I knew him. I had not been in the court above two minutes before the prisoner with this case. I asked him what he had got there, and he said a case. I asked him where he got it from, and he said he stopped a boy with it in Chequer-square. I asked him then what watch-house he had put the boy in. With that he said, that when he came up to the boy, he threw the case down and made his escape. I then told the prisoner by his name, that that account would not satisfy me. With that he said,"Upton, you know me; I am an officer;" and he shewed me his staff. I believe he was a head-borough, or constable. With that, I told him I must take him into custody. He told me not to handle him as if he was a thief. I told him I should, as I suspected he was one. Upon that he begged to go up stairs. This was close to his own door. I searched him, and found a few old halfpence on his person, and a knife. There were twenty pairs of scissars in the case, and fourteen knives. There were also cards of address of the prosecutor. These cards were in the glass-case. He asked, should he send for his brother officer, and and I told him he might do as he pleased. It was then moon-light.</p>

            . I am on the Bow-street Police establishment. All I have heard of Upton's testimony is true. Then we took the prisoner up stairs, and before, when he said the boy threw the glass case down and ran off, I asked him if he cried out, Stop thief! and he said, 'to be sure he did!' I put the question a second time, and he again said, to be sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140053"></xptr>he did. To satisfy his friend, I put it in his presence, and when we enquired, we learned that no such cry existed that evening. I found out the prosecutor's by the cards in this case. The prosecutor saw the property, and stated that it was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. I know there is 40l. reward in this case. I know that that reward rests with the jury, whether they find the prisoner guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, an old thief would have taken away any direction - A. So I should think, if he had an opportunity of doing it. I have been an officer fifteen years.</p>

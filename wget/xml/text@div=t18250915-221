I went after him, and saw him standing up; I said, "Why don't you come forward and show your face?" he came out - I went in and pulled the trousers up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever see the trousers in his possession? No. I was not suspected myself. Mr. Hart sent for an officer at my suggestion. I do not know how many quarrels I had with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL HENRY HART. I am a slopseller, the prisoner was my <rs id="t18250915-221-deflabel1177" type="occupation">shopman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18250915-221-defend1151 t18250915-221-deflabel1177"></join> two years. On the morning of the 11th of July, I missed a pair of trousers from a glass case; there was a jacket there, and another pair of trousers were put in the place of those which were taken. I called Southam, the prisoner, and the servant girl, and said "Here is the old work going on again, and I am determined to discover who is the person;" they all denied knowing you thing of them. Southam proposed to have an officer to have them all searched; the prisoner then went to the other shop at Shadwell. I said, "We will have an officer," I went for him, and sent the servant to fetch the prisoner back. When I returned, Southam stated, that the prisoner asked where I was gone, and the moment he told him he ran into the yard, and Southam found the trousers, in the prisoner's presence, down the necessary; the prisoner cried, and said, "O my father." I think these trousers are mine, but my servant can speak more positively.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any mark on them? A. No; the prisoner was with me two or three years - he was sometimes at my other shop - I considered that he had a good character - my apprentice had absconded long before this - I had not a very good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>HENRY SOUTHAM re-examined. Q. Did Mr. Hart swear to this property at the office? A. I believe he did, but I was out of the office at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had them ever since? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, did you put this mark upon them? A. No, I did not.</p>

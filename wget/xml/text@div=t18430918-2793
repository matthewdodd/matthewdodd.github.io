On Saturday evening, the 2nd of Sept., between eight and nine o'clock, I had charge of a police-gal<lb></lb>ley at Battersea-bridge—I saw a boat with the two prisoners in it, rowing fast—I saw something bulky in the boat, under the fore-part, and in the state-room—I asked Hough what he had in the boat—he said a quarter of wheat which was going on board the <hi rend="italic">Phœnix</hi> barge—I asked if he had any bill with it—he said he had not—I asked if the captain knew it was going on board—he said he did—Captain Sparrey is the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Phœnix</hi>—I gave the prisoner in charge of my men, and went on board the <hi rend="italic">Phœnix</hi>—after having seen the captain I asked Hough the name of the foreman—he said Mr. Bradley—I asked if he knew of its coming away—he said yes—I allowed them to put the wheat on board the <hi rend="italic">Phœnix</hi>—I took Hough with me to the Queen Charlotte public-house, and asked Bradley, in his presence, if he knew any thing of the quarter of wheat going away—he said no—I said, "If the quarter of wheat had gone away, would you have known it it?"—he said, "Yes"—Hough said it was a quarter of wheat for Mr. Barnes, who owns the <hi rend="italic">Phœnix</hi>—I took him into custody, and got the sacks from the <hi rend="italic">Phœnix</hi>—I took this key from Short.</p>

            . I live at Chelsea. On the 4th of November I spent my evening in town. I took a coach from the corner of York-Street, between one and two o'clock to go home, I told the coachman to drive me into <placeName id="t17741207-35-crimeloc159">Chelsea</placeName>

I cannot go quite to my own door at so late an hour: immediately as I got out of the coach I asked him his fare, he said five shillings; I told him it was only two, but I would, as it was so late give him three shillings. I stood under the lamp to see that I gave him right: I offered him three shillings, he would not take it: scarcely were the words out of my mouth, before the prisoner jumped out of the boot of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070024"></xptr> the coach, whom I never saw before, and laid hold of my collar; the coachman knocked me down, and he took my watch from me: I looked extremely hard at him, and had a strong idea of his person: in consequence of that, I went early on Saturday morning, the 5th of November to Sir

               <p>Question. What sort of a light was it where you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Dicker. It was between one and two, I had no light, but the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Question. Was that light sufficient to enable you to discern the face of a man?</p>
               <p>Dicker. Yes.</p>
               <p>Question. Do you swear to his face?</p>
               <p>Dicker. Yes I do.</p>
               <p>Question. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Dicker. Much as he is now, but he had a remarkable large black hat on.</p>

               <p>Question from the prisoner. Was you in liquor or sober?</p>
               <p>Dicker. I was no more in liquor that any person that had been spending an evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you a little in liquor?</p>
               <p>Dicker. No, I was not, I was equally as sober as I am at this instant, and as capable of judging of any thing that passed.</p>
               <p>Question. And you do take upon you to swear that is the man?</p>

            . I have watered the horses for the coachmen, at Charles-street, Covent-garden fifteen years. Mr. Dicker got into a coach, the corner of the street in Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Question. What day are you speaking of?</p>
               <p>Pope. Friday night, about half after one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Question. Was that the 5th of November?</p>
               <p>Pope. Yes.</p>
               <p>Question. Do you know Mr. Dicker?</p>
               <p>Pope. This is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Question. What is Mr. Dicker?</p>
               <p>Pope. I don't know, the boy that drove the coach came back in about three minutes; he stopped at the Bunch of Grapes in Charles-street, Covent-garden, and knocked at the door. I told the gentleman that they were all gone to bed. From there he ordered him to drive to the Fountain Tavern, Catherine-street; when they came there, one with a link, called Raggy, and another, one Murphy: they heard the orders: they jumped up upon the box, and ran away with the boy's coach, and did not bring it till four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Question. What boy is it; is that the coachman?</p>
               <p>Pope. A very little boy.</p>
               <p>Question. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pope. Yes, he was not there that night; after the play broke up, when they came back, they gave him two shillings, and said they had been with a gentleman to Chelsea. When this prosecutor apprehended this man; I was not come to work. I told Raggy of it on Saturday night, and Murphy: Murphy is gone out of the way ever since: Raggy is now in Tottlefields Bridewell for breaking the windows of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070025"></xptr> the gentleman's house that Colby was hanged for breaking open; and that they are the men that robbed the gentleman, I will assure you.</p>
               <p>Question. That you cannot know?</p>
               <p>Pope. They drove the coach away.</p>
               <p>Question. You say, a gentleman took the coach?</p>
               <p>Pope. Yes, it was between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Question. Where did Raggy and Murphy get upon the coach?</p>
               <p>Pope. At the Fountain Tavern; they drove away the coach, and left the boy behind, with the gentleman in the coach.</p>
               <p>Question to Mr. Dicker. Were there two persons that drove you to Chelsea?</p>
               <p>Dicker. I saw but one.</p>

               <p>Dicker. I took it in York-street.</p>
               <p>Question. What house had you been at?</p>
               <p>Dicker. At the Chequers, at Charing-Cross.</p>
               <p>Question. How came you to go to Covent-garden to go to Chelsea?</p>

            . I am the brother of this unfortunate man. I went to this gentleman's, Mr. Dicker's house, on Monday: the servant maid told me, he was not at home: I asked her in regard to the affair. She said, that her master came home between two and three in the morning very much in liquor, and all over dirt; that he had lost his wig. I went again next morning, a quarter before nine to him: I said, I find you have swore absolutely to my brother: he said no, he had sworn no otherwise than to the best of his knowledge, nor would swear any more at the Old Bailey. I said, I hope, as you are so resolute upon this, you will take it into consideration, and be sure before you do pretend to swear. Says he, I have not swore certain; nor I will only swear to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Question to Dicker. Did any such conversation pass between you and that man?</p>
               <p>Dicker. I heard, by my servant, that this man had been there before; and very well she might tell him I was dirty; I was knocked down, and of course must be very dirty, and lost my wig: it was brought home by my neighbour next morning: I lost it on the spot I was knocked down upon. This man came to me at the time my barber was shaving me: I said, sit down, I will speak to you presently. What is your business? said he, I came on account of an unfortunate brother of mine: I hope you will be as favourable as possible. Said I, I certainly shall be: I just told him the state<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070026"></xptr> of the case. Now, said I, what could you do? That was what passed between us.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you ever say you was doubtful of the Person of the man?</p>
               <p>Dicker. No, not in the least; I was always certain to him, though I did not positively swear to him before Sir

               <p>Question. What was the reason?</p>
               <p>Dicker. He was going to be examined again; he said, he would bring a person, so very like himself, that I should not know one from the other.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you see that person?</p>
               <p>Dicker. Yes, and they were not at all alike.</p>

            . I drive a hackney coach. I have known the prisoner three years; I never heard any harm of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Question to Pope. Pray, who was the coachman, you say took this gentleman up?</p>
               <p>Pope. A lad took him in; I don't know his name.</p>

               <p>Silk. The prisoner was at my house at half after ten o'clock; he bought a candle, and was going home to bed.</p>

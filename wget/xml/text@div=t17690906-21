The prisoner came to me on a Monday in July; I think he had been at my house on the Wednesday night before: he knocked at my door and spoke bad English. I said, Speak German. He pulled out one of my cards, and said, Is this yours? I said, Yes. Said he, I came out of the city from a merchant who sent me to you. I said, What gentleman? He mentioned one. I said I did not know this gentleman. He said the gentleman gave his compliments to me, and would take it as a favour if I would get him a place, or employ him till I got him one. I told him I could not take a man in where there was such a great trust till I knew something of him, and I had not the honour of knowing the gentleman he mentioned. I told him, if he would bring me a letter, with some account of his character and behaviour, I would employ him, if I found he would do for me. He said it would be charity to employ him. He looked very pitiful. He told me he could not bring a letter that night, for the gentleman was at Hackney, at his country seat; but he could bring it the next day. I told him I had business that required me to be out of town; but he might leave it with my wife, and call on me on the Wednesday, and I would give him an answer. A note came, and my wife gave it me. I think it was with the name of Cousmaker, or some such name. I believe he came again on the Wednesday, when I told him I would employ him. He seemed to be exceeding thankful, and said it was very good of me. I asked him where his things were; he said they were at the gentleman's country house, and it would be very late before he could come. He came in late that night with a box, it was quite dark; it must be nine o'clock or more. I saw him come, and asked him what made him come so late, he was all in a sweat. He said it was so far, he could not come before. He pitched the box in the court; I told him to carry it up stairs. I meant to lay him with the cook, but the cook made an objection, gave him up his bed, and went home to lie with his wife. The prisoner was shewed up, and he carried his box into the cook's room. It appeared that the box was full of something, but after the robbery I went and looked in the box, and there was nothing in it. There was a trunk carried up stairs, and a silver hilted sword lay upon the outside of it, with a bag of things, in which was a green waistcoat trimmed with gold, which I shall give some account of hereafter. On the Sunday I had some company, when the prisoner came to me and complained of my servants, that they were very lazy, and gave away my victuals. I did not like him, and told him that on the morrow he should go about his business. I then went to walk in the Park, and when I came home there was a silver spoon missing: having lost one before, I said I would not lose another, without making a through search. I looked about my house, but I could not find my spoon. About a quarter after nine, I asked where the prisoner was; I was told he had not been seen since dinner.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060014"></xptr> Presently I heard my wife call out, Here he is! Here he is! I said, Where is he? She said, He is gone into such a parlour. Then he said, Do you want me? As soon as I came to him, I replied, What do you want here, you rascal? He appeared to me as though his breeches were down. I pushed him out; got him towards the kitchen, and said, Why do you run about my house in this manner? Pull your breeches up. I then said, What have you got there? seeing some shifts. He replied, These are my sister's. I answered, Why did you not make a bundle of them, and go off like an honest man. I am a very honest man, said he. I then took him into my kitchen, and told my cook to take care of him. I said, Come, and make him strip. My cook said, I cannot, I am frighted out of my wits to see such a rogue. He had nine shirts on, besides several shifts. We were obliged to pull them over his head, and the green waistcoat laced with gold, which I had before mentioned. He endeavoured to throw out what he could from his pockets. I said to the people by, Take a pen and ink, and we will make a proper inventory, which I have here, (producing a long list of rich things) of the things which were found upon him. He begged for God's sake I would let him go, as I had got all the things. I said I should look upon myself to be as great a villain as you to let you go. The things were kept in a garret, and the key locked in a bureau. I found the door broke open, and the lock of the Duke D'Eon's trunk broke. The silver hilt of the sword I found broke from the blade in the lining of the prisoner's coat, and the silver hook of the scabbard. The waistcoat and sword are the property of the Duke D'Eon's secretary, which were left at my house under my care. When I came to look in my store room, I found some crimson silk damask missing. The gold fringe, with several other things which I found in the prisoner's breeches, was my property: he had crammed them so full, that he could not keep them up. Here are four witnesses in court that saw me take the things from him. I took him to the watch-house, with the assistance of a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman took the things from me himself.</p>
               <p>The jury thought it needless to examine any other witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

               <p>I had not a shirt to my back, and the master of the house was for turning me out of the house the next day. There was a servant that was well known in the house; he went up with me to my room, and gave me these things to take care of them. I did not know what, or how much there was. He was what they called a foreigner. I did not know his name, nor where to find him. He used to frequent the house. I was drunk, and the man told me to put the shirts and shifts on. I did not know what the fringe was till the master of the house took it out of my breeches.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. These people used to keep the house and let lodgings, it is a kind of house for two-penny lodgings, and when I had no money, this was a place that was always open, as the neighbours told me; it is a lower place like a kind of shed, and when I had no money, I used to go and lay in there, and when I had money, I paid for my bed; I went to lay there, and this man laid hold of me; I have not got a friend in the world.</p>

I went to the White-horse, and there I saw the prisoner and Piggot, and some other people. I asked the prisoner how he came to be guilty of such a beastly action; he said he was in liquor, and did not know what he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor?</p>
               <p>Henley. He did not appear to be so. I bid them stay till I acquainted Mrs. Lovell, whom the ass belonged to, of it, and had her opinion, (Mrs. Lovell is very ancient, and I manage her business) the prisoner said, For God's sake, let me make it up. I went and told Mrs. Lovell, my mistress; she said, the man must suffer the law: the prisoner desired to go in to speak to her, but I would not let him, as she had before desired me not to let her see him: he said he would give me any thing to make it up; I said he should go before a magistrate; I accordingly took him before the justice.</p>

             the brick-maker near Knight's-bridge. My brother and I were going from Knight's-bridge to Chelsea about ten in the morning; we went down a lane that is called <placeName id="t17701024-38-crimeloc178">Yeoman's Row</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where was he with the ass?</p>
               <p>Pigott. It was in a little shed, where they give the asses hay; the shed is tiled at the top; the front part is open, the back part is pailed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off was the brick kiln that you stood upon?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Forty, or fifty, or a hundred yards; the brick kiln fronts the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the ass stand?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Her head was to the manager; she had a foal by her side; she was in the farther corner of the shed, that I could see him sideways.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you positive that you really saw him in her?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Yes, he was in her; when I first went up, he was shoving at her as a man might be at a woman: I stood a minute or two till he withdrew, and then it was he turned about and saw us.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after he came to take his pails, that you took him?</p>
               <p>Pigott. About a quarter of an hour; he got off then; we took his pails to a public house, the Cow and Calves; the prisoner came there in about a quarter of an hour; he had been home and changed his cloaths; he had a red cap and hat on when we pursued him; when he came into the Cow and Calves he said, Pray was there not a man frightened away from the cow-house that was milking a she ass? I said you are the man that b - d the ass; he said, No, I am a man in credit; I have a wife and family; I said, You are the man; I said I would carry the pails home, and know if he was not the man that fetch'd the yeast; he said, No, he would rather carry them himself. We left him with the pails in the house; he took up the pails and was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240018"></xptr> towards the Bell at Brompton; he set out with a run; we ran across and met him; he put down his pails and wanted us to go into a house to drink; he said, You don't think it is me; I said I am sure you are the man; he still denied it; I said at last, I insist upon your going to Mr. Healey's; whilst I went to Mr. Healey's, my brother and another man came with the prisoner to Knight's-bridge; he put down his pails, and said he hoped we would not take him to Mr. Healey's; he said it was his brother, and he was very much like him; he offered me half a crown or half a guinea to let him go; when we had got a little farther, he said, Don't take any notice of it, I am the man, I was in liquor; he confessed the same when he was at Mr. Healey's; he said he would sooner give ten pounds than it should be known. I kept him in charge whilst my brother fetched Mr. Healey.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Between nine and ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cap had he on?</p>
               <p>Pigott. A red cap.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cloaths?</p>
               <p>Pigott. She same coat he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say the man had a great coat on?</p>
               <p>Pigott. It was long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you describe it as a great coat?</p>
               <p>Pigott. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare that you was not certain who the man was?</p>
               <p>Pigott. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. He came into the Cow and Calves himself?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Yes; he had changed his cloaths; he first said it was a man he employed, afterwards he said it was his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first came into the Cow and Calves, did you charge him with being the man?</p>
               <p>Pigott. I did not at first, but I did before he went out of the house. I met him going for yeast about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . My brother and I were going into Mr. Scott's field up this lane, between nine and ten o'clock; I can't speak to half an hour; we work for Mr. Scott; we were going to fetch our tools to go to work at Paddington; we saw the pails; we went to seek for the man; my brother got upon the kiln before me; he called to me, and said, There he is; he is - a woman standing; he turned round, then my brother said, d - n him, he is b - g one of the she-asses; almost as soon as we got up he drew out of the ass, he took the tail of his shirt and wiped his -.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is the kiln from the place where the ass was?</p>
               <p>Piggot. A hundred yards more or less; my brother saw him draw it out, I did not: the ass fell back in his lap.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the ass stand to you upon the kiln?</p>
               <p>Piggot. The ass stood partly sideways; as soon as he had got off and wiped himself, he saw my brother and I getting down off the kiln; he buttoned his breeches and ran over the field going to Knightsbridge; we lost him at that time, we saw him afterwards creeping under the hedge, he was, I suppose, coming for his pails of yeast.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Piggot. In a long coat, a red cap, and a flapped hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Piggot. Yes, as he was coming up under the hedge. I knew him again, my father came up and we pursued him then, but could not catch him; my brother took the pails up to the Cow and Calves; after we had been there about a quarter of an hour he came in, in another dress, and said where is the pails of yeast you frightened my man away from? My brother said, I believe you are the man, and I am sure you are the man, He said, no, indeed I am not the man, it was my man, he was milking the ass and you frightened him away; I shall be obliged to you to let me have the pails of yeast: with a great deal of persuasion we, let him have the pails, and agreed to meet him at Knights-bridge; we drank our beer up, and went up the field; we saw him take up the pails and run; we ran too and met him at the end of the lane; he set down his pails and went in to drink at the Bunch of Grapes; my brother said, I am sure you are the man; he said, indeed I am not, my man that you frightened away is gone to London; we said, we were sure he was the man; we went and fetched

               <p>Q. Have you taken pains to find him out?</p>
               <p>Langley. My sister has asked after him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to dress himself?</p>
               <p>Langley. He was going to London upon business.</p>

               <p>Langley. The cloaths he has on now.</p>

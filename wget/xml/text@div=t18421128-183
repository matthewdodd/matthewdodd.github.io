                  </hi>. I am a furnishing undertaker, and live in Sebbon-street. The prisoner has been in my employ for two years. On Wednesday, the 16th of Nov., I missed a brooch with some hair and eighteen diamonds in it, from a trunk in my room—I had seen it safe on the Sunday morning before—on that Sunday morning I had sent to the prisoner nine cloaks and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184211280135"></xptr>
               <p>bands, and nine scarf's and hoods, and three men for furnishing a funeral which he had at Deptford—I asked the prisoner if he had seen anything of the brooch—he said he had not—on the following Saturday his mother died—he came to me for the coffin, and on the following Tuesday he came and told me he knew where the brooch was—he took me to Mr. Tyler, a Jew, in Holy well-street—Tyler told me the brooch was at Bow-street, he had not got it—I saw it on Wednesday—this is it—it is mine.</p>

I am a watch-maker, and live in Holy well-street. On the 18th of Nov. the prisoner came to my shop about two o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—he asked if I would purchase this brooch—he had a fustian jacket on—from his appearance, and knowing it to be a valuable brooch, I hesitated, and told him to come back in half-an-hour, and perhaps I would buy it—he re<lb></lb>turned—I said, How much do you want?"—he said, "6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was left me by my mother; it is an old brooch, and has been in the family many years"—that he had a brother living in my neighbourhood—I knew his brother, and said I would go with him to him—he was living in Drury-court—he went with me, and endeavoured to whisper something in his brother's ear—I said to his brother, "Do you know anything of a valuable diamond brooch that has been in your family some years?"—he said, "No"—the prisoner said, "You re<lb></lb>member my telling you about a brooch that a man gave me to sell for him?" I said, "Then you now admit it is not yours?"—he said, "No, a man gave it me to sell"—I said, "I shall keep it till the man comes"—I took it home—the prisoner came with me—he afterwards came to my shop with the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, and said, "I hare brought the gentleman that belongs to the brooch"—the prosecutor claimed it—I said, "Very well, but we will go to Bow-street; did you give it to this man to sell?"—he said, "I would not sell it on any account"—I took him to Bow-street, and appointed to meet him the next day. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you not appointed to attend the next day, and did not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner came to my house first, and asked me to come—I was cleaning myself to go—it struck me at first that he had stolen it—I thought he would not bring the owner—if he had not, it would not have been mine, for I had been to Bow-street and given information—I knew where to find him—I am a jeweler—in my judgment this brooch is worth 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I keep an open shop—the prisoner told me on Friday, the 18th, that he had been offered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in pawn for the brooch—I knew his brother to be a respect<lb></lb>able tradesman. <hi rend="smallCaps">

I keep the Mason's Arms beer-house, Park Crescent, Clapham—on Monday, 30th March, about 4.45 I was awoke by the police ringing the bell—I went down and found the top sash of the bar parlour window pulled down, which I had fastened the night before, the shutter was pulled down and a pane of glass broken, next the catch—I had left about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers, and some 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces in some bowls, that was all gone—I also missed a shooting coat and a handkerchief in the pocket of it, also a razor and case from a shelf in the wash-house—the</p>

About 4.30 on this Monday, I was passing Crescent Row—I noticed that the prosecutor's window was broken and open—I called him up and found the premises as he has just stated—about 2 o'clock on that morning I had seen the prisoner in High Street, Clapham. 600 or 700 yards from the prosecutor's house, and going in that direction—about 12.30 on the Sunday evening, I went to a stable in Nelson's Row—I afterwards heard the prisoner say that he had slept there.</p>

She turned into Leadenhall-street; I stopped looking at her, and saw her turn into Leadenhall-market; I did not go after her, but put my hand to my pocket and missed my purse; I then went after her, but could not find her; I told the watchman; I went down to Lime-street, and met with her in Lime-street with a cloak under her arm, which she had on before; I stopped her and said she had robbed me; she denied it. The watchman came up and took her; I saw her drop the purse when he took her; the silver was in it, but not the sovereign; I knew the purse to be mine; she had asked me for a shilling, but I gave her nothing.</p>

            . I am watchman of Lime-street. On the night of the 20th of March, about twelve o'clock, the prosecutor came to me by the private door of the India House; I saw the prisoner first, and then I saw the prosecutor go after her, and say "You are the one who robbed me." She denied it; I endeavoured to search her, and saw her throw the purse down; I picked it up, and asked the prosecutor what he had lost, he said a sovereign, and 18 s. or 19 s. in a green purse; I found 19 s. in silver in it, but no sovereign; he described the purse by a hole at the end of it; he appeared sober. When the constable searched her, a sovereign fell from her bosom without any paper; the prosecutor said his was wrapped in paper.</p>

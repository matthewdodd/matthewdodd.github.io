On the evening of the 17th of February I locked up the house a little after seven o'clock; I and my fellow servant, John Lees, were the last persons in the house; we left it together when I locked up; I slept in the house that night, and always sleep there; I returned a little after eight o'clock, and found the two prisoners in the counting-house; I found the door on the single lock; I had left it double locked; Plowman had a dark-lantern, and Smith was rummaging my master's desk; I instantly went out of the warehouse, and called out "Thieves!" I locked the street-door, and locked them in; I cannot say whether they had seen me; unfortunately I had taken the key out of the lock, and they came out at the door by means of a skeleton key; the watchmen and patrol were off duty, as they were then just changing, but Charles and Edward Hitchings came up at the time; I had secured Plowman, and they secured Smith; they had a scuffle at the end of the street, Smith turned back; I secured him also, and gave them both in charge of my neighbours and Benison, an officer, who came up; I found the warehouse dog dead a few hours after; he was well when I left the warehouse; we had given him his supper. I observed the prisoners' features distinctly through the window by the light of their dark-lantern, in the counting house, and could swear to them any where; they were taken to the watch-house, and then to the Compter; no property was taken away that I know of; I had left the desk locked; I had seen that it was locked; my master locked it; the papers were a good deal rummaged about - the dog was poisoned, the poison was found in his stomach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Are you speaking of the night or the morning of the 17th? A. The night: it is a large warehouse - there are rooms on the first floor - it is a dwelling-house two stories high - there are five distinct rooms - there is only one room below - the counting-house is parted off; the goods are kept in the warehouse on the ground floor; there are two rooms on the first floor, one is to store goods in, and the other a sleeping room - I sleep there, as Mr. Boyer's servant, and receive wages - he has no partner; I had not been out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050093"></xptr>warehouse before I left it at seven o'clock; the door is left open in the day time; Lees, Mr. Boyer, and the clerk, are there in the day time; Mr. Boyer and the clerk had left about an hour and a half or two hours - Lees remained with me till I fastened the premises - I had been working in the warehouse till then - I was in the counting-house the last thing, when I went to fasten up; I had just got in at the street door when I saw the prisoners in the counting-house - I looked through the counting-house window, which is just on the left hand, and saw them, and undertake to swear to them from the view I then had of them - they rushed out upon me, and I caught Plowman - Smith got by me; I just saw his back, and saw his face afterwards - I never lost sight of him; I gave Plowman to others to hold, and went after Smith - he came back towards me, and I knocked him down into the kennel; I was then ten or twelve yards from the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. At what hour did you leave the warehouse? A. A little after seven o'clock - I am certain it was seven - it was as dark as it usually is at that time - I could see a man's face in the street without a lamp: it was quite dark - not twilight; there was no light except what was from the gas-lamps.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I was in Old 'Change on the 17th of February, I think it was between eight and nine o'clock, but am not certain - I came down Carter-lane into Old 'Change, and had not passed Mr. Boyer's warehouse many yards, when I heard a cry of Thieves! and Murder! I said to my brother, "Let us go back" - I went back, and saw Tunnicliff, who said, "There are two thieves in the house - I have locked them in;" he had no sooner said so than I heard the noise of a key inside, the door burst open, and out came Plowman - Tunnicliff grasped him on the neck, and with the force he came out with, he reeled round to me: I had a tray in my hand - I struck him, he fell, and Tunnicliff on the top of him - I turned my head and saw Smith rushing forward - I took up my tray and tried to hit him, but he jumped over it, and ran to my left - my brother was then on the opposite side, I called to him, "Ned, here is the other going;" he and I pursued him - my brother overtook him, and got hold of him - I saw them struggling together, and I went to assist him; I am certain he seized the man I had first seen, for I had not lost sight of him; when I came up to them my brother slipped down, I caught hold of Smith and hit him with my tray, he leaned forward and got from me, and ran up the street towards the warehouse again; I got up as soon as I could, and run up the street - Tunnicliff put out his arm and caught hold of him - he resisted very much; my brother and others assisted, and the officer took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did the second man come out of the door at the same time as the other? A. Plowman came first and Smith after, close following each other, perhaps a yard and a half after each other - I just turned my head, and he came out; Plowman and Tunnicliff fell together - I think they falling at the time Smith came out - it was all in a minute; I did not turn so as to have my back to Smith, while I struck at him; I never lost sight of him till my brother got hold of him, which was fifteen or sixteen yards off, I will not swear to the time, it might be about nine o'clock; if I was quite close to him I might see his face, but not by the light of the heavens, without the gas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was it light or dark at seven o'clock? A. I should think it was quite dark; I saw Plowman quite plain; I said at Guildhall that I struck him, and was the means of his falling, I suppose.</p>

            . I was in Old 'Change with my brother, between eight and nine o'clock (I think), on the 17th of February - I heard a cry of Watch! my brother said "We will go back" - I said "You had better not;" but we did go back, and Tunnicliff said, "There are two thieves in the house;" my brother said, "Well, you stand hard, and I will give him a crack with my tray;" he stood behind Tunnicliff, and I stood in front of the door - I saw Plowman rush out - I could see his face distinctly by the gaslight on the opposite side - I do not think the twilight was sufficient to enable me to see his face - he fell at my feet in the kennel, and Tunnicliff upon him - Smith rushed out at the instant, and my brother struck at him - he jumped over the tray, and I ran after him; I caught him about twelve yards off - he ran in a slant direction across the street; when I stopped him, he stood back, and asked what I wanted with him; I said I would let him know - he gave me several blows, and was going to return - we closed, and I caught hold of his collar; we both stumbled, as it was icy, and I lost my hold. I never lost sight of him; he then ran back towards the warehouse, near the place he started from, and just as I got hold of him again, Tunnicliff held out his arm, and stopped him; there was blows between them - another witness and the officer came up, and two or three others were round him - he made great resistance, but was secured.</p>

Yes; I had no watch; I looked at the clock when I got home to Friday-street, it was then ten minutes past seven o'clock. I do not know whether it was twilight or dark: it was dark; there are large piles of cheese and butter in the warehouse; a man could not easily hide himself behind them. Mr. Boyer lives in Nelson-square himself, but his dwelling premises are in Old 'Change. I never knew him sleep there; persons could not slip in and hide themselves in the day-time; there was a large dog chained inside the door, and there are always people in the warehouse; the dog was alive and well when I left - I gave him some meat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you examine the premises before you left? A. Yes; I went all round with a candle; I found nobody there.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to TUNNICLIFF. Q. How long have you slept there? A. About ten months; Mr. Boyer never slept there; I do not cook there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you get your meals there? A. Sometimes; there is convenience for cooking, but I never use it. I was there to protect the property and premises; the bed-room is on the first floor; I sleep there; there is a fire place and stove in the bed-room. I dine on the premises once or twice a week.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was passing along Fish-street, and turning into Old 'Change, I heard a cry of Fire! or Thieves! which induced me to run up to see what was the matter; a man caught me in his arms, and gave me in charge, without saying on what grounds. I was taken to the watch-house, but no property, except my own, was found; nor was any thing suspicious found near me. Do you suppose if I was the man, after making my escape, I should return to the spot? as to the person being positive of my identity, after losing sight of the man, I leave to your judgment; I was frequently passing in Old 'Change on business. I have not the slightest knowledge of Plowman. I solemnly protest my innocence of being the man who escaped.</p>
               <p>PLOWMAN's Defence. What has been sworn against me I positively disavow; I know nothing of the prisoner or witness - I was passing the Old 'Change, and standing against the wall when I heard the cry, and saw three or four men rush by me; one man struck me on the shins, and knocked me down; as to the men who came out of the house, I declare I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave Smith a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I formerly kept a tobacconist's shop in the Old Kent-road, and now reside at 8, Horatio-terrace, Old Kent-road—the prisoner was one of my customers about fifteen months ago—I used to ask him into my back room to smoke his cigar—on one occasion I fetched my cash-box down stairs—it contained a chain, rings, pins, and different things, which I showed to the prisoner; whilst doing this, my attention was called to the shop—I was away about five minutes—the prisoner remained—some time after he had gone I proceeded to put away the things I had shown him, and then I missed a chain—I did not see the chain after that—the prisoner came the-next day—he used to come in and out every day—I told him I had lost a chain, and he dared me to accuse Him of stealing it—he took up a ginger-beer bottle, and said he would knock my brains out—I said, "I do not accuse you; it is gone, and it is very strange"—I have seen the chain since—the prisoner has been in custody at Mr. Wilmer's—he keeps a jeweller's shop in the Old Kent-road—the chain I saw there is my chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been head-master of St. Mary's National School thirty years—it is under Government inspection—there is one assistant-master and four pupil teachers—the prisoner was the senior pupil teacher—the rules of the school are out of print—I have a copy of them, in a cupboard—there is nothing in them about corporal punishment—with incorrigible boys, the head-master has the case submitted to him by the pupil-teacher, he would consult me or he would administer with a little switch or cane any slight punishment—the prisoner was in his fifth year of apprenticeship; he had the power to use the cane, and I have asked him occasionally to be gentle—that was not in consequence of anything that I had heard—I never authorised him to box the boys' ears—it has come to my knowledge occasionally that he has done so and I advised him not to do so again, and to bear more patiently with his pupils, but they were very obstreperous.</p>

I went to one of them, the Black-moor's-head in Germain-street; the woman there said, she had lived with her about a month or five weeks, but that she was not there then. I sat in the coach, and a boy came to me and said, a person wanted me at the Feathers at the top of the street, I ordered the coach there, there was a great mob, a girl came out and said, madam, she is here, and your servant has got her; I went into the tap-room, being lame and sat down, there was Mrs. Ferne, the mistress of the house, who said the girl was here, swearing a great oath, she knew she was a thief, and had taxed her with it last night; the prisoner was up stairs, I went up to her, with the footman, and another man, I said, so, Kitty, how came you to do so? she answered, O, madam, I have done it, and it cannot be help'd; or to that purpose. There was our foul cloaths-bag in the room by her, with a number of things in it that belong to Mrs. Carr. I said, where are all the things that you have taken? she said, they are here, in the bag. I went with her and the constable, and the bag, in the coach to Mr. Cox's, the things were examined there directly; there were several pieces of lace, a pair of laced ruffles, a cloak lined with beaver, a black bonnet, a white sattin cloak, two Dresden aprons, two pair of round robbins laced, a pair of stockings, these all belong to Mrs. Carr. (Produced in court.) I found also a striped lutestring gown, a cotton gown, a laced handkerchief, a pair of muslin ruffles, and four pieces of lace, my property. (Produced in court.) We not finding all the things that we missed, the Justice asked her what she had done with them; she said she gave them to Mrs. Ferne over night for her to take care of, and that the prisoner Ward had bought a riding-shirt of her for 4 s. and that Ward made her give her the 4 s. again, but never gave her back the shirt; there was no shirt found there.</p>

They said Ward was not there, and that she was married, and they did not know her husband's name this was in my hearing: we did not meet with her, we returned again to the Justice.

I went in, and stood in the middle of the tap-room, and imagined I heard the girl's voice; I said to him, she is in that room, I wish you will go and see. He did not seem to move, I said, I'll go myself; then he pushed by me, and got into the room, and shut the door.

She put down a tub she had in her hand, and went into the room; I went to go in, but she pushed the door too, and kept me out. I then called for a pint of beer, nobody brought it, I was almost certain she was in the room; I kept my eye upon the street door, and went for the constable, who was at a little distance; he came, I told him she was there, I had heard her voice; the constable went into the house with me, he went into the back yard to see if he could see her, then that room door was set open with four or five men in it. The constable then told me he had information she was at the Black Horse in the Hay-market. I went there, the man told me he knew no such person. I went back again through Germain-street, and saw Mr. Ferne on the other side of the street; I went to him, and said, are you sure this girl is not in your house, I am almost sure I heard her? he said, she was not there, and he did not know her if he met her.

             come out of the alley with a red cloak and black bonnet on. I said to Mr. Ferne, that is the girl; I jumped after her, and into the room where I heard her, and set down by her, and said the house-keeper was very angry with her for staying out all night. I wanted to send a messenger for the constable and Mrs. Gittoes, but the people of the house would not give liberty to the waiter, or any way assist me in it, they were at the Blackmoor's-head; with much ado I sent them word, they came, I saw the bag and two bundles of things with the prisoner. I told her I was sorry for her; she said I had no occasion to be sorry, it was nothing to me; and if my mistress was a considerate woman she would let her go, as there were all the things again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rose, the constable, confirmed that of the securing the prisoner Thomas, and seeing the bag and two bundles with her, and finding the shirt at Leedham's.</p>

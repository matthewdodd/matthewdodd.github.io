            . I saw my notes safe about a week before Monday se'nnight; they were in a tin box, locked up in another box, which I kept in my bed-room. I missed five 5 l., and, I think, three 1 l. notes, but I am certain of two. I cannot tell when I lost them. I saw the prisoner in custody the day after she left her place; one of my 5 l. notes was found in her possession - I know it to be mine.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday, the 12th, and found a 5 l. note, No. 19087, three 1 l. notes, and some silver on her. I charged her with robbing Mrs. Woodfall. She went up stairs to be searched by some women, came down again, and at the lock-up place she said she hoped Mr. Rogers would not be hard with her, and that she could not tell what she was about - that was all she said to me. I found some things at her lodgings, which she said she bought with the notes. I took the prisoner at Mr. King's. I produce the note.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOODFALL. I know my notes were following numbers. I produce one that was left in my box, it is 19088 - the notes that were lost were following numbers below this, I am sure of it.</p>

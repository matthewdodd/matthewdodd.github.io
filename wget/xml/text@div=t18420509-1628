                  </hi>. I am a glass dealer and live in Tavistock-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner had been apprenticed to me as a glass cutter—he has been with me seven years and five months—about nine o'clock on the 13th of May, in consequence of suspicion, I went to my workshop and looked over a bench where the prisoner in general worked—I found a coat tied up in a handkerchief with some hard substance in it—I called the prisoner in about half an hour, and told him to go and fetch the bundle and bring it to me—he did so, and began to cry directly and to make a noise—I took him to the station, and gave up the bundle to the policeman—it was opened in my presence, and these two pint decanters were found in it—I had not given him any leave to take them away—they were kept on a shelf in the workshop six or seven feet high—it was the prisoner's coat—he had asked leave to take it out to be mended.</p>

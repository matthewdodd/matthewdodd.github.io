                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, carrying on business at Enfield. By the direction of the Corner of the Duchy of Lancaster, I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>motem</hi> examination of the body of Martha Hobbs—that was about seventy<lb></lb>two hours after her death—she had evident marks of <hi rend="italic">psoriasis</hi>, which is a scaly disease of the skin—it is sometimes called scaly tetter—on examining the brain I found recent inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">pia mater</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arachnoid</hi> mem<lb></lb>brane—there was a gelatinous deposit in the convolutions of the brain, which appeared like serum and lymph together—the substance of the brain was flat<lb></lb>ulent—the brain was very much congested, which was particularly seen in the medullary structure of the brain—it was more particularly marked there—there were adhesions—I think there was no mark of chronic disease—there was a small portion of fluid at the base of the brain—there were no marks of disease on the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi>—there was inflammation of the internal lining of the <hi rend="italic">pericardium</hi>—that was also recent—I think the congestion of the brain was brought on from the transfer of the chronic disease of the skin to the serous membranes of which I have spoken—it leads to the chronic disease of the skin being transformed into an acute disease of those membranes, which very soon ended in death—in my option, the cause of death was acute disease, brought on by the transfer of the constitutional chronic disease of the skin to the in<lb></lb>ternal membranes and organs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would, or would not that transfer be accelerated by the continued ap<lb></lb>plication of cold in the shape of wet sheets, and wet cloths to the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The continued application of cold, by acting on the blood-vessels of the skins, causing a contraction of them, and thereby driving the blood from the surface of the body to the internal organs, considerably facilitates the transfer of such diseased action—I found the body in an <hi rend="italic">anemial</hi> or bloodless condition—that remark more especially applies to the external appearance of the body—the cutaneous vessels, which are very numerous on the <hi rend="italic">derma</hi>, commonly giving to the human character that flesh colour, were entirely empty—the constitu<lb></lb>tional disease of the skin which I witnessed, and the poverty of system, by which I mean poorness of blood, and which, in all probability, had existed for a considerable time, would have induced me to adopt a different line of prac<lb></lb>tice—there was decided poverty of system and poorness of blood—the sto<lb></lb>mach was empty of food, and the colon, which is the organ usually conveying the feces, had no particle of feces in it—that state of the body would render warmth necessary, and cold I consider would be prejudicial—in a case of acute inflammation I possibly might have bled in the onset, to have unloaded the vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you have the goodness to tell us whether or not, in your judg<lb></lb>ment, the application of cold water cloths to the head, and wet sheets to the body, supposing them to have been applied, did or did not cause the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that the cold application caused the death of the patient—I cannot say that it did not—I cannot, as a medical man, say that it did—under such a state of body as the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination indicated I think such applications would accelerate the death—the application of cold long conti<lb></lb>nued to the surface of the body would most unquestionably increase conges<lb></lb>tion of the brain, or produce it; hence the practice of putting the body in a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010040"></xptr>
               <p>warm bath, and applying ice to the head itself during the time the body is so placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the application of cold to the head you did not include in your former statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—if cold was applied to the head whilst the body was in warm water, that would have a tendency to counteract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing wet sheets to be placed round the body, and cold wet cloths applied to the head at the same time, what should you say then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I certainly think the practice injudicious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But would it, or not, if applied to a person suffering under this cuta<lb></lb>neous disease, accelerate death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If no reaction took place, it would un<lb></lb>questionably, in consequence of the application of cold on the surface of the body, and I think the emptiness of the blood-vessels on the surface of the body, show that reaction had not taken place—in consequence of there being a law in the animal economy to transfer disease from the surface of the body to the interior, from natural causes in that body, it is impossible for me to say what degree of power I must allow to that natural cause and what degree of power to the cold, therefore it is impossible for me to say that cold killed the individual—I cannot distinguish the one from the other, and I have the authority of John Hunter for saying that we cannot arrive at it.</p>

               <p>Segley. I observed her to go into a house, I followed her in, and insisted on the landlord assisting me, but he pulled me out of his house; then I went home; the next morning I got a warrant and constable and searched the house; the people of the house denied her being there; but at last we found her under a bed in a dark room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her hand in your pocke when you lost your watch?</p>

               <p>I never saw the prosecutor in my life before I was coming from my day's work at Long-Acre. I had been a scouring I lodge at one Carrol's in Drury-lane. I met this man with a girl; she left him; then he said to me I want to speak with you. I said, what do you want? he said no harm; he took up my cloaths; I said, what do you want? then he wanted to put his hand to my breast, after that he said he had lost his watch, then he stripped me as naked as ever I was in the world; I had neither shoe, stocking, cap or shift left on.</p>

She said come down the court. I went with her; she asked me to give her something to d, I said I should give her nothing; she held me fast; I don't know that I chang'd five-words with her; I never pull'd one rag of her cloaths off. After I charg'd her with taking my watch, the people of that house came out, then she strip'd herself; but she had time enough to give the watch to some of them before that; then a man brought out a candle, I could see her face plain, and she was not out of my sight before, so I knew her again.</p>

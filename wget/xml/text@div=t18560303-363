                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 130). I was on duty at Stepney, on 11th Feb.—I heard some footsteps at a quarter before 1 o'clock in the morning—I went to the yard of Mr. Berridge—I saw a hand on the water closet door—I went and saw Bush and Powell in the water closet—I asked them what they were doing—they said they were doing nothing, only going then to sleep—I found in the water closet about a bushel of flour, and a show glass, and there was a bag lying on the floor—I saw Powell drop this hand-kerchief, which contained some pastry—I apprehended them, and searched the premises—I found outside the premises a jar of jam, and two candle-sticks were in the adjoining yard—they had been put through where the fence was broken away—I went into the house, and roused the inmates—the kitchen window and kitchen door were open—there were two squares of glass broken in the kitchen window, and paper had been pasted over them—they had been burst, and a hand could then be put in and open the window—I found Lambert concealed under the counter in the shop—I had seen the three prisoners that night—they had passed me at 11 o'clock it night, in front of the house—they were all three in company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pastrycook, and live at Stepney. I was called up by the last witness, at a quarter before 1 o'clock that morning—I went down, and found the place was open—it was all fast when I went to rest—the door was fastened with two bolts and a latch, and a large baking plate was laid against the door, to alarm me if any one moved—the glass of the window had been broken twelve months, and brown paper was pasted over it, and boards laid against them—the paper was whole the night before—if a hand was put through that paper they could open the window, and a boy could get through—Lambert knew my preraises—he has cleaned my shop, but I had not had him to do anything for the last three or four months—this bag is my mealman's property, but it was on my premises—the flour, and pastry, and candlesticks were mine, and the jam was mine.</p>

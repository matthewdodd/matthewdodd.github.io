               <p>Q. After you had apprehended the last prisoner did you go to the house of the prisoner - A. Yes; he lived about an hundred yards from the distillery. The constable knocked at the door and demanded the key of his corn bin. I desired the constable to ask for the key of the corn bin. While we were waiting at the door, which I thought a considerable time, I heard a noise as if bottles were being removed. I thought I heard a bottle break. When we got in I desired the constable to search the house, and in one cupboard he found four quart bottles full of gin; in another cupboard he found three bottles, two of gin and one of rum. The constable then proceeded to search the bed. At the bolster of the bed the constable found two bottles of gin. The constable desired the wife to get out of bed. She got out. He discovered six more bottles in different parts of the bed. We took the prisoner to the distillery, and placed the bottles before him. He said he must confess that he was an old rogue, and that they were his masters property. The constable had the key of his corn bin. He opened the corn bin. We found one bottle nearly full of gin. We told him of it afterwards; he said that he had taken a bottle for his own drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you whether your servants have the liberty of taking gin for their own drinking - A. None whatever. I have examined the whole of it; I believe it to be our property.</p>
               <p>Q. You give your servants a bottle of spirits at Christmas I believe - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Chamberlain gave me a bottle of gin at Christmas, and these were the savings of three Christmas's.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did he tell you then that they were the savings of three Christmas's - A. Yes, he did. I can confute him; the four bottles of gin that were given to him by Mr. Chamberlain were cordial sweetened gin; this is not the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bottles are here - A. Eleven. We never give our men any of this description.</p>

I was on duty by the Pigeons, in the Romford-road, about a mile from Mr. Maxwell's, and ✗ Keys drive the wagon into the Pigeons yard—it was drawn by three horses—Granby was standing by the tap-door—he and Keys had some conversation—they went into the house, and were there ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour—they came out, and conversed again for two or three minutes—Granby then took something from his pocket and gave it to Keys—they both went to the wagon—Keys got a sack off the fore-ladder, and Granby took it up—he saw me, and ran very fast into the public-house—I called him out, and told him I must take him into custody—the sack had chaff and peas in it—the prisoners asked me if I would look over it—I told them I could not.</p>

On 18th July I was out of place—on that night I met the prisoners in Fleet-street, about half past 11 o'clock—I remained walking with them, and went to different public houses—I should think I was with them two hours or more—after I had been with them some time I missed Jones—I then put my hand into my pocket, and missed my watch—I asked Johnson where the other girl was gone—she said she would be back in a minute—I said, "I have lost my watch," and I tried to get after Jones—Johnson stopped me, and took my arm—the policeman came up, I left Johnson with him, and I went after Jones—I found her, and took hold of her—I accused her of taking my watch—she struggled and fell down, and I fell down too—I had had</p>

I was called, and found the pro-secutor and Jones—I looked in the gutter, and found this watch close to the kerb where they both fell—it might have fallen from the prosecutor's pocket—they struggled very hard together—I heard him call out, "Hoy! hoy!"—I found the watch, and my brother officer took Jones.</p>

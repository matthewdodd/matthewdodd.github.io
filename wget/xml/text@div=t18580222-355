                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of No. 4, Wandsworth Road. On Tuesday, 26th Jan., about ten minutes to 5 o'clock, the prisoner came, with a younger woman—I served the prisoner with a piece of pork, which came to 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me a bad half crown; I bit it, marked it in two places, and gave it to her back—I asked her how she came by it; she said that she received it from her husband—she gave me a good half crown, and I gave her the change—they both left together; I followed them about a hundred yards; they stopped at the corner of the turning to Vauxhall Bridge, just by the turnpike, where the prisoner put something down a grating at the side of the road, and forced it down with her feet—it had been freezing—I after<lb></lb>wards pointed out that grating to Letty—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the half crown; it has my marks on it.</p>

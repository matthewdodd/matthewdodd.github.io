               <p>JOHN WALTER WALKER. I live at Park-house, Turnham-green, Middlesex. On the evening of the 5th of February I was walking with my wife, in <placeName id="t18310217-205-crimeloc1219">Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you had considerable difficulty in saying that it was the one you had lost? A. Yes, as it had been so short a time in my possession, I could not conscientiously swear to it; I stated so to the Magistrate in the first place - the officer had been examined then; he then added that he saw the man take it from my pocket, having before said he found it - I said I could not swear to it, and the Magistrate was about to discharge the prisoner; the officer then said there was no occasion to discharge him, for he saw him take it from my pocket - the officer had not been examined first; I know Dowding was sworn - I do not know whether Groom was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were not aware your handkerchief was lost till your attention was called to it; you then missed it, and before the Magistrate you expressed considerable doubt about it? A. No; I said I could tell it by a stain which I recognized, and I pointed out that stain, but I said I would not swear to it.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Rose-street, Long-acre, and am a constable. A little after seven o'clock in the evening, on the 5th of February, I was in Drury-lane, near Long-acre; I saw the prosecutor walking with a lady, and I saw the prisoner, whom I had not known before, in company with another person - i saw the prisoner touch the gentleman's pocket several times, and at last he put his hand into his right-hand coat pocket, and took out a silk hankderchief; he ran across towards Groom, and I called to him to stop him - the prisoner threw the handkerchief into the road; I took it up, and told the prosecutor he had lost his handkerchief - he identified it as his property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He knew it at once? A. Yes, he had no doubt of its being his property; he identified it both to me, and at the office - he pointed out a stain, and swore he had no doubt of it, but the fact is, the gentleman did not wish to prosecute, as there was so much trouble attending it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, which is the truth - did he swear to it or did he not? A. He did swear to it to the best of my knowledge, and I believe that was taken down; I think I was examined after the prosecutor - I saw the prisoner make two or three attempts at the prosecutor's pocket; I was across the road - I saw him for five minutes; I am an officer - I am serving in my own right this year; I served for five years as a substitute - I am a tailor; it all helps to bring in a crust to support my family - I am both a master and a journeyman tailor; I work as journeyman for Mr. Stringer, in Long-acre; I generally get about 10l. for acting as a subsitute - I had a good many cases here last year, but I only had my expences in one case at one Session.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the evening of the 5th of February I was in Drury-lane; I saw the prisoner, and another person with him, following a lady and this gentleman - Dowding called out "Groom;" and I saw the prisoner running from the lady and gentleman with a handkerchief in his hand - he dropped the handkerchief, and I told Dowding to take it up, and to run after the lady and gentleman; I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you show the gentleman the handkerchief, and did he say it was his? A. Yes, he had no doubt of it; and at the office he said it was one he had borrowed of a friend - I am in no business; I did not see any more persons about the place but the prisoner and his companion; I had known the prisoner before - his clothes had no pockets - I am sure the prosecutor said he had no doubt it wasthe same handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have the same clothes on now; I have pockets in them.</p>

            ? - A. No; her mother lodged with me; the girl came to her, to complain of the prisoner having threatened to shoot her, and behaved improperly to her, and of what he had attempted; I said, it was proper she should come away; her mother asked me to go with them to her place, which I did; when we went it was ten o'clock at night; I asked the cook and house-maid how it was; they said, they could not tell, but he behaved very indifferent; I asked, did he court her; they said, they did not know, but he was a very comical fellow, and had attempted her life, and wished her mother and I to talk to him; the prisoner was not at home when we went, but came home about half an hour after; her mother and I went into the pantry to him with the girl; I asked him what he meant by using the girl ill, and whether he wished to have her for his wife; he said, no, he did not; I said, how could you use her so, as to conceal two pistols in a pair of boots, and say, if she did not put her hand to a paper, you would blow her brains out, and locked her in till she did put her hand to it from fear; he said, he did take the two pistols, and that there was one for her and one for him; I asked him, how he could use any body in such a barbarous manner; he said, he would not talk to me, but to her mother, upon which I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - A. He was sober to all appearance; I told the cook, I did not like his behaviour, and should be glad if she would let the girl go home with us, as Sir Ralph was not at home, and there were only two women servants in the house; she at last consented, and I had hardly said, come, let us go, because it is late, when the prisoner came in with three pistols; he stopped, and said, now I'll let you see what a man dare do who is destitute in his mind; the girl's mother got up and ran away; he advanced to the girl, and the house-maid ran away; the girl ran behind the cook and me, and screamed and begged of him not to kill her; the cook covered her head, and then he pointed a pistol at her, which flashed in the pan; the cook then ran away, and none but the prisoner, the girl, and me were left. I took up one of the wooden-bottom chairs, and told him I would not run away, for then he would surely murder her; I begged for God Almighty's take he would not kill her, for we would settle it any way; he bid me take care of myself; I told him there was no fear, and as I came to defend the girl, I would stand by her; he shuffled about till he got the pistol between the spokes of the chair and my arm, when he shot her, and she fell down behind me; she was no sooner down but she jumped up again, and ran up stairs; I being a stranger to the house, did not know which way to run; he discharged the third pistol, and I thought he pointed it at his own head, but it did not take place, nor do I know where the ball went to. I never saw the prisoner before that time, therefore do not know the state of his mind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know what became of the prisoner, and whether he did not attempt to cut his own throat? - A. He did, but I did not see him.</p>

             Sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Kirby: On the 6th of June last, which was the first day of the Sessions, we were obliged to handcuff the prisoner, to prevent his beating himself to pieces; he beat his head against the floor that we thought he would kill himself; he has been so at different times since; sometimes he is very well to talk to, and at other times quite slighty.</p>

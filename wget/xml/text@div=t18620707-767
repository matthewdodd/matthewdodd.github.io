                  </hi>. I am a brewer, in partnership with my brother and father, at Greenwich—the prisoner had been in our service nearly two years, as watchman—there was one tap, about the middle of the brewery, on pur<lb></lb>pose for the men to take ale from—it was not near the store-cellar—I personally gave the prisoner instructions that that tap was put up for their purposes, and that they were not to touch anything else—I gave the prisoner in custody on 21st June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in this firm—in consequence of something I had heard, I went, on 20th June, about half-past 9 at night, into the cellar where the stock ale was kept, to watch—that is some little distance from where the tap is—I saw the prisoner pass with a light through the store-cellar, in which I was; he went out, and then returned with a can and siphon; he drew the bung; put his light out, and I heard him suck the siphon, and heard the ale run out—I heard him knock the bung in, and saw him retire with the can and the ale in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him put the light out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw the total darkness in a moment—when he was out of the cellar I saw him pour the ale into a glass, drink some himself, and give some to a woman, a man, and a boy—I cannot say whether the woman was his wife, or who she was—I believe he has a wife, but I do not know—I do not know whether she brought anything with her for him to eat—I believe there was some<lb></lb>thing to eat there—I do not know who had brought it.</p>

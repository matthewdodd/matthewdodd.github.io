                  </hi>. I live at 124, Great Dover Street, Borough, and am a bookseller and stationer—about twenty minutes past eleven on the night of 1st July I was in Dover Road—I had got to the corner of Napier Street, when a man suddenly rushed out from the corner, seized hold of my watch-guard, broke the chain away, and ran up Napier Street—I called out, "I have lost my watch"—my wife was walking with me at the time—I was proceeding a step or two up Napier Street towards where the prisoner had run, and a man crossed the road to me, with the intention, as I thought then, to stop my progress—I had an umbrella in my hand—I struck him with it—then some voice said from Napier Street the man was caught, and that he had got my watch—I went up Napier Street, and found two men struggling on the ground—one of them was the prisoner</p>

               <p>Jones—I could not identify the person who took my watch at the time, it was so quickly done—I could only say it was a man about Jones's height—I collared him—we were immediately surrounded by a number of people, and he was dragged into Dover Road—he struggled very much—there was a very great fight and struggle indeed between him and some of my witnesses—I shouted out "Police!" for some minutes—it was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before any police assistance came—Leary was brought into the station-house after Jones—whether or not he was the man that afterwards stopped me, after I had lost my watch, I can't posi<lb></lb>tively say; he is about the height—I can't say whether he had a smock frock on or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Union Place, Crosby Row, and am a labourer at Mr. Standon's—I was with Wybrow on the night of 1st July about half-past eleven—I was in the Dover Road, near Napier Street—we were coming along together, and saw Jones and Leary stop the prosecutor, and Jones snatched a watch from his pocket and ran down Napier Street about twenty yards—he stopped there, and then he took one boot or shoe off and ran on again—I said something to Wybrow, ran after him, and Leary stopped the prosecutor, and would not let him go—leaving the prosecutor with Leary, I went to assist Wybrow—while Jones was struggling on the ground with him he hallooed for his boot—I looked for the boot, and in the boot I found this piece of guard, and gave it to the prosecutor, who was then coming towards me—Leary came up, and I caught hold of him—there was me and a sailor, who is not here—we got Leary to the Dover Road, and a policeman took him to the station—Jones was gone on to the station before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live in Albany Street, Old Kent Road—on the night of the 1 st July, about half-past eleven, I was in Dover Street with my wife going home—I heard a female cry, "Stop thief! my husband has lost his watch"—I then saw a man in a white smock stop the prosecutor—I cannot swear to either of the prisoners—I went round the corner into Napier Street—I ran round and saw Wybrow on the ground with Jones—I seized hold of Jones—he was struggling very violently, kicking and punching as hard as he could at everybody—I saw the watch on the ground—he fell on to the ground again, when we seized hold of him, and, in so doing, he managed to take up the watch from the ground, and I then left go of his collar, and seized hold of his hand with the watch in it, and his fingers and mine met on the watch—I struggled with him with the watch in his hand for full ten minutes—I then received a severe kick, which caused me to take away my hand, Leary said, "Get up mate," and, in so doing, the watch left—he then got up and said, "I have not got the watch"—I did not see the watch in Leary's hand, but I will swear it was in Jones's hand when Leary took hold of it—I then took hold of Jones and struggled with him, and gave him to the sergeant—I held him by one arm along Blackman Street until we met another constable.</p>

September, I watched the premises 118, America Square, the business place of the Wholesale Co-operative Stores Society, Limited—at 1.55 I saw a man named Rowley leave the warehouse with a tub of butter—Carey was standing at the door—the tub was placed down in the Minories, and a man was beckoned from the opposite side of</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). In consequence of something said to me I passed the shop 10, Minories and saw Seal and King taking butter out of a tub—on the 6th September I was watching with Williams, and saw, at about 2 o'clock,' Rowley leave the warehouse with a bag containing twelve cheeses—Carey at that time was at the door of the warehouse in America Square—I saw Rowley take the bag to 10, Minories, leave it there, and come away—I then handed him over to Williams, and went into the shop and saw Mrs. King and Seal—I said "I am a police officer; this bag has been stolen by a man named Carey, I shall charge you with receiving it, knowing it to have been stolen"—Seal replied "It has just come from the Midland Railway," at the same time handing me this consignment note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "You will also be charged with receiving a tub of butter on Friday last"—he told me his name was not King, that he simply was a servant, and that Mrs. King and himself managed the business, but he was the responsible party—he further stated that he did not deny having bought goods of Carey, and that he possessed invoices—I obtained these invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) after a little struggle—I left Williams in the shop in charge of Seal and Mrs. King while I went after Carey, whom I took to the station, and afterwards returned to the shop—I sent Williams on to the station with Seal—I found this consignment note marked B (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which relates to a firkin of butter—I took Mrs. King to the station—I also found a. cash book and some empty butter tubs, the latter of which I took to the station and showed to Mrs. King, stating that Mr. Jones, the manager of the society, had identified them as the property of the society—these are the heads of the tubs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to Carey's house and found six books amongst other things, which appear to have been used as delivery books.</p>

Seal did not deny that he had bought the goods from Carey—I omitted for a short time to speak about the firkin of butter—the Co-operative Stores call themselves wholesale dealers, but they supply retail—I have never seen any goods sent away from these stores except from the rear entrance in America Square—I found all the invoices bearing Carey's name on the file—in the cash-book there are various entries, chiefly corresponding with the invoices.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the London Branch of the Whole-sale Co-operative Society—the business is wholesale in groceries and pro<lb></lb>visions—we supply retail co-operative societies, and no one else—Carey was in our employ as warehouse foreman—he had been with us about sixteen months—his duties were to receive goods into the warehouse and send goods out—I have seen some Dutch cheeses, which are similar to those in our warehouse—I have also seen some tubs, which bear our mark upon them—I identify these order-books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as belonging to the society—Carey had not the control over them—I have seen these invoices (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>); the writing upon them is by Carey—I know the prices the society were charging for these goods at the time, and observe those on the in<lb></lb>voices for which these goods were sold, but prices vary—the prices obtained for these goods are considerably too low—I have missed some goods since July last.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I am a buyer and salesman too occasionally—I form my estimate that these are low prices, knowing what the goods are selling at—we are very particular to whom we sell; we sell only to co-operative societies—we do not supply private tradesmen—'it is a question of consideration whether our goods are too good for them—we try not to sell goods that are bad—we do not sell spoiled goods to our own customers—we supply no other persons but our own customers in the regular way of trade—ours is a regular way of trade—we occasionally sell a small parcel of goods if it is not good enough for our customers; if it is not good enough for our customers, it is good enough for private selling—we do not try to dispose of them in the ordinary way; we certainly tell them they are bad—our sales pass through our books—we sold about the time in question two sides of bacon, not fit for our trade, to a man who paid ready money for them—Carey had three men under him—it was a principle before last Christmas to sell goods to our own people to the extent of their own consumption, at least that is what was understood—it would not be Carey's duty to make out invoices, but the clerk's.</p>

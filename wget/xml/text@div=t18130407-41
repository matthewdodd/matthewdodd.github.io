I was in liquor when I went into the house; and when I quitted the tap-room, I went into the parlour the four prisoners went with me into the parlour. We drank together. I fell asleep in the parlour. When I was asleep one of the prisoners absented himself his name is Willoughby.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Willoughby came back after you awakened - A. I have been told in about three quarters of an hour. I do not know of my own knowledge. I had fourteen pound in bank notes; two two's and two five's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you so much as that when you awoke from your sleep - A. No, I had not when I awoke. I am sure that I had the notes when I went into the parlour, and some time afterwards, until I drank to that degree that I fell asleep. The landlord had got a five pound note and a two pound note; I gave it to him before I fell asleep to pay part of my reckoning. I know that I had got the other two pound and five pound in my pocket. They were in my pocket, in a piece of a rag. I am confident that I had them when I fell asleep, and at the time I awoke I was alarmed, and told that I had been robbed. I did not know, myself, that I had been robbed, until I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the four prisoners in the room when you awoke - A. No, Willougby was not. I cannot say whether the other three were or not. When I awoke I was without the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the notes since - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the prisoners charged - A. That day; the 16th of last month.</p>
               <p>MR. WICKHAM. Q. You keep this public-house the Eight Bells, do not you - A. I did, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of the four prisoners - A. Perfectly well. I remember their being in my house in company together on the 16th of March.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070033"></xptr>Mackdonald came to the outside of the bar. There were a number with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the parties that went into the parlour - A. The four prisoners and Mackdonald; those are the parties I saw there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they drinking together - A. Mackdonald was drinking a long time. At one time I got a two pound note of him, and another time a five pound note. I wanted the whole of the money to keep for him, and I told him if he wanted to treat his comrades I would give him twenty shillings all in silver. When he gave me the five pound note I saw him have a one pound note and another note. I cannot swear to the value of it. He wrapped up two notes in a rag, and placed them in his right hand waistcoat pocket. He then went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went into the parlour where were the prisoners - A. In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they stay together after that - A. They were some time together in the parlour after that; an hour or two. It is impossible to be correct in stating to time.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time was there any liquor - A. Yes, beer and half-and-half, and they were smoking together. They had half ale and half porter. I was backwards and forwards while they were together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular - A. When I was in in the parlour I observed Willoughby put his hand into Mackdonald's pocket, and take out the tobacco and throw it on the table for them all to smoke. The left hand pocket, not the right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mackdonald asleep then - A. No; he was quite drunk, and the last time I went into the room Mackdonald was asleep in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the prisoners there then - A. No, Willoughby was absent and Todman was absent, and whether Clibbon was about the door I will not swear. Thompson was present. When I went in, Thompson said, Wickham, I wish you had all that man's money. I said, I wish I had it all. I said, there is nothing like the time present; I shall, now he is asleep, take it from him, and take care of it for him. I put my right hand into his right hand waistcoat pocket, where I saw him deposit the notes and the rag, and neither the notes nor the rag were there. I then searched his left hand pocket; there was nothing there. I then said, Thompson, this man is robbed, and I will not stand it. By that time Clibbon came in. After that I went out, and met Todman coming in. I went to the parlour, and locked the door. I had all in the parlour but Willoughby. I said, that man has been robbed, and I will not let any of you go out. At that time the parlour door was locked, and I had the key. An officer came; I told him the circumstance. More assistance came, and they were taken. Then in came Willoughby. He said, what, is the parlour door locked? Yes, I said, it is, but I will unlock it. I unlocked it, and said, I will lock you all in. I gave them all in charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mackdonald after that - A. He was put to bed. After that, they were all searched, and nothing was found on either of them.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Luke's. On the 16th of March, I was sent for to take these prisoners into custody for robbing Mackdonald. I found Willoughby absent. The other prisoners were locked up in the parlour. I went for three other officers, and when I came back Willoughby had returned. They were all four there. Mr. Wickham then gave me charge of all four. I searched the prisoners. I found nothing upon either of them.</p>

W. E. A.". - When I got to March's, they said they knew nothing of him, that he only came there with an excuse about straw - March's was about a mile from the wheeler's, where I left the cart - I went back there, but my horse and cart were gone, and the prisoner too; Tomkins afterwards shewed me the cart and pony, it was mine; I got the harness from Williams.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker, and live in the Edgware-road, Paddington. The prisoner came to me with a horse and cart, I think it was on a Thursday, about three o'clock in the afternoon; he was a stranger to me, he drove up to my door and enquired for a pony-saddle, I had none; he said he wanted to sell his harness and cart, for he was going to ride, and not drive; he asked 8 s. 6 d. for the harness, which I agreed to give him, it was as much as I could afford to give - I fitted up a bridle for him to put on the pony, and lent him a strap to buckle on a cloth, and he bought a whip - he went away on the pony, leaving the cart, and said he should be gone about half an hour, he returned in about half an hour, with Tomkins and Kerry, who he sold the cart and pony to, at my door - Martin claimed the harness.</p>

            . I live in Virgil's-place, Marylebone. On Thursday, about four o'clock in the afternoon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240020"></xptr>I was in the New-road, near Quebec-street, with Kerry, in his cart, and met the prisoner; he was riding on a pony, without a saddle, he called to us and asked if we wanted a pony; I asked the price, he said three guineas, I said, that was too much; he said, he would sell me a cart very cheap, as he knew me (I did not know him), and that if I liked to go and look at it, I could pay him half down, and half in three months - I went with him and looked at the cart at Williams's door, Edgware-road; he asked 3 l. for the cart, I offered him 30 s., he agreed to take it - I was to pay him 1 l. down, and 10 s. to Williams, who he said was a friend of his - I went to get the money, and only had 18 s.; I took Kerry with me to Williams to see me pay for it; I came as far as the Royal Oak, public-house, Circus-street, the prisoner went with me all the way; I paid him there, and he gave me a receipt for 1 l., and said he would call on Sunday for the 2 s., and would forgive me the 10 s. - I then thought it was not all right exactly, I said I do not think it is right; he said, "If you will go with me I will take you to Williams, and he will satisfy you" - I went to Williams with him and asked if he knew him, he said he did not, he took me by the collar, told me to come out, and said he would give me two other references; he took me to Westminster, and told me to stand opposite a shop. I saw him talking to a man - I went over and asked if he knew him, he said No; and then the prisoner ran through the house and down a court at the back; I ran, caught him, and said "If you leave me, I will kill you, I think you have stolen it" - I secured him.</p>

            . Tomkins was in my cart, coming from Billingsgate. Tomkins went to bargain with the prisoner about the cart, I went afterwards to fetch the cart - the prisoner then offered to sell it to me; he said, Williams was about it, but I should have the first offer; he asked 30 s. for it, I said I had not enough money; he said it was of no consequence, he would call on Sunday morning, or I might pay Williams - we went to the Royal Oak, public-house, he wrote me a receipt in part. I paid him 18 s. - we went to Williams's. Tomkins's story is correct.</p>

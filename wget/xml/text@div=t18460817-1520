I am in the service of Mr. John Renshaw and another—the prisoner was in their employ—as he was going out of the house, on the 17th of July, I thought it necessary to search his bag—I found two reams of paper in it—he had no business with them—I asked How they came in his bag—he said he was going to take them over there—I said he could not, because they were not tied up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packer in the prosecutor's employ. About six o'clock that evening I was in the cutting-room—I asked for a boy to take two parcels over London-bridge—the boy was otherwise engaged, and the prisoner offered to take them, provided I would furnish him with a bag—he came to me about half-past six, and asked if the parcels were ready—I told him they were not—he said he should like to have a bag with him, as it looked so much like a boy, to take parcels without a bag—at seven o'clock I took him an empty bag, and placed it by the side of the two parcels—I told him they were the two parcels—I presume this paper which is produced was not in that room, but in the room adjoining—the two parcels I sent out were directed properly—one to Robins, of Tooley-street, and the other to another person—this other paper which he had, was not even labelled, and was not tied up in brown paper.</p>

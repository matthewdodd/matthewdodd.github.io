                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 67). I was on duty at Woolwich on 20th Dec., about half past 6 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner going up Powis-street, with a bundle under his arm—he went into a second hand clothes shop—I went in a minute after him—I saw Mr. Hart, who keeps the shop, looking at these trowsers—I asked the prisoner how he became possessed of them—he said he was a tailor, and he made them—he after<lb></lb>wards said he bought them of a recruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He has made one mistake, I said the person I bought them of was a tailor, and he made them. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; I asked him to ac<lb></lb>count for the possession of the trowsers, he said, "I am a tailor, I made them."</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of Augustus Whittingham, he is a retailer of clothes at Woolwich. On the evening of 20th Dec., about twenty minutes to 7 o'clock, I missed two pairs of trowsers—this is one pair—they were safe at 6 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How do you swear to these trowsers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were hanging at the door—here is the mark of the iron—there was a private mark on, which, is torn off—that was the mark of the maker—he sends to other shops—I had seventy pairs hanging on the rail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He swore before the Magistrate, that he knew them by a fold on the knee, where they had hung over a rail; he never said a word about the mark, but he spoke about some dirt on them; it is well known to all tailors and cutters that they are cut out three pairs at a time; as to the mark of the dirt, that might have happened to any.</p>

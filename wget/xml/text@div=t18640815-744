                  </hi>. I am a banker and general merchant at 11, Rue Bergere, Paris—I carry on business there with two partners, under the firm of Le Grand, Tanco &amp; Co.—we had also an office at 117, Cheapside—in May, 1863, the prisoner was introduced to us by one of the partners in Messrs. Candy's house, and very highly recommended to us—they are large silk merchants—we afterwards agreed that the prisoner should become the agent for our house in London; he was to receive 4000 francs, which is equivalent to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and-one per cent, on sales—I have the letter of instructions here, which was given to the prisoner before he left Paris—my partner engaged him—I know exactly what he said to him—I was not present; I had left for London—I said nothing to the prisoner before I gave him this letter of instructions—I approved of the instructions in London when he came over—(<hi rend="italic">This letter contained instructions to the prisoner that he should, before he made any sales, be satisfied as to the solvency and respectability of the buyers, that the books should be kept in the usual way of business, and that an extract from them should be sent every month to Paris</hi>)—The prisoner came to London at the end of May, 1863—he did very little business between that time and the end of December—I communicated to him in reference to his sales and transactions, and about December he came over to Paris—he said that the business began to promise, that he had begun to make good connections, and the only thing that he required in order to carry on a good and important business, was to have a stock of goods, which he said would be necessary about the spring, when the London season began—he said he had brought two buyers with him; he did not tell me their names then, or in his correspondence afterwards—I told him to introduce them to me, but he said he could not present them then, because they were very busy—he said they were buyers for some large English houses—on that statement I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150004"></xptr>
               <p>gave him some directions as to the purchase of silks—he proceeded to Lyons to buy the stock that he wanted, and he also went to Switzerland—the amount of his purchases at those two places were about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods all went straight to London, and the prisoner went also, without writing us what amount he had bought, or anything about it—the goods consisted of silks to the value of 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., plush 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leather about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and cotton and printed goods to the amount of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was also 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth more, which he bought at the same time—the whole amount of goods transmitted to London at that time was about 32,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—the prisoner got back to London again about the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of February, 1864—I came from Paris to London on 6th or 7th of February—I saw the prisoner—he said, "All my stock is sold, the goods are in the hands of all the people who bought them"—I did not even know that the goods had arrived in London—I then asked him who the buyers were he had brought to Paris, and he told me they were Messrs. Lhemann and Arand—I heard of an alleged transaction with Bevington's, at the very beginning of February, before I came to London—we had a telegraphic despatch—I communicated to the prisoner with reference to it, and he gave me the same answer that he had given to the house—I cannot find the letter which we wrote to the prisoner about that, but I have the answer we received on the 7th. or 8th. o£ February the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">This letter, being in French, was interpreted; it was dated 8th of February</hi>, 1864, <hi rend="italic">and stated that he had been to Messrs. Bevington and Sons that morning, and that his client had offered them some goods for the purpose only of getting the value of them, and to assure himself that he had not paid too high a price for them, that there was nothing to be alarmed about, and that tive prosecutors might always rely on his (the 'prisoner s) help and assistance</hi>)—I have now found the other letter (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 6th of February, from the prosecutors to the prisoner, recommending him the greatest possible circumspection as to the people he did business with, and that he was always to try and get the best possible security</hi>)—I came to London immediately after that, and spoke to the prisoner about Bevington's transaction—I repeated to him what we had said in that letter—I told him that we had great fears that all the leathers were bought by some person who could not pay for them, and who had offered them for the purpose of raising money—the prisoner said, "Don't have the least fear about that client, he always pays me beforehand, that is the best answer I can give, the only reason they offered those leathers was to make themselves sure that they did not pay a high price for them"—he afterwards told me who that client was—I thought it useless to see Bevington upon that statement—the actual date upon which I came to London was the 7th—I did not wait for the answer to our letter—I asked the prisoner to give me a list of all his clients, so that I could take references of all of them—he gave me a list on a bit of paper—I have not got it—I kept it for some time, and then destroyed it—I showed the names <hi rend="italic">to</hi> several merchants, and within half an hour I found out all about them, and told the prisoner verbally that all those clients were good for nothing—they put opposite to the different names he gave me in pencil "very bad," "very bad"—the first name was Lhemann, the second Arand, and so forth—I said to the prisoner, "Nothing can he said about these houses; nobody knows them at all; people say they are good for nothing, that they cannot be trusted to any sum, and I forbid you to let them have any more goods whatever"—he said that the information was wrong, that he had known these people for many years, especially Lhemann, as a very high standing and respectable person; that we could rely upon them; we were sure to be paid our money</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150005"></xptr>
               <p>—he said Lhemann bad been highly recommended to him by De Vaux and Co., the bankers, and that moreover he had known him for many years, and that from his high character we should be sure to be paid—he said that a man of the name of Leo had presented Arand to him, and that his banker also had given good references—I recollect saying something to the prisoner about getting a book-keeper—I said the books were in great confusion, that he most get a book-keeper at once—he replied to that that it was a very difficult thing to get a book-keeper in London, but that he had already spoken to a Belgian whom he would very likely get; he told me at that time that Lhemann owed us about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I looked at the books, and that was the amount according to the books—he had not before that sent me any account sales to Lhemann—I saw Lhemann immediately before I went to Paris (<hi rend="italic">Lhemann was here brought to the bar</hi>); that is the person I saw—I believe I returned to Paris the very day I arrived here, the 8th, but before I returned I went with the prisoner to see Lhemann at his office—Lhemann told me that he had purchased many goods from us, and that he was doing a very large business at the Cape and Mauritius, and in different parts of the world—I told him that I wanted to draw on him for part of his debt, and that I should at least draw upon him for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said, "I want" you to give me a bill for that amount"—he said, "I have no objection to send you the bill, and whatever balance I may owe you I will pay in the course of the month of May"—he did not tell me at that time how much he owed me—we went out, and I said to the prisoner, "We shall be sure to lose our money, those are no merchants, persons circumstanced as those are, the office looked wretched and miserable—the prisoner said, "Oh, you may be sure that every penny will be paid; he is a very high character, and you must not judge by appearances; I regret you want the drafts, for without those bills I should be sure of getting all the money in April"—I told Lhemann be could not expect to have any more credit till he paid us the debt—he said I was very wrong in stopping his credit, for that would prevent him from paying me what he owed me sooner; he would not have any facilities for paying me—I was not aware that on that very day, the 8th, the prisoner sold goods to Lhemann to the amount of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in valued or that two days afterwards he sold goods to him to the amount of 796<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never even surmised any such sale—the prisoner also introduced me to Arand; next morning, when I arrived at the office in Cheapside, I found Mr. Arand waiting for me—the prisoner had told me before that that he wanted to present Mr. Arand to me—I had a general conversation with him; he said he was a large merchant, that he was accustomed to buy of different houses in London, but that he preferred buying goods from us, because he bought them on advantageous terms—I had a conversation to try and find what were his means, and his commercial standing—he said he was waiting for a very large order which Werner had ordered, and which we fortunately stopped—it was given to the manufacturers at Lyons; the prisoner had ordered them for him at Lyons—we stopped that at once, and the manufacturers then for the first time refused to advance any more goods—Arand said he had consigned the goods to York and other places—I told him that we wanted bills at least to the amount of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid in a couple of months, and that he would have no further goods until these bills were met—according to the books, he owed us about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would shortly pay 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the whole amount would be paid in a few days if I did not draw the bills—the prisoner confessed that he never inquired of the merchants to whom I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150006"></xptr>
               <p>introduced him—I presented him personally to four houses; Messrs. Isaacs and Son, Mildred and Co., Drake and Co., and Schloss and Co., who were ready to give him all sorts of advice—I had not the least idea that on 10th February the prisoner trusted A rand again with goods to the amount of 1,179<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I returned to Paris on 14th—I went to Manchester before that, and returned immediately—the last thing I said to the prisoner when I left, was not to trust either Lhemann and Arand further, as they were worth nothing, and I had heard from a reliable source that they were not worth 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they could not be trusted to that amount—between 14th and 20th I received bills of exchange from the prisoner to the amount of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Lhemnnn, and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Arand—on 20th I returned those bills to the prisoner in a letter—(<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that it was impossible for Messrs. Le Grand, Tanco, to negotiate the drafts and bills of exchange, and that it was indispensable for them to have the value of those bills on the Wednesday following, as they had to pay a large sum to one of their clients. It also desired that the prisoner should not give credit to Lhemann and Co. to a sum higher than</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that if he went beyond that figure they should hold him responsible, and that he was to send them word by telegraphy on the Tuesday, whether they might depend on the sum of money being sent</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just explain that passage in the letter about giving Lhemann a credit of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That if at once they would pay all they owed, not to trust them again over 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this memorandum was sent in that letter <hi rend="italic">"Lhemann—limited credit—capital small and insufficient for his business—established two or three years—respectable character, but too enterprising, and has not sufficient capital"</hi>—I afterwards received from the prisoner a letter dated 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> February—I was not at all aware that between 27th February and 8th March the prisoner supplied Arand with further goods to the amount of 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 5th March we wrote to him again, and asked him the precise names of the persons to whom he sold—I have the books here—there is, on 6th February, sold to Lhemann and Co., 2,128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 9th, to Arand, 1,179<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d;</hi> on 10th, to Lhemann, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 11th, 796<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 15th 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 16th, 391<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, all to Lhemann—there are four books full of sales made to Arand and Lhemann—the sales to Arand between 27th February and 8th March, were 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, 2<hi rend="italic">d;</hi> on 1st March, 1,007<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and on the same date 954<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, 193<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—all these four page full of goods are on the same date, amounting altogether to 4,608<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 7th there was a sum of 803<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—on 5th March we wrote this letter to the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prosecutors had not received the</hi> 50,000 <hi rend="italic">francs promised in the prisoners last letter, and asking him to send the money that day by a draft, so that they should be in possession of the sum of</hi> 23,579 <hi rend="italic">francs on the next Monday.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150007"></xptr>
               <p>arrived, and he did not pay anything—after that I went to Lhemann and asked him if he could meet his bill on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> April—he expressed his inability to do so, and said, "I have already written to the Paris house, stating that I cannot, because 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I expected from different quarters, has not arrived, and I have no money"—of course I said, "If you want us to wait any longer you must give us some security; have you any property, any shares?"—I asked him what security he could give us, in whatever shape—I said, "You must have sold these goods to somebody?"—he then gave me these bills of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said, "I have made my sales to the extent of 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I can hand you as collateral security"—I said, "I will not take them in payment, only as collateral security" and he handed me all these bills, with some others—I never got a penny on those bills—I asked him what sort of bills they were; he said that very likely some of them would not be paid, but a great part of them would—they are completely worthless—Lhemann owes us 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the total amount of our loss is 32,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was in three months, from January to March—the prisoner sold Lhemann 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, Arand 11,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth to two or three people, who were recommended by them, without taking any references whatever.</p>

               <p>afterwards to make up the books—I think he left at the commencement of I September—Copleston was employed at the prosecutors' as salesman—I don't I know where he is now—an accountant, named Kellingworth came in De<lb></lb>cember—the prisoner was away from the end of December till the begin<lb></lb>ing of February—Copleston attended to the books during his absence—I don't remember seeing Mr. Tanco the first time he came—I was out the first I time he came; I saw him the second time he arrived—I can't recollect what I day it was—he came over two or three times—Lhemann came there once while Mr. Tanco was over; I don't know which time that was, whether the first or second time—Arand came at the same time as Lhemann.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier in the service of Messrs. Bevington—Mr. Pace, our warehouseman, who was examined before the Magistrate, has had to go abroad—I was present at a conversation between Werner and Mr. Pace on Monday, 8th February, I think, but I have rather gathered the date from the correspondence—I know it was on a Monday—the prisoner brought in a letter which he had received from the prosecutors at Paris, which referred to a letter that had been written by our house about some calf-skins which had been offered for sale, and asked us for any information that we might be able to give him as to the house that had offered us these goods—we said the goods were offered by a house of which we were sus<lb></lb>picious, and we asked him if he was aware of the position of the house which had offered us the goods—he then gave us the name of the house to which he had sold the goods—I do not recollect the name; I can't say whether it was Lehmann—we offered, while he waited, to send on to a protection society office, to which we subscribe, to gain some particulars of the standing of the house lie sold the goods to, for his information—he was quite willing to wait—we sent, and the report was doubtful.</p>

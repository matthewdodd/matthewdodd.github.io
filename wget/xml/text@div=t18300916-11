On the night of the 6th of August, I fastened the house up, between seven and eight o'clock, and went to bed between ten and half-past ten; two gentlemen who sleep up stairs, and lodge with me, were in the house when I fastened it - nobody came in after I fastened it up, to my knowledge; about two in the morning I was alarmed by the breaking of glass - I got up, went to the window, and looked out, but could see nothing; I concluded it might be something thrown out of the opposite house, and went to bed - in about ten minutes I was alarmed by the Police-officer, who called to me by name to get up, saying there had been thieves on the premises; I dressed myself, unlocked the doors, and came down - the prisoner had then been sent away in custody; I examined the premises, and found some glass broken in a window on the first floor up stairs - it is a sash that is always shut, and hangs on binges overhead; it pushes up, and when let go it falls too - no property was taken or disturbed; I was not the first person that examined the window.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 6th of August I was on duty, and heard a rattle spring; I ran up immediately, and found the prisoner in Daly's custody, in George-street, near Barron's house - he was taken to the station, but not searched in my presence; I got on the top of the prosecutor's door, and saw the window broken - outside the window I saw a crow-bar and dark lantern, which appeared warm; one part of it was in one place, and another in another, as if it had fallen out of their hands - the window was broken; it then comes back - it might be swung back, and a person get in; I found a piece of crape and a bundle handkerchief on the premises.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 7th of August, I first saw the prisoner and two others standing against the chapel wall (the prosecutor's house is the Spanish Ambassador's chapel); as I went up, one of them pretended to be easing himself - I asked what they did there - he said he was there for a necessary<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160014"></xptr>purpose; I said he ought to be taken to the watch-house for committing a nuisance - they said they were strangers, and would be obliged to me to overlook it; I went down King-street, turned to the left, and met my serjeant - I returned the same way, and as I passed Little George-street I looked down the street, and saw a man standing against the door; I knew him to be one of the party I had moved off ten minutes before - it was not the prisoner; I took that man into custody for loitering about the street, and asked where his companions were - he said he knew nothing of them; there is an entrance near there - I went, and could not find his companions; I came out, looked up at the window, and saw the glass broken; I called Barron, and told him there were thieves in the chapel, as I heard footsteps there - the prisoner then looked out from the broken square of glass; I sprang my rattle, and he came out at that window - there is a portico near the window; he came down that, and I laid hold of him - another man followed him out of the house; I had two in custody then, and the third man jumped on me and threw us three down, but I always kept hold of the prisoner, and am certain he is the man I saw within the window; I found a phosphorus-box, containing matches, in his pocket - the serjeant brought in a crow-bar, a piece of crape, and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you seen the chapel safe before? A. Yes - this is a front window on the first floor; I had been desired to look after that house, as it had been attempted two nights before - the pane of glass is about eighteen inches by fourteen; there was no ladder to the window, but there is a portico - it was after two o'clock; there is a gas-lamp about two yards off - he opened the window and came out; I examined the window after - it was not open then, but others had been on the premises; I took him as he came down off the portico- he was never out of my custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him come out? A. Yes - he came out from under the window; the hinges are at the top - he came out of the window.</p>

             re-examined. I keep the Spanish Ambassador's chapel, and live in it; there is a bed-room for me up stairs; the two gentlemen up stairs were clergymen who lodged there for a few nights.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. This is the chapel window? A. Yes - there is a door communicating from my room to the chapel; it is under the same roof - the door comes out of my bed room into the chapel; I had fastened the window the night before - the only part broken was the pane of glass; nobody could get through that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If a person broke a hole in the window, and put his hand in, could he open it, and let himself in? A. Yes, by pulling it towards him he could go in under it - the room I sleep in is attached to the chapel; it is my ordinary room - the clergymen were only sleeping there a few nights, and slept in the garret; nobody usually sleeps there but me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

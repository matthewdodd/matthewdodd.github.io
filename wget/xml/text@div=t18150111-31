               <p>MR. EYRE. I am a hosier. The prisoner Ringrose came to my shop on the 14th of September; about eleven o'clock, and bought some Angola stockings, flannel, and silk handkerchiefs, for which she offered in payment a fifty pound note; thinking it was a forgery, I sent my young men to the Bank of England to get it changed, there it was stopped, a gentleman and a Bow street officer came from the Bank and took the prisoner into custody at my shop. I took her address, it was not a true address, 26, Berwick street; she said she had the note of a servant who was going abroad; I endorsed my name and I believe the name she gave me, on the back of the note.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched Ringrose's lodgings; I found some plumbs, currants, two handkerchiefs, and two pictures, that had been stolen out of the parlour; I in company with Plank we went to the prosecutor's house; when we came to the house we took the man prisoner into custody, on suspicion. On the next day, at the examination, Ringrose said the man had let her into the house; no threat or promise of favour had been made use of to her before the woman said this; she said it frely of her own accord; she said it to his face, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin. The two handkerchiefs, two pound of plumbs, a pound and a half of currants, two half ounces of ground spice, two ounces of candied lemon, orange-peel, and two pictures, are mine.</p>

Yes; one fifty-pound note I had changed some time before, and the other remained in my possession on the night in question; I received them at my bankers; I don't know it by any particular mark; I only know it by being told by the banker that was one of the notes paid to me; I received it myself at the bankers.</p>

               <p>Ringrose's Defence.

I asked him what it was; he said, go to a shop, and get it changed, and get some things there to get change; he said, he should come and see me on Sunday, he did not say he should see me before.</p>

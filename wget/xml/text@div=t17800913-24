While I was standing at Mr. Warwick's door, between seven and eight o'clock on the 1st of September, I saw the prisoner jump up and take this box out of Mr. Health's cart while it was passing by. He took the box upon his shoulder and ran away with it. I informed the carter that a man had taken a box out of his cart; he went with me, and we found him in Fleet-market. I never lost sight of him but for about two minutes, when I went to tell the carman what had happened. I will swear the prisoner is the man. (The box was produced in court and deposed to by the witness.) When he was taken I observed this mark Spencer of Hempstead.</p>

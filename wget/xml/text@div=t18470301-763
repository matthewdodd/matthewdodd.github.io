                  </hi>. I live in Cardington-street, Hampstead-road, and am a collector of rates. The prisoner was in the service of my family—she came on the 20th of Nov., and quitted me last Monday—in consequence of missing some things, I went to the police-office in High-street, Marylebone—I got an officer, and went to Sarah Sircombe's lodging, No. 75, Drummond-street—she delivered some parcels to me and the officer—they were taken to my house, and in the presence of the policeman, my wife, myself, and one or two other persons, the parcels were opened—Sircombe has been in the habit of coming to my house for eight or ten years as a charwoman—the articles in the parcels were identified—these are some of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I live at No. 75, Drummond-street. I delivered the parcels to the prosecutor and the officer—the prisoner gave me one parcel at Mr. Roberts's house, to take care of for her for a few days, till she called for it—the other parcels she left at my place when I was not at home—the parcel she delivered to me was sealed up—I could have distin<lb></lb>guished that from the other if I had seen it sealed up—I do not know what it contained—the prisoner was at Mr. Roberts's house when I delivered up the parcels—I called at Mr. Roberts's the day after I delivered up the parcels, and took a few small things that fell out of a pocket-handkerchief—I called between two and three o'clock—the prisoner was not there then—I believe she had left the service—I had been at Mr. Roberts's house on the same evening that I delivered up the parcels—I went into the parlour—they called the pri<lb></lb>soner up, and asked her if she had given me these parcels—she made no answer in my presence—I said to her, "You gave them to me"—she made no reply—in point of fact, she had only given me one parcel, and whether that contained the articles that they had then got open, I do not know—when she gave me the parcel at Mr. Roberts's, she told me she had a dress and a few things in it, which she wished me to take care of for a few days, till she called for them—she said she was going to leave, and going into the country—the second parcel, which was left by somebody, was smaller than the other—she said the parcel made her box lighter, and she was going to carry them into the country—she came to my house one day before she left her situation—she went to a dancing-room—I did not go into the dancing-room—I staid in a little room, and saw them dancing—when she came home from there she left a veil, a collar,</p>

Between twelve and one o'clock, on Monday night, I was called by Mr. Robert's nephew to Drummond-street—I went to Mr. Sircombe's—she was not at home—I went with Mr. Roberts to his house in Cardington-street—shortly afterwards Mr. Sircombe came with Mr. Robert's nephew—the prisoner was called into the parlour, and Mr. Roberts asked Sircombe, in her presence, whether she had ever received two parcels from the prisoner—she said she had—the prisoner made no reply—Mr. Sircombe said, "The parcels are at my house; if you think proper to go to my house with the policeman, I will deliver them up"—I went, and she gave up two parcels sealed up, and a muff, and a small basket—the parcels were opened when I got to Mr. Roberts's—I found in the large brown paper parcel a table-cloth, three towels, a silk shawl, and a number of other articles, which I here produce—I afterwards went into the kitchen—I saw the prisoner—I said, "I am going to take you into custody, for robbing your master of various things; you need not say anything to me unless you like; remem<lb></lb>ber all you say I shall repeat before the Magistrate"—she laughed—I asked her if she had any objection to my going up stairs with her mistress to examine her box—she said, no, she had not—I went up but found nothing relating to her master—Mr. Roberts delivered to me the next day a lace veil, a black collar, a brooch, and two pieces of ribbon—these are the articles which were in the large brown paper parcel which I opened—the prisoner was apprehended before she left the service—there was no opportunity of knowing what she meant to do with the things she had left at Sircombe'<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

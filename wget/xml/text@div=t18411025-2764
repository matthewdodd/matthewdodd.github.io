                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 62.) Between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the 28th of September, I was on duty in New King-street, Deptford—a little girl came out of the King's Arms public-house, saying she had been robbed of a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Sergeant Lovell was with me at the time—the prisoner came out of the public-house, and said, "It is no such thing, she gave it us"—" No," said the girl, "it is the only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I had; he took it out of my pocket"—I said to the prisoner, "It would be more to your advantage to spend your own money"—" You be d—d," says he, "you are as bad as the others"—Lovell went and spoke to the landlord, and he then spoke to the prisoner—I then went on my beat—about twelve I saw the prisoner again at the end of Dock-street—he appeared to know what he was doing—I passed by him—he said, "You b—y b—r, you wanted to take me into custody for a robbery"—I said, "Go to your home, I do not wish to have any thing to say or do to you"—he doubled his fist in my face, and struck at me—I threw his blow off, and he seized me by the—with his right hand—he hurt me at the time, but in the struggle I got his gripe away, and got him down—he gained his hold again, and said, "You b—y b—r, I will <hi rend="italic">do for you"</hi>—he hurt me, and I could hardly speak—Taylor, a parish constable, came up, and assisted me in getting off him—he and I took the prisoner towards the station—on our way we met Pritchard, and Pritchard and I took him to the station—on the way he said, "Only for this constable having hold of me, you b—y rascal, I would rip your b—y guts open, or do you bodily injury; I don't care a d—n for you; Dr. Drury will stand my friend; or, if he don't, Mr. O'Connell will"—I had known the prisoner before—he had been about eighteen months from Ireland, the last time—I felt pain all that night, and the night following, from the gripe the prisoner gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Deptford. I was out about twelve o'clock that night, near Dock-street—I heard one man say to another, "Go home, I want nothing to do with you"—I came up—I found it was Connor and the prisoner—I said, "What is the matter, Connor?"—he said, "I have got a man following me, and he won't go home"—I said to the prisoner, whom I knew very well, "Go home"—at that time he made a blow at Connor, who got hold of his wrist—he swore at Connor, and called him a b—r—they struggled and fell—when they were down he laid hold of Connor by the collar, and Connor laid hold of his neck—I said, "Let go his neck, I will get him up"—I pulled Connor from him, and he had got Connor tight by the * * * by his clothes, and Connor appeared very pale and very much exhausted—I got them both up—I said to the prisoner,</p>

               <p>"You foolish man, go home," but Connor insisted on taking him—we took him as far as the comer—there Pritchard came up, and I left them—the prisoner was swearing at Connor, and calling him an Irish policeman, and said he ought not to serve his fellow-countryman so—Connor seemed very much excited, and said he had hurt him.</p>

Q.</hi> Did it appear to you that Connor had ill<lb></lb>treated him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when he was down, Connor had hold of his neck—he was not throttling him—they were both in such a scuffle that I should think they hardly knew where their hands held.</p>

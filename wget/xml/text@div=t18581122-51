               <p>about last April in Bishopsgate-street, near Shoreditch Church—I had on a watch and chain; he wanted to buy the chain of me—I offered him the chain, and then he would not buy it because he said it was not silvor—he tried it first—he then asked me if I wanted to sell the watch—I said that I did not; and then he said, "You may as well sell it to me"—I afterwards sold it to him for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had stolen that watch from the plate-closet—the prisoner said that he knew where I had got it from, and gave me his card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said that if I had any more I was to bring them to him (<hi rend="italic">Card read:</hi> "H. Hopkins, Crinoline cane preparer, 11, Ely-place, Kings-land-road")—we then went into a public-house—I saw him again about a fortnight afterwards at Ely-place, and he asked me if I had got anything else—I said that I had got a ring; it was a gold keeper, which I had stolen from Mr. Walter's—I sold it to Hopkins for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said, "Why did not I bring him something better than that?" he wanted a watch for his own wear, something about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he appointed to meet me at Shoreditch Church—I met him there and took him a watch which I stole from Mr. Walter's—on other occasions subsequently I met him or went to his place and took him other property which I had stolen, he used generally to meet me—he said that in case of the matter being discovered, I was never to mention his name, but was to say that it was the first time and then they would let me off—on the day I was taken in custody I had a conversation with my master, and accompanied a policeman to Ely-place, but did not find Hopkins there—we afterwards went to Shoreditch Church, and after a while. Hopkins came there; I pointed him out to the officer who said to him "Is your name Hopkins?"—he said, "Yes"—he then asked him whether he knew me, and he said that he had never seen me before—the officer asked me whether I knew him, and I said "Yes"—the officer said that he should take him in charge for receiving stolen property.</p>

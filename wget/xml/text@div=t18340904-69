On the evening of the 25th of August, about seven o'clock, I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18340904-69-crimeloc387">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now what time of night was it? A. About seven o'clock, as near as I can guess - it was not broad daylight - it was so light I saw the prisoner's face and features - it must be daylight, I suppose, according to the hour - it was at the corner of Grace-church-street and Fenchurch-street - of course, there were more people than the prisoners coming along; but my attention was taken by the woman holding me, and the man hustling me - I did not notice whether there were many persons passing at the end of the street - I do not know the times the steam boats discharge their company - my attention was quite taken to dislocate myself - I had the 8s. 6d. shortly before, as I was in the court in Leadenhall market, I can safely swear it was in my pocket - I live in the Kent-road - the court I speak of leads into Gracechurch-street - I put my hand into my pocket and felt it - I merely put my hand into my pocket, and the money was in it then - I had no reason for doing that - I had not been at all incommoded in the road from the market - I was not incommoded by any body - the pavement was perfectly clear till I got to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner exchange a word with you, or with any body else? A. He did not with me, nor did I see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040045"></xptr>him with any body else - there might be other people passing - I cannot say whether there was a crowd passing - there might have been; I was in such a predicament with a woman holding me, I felt desirous of getting away, at my time of life - the 8s. 6d. was in my left hand pocket - the prisoner was on my right side - it was the little man and the woman that surrounded me, and the prisoner was on this side of me - they were all in company, when I followed them down Gracechurch-street, and saw them by the church - when I lost the money, I was alarmed, and was under the necessity of pledging a gown, as I came along, to make up the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long elapsed between your being surrounded, as you describe, and the time you say you saw the prisoners together? A. It might be about a quarter of an hour- I went to the oil shop at the corner, and the young man there called a policeman - the little man and the woman went away when I got from them - I afterwards saw them all together in Gracechurch-street, and I saw the prisoner coming out of Talbot-court - they were not all close together, but they were all in company together - he was the width of the court from them, and the little man was with them - he spoke to the little man, and the little man ran away - they were talking - I will not swear he spoke to the little man - he was talking when he came out of the court, and the little man was with him - the instant I took hold of the prisoner, the little man ran away - the officer was with me, but I took hold of him first - this might be half an hour after I lost my money, because I went down Gracechurch-street to see if I could see them, and then had to come back to the policeman - that policeman was gone, I called to one who is a witness, and he went with me - I missed my money as soon as I got under the window - I was so agitated I could scarcely put my hand into my pocket - I did not cross over the way before I missed any thing, nor did I go off the pavement - the oil shop is on the left hand side - I was on the same side of the way when I missed my money - I saw the prisoner searched, and 6s. 6d. was found on him - in silver, 1s. - my money was eight shillings, and a sixpence - I had no mark on it - I had not observed the hand of the prisoner about my person at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which pocket was your silver money in? A. My left hand. The prisoner stood on my right side, when he was by my side, and he was in front of me, I think, two or three minutes - when I dislocated myself from the woman, he ran away - he was there when I got from the woman - I turned round, and asked, what he meant by holding me so fast? - there was no necessity for the prisoner to press against me as he did - the pavement is very wide.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to say he pressed on you? A. He was close to my side, and I turned round, and saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you say he prevented your getting on? A. He did; and walked in this manner, to prevent my going forward - I was obliged to turn towards the window of the oil shop, to avoid him, when I got from the woman.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was directed by the prosecutrix to go in search of the party who she complained of - my inspector ordered me to go - she complained to him - the inspector gave me orders to watch for them - she was with him at the time, making a complaint that she had been robbed - I told her to go in front of me, and any of the party she saw to point out to me - I went in the direction of the bridge, but could see nothing of the party - I told her to come back in a direction from Gracechurch-street, and, at the corner of Talbot-court, she went up to the prisoner, took hold of him, and said, "This is the man, and that is the other man," pointing to a little man - I laid hold of the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house - six shillings and six pence, in silver, was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As she herself took hold of him, what did you do with the little man? A. I could not take him - the moment I laid hold of the prisoner, the other went off - the prosecutrix caught hold of him first - I was not close to her at the time - I was two paces from her - I knew she could not hold the prisoner, and I collared him immediately - the little man made off immediately - I think I was a quarter of an hour with her before I found him - I told him he was accused of robbing the woman of her money - he said, "It is no such thing" - I told him to come along with me to the watch-house, and state what he had to say to the officer of the night, and make what complaint, or whatever he had to say - he complained of being taken into custody, when he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was the spot where he was taken, from where she described herself to have been robbed? A. I should think, sixty or seventy yards.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. I do not know whether you know what time the steam-boats discharge their passengers of an afternoon? A. Mostly from seven to eight o'clock. She was ill-used between seven and eight o'clock - she did not come to the station-house to complain - I saw her at the end of Fenchurch-street - there was a good many people passing along the street at this time - the street was a good deal crowded at the time I took the prisoner into custody - I had not been walking in the direction of the bridge before - I had come from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent of the charge altogether - I never saw her till she met me at the corner of the court, and accused me of the robbery - I have not a doubt anybody who was there she would have mistaken for the person.</p>
               <p>MRS. TEMPLEMAN re-examined. I suppose it was not less than half an hour after I lost my money that I saw the prisoner again.</p>

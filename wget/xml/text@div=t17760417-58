            : I was drinking at Flannagan's, a public-house in Broad St. Giles's; I was going out backward and saw some flour standing on a stool in the passage, and some stuff in a cup by it, that looked almost like treacle, but appeared redder; the prisoner and another woman came in and kneaded a cake.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether they put any of the stuff in the cup in it? - No; the tea-cup stood with the flouer on a stool in the passage.</p>
               <p>Did you see them do any thing with the cup at all? - No; I saw them knead the cake coming in doors with it.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - The 18th of March.</p>
               <p>To FOWLER. What day did the child take the cake? - Between seven and eight at night on the 18th of March.</p>
               <p>To WADDICK. What time of day was it you are speaking of? - It was the afternoon; I saw the cake laid on the fire, so they said one to the other, that cake will make them gallop and sh - e.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any more? - No.</p>
               <p>You don't know who the other woman was? - No; I was with child: they said, if I longed for a bit, I might have it; I refused to have any.</p>

             after his death; I did not see him while he was ill; the first view of the stomach and bowels upon opening him, was that of proud flesh, which is generally left after an inflammation of those parts; I made an incision into the stomach, and it was corroded and gangrened in several places, evidently arising from some corrosive matter taken into the stomach and endangering the life: I found no particles of any poison in the stomach.</p>
               <p>Do you know what might be the corrosive matter that had been taken into the stomach? - Mineral poisons; there are different qualities of them.</p>
               <p>What are the mineral poisons? - Arsenick, corrosive sublimate, the oil of vitriol, preparations of lead; the preparations of lead do not act as corrosives upon the stomach. I saw him on the 22d of March, three days after he was dead; I was desired by the church wardens of the parish to attend; I opened him the day after.</p>
               <p>Would not some of the arsenick remain if it had been taken? - I apprehend very little, for nature makes an exertion to get rid of the poison by violent vomitings and purgings.</p>
               <p>What is the colour of arsenick? - White, red, and yellow.</p>
               <p>Is there any black arsenick? - No.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner Owen; she has lodged in my apartment twenty years; they lived as happy together as any body I ever saw; they had lived in a house up the yard, but they left it a little before, because it was too great a rent for them; they lived in great harmony together: this happened in my father's parlor.</p>
               <p>Was there any quarrel between the prisoner and the other woman that is dead? - No; I heard the woman say as she lay bad, she believed she gave it her very innocently. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177604170039"></xptr> at my father's door between five and six in the afternoon after tea, and a woman went by with something very dirty in her apron; she dropp'd two papers and pick'd them up again, and a little girl that was at the door, went to the kennel and picked up something that looked like brown bread, and she carried it in doors, and said, she had given it to my mother; I went in and they were breaking this cake among them; I took a bit and put it in my mouth; it was sweet but very nauseous, I spit it out again.</p>

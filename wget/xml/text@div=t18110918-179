               <p>Q. Do you remember a woman of the name of Williams and a woman of the name of Stevens coming to your house on the 22d of August last - A. I do, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, Sarah Stevens came for a quartern of gin, it came to fourpence, she offered me a sixpence; I told her it was a bad one, I kept the sixpence and gave it Kennersley, the officer. Williams came up at the same time and offered another sixpence o pay for the same gin. I told her that was a bad one also, I would have them taken up for smashers. They told me they took it of a woman that sat in the passage of my public-house; I sent for an officer. Tremer the officer came, and the woman slipped off the bench, I saw her hand go from her bosom, as if she was parting with something, I held the candle under the bench, there I saw a little bag, with four sixpences of the same shake, with some shot. I sent her over to the watchhouse. I afterwards looked in the same place were I found the bag; I found a shilling. The canvas bag was warm, as if it had been in some person's bosom.</p>

I know nothing of the prisoner, she was sitting in the house about half past eleven o'clock, I went into that public house with Williams. I had a pot of porter, was paid penny-peices for that; the prisoner was sitting in the passage, I never saw her before I went with the porter to Hannah williams. The prisoner asked me to give her a drink of beer. I did so, she then said for my good nature she would give the some money to fetch a quartern of gin, she put her hand in her bosom and gave me a sixpence out of the bag, I went to the bar for a quartern of gin, I gave him that same sixpence that I received of the prisoner for a quarter of gin; I had no other, nothing but a few penny-pieces. Mr. Osborne objected to it, and kept it.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been but two months out of my own country, and have been out of bed five weeks with this baby; I was put to bed on the road, I was coming to my husband. I sold my shift the last thing for a shilling; I changed that shilling I got two pennyworth of shop, and a pennyworth of bread; I had only then a sixpence and three penny-pieces in my pocket; I was going to Gravesend to my husband. Coming along the road I met with this woman, she said if I was to go to St. Giles's I might find some of my country people who would give me a lodging; she said come along with me; I was fatigued and weak, I could not walk. It was twelve o'clock, she took me to this public-house, she said, we can rest here and have part of a pint of beer; I sat down, this woman went for the pint of beer, I gave her sixpence; the other woman said, had we nor better have a drop of gin; I said, I do not mind. I was taken in custody, and by the Lord God I am in custody for holding.</p>

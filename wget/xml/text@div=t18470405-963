                  </hi> I keep a wholesale cigar manufactory. The pri-soner was in my employ as a tobacco-stripper—I stopped him as he was going to leave on the evening of the 24th of March—I spoke of sending for a constable—the prisoner said he had nothing on him, but when he found I was sending for a constable, he produced five cheroots from his pocket, and said it was the first time, and he was very sorry—I gave him into custody, and at the station one more cheroot was found on him—they were in such a state, that I could swear to them—they had been made that day, and were damp, not fit for sale—it was a general holiday that day, and I gave the prisoner and all the others one—there were five men at work.</p>

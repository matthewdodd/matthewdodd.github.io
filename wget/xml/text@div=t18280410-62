I heard a cry of Watch! and saw the prisoner running down the lane - I stopped him; the prosecutor came up in two or three minutes, and said he had knocked him down and taken his handkerchiefs; he threw away two handkerchiefs directly I took hold of him - I picked them up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

To tell you the truth I do not think he came honestly by them himself; he came into the house with a seafaring man, and called for gin; there was a dispute between them who should pay for it; the prosecutor said, "Never mind, I have only brought him here to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100056"></xptr>try to pick him up;" he produced these two handkerchiefs and about six duplicates of handkerchiefs for sale.</p>

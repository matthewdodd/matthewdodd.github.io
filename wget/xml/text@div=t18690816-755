                  </hi>. I am manager of the King's Arms, Uxbridge, of which Mr. Edge is landlord—on the evening of the 29th July I saw the prisoner standing at the bar, with a glass of stout in front of him—Mr. Beasley, who was in the bar, said, "You have soldiers billeted on you to-night?"—I said, "Yes; they have gone to bed"—Mr. Edge said, "It is getting late"—I said, "I am quite ready when these gentlemen are; it is 20 minutes past 12"—the prisoner said, "1 o'clock is the time to close," and that he should be served again—I said "We do not keep open till 1 o'clock"—he said, "I know the house better than you do, I shall be served again"—I said, "The law compels me to close at 1 o'clock, but there is no law to make me keep open"—he said, "I will dare you to put me out"—Mr. Edge turned out one gas burner, and I said, "I want to go to bed, our soldiers are going away in the morning, and I shall have to get up early; will you go out?"—he said he would not, he should stop till 1 o'clock, and dared me to put him out—we had a struggle, and fell together, and got up again—I held him at arm's length against the wall, getting him to the door—he could see into the street, and seeing a police-man he walked out—I held the door open, and he pushed me twice and said, "Skinner, you have the worst of it"—I directly felt blood running down the leg of my trowsers—I put my hand in my trowsers, and my hand was blood all over—no one had touched me but the prisoner.</p>

I am landlord of this house—I saw the prisoner there on 29th July—I wished him to leave, and Skinner also asked him to leave, but he refused and wanted more drink, but I would not let him have it—Skinner attempted to turn him out, there was a scuffle, and they both fell and struggled while they were down—I opened the door and called a police-man, who came in and called the prisoner out, and he went out—Skinner went outside the door and then found that he was wounded—I fetched a surgeon.</p>

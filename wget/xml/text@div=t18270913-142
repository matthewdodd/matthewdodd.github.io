            . I keep a silversmith's shop. The prisoner came into my shop, two or three months ago - I cannot tell whether it was June or July - I was before the Magistrate, but do not know when - I have a very short memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to the Magistrate, at the examination, on the 24th of August: - "The prisoner came to my shop, and threw the spoon on my counter - I asked where he got it; he said his mother sent him with it?" A. Yes; it was broken. I do not know his mother - I weighed it; it was 13/4 oz. - I paid him 8s. 3d.; here is the spoon - I live in at No. 4, Upper East Smithfield, near the Mint - I deal in clothes as well as silver - I did not ask where his mother lived. I sell my silver to the refiners.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this spoon worn out? A. It is; because it is broken; it is not worn out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What day did you buy it of me? A. I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's son; she informed me she had lost a spoon. I was accidentally passing Israel's shop, about a week after, and saw a spoon which appeared to me to be the same. I got an officer, who went and brought up Israel; the prisoner had been in my employ, and was discharged on the 6th. If this spoon is ours, it is much disfigured since I saw it last. I told the Magistrate the spoon produced there was mine - I cannot swear to it now. I knew the spoon I saw in the window was my mother's; if this is the same, it has been much worn, and knocked about since. I believe the one I saw to be ours, but the parts of this do not fit the bowl.</p>

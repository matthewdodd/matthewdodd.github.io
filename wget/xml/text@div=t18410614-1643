                  </hi>. I live with my father William Newcomb, in Bengal-terrace, East India-road. The prisoner was our servant—she went away on the 24th of May, and did not return till the afternoon—I went down into the kitchen, an officer was sent for, her box searched, and all these thing found.</p>

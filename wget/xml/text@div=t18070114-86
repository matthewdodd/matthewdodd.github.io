               <p>- VISCAR. Q. Do you know these lads. - A. Three of them, Taylor, Knightley, and Foley. On the 12th of December, at about a quarter after ten at night, as I was going along, I saw them three in Spital fields market, I saw them at a cheesemonger's shop, outside, placed where they put the shutters in the day time, I and Mr. Hart desired them to come out; they were not dressed as they are now, they were meanly dressed indeed. They came out, and we took them to the watch-house, and Mr. Hart will tell you what he found upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hart take any thing from either of their persons. - A. Foley had a shirt in his breeches, and a check apron was found upon Taylor. Taylor is thirteen years old, Foley eleven, and Knightley eleven.</p>
               <p>- HART. I am a constable. On the night of the 12th of December last, the prisoners were brought to the watchhouse by the patrol, Taylor, Foley, and Kightley; the patrol told me he found them under the place where the cheesemonger's shutters were placed, and while the little one was running away, the shirt fell out of his breeches, here it is. I took this child's great coat from Kightley, from under the waistband of his breeches, and this shirt and check apron were buttoned under the coat of Taylor; I asked them how they came by them, they told me they found them by Well street playhouse. We did not believe the story; the next morning they said two other boys brought it to them, who represented that they had found them there, and they had kept them for these two boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the other two boys. - A. No; and the next morning they said they took them from a China shop in Old Gravel lane. Mrs. Briscoe afterwards came and claimed them; they told us that the other two boys were their companions, and we brought them up by the order of the magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Poultry. On Thursday evening, the 7th of September, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in the back of my shop, and heard a noise in the shop—my son ran forwards—I saw the goods moving, but did not see the party—I ran into Frederick-place, and</p>

In consequence of the noise I heard, I ran out, and saw the prisoner turning into Grocer's Hall court, with this coat under his arm—I gave an alarm; and when he got to Dove-court, which leads to the Old Jewry, he threw the coat down—I still followed him, and stopped him at the corner of Frederick-place—this is the coat—it is my father's.</p>

I took him to the watch house, and on the Monday he was sent to the Justice's ; and there I was bound over to appear in this affair: Ashford confessed before the Justice that he and Furbiland broke open Blewet's house; he said they got in at the street door, and went up the stairs, and that at the top of the stairs, for fear of making a noise in breaking the door open, they got out at a little place on the top of the tiles, and made their way through the tiles into a cock lost; there they lay together till they thought Blewet was gone to bed; then they made their way through the cieling of the room, where the things were; that they took away the laths and plaster, and tied a rope to the rasters, and so got into the room. Furbiland denied it; Ashford said they were very much put to it for a light; they had never a candle.</p>

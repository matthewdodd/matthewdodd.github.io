                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 96). I know the prisoner Garwood—he is ostler at the Rising Sun, at Ilford—Porter was a master carter. On the 1st of April, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners in company—I saw Porter carry a trass of hay from the pre<lb></lb>mises of the Rising Sun, and place it in the hind part of his cart—he was driving the cart himself—he went to the horses' head and did something to the bridle, watered his horses, then followed me down the road about a quarter of a mile, and there overtook me—I asked him where he bought the hay in bis cart?—he said, "At a corn-chandler's"—I asked "What corn-chandlers?—he said, "I shall not tell you"—I said, "How can you say you bought it at a corn-chandler's when I saw you bring it from the stable of the Rising Sun"—he then said, "I know I did."</p>

I keep the Rising Sun at East Ham, and have a hay and straw loft in my stable—Garwood was the ostler—the key of the door hung outside the stable—I saw the truss of hay which was found in the cart on the bench, but did not examine it to see if it was like mine.</p>

               <p>—I baited at the Rising Sun—my bones consumed part of the clover-hay on their way to town, and I left the rest at the Ewipg Sun—it was rather better than a truss—my master does not authprize me to leave it there, but I always do it—I never got it back again—it was gone when I returned—I left it in Garwood's care, in the doubie-dppr stable—Garwood told me to put it there—when I got there on my way back, Lord told vie I had better not stop there, for my hay was taken away, and the police had got my corn—I have seen the hay taken from Porter's cart—here is part of it—I know it, and can say it if part of the hay J left in the stable—it is the same as master had at home, which it was cut from—there was a binding on the truss, but I did not tie it myself—I had seen it tied and am able to say it is a portion of what I had left at the fitting Sun—I saw the whole truss at Ilford station, and this is a sample which I took from it.</p>

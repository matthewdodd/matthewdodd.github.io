I am an officer of the Central London District School, at Hanwell—on the 4th of March, about 11 o'clock, I was crossing the yard and going towards the day-room, when I saw a large number of children running out—I ran in and hurried the remainder of the children out, as I saw that the end of the house was on fire—the inside of the building is lined with wood but the outside is galvanised iron—I ran for water—one boy threw a painfull over me—the fire was inside—the flames were 10 feet high—the hut was so damaged that we had to pull it down—the wood was burnt nearly to the ceiling—about 240 children were in the room at the time of the fire.</p>

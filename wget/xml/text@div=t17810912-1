I felt a person about my pocket; I immediately put my hand down towards my pocket, and felt that person's hand: I struck the hand, which was close by my pocket. I immediately turned round, and saw the prisoner standing close to me: she was the only person that was very near me. I immediately charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120003"></xptr> her with having stolen my handkerchief, which she denied. Upon putting my hand into my pocket, I found my handkerchief, but missed my snuff-box; this is it (producing it). I then told her she had not got my handkerchief, but had stolen my snuff-box. I seized her left-hand immediately, which I had before seized; she had drawn it from mine, and had put it behind her, under her cloak; she put her other hand behind her, and seemed to be shifting something. I laid hold of her right-hand, keeping the other fast in my hand, upon which I heard something drop on the pavement; I looked down, and saw it was my snuff-box: I kept fast hold of her. I called a hackney-coach, and get another person to go in the coach with me, and we carried her to St. Martin's watch-house. There was a croud immediately after I secured her, but there was no other person but the prisoner near me at the time it was taken out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Was it light? - It was so near the lamps that I had a perfect sight of the prisoner.</p>

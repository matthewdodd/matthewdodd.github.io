                  </hi>. I live in Durham-place west, Hackney-road. The prisoner Crispin occupied a house of mine, No. 20, Holy well-street, Strand,—he took it some time previous to Lady-day—the rent was to commence on Lady-day—I cannot tell how long he lived there—I gave him some time to put the windows in, and he got a man to put them in for him—I had had a very bad tenant there before—Crispin referred me to some person in Doctors' Commons, a Mr. Steel, I believe, and I received this letter answering my inquiries—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Knowing Mr. Crispin, who was lately a tenant of mine in the country, I can have no hesitation in saying that anything he promises or engages will be paid and attended to—he has paid me, and I entertain a high respect for him"—I went about this person but could not see the man—I have not got my rent of Crispin—I have not got my house, and do not know who has—I suppose it is some of the parties in connexion with Mr. Crispin.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hosier-lane. On the Saturday previous to Adams and Nott opening the shop in Holy well-street, I was at the Queen's Head, Red Lion-square—(Crispin had opened it before, and I had been there when it was in his possession)—I had been at Mr. Maton's, the Sugar Loaf, in Bell yard, Fleet-street, and we adjourned to the Queen's Head—I had been introduced by Mr. Nott to Henry Adams, in Bell-yard, Fleet-street, four or five weeks previous to the opening of the concern—Mr. Adams, I should say, is thirty-two or thirty-three years of age, a little taller than I am, with sandy whiskers, and, as near as I recollect, brown hair—he told me he was employed by Mr. Smith, down at Bristol, for eight years, as a ship-joiner, and Mr. Nott stated he was a respectable man, and worked for his brother eight years—we had several meetings afterwards, but on the Saturday previous to the opening of the shop there was an appointed meeting, to determine as to what the shop should be opened as—it was to be opened on the Monday or Tuesday following, provided we could get the cards printed, and the name up—Adams asked me what I could suggest best for them to call themselves—I suggested to call themselves general salesmen—it was agreed to call themselves" Colonial Agents and General Shippers"—this was settled when we got to the Queen's Head—Mr. Nott said, "You had better put,' <hi rend="italic">Nott Bene,</hi> Manufacturers of the best French Hats'"—I said that seemed an analogous sort of concern, they had better not put that—he said, "Yes, because I am a hat-manufacturer"—I wrote this on the cards for them, by their direction, but I do not think the cards were printed—Crispin was not there at that time, but I knew him before, and had seen him with Adams at the Sugar Loaf two or three times, and had seen him casually, about fourteen months ago, with Mr. Pack, a leather cutter, in Brick-lane, Old-street—on the Friday after the meeting at Red Lion-square, I saw Nott and Adams at the Sugar Loaf, in Bell-yard, Fleet street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190146"></xptr>
               <p>—Adams said to me, "We got some blacking in to-day, do you know anywhere where we can sell it?"—I said I knew a party in King. street, Minories, and another in Bishopsgate-street, who would be likely to give a fair price for it—he said, "What do you call a fair price?"—I said blacking was now a drug in the market—I did not sell it, but I saw Martin the next day, who came out of a public-house, where he had been in company with Adams and Nott—Martin told me the blacking was sold—on the Saturday night after the blacking was received, I was drinking with Adams at the Sugar Loaf, and Smith came in—she said, <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi> Adams, I want to speak to you"—Adams said, "There is something up, come out"—we went to the bottom of the court, and there Smith aid there was a b row—there were two policemen and the carman then, and they were going to break in the bulk—she said, "I started the carman off, because I told him the blacking was all there, and Mr. Adams was a highly respectable man"—she said, "I am not going to take all the blame on my shoulders for a lousy 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was all we had"—I said Adams was afraid he would be taken—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> Adams need not be afraid of me, I will never <hi rend="italic">split</hi> upon him"—Adams told me to go down and see hot it was, and tell them it would be paid on Monday—I asked Adams who ordered the blacking—he said, "Nott did, and when the blacking came I told the carman Adams was just stepped out for ten minutes"—I went to Holy well-street with Smith—I found the shop was shut up—Smith said, "I have told the carman the goods are still on the premises, Mr. Adams is a highly respectable man, and he can get his money on Monday"—I went back to Adams, and said, "There is a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at your place, you can do at you like about going down"—he said, "I shall not go, d the blacking, I wish I had had nothing to do with it; it only fetched a lousy 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Nott went to order it, without saying any thing to me; in fact, I was taken quite at a <hi rend="italic">non-plus"</hi>—he said it was sold, and had fetched 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was divided between him, Nott, and Mr. Crispin—Crispin told me the reason he abandoned Adams was, that Adams said he had taken it, and could do as he liked; and said, "I am going to put up my name on Monday, and make it look <hi rend="italic">bona fide;"</hi> and he said, "What is to come in is to be divided between Nott, Adams, and me"—Crispin stated he had got all he could get, he could get no more, and now there was a <hi rend="italic">stink</hi> about the sashes and stoves that had been measured for; he could go on no further on his own account, and Adams must do what he could.</p>

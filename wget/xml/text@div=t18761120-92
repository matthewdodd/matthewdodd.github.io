                  </hi>. I am a gardener and live at 4, Aberdeen Terrace, Mitcham—the prisoner lived next door, but one to me—he had a wife and step-daughter—on the evening of 8th August, about 10.30, I was at my own door with Bennett, his wife and my wife, I. saw the prisoner's wife and daughter come to the house, the deceased entered the house first, the daughter followed, and as soon as she entered the house the prisoner came and pushed her out of doors, and. said she should not enter the house that night, he then shut the door, the daughter remaining outside—I heard some words inside between the prisoner and his wife about a shilling; I only heard him speaking—I also heard the sound of some blows—in a few seconds he came outside and pushed the daughter down in some potatoes—the deceased then came to her daughter's assistance, and the prisoner turned to her and hit her three distinct times with his fist, as far as I could'see about the chest and ribs; they were three blows in succession with his fist; I could not say whether they were hard blows—as he gave the third blow I caught hold of him from behind by the muscles of his arms—she fell as he gave her the third blow—I hoard a sound as he gave the blows—she fell on the doorstep of No. 7, the back of her head came in contact with the door<lb></lb>step—she appeared to be in a dying condition—I pushed the prisoner indoors and went to assist the deceased, as she was lying on the ground—I went and fetched the doctor, I fancied I could hear a groan as she lay on the ground, I thought I could hear her groan once—I left my wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett with her while I went for the doctor—I returned before the doctor, she had then been carried indoors and laid on the sofa—she was dead; I had told the prisoner while his wife was lying on the ground to go and fetch a doctor, and he said he would not; some of the women round advised him to go and fetch some brandy, and he did so.</p>

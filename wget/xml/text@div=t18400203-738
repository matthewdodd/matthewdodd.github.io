The prisoner was horse-keeper to my father—these sovereigns were my wages, and they were in a purse in my box—I saw it safe at eight o'clock on the morning of the 30th of December, and missed it at seven o'clock in the evening—the box was unlocked—the prisoner lodged in the next room—I saw him down stairs at ten o'clock that day.</p>

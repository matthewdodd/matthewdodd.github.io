             sworn. - I am inspector of the Excise watch: On the 7th of June last, about seven o'clock in the evening, John Yorke, one of Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman's men, called upon me at my lodgings, and required my preference; I went down to the quays and there were four or five sticks of liquorice brought to me; the prisoner was present; I asked what he had been about, and the prisoner said there was no harm intended; I asked him if he had any about him, and he said, no; and upon searching him I found one stick in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What is it worth-five pounds? - A. I am not a grocer, and I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it worth five shillings? - A. No, nor five-pence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was any thing said about where it was taken from? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN YORKE sworn. - I am a labouring man:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090005"></xptr>I was at work Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman; I saw the prisoner take three sticks of Spanish juice out of one chest that laid on the right hand side between Ralph's-quay and Young's-quay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner is a married man? - A. I do not know; he has got three children.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to that stick? - A. No, but I can swear that I saw him take three sticks out of the chest.(The constable produced the Spanish liquorice.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character; a great number attended, but the Jury thought it unnecessary to hear them.</p>

               <p>Tustin. No; when I found myself robbed the prisoner was gone; on the 19th, which was the Monday, I went and found her at the same place; she charged the other prisoner with being concerned with her; upon which I called a constable and had them before the justice; I have not got any of my things again; when we took them up they both owned they sold the watch in Hungerford-market, for half a guinea and a gallon of beer; they gave no account of the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that night?</p>
               <p>Tustin. I had been at Mr. Clements's at the Carpenter's Arms; I was coming out of the country from a job.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you lost it before you got there?</p>

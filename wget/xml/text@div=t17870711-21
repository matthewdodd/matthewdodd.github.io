               <p>I am a pawnbroker, this watch was pawned with me on the first of June, about half past seven in the morning; the prisoner at the bar pledged it in the name of Williams; he said Williams was a friend of his, and lived at North-end, Tottenham Court-road; the prisoner said his name was J. Evans, he lived at No. 19, in Wells-street; this is the written direction which he gave me; on the Monday following I saw the watch advertised, it was carried to the advertisement, and the next morning the prosecutor appeared and owned his watch, and in about an hour he returned with Mr. Fletcher, the clerk of Litchfield-street, and me and Mr. Macdonald went to look for the prisoner; but we did not go to No. 19, left the prisoner should get off; the next morning we went to No. 19, and got a description of such a man as the prisoner; we went up stairs, and the man we had the information of, was not the man; we came down again and enquired at the next door, and about five yards off I saw the prisoner in company with another man that was in Wells-street; I left Macdonald in the house, No. 19; I went out and went back again to tell Macdonald; and immediately as I turned, the prisoner turned and parted from the other man; we both went after him, he walked very briskly into a house No. 56; we followed him, we heard him run up stairs, and I heard a noise, and I said to Macdonald as we were going up, he is putting something away; Macdonald went up first and took the prisoner, I went up immediately after, and Macdonald took him into the next room to search him, and in looking about I saw on a shelf, just by where the prisoner was taken, laying on a hat box, this pistol loaded with powder and ball; I was not quite time enough to see him taken; it was laying on a shelf on the stair-case, the doors were all locked, he could not get up any higher; we took the prisoner to St. Ann's watch-house, it was in the morning, and we went back again to the house, No. 56, to enquire where he lived, and they gave us directions that he lived at No. 9, Booth's-court, Well's-street; we went to his lodgings, and on the mantle-piece we found this piece of paper.</p>

               <p>(Deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Here is my cypher upon it, there was a steel chain to it and seals, and brass key; I believe I gave him ten or fifteen shillings, but I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you any of the tickets with you? - No, I returned them all to him, he said they were his; I found these balls in the box, that was all, except the tickets which I returned.</p>

               <p>Perhaps your know where this prisoner lodged? - He lodged in Booth's Court. No. 9.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it fair to ask Mr. Steel, what time the horse was brought home that night.</p>
               <p>Steel. I was going to buy some straw when he hired it on Thursday, about ten in the morning, he came home on the Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110039"></xptr>about ten at night, and he was out the two days together, it was a black horse.</p>
               <p>The Jury desired to withdraw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the Jury withdraw, am I permitted to make an observation? I think it will be necessary for me to observe to your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury, how Robert Williams came by these pistols; he borrowed the pistols of me, I had been repeatedly out and fired at a mark at the end of Gower Street, Bedford Square.</p>

               <p>Jury. We are very desirous to recommend this prisoner to his Majesty's mercy.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I wish my recommendation may be added.</p>
               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice WILSON.</p>
               <p>When this prisoner came up to receive sentence of death, he thus addressed the Court; My Lord, as human wisdom is liable to error, I beg to be permitted to make a few remarks: The prosecutor's evidence did not in the least tend to convict me; on the contrary, he on his oath said, the person who robbed him, was a tall genteel slim young man; neither of which descriptions I answer. It was likewise proved that such a person as

             lived at No. 36, the house where I was apprehended, who on that day absconded, and in whose name I pawned the watch; these circumstances proved on oath, I hope your Lordship will take notice of, and recommend me to the King and Council.</p>

On the 17th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was in an inner room on the ground floor, and heard a noise at the lobby door; I looked, and saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, closing the street door - he was then going out: I saw him sufficiently to be able to recognize him; I had seen the lobby door latched about five minutes before, and think I must have heard if anybody came in after that, as the room I was in is about twenty feet from the door; I looked in the direction the prisoner was walking, and saw he had a picture under his arm, which had previously hung in the lobby - it was framed; I caught sight of him before he got one third of the way to Fleet-street - he turned the corner into Fleet-street; I lost sight of him for about three minutes: I laid hold of him within ten minutes from the time of his leaving the door; he had then got this picture in his hand - it is a sporting piece, and is Mr. Wray's property. If anybody had opened the door I think I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What door are you speaking of? A. The outer street door is generally open, but the inner one, communicating with the lobby, is invariably closed; if that had been open I must have heard it, as there was no door shut between me and that door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear it opened? was it that that attracted your attention? A. I cannot say; I heard a noise, but whether it was the door being opened I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came up to me, was I walking or running? A. Walking; he did not object to my taking the picture from him; he was confused, and when I took it from him he ran away, and dodged me about the shambles of the market, but he made no violent resistance.</p>

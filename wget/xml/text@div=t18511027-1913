                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper, of Tottenham-court-road. On 10th Oct. the prisoner came to my shop, soon after 6 o'clock—he, asked me, in a low voice, if I was Mr. Heale's tailor—(there is a Mr. Heale, who lives in the same road)—I told him I was not—he hesitated a moment, and said he could not understand it, for Mr. Heale had sent him to a tailor of a name very much like mine, either Batton or Battam—he said the article he required was a warm winter waistcoat, and if I would let him see some he would make a selection—I did, and he got me to write a description of them on one of my cards—he said he would take it to Mr. Heale, and said he supposed if Mr. Heale wrote on the card, and made an order for it, I would let him have it, and he would send the money by his clerk in the morning—I told him that would be quite satisfactory—he selected a waistcoat—I wrote a descrip<lb></lb>tion of it, with the price, on one of the cards—he left my shop with it, and said he would return in about half an hour—wishing to be satisfied I sent one of my lads to follow him, and see if he went to Mr. Heale's—my lad returned, and from the information he brought me I ran down to Mr. Heale's, and was informed he was at Hastings—the prisoner had before told me that he was not in the business in Tottenham-court-road, but he lived at Mr. Heale's private residence, in Euston-square—a little before 9, the same evening, the prisoner came again, and told me he had called for the waistcoat—I asked him if he had brought the order from Mr. Heale—he said he had, and took my card out of his pocket—this is it—here is first my writing on it, with the description of the waistcoat, and then here is, "Please let the bearer have the vest at the above price. Heale and Sons, 159, Tottenham-court-road"—I said, "Is this Mr. Heale's writing?"—he told me it was—I papered up the waistcoat, and gave it to him—on leaving he said if the waistcoat was not approved of by Mr. Heal he supposed I would change it—I said, "Certainly"—I followed him out, and he was taken by the policeman—this is the waistcoat—it is worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Battam—I followed the prisoner, by his direction, on the evening of 10th Oct., from my master's shop to Mr. Strange's public-house, at the corner of Alfred-street—he went in—I stood outside the door—a pen and ink was brought him, and I saw</p>

I reside at 63, Euston-square, and carry on busi<lb></lb>ness, as a bedding-manufacturer, at 196, Tottenham-court-road—this is not my writing on this card, nor did I ever authorise any one to write it, or to go to Mr. Battam's for a waistcoat—I have a slight knowledge of the prisoner—he was never in my employ—I have not seen him for some years, till he called on me about a month before this—he is no relation of mine, and does not reside with me.</p>

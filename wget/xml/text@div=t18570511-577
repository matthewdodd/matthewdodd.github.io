                  </hi>. I am under barman to Mr. Sinclair, who keeps the Crown, in High Street, Bloomsbury.

               <p>him change for that, and put that in the same place with the other—there were only those two shillings there—after that, Mr. Wilcox came to that till for silver, and he saw the two shillings—he said they were bad, and that he saw me serve the man—in five or six minutes afterwards the prisoner came in again, and Mr. Wilcox served him with 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin, and he put down another shilling—I saw Mr. Wilcox take it up, and he took hold of the prisoner by the collar, and jumped over the counter—he told the prisoner it was bad—he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at that house. On Saturday, 4th April, I saw the prisoner, about half past 8 o'clock—the last witness served him with 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin, and he gave him a shilling—the prisoner came in again in three or four minutes, and the witness served him again—he came in again in five or six minutes afterwards; he came towards both of us, and said, "A pennyworth of gin," and put a bad shilling into my hand—I had looked in the till, and found two bad shillings—I laid hold of him, and told him it was bad, and he had been offering bad money there that night—I gave him in charge, and gave the three shillings to the constable.</p>

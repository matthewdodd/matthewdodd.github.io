On the 7th of November the prisoner came and asked the price of a smelling-bottle; I said 2s. - she said she would give me 1s. 6d.; I said it was the custom of the place to make two prices, but I had some at 1s 6d.; I stooped down to get them; she said she would give 1s. 6d. for the one I first showed her, which I refused, and she went away - I afterwards saw her in custody; I had not sold her any vinegarette, but this one was shown to me - it is mine, and had been at my counter when the prisoner was there.</p>

            . I assist Mrs. Mariner. On the 7th of November I put out this vinegarette; I know it by my figures being on it - I had not sold it; I recollect its being missed - the prisoner was at the counter that afternoon, and went round to the other counters; I heard there was a person taken - the Policeman produced this vinegarette to me in the room adjoining.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had sold some vinagarettes in the course of your business? A. Not that day.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you take off the tickets when you sell them? A. No - I am sure this particular vinegarette was on the tray that morning.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE LOVICK. I am inspectress of the Bazaar. I recollect the prisoner being there on the 7th of November - I followed her down stairs; she went through a door to a private door, and asked to go to a back place -I was close to her; she went into a room, and threw these articles behind a basket, out of her muff; I asked why she threw them there - she said, "They are my own, what have you to do with it?" or something of that kind- I said, "Why have you thrown them there?" I picked them up, and gave them to the officer - this vinegarette was among them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you quite as sure you delivered this to the officer, as you did the brooch? A. Yes - I did not see Mr. Burrows; she said she had bought these things, or something of that kind - I cannot undertake to state every word she said - I heard afterwards that Mr. Burrows had the brooch; I saw him that day, after the things were taken.</p>

            . I am the Police-officer. I produce the vinegratte, which I got from Lovick - I did not part with the possession of it at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you as sure you did not part with that as the brooch? A. I saw the gentleman with the brooch, but not the bottle - I saw Mr. Burrows in the room with Lovick for about two minutes, and then we went out at the door while Lovick searched the prisoner- I do not know what became of Burrows; I am confident he did not go away with the brooch after I had it.</p>
               <p>Fourteen witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

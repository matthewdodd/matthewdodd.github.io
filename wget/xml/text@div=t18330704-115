I had a search warrant directed to him at that house; I explained to him what I had come for; he said, he had none of Mr. Morley's property; I searched the room he was in, and in a trunk of which he had the key, I found some articles not the subject of this indictment; he gave me the key of that trunk, and I opened it; I asked how he accounted for the things in the box; he said, "My landlady bought them;" I asked, who she was; he said, "Mrs. Lee," and she was in the back parlour; I proceeded to the back room, and saw the female prisoner; I asked her if her name was Lee; she said, it was not Lee, but that she was the person I wanted; I said, "What is your name;" Bayly was not present, the door was open, he might have heard, it is not impossible, but not very probable I think, as I left Goddard with him, I did not hear them talking; it was in the adjoining room at some distance, the passage being between the two rooms; I think I spoke loud enough for them to hear it; the female prisoner did not speak loud enough for them to hear.</p>

No, my object was to recover some of the property; he said,"I only took twelve pieces of cambric;" nothing else passed that day; on the following morning; I told him I had learnt, that a small deal box full of cambric was taken away altogether; I said, "There is a small deal box taken out from the warehouse; taken out from the other boxes, one of four; - and I know you have pledged the cambric, but what have you done with the box? - I did not see it in your house;" he said "It was cut up, and burnt in the kitchen fire."</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. If this had been yours, is there anything to show when they have been missed? A. Yes, they have been missed between April and June; I can swear positively to the box and the handkerchiefs fit it, and agree in every respect with the price on the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your handkerchiefs packed in this sort of box? A. Yes, there is originally, two marks on the box; I was at the prisoner's lodging at one time when they were searching; I think it was on the 26th of June; I found in taking the fancy shavings out of the fire place, four tickets, they do not relate to this charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have said, you have not taken stock between April and June? A. No, not of these goods; I have not missed this handkerchief, nor the twelve cambric ones; I cannot say the handkerchiefs are the property of my employers; but I believe they are; we are in the habit of selling such things; I cannot swear the shawl was not sold; if the handkerchiefs had been my masters I cannot positively say they have not been sold; they are usually sold with the box; we have sold some scores of boxes marked in that way; I suppose other warehousemen sell handkerchiefs in the same sort of boxes.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Where were these kept? A. In the Scotch warehouse which the prisoner had access to; it was in the floor below his bed room; he could get to it from his bed room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are they such articles which a man, in the condition of the male prisoner, would purchase for his own use? A. He would not; they are for women's pocket handkerchiefs; we sell them at 7s. 6d. a dozen.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you not many boxes with the same mark as that, which you have sold? A. Yes, we have some of this mark, and others of a different mark; all those at 7s. 6d. a box, are marked in the same way; we have about twenty men; if the shopmen wanted any goods we were at liberty to have them, by entering them in the book; if I had bought goods of my employers, I should either enter them as ready money, and pay the money, or enter them in my own name, - the young men buy articles at times.</p>

            . Q. Did you not state before, you were not certain whether you pawned the things in the box in May, or June? A. Yes; I cannot tell - I am almost sure it was May - it might be in June.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know when the prisoners were married? A. Yes; it was before the marriage; before the day I pawned the box and contents I had not received from the female prisoner any goods of that kind; I received pieces of French cambrics from her more than once - I had a great many from her.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. As far as you believe, Mrs. Bayly came by them honestly, or you would not have had anything to do with them? A. No; she told me her first husband kept a linen-draper's shop.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Can you tell about how many pieces of cambric you received from her, or saw in her possession before the day you pawned the box? A. I am not sure; I cannot say - I should suppose eight or nine pieces, worth £1 each piece - they were new; I pawned them for £1 each; I never saw above one of these pieces or so, in her possession at a time, when she gave them to me to pawn; I have also seen crape shawls in her possession - I think I pawned about six; I remember being in a cab with Mrs. Lee, before the box was pawned; there were some pieces of French cambrics in the cab - six or seven; they were taken to pawnbrokers in Shoreditch or Whitechapel, to different pawnbrokers - I was the person who generally went into the shop to pawn them; she told me, it being such a distance off, that I was to tell the pawnbroker it came from the street opposite - I was to say the name of the street opposite; that they came from that street; we had come from South-street in the cab - Mrs. Bayly lived in South-street at that time; I was in the habit of seeing Mr. Bayly there at that time - he did not sleep there; I have, since this has been inquired about, been round to the different pawnbrokers with Mr. Morley, and the officer, and showed him the places; I took one or two light shawls,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040092"></xptr>besides the cambric, to Whitechapel - they were not pawned with the cambric, but on the same day; I did not take more than one piece to each pawnbroker - I went to six pawnbroker's with the cambric, and to two pawnbroker's with the shawls - the whole eight pawnbroker's were in the neighbourhood of Shoreditch and Whitechapel; the shawls were new - on the 27th of May, I took a piece of cambric to St. George's-circus, and pawned it for £1; I went to Collins's in Shoreditch - Mrs. Bayly told me that her husband kept a linen-draper's shop - that this was the remainder of her stock, and she wished to dispose of it; I did not leave her service before she married the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you say, she said she was desirous of disposing of it, you mean the large stock; she did not say that respecting the box of handkerchiefs? A. No.</p>

             re-examined. This I know by a number on it, and know it has never been sold; it belongs to Mr. Morley; the other piece is not numbered, but is the same make, and I have no doubt out of the same box - I believe they had not been sold, but cannot speak positively to it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Point out the mark on the piece you know? A. Here it is; it enables me to say it has never been sold; because there never was any sold out of the box, corresponding with this mark - you will find No. 2296 on it; that is not the number of the box - the box is No. 3; all the pieces in the box were different numbers - I believe No. 2296 was missing from that box; I looked to see, and did not find it in the box - It is difficult to say whether this is No. 2290, or No. 2296 - it is either No. 2290, or No. 2296; I will swear it is not No. 2299 - perhaps I did not look carefully enough before; No. 2290, and No. 2296 are both missing - I know they have not been sold, because I had the invoice in my own pocket, and nobody else knew the price of them, and could not have sold them; they came in three or four months ago, and not a piece in that box was sold - nineteen pieces were missing out of the box, corresponding with that number - I have not got the numbers of the nineteen pieces - I can say this is one of them, because it corresponds with those left - because the figures are the same hand-writing, and each piece of cambric is numbered; I cannot swear that the manufacturer might not have numbered two pieces alike - I don't think it probable; to the best of my belief, this number is No. 2290, and not No. 2299.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. About three months and a half ago, the cambrics came into your stock? A. They did; the box contained twenty-five pieces, according to the invoice; I took off the lid and saw the box was full - the pieces are numbered consecutively - I have two more pieces from the box here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the nineteen pieces missing, numbered beyond No. 2296? A. Some above, and some below; these things were under my particular management - I know the pieces the pawnbroker has produced, had never been sold.</p>
               <p>- BECK. I am a pawnbroker; I have a piece of cambric pawned on the 1st of June; I live at No. 94, Blackfriars-road; I took it in pawn from a young woman giving the name of Lee - I could not swear to her; it was not the female prisoner; I have seen the female witness; it was a person of her description, but I cannot swear to her positively - I don't remember her; this is the duplicate I gave for it.</p>

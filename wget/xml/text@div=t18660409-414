               <p>, I keep the Alleyne's Head public-house, Dulwich—about 8 or 9 days previous to 14th February, I took the prisoner into my service from a registry office as potboy—on 14th I gave him a holiday—my wife had complained of illness during the day, and she went to bed between 8 and 9, and my son Alfred went to bed about 11 o'clock; I do not know at what time the servant went—I do not know what time the prisoner came home, but I saw him between 6 and 7 in the evening—about twenty minutes to 12, I told the prisoner to go to bed, as I wanted him to assist me in the morning to clean the tap-room—he then went to the kitchen, which is on the ground floor (<hi rend="italic">plan produced</hi>)—I went into the parlour and sat with three or four customers till nearly 12 o'clock—they left, and I closed the door just as Norwood clock was striking 12—I locked it, bolted it, and then went into the bar—I got a candle and lit it—I fastened a pair of sliding doors, which prevents any one going into the bar parlour or bar—there is a back door leading into the pothouse yard, but I did not see to that—I un<lb></lb>locked a cupboard on the left side of the bar parlour door, took out the cash box, and put a lot of silver in it—I placed the cash box on a table in the bar parlour, which is under the window opposite the yard—I made a noise in emptying the silver into the box—there was nearly 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I then went down the cellar, the key of which is kept in the bar—the cellar door is on the left hand in the passage—I unlocked the door, went down, and turned off the gas—before doing that I looked and saw everything was safe—there are two cellars, one under the bar parlour, and one under the bar—there are four cellars altogether—there is a wine cellar which is always kept locked with a padlock—I examined the cellar flap, which leads into</p>

On returning from the cellar, I was struck with a hatchet on the head and on the shoulders. The person who struck me passed by me, and ran up stairs. He had on a coloured shirt and coloured stockings. That is the man," looking towards the prisoner—he said to his son, who was in the room, "You charge him"—I then told the prisoner that he was charged with feloniously assaulting his master, with intent to murder him, and that he need not answer me unless he chose—he made no answer—I handed him over to a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Dulwich—I was called to Mr. Hill's about half-past 12 on the morning of the 15th February—he was in his bedroom—I examined him, and found a severe contused wound near his left ear, and another contused wound at the back of his head—the bone was laid bare—there was a severe contusion on the right side of his forehead, and an incised wound on his right cheek; a slight bruise on the point of his left shoulder, and another at the back of his left shoulder-blade—his left shoulder itself was broken—I have seen the axe, and I think the contused wounds might have been inflicted by the back, and the incised wounds by the blade of it.</p>

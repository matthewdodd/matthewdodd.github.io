I am a farrier—on 9th August, I lived at Hodden's lodging-house, in Pimlico Road—between 3 and 4 o'clock that afternoon I was taking my tea—the prisoner was lodging there at the time, and was sitting in the kitchen at a table opposite me—he jumped up and began handling me very violently—I thought he was joking at first—he thrust his knuckles into my throat, it caused me very great pain, and made me cry excessively—I said "I never said a word to you"—he seized me by the throat, and kept doing so ten or twenty different times—he then pushed his hand down the side of my trousers, and said he would have my money—he felt some money—he then dragged me by the collar into the back kitchen; he then thrust his hand down again, and pulled the pocket of my trousers out with violence—this is the pocket—he then went into the kitchen, and said "I have got his money, and now I will go and spend it; I believe he has got more, and I will have that"—he gave me the pocket—I took it from him because I was apprehensive of further violence; I went to the station and gave information, and he was taken (into custody—there was 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pocket—I had a little money in my other pocket, but he did not find that.</p>

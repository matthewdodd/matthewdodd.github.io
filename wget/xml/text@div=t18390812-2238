                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in New-road, St. George-in-the-East. I only know the prisoner from this occurrence—I believe he is a tailor, but he has been a bricklayer in the country—I had seen his wife, before this affair, at a cousin of hers whom I attended, but I did not recollect her—she was about twenty-two yean of age—the had had one child, which died, I believe, at eleven months old—they had no children living—I was called in to her on the night of the 14th of July, about one o'clock—the prisoner fetched me—he requested I would come immediately with him to attend his wife, who, he said, was far advanced in labour, and there was no time to be lost—I got up imme<lb></lb>diately and went with him—I answered him out of window—he waited outside while I got up and came out—nothing but common conversation passed between ns on our way to his wife—I do not believe ten words passed—that was nothing at all about his wife, except with regard to her being in labour—I do not recollect whether any thing passed at all respect<lb></lb>ing her on the road—we had about four minutes walk to go—when we got there I think the prisoner had a key and let me in—we went in together—he conducted me down stairs into the kitchen—his wife was in the front kitchen, below stairs, lying in bed—she appeared to be in great pain in her stomach and bowels—that was what she complained of—I understood she had been vomiting, and she complained considerably of constant sick<lb></lb>ness and of purging—she was tossing about and moving from one side of the bed to the other, first on her back and then on her side—that was certainly indicative of pain, but not of labour far advanced—her hands and feet were cold—the pulse at the wrist had ceased, I could detect nose whatever—her countenance was anxious and expressive of great pain and suffering—I found on pressing the stomach and bowels that there was grot tenderness—she was quite sensible—the prisoner was not by at the time I was making my examination—he was in the adjoining kitchen—the door was not shut close, and I think ho could hear what passed—I inquired of the deceased the cause of her suffering, and of how long dura<lb></lb>tion was—I think that the prisoner could have heard it without paying any particular attention, from the construction of the door, and that ap<lb></lb>peared an eye-sore to the deceased, for she was casting her eyes towards the door, while I was asking the question she frequently turned her eyes to the door—no part of her account took place after the prisoner came into the room—in conjunction with the other pains I thought there was some<lb></lb>thing of pain going on in the womb—I made an examination of the state of the womb at that time, to satisfy myself as to whether that would account, for the suffering and the state she was in—there were pains independent of labour pains—the labour pains were very slight—they were the common</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120066"></xptr>
               <p>usual pains attendant upon that state—I made an examination—I found the uterus very slightly dilated, and the <hi rend="italic">umbilical</hi> cord very little protruding—on further examination I discovered the feet of the <hi rend="italic">foetus</hi> foremost—she had only gone six months—after making the examination, and satisfying myself that the symptoms and state she was in did not arise from that, I did not make any attempt to deliverher—there was general prostration of strength, without any pulse at the wrist, and vomiting—(I saw her vomit)—involun<lb></lb>tary purging, extreme anxiety of countenance, excessive tenderness of the stomach and bowels, and excessive pain, which she appeared to be suffer<lb></lb>ing generally, beyond that of labour pains—the pains continuing, I made slight attempts to deliver her, but finding the stomach did not improve, and that the pains continued, I ceased to make any attempts, conceiving it arose from other causes, and not from labour—the symptoms were very suspicious, and what I could not at all solve at the time—I was positive they did not arise from natural causes—I sent the prisoner to my house for some medicine—he was away from ten minutes to a quarter of an boor, during which time I was still holding conversation with his wife, and ex<lb></lb>amining her—on his return I gave her some of the medicine he brought back, and after she had drank it she requested to have a little tea, which she had, and it was immediately thrown up, with the medicine—I do not think the prisoner was by then—I told him afterwards, in the adjoining room, that the deceased had said he had given her a powder—he said, "I have given her some cream of tartar, which I have been frequently in the practice of doing when she felt poorly"—I replied that cream of tartar would not produce those symptoms, not in the quantity he bad given her—he said he had given her about a tea-spoon full—I said, "Are you cer<lb></lb>tain you have given her nothing else?"—he said he was positive he had not—I requested him to produce the cream of tartar—he showed me about three drachms, or from that to half an ounce of cream of tartar—I told him I would take care of that—I put it into my pocket—I said I should like to have it, and took it away with me—he made no reply—he said he had given her the cream of tartar some time in the afternoon, I believe, but I do not recollect whether he said afternoon or evening—I told him his wife was in a most dangerous state—I remained with her until she died, which was about four o'clock—that was about three hours—I told him she was in a most dangerous state, perhaps about three-quarters of an hour after I got there—I do not recollect that he made any reply to that—on returning to the deceased, and finding the same symptoms in<lb></lb>creasing, if possible, I advised a mustard poultice for the stomach, which I sent the prisoner to my house for—that was the other time I sent him—I cannot charge my memory how long after, but it was about three-quarters of an hour or an hour before her death—he brought it back, and I applied it—before I sent him for it I communicated to him a still further opinion of the dangerous state of his wife, that she was in more danger still, if possible, and could not live long—he then came into the room—that was before he went for the plaister—he kissed his wife, I believe, and seemed very much cut up at the time—he seemed very much affected, as man and wife could possibly do—nothing more passed that I recollect before he went for the plaister—she made no remark about her ailment while he was there, nor did I—on my way from the house immediately after her death, I met police-sergeant Donegan, and communicated my opinion to him—before I left the house, and after her death, I saw the prisoner in the back<lb></lb>kitchen,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120067"></xptr>
               <p>and inquired of him if his wife had any relations in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood—he said she had a sister at Hampstead—I wished him communi<lb></lb>cate her death to that sister, but, after reflection, I told him it was of no im<lb></lb>portance—I told him it was a very alarming and remarkably sudden death—I do not recollect that he said any thing to that—I told him I would call again at nine o'clock—after meeting Donegan I returned with my assistant to the house—that might have been five o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the back-kitchen—I repeated as to the suddenness of her death, and at the same time informed him that in all probability there would be an inquiry about it—he said he hoped I would make it as mild as I possibly could with him—I made no reply—that was the sum total of the conversation—when I returned with my assistant, what I told him was a repetition of what I told him before—I told him his wife had said he had given her a whito powder—I did not tell him any thing else which she had said at that inter<lb></lb>view—I had told him I would return at nine o'clock, but I returned be<lb></lb>tween five and six o'clock, after seeing Donegan—it was then that I told him his wife had said he had given her a white powder, and I also told him that she desired me not to tell him, for if I did he would kill her—(it was either kill her or murder her, I am not sure which,) and that the reason his wife assigned for the powder was, that he said he did not want any more b—children—that was what passed in the presence of my assistant—he is not here—two other persons who live in the house were present, and they are both here—I said nothing more to him about what she had said—he said, "Oh, poor woman, she was not sensible" or could not be sensible—I said, "She was perfectly sen<lb></lb>sible"—he said nothing to that—I again repeated that it was very sodden, and an inquiry would be entered into no doubt—he said he hoped I would make it mild with him—I did not use the expression that his wife had said "on her dying bed" that he gave her the powder, but only that his wife had said so—the woman was perfectly sensible when I came to her, and continued so for two hours at least—she lost her senses for half or three-quarters of an hour before her death—she was not under the impression that she was going to die—from the expressions she made use of she did not at any time think she was going to die—I examined the body after death in company with Mr. Adams, on the day she died—on opening the body I found the stomach highly inflamed, and slightly contracted, thrown into wrinkles—the inner surface was lined with a thick coating of mucus, inter<lb></lb>spersed with flakes of a substance similar to the half-boiled white of an egg—it contained a light brown fluid—the small intestines, the glands were slightly enlarged, slightly inflamed, and contained a large quantity of fluid, interspers<lb></lb>ed with the same substance as the stomach, like the half-boiled white of an egg—the large intestines were inflamed, the secreting glands of them enlarged and also inflamed—the rectum was in the same state—the bladder was contracted and empty—the womb contained a <hi rend="italic">foetus</hi> of six months—the membranes of the <hi rend="italic">foetus</hi> were ruptured, the <hi rend="italic">umbilical</hi> cord torn, and the lungs congested, and infused blood in points—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination confirmed me in the opinion that she was not suffering from labour pains, from the state of the stomach and bowels, which would account for the pain, but the state of the womb and its region did not—the appearance of the body, except the stomach, intestines, and lungs, was healthy in the extreme—I have seen many subjects labouring under the effects of poison, and who have died of it—I have made a great many <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120068"></xptr>
               <p>examinations of the sort—I have, perhaps, seen twenty or thirty opened who have died of different poisons—I should say without doubt that the woman did not die from natural causes—I have no doubt she died of poison, from the symptoms, and from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I took the contents of the stomach to subject them to a chemical test—I gave them into the hands of Mr. Lunn, an analytical chemist—I was present part of the time, but did not myself make any analysis—I did not detect any poison—I cannot account for no poison being found, supposing she had taken arsenic or any metallic poison, unless the vomiting and purging might have carried off the contents of the stomach—it is a question in the profession whether a person may not take poison and die from it, and yet none be discovered; whether it might not create such inflammation as to cause death, and yet be vomited—it is the opinion of the profession that that may take place—it is an opinion—I have not a particle of doubt, from the symptoms, and from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, that she died of poison—the circumstance of no poison being found in the coat of the stomach or elsewhere, does not at all shake that opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you save any liquid which came from the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only liquid was the medicine and tea that came out while she was lying down, and that was spilt on the linen—I have the cloths which I found in the room—poison may be introduced into the stomach to produce inflammation, of which a person may die, and yet the poison be thrown off, and not be discovered—a person may die from inflammation of the stomach and bowels, producing exhaustion—that death was caused by something of an irritating quality taken into the sto<lb></lb>mach there is no doubt—poisons are irritating—I am not aware of any thing else that would irritate the body through the whole track of the sto<lb></lb>mach and intestines—it would be brought up again—persons do not die in that short space of time from inflammation of the stomach and bowels with<lb></lb>out taking poison—not from the time she told me she had taken the pow<lb></lb>der—I went, at a very late stage of the disorder, when pulsation at the wrist had ceased.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you whether or not medical men are satisfied in general to pronounce that a person has died of poison, in any case where it is not detected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Where you have the appearance of the stomach and bowels and the state before death, without doubt any medical man would say from the appearance of the stomach and bowels, coupled with the symptoms before death, that the person had died from natural causes—I never heard of any substance, comparatively harmless at other times, which will sometimes act as a poison—persons have died from eating fruit—the cholera is an instance of that kind, but you have very different ap<lb></lb>pearances of the stomach and bowels—I have not seen any cases of death from inflammation without poison—I have never heard of persons dying of violent and repeated inflammation of the bowels and intestines, except where poison had been taken—inflammation of the bowels is very common<lb></lb>persons die of it sometimes—I am not aware of instances of death five or six hours after some substance having been taken—I never knew any so rapid as that—I have known it in thirty-six hours, never less—I have had many cases of thirty-six hours from the time I might have attended them, but persons may have been ill for some time—I am surgeon of St. George's parish—I have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for attending all the patients—it is a very large parish, 50, 000 inhabitants—I find all the physic—I understood that the deceased had wished to see me in the evening before—I gave evidence before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120069"></xptr>
               <p>the Coroner—I believe the Jury adjourned three times—I am not prepared to say what their verdict was—I believe it was, "Died of poison taken into the stomach"—that was the substance of it, I believe—I am not pre<lb></lb>pared to say whether it was "Died of poison, or of some irritating matter"—it was not "Accidental death"—there was no verdict found against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner show all possible affection that a man could to his wife, under such circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I communicated to him that she was dying—the medicine I gave her was carbonate of magne<lb></lb>sia, laudanum, and a little spearmint water—carbonate of magnesia was decidedly not the worst thing that could be given to her—it is a sedative—it would not at all increase the inflammatory action, it would tend to allay it—I should give it in an extreme case of this kind—I should not give it in common inflammation of the bowels, but it is not by any means bad in inflammation arising by itself—I should not depend on magnesia, but in that state of things it suggested itself to me, combined with other matters—I should not recommend it, supposing poisoning by arsenic, not at first—if I saw the case early I should not use it, but in the state of things I ob<lb></lb>served I should use it—I at first observed what might possibly be labour pains in combination with the other pains—there were some labour pains, as I imagined—if she bad lived she must have miscarried in seven, eight, or ten hours—she was in a very weak state indeed—the pain in her stomach and bowels must have produced a miscarriage, in the extreme state of prostration she was in.</p>

I am a shoemaker, and lived in the same house as the prisoner and his wife—he is a tailor—the last time I saw his wife up was about seven o'clock on the Sunday evening—I saw her standing at the bed-room door in the kitchen, where they used to sleep—she appeared to be like a per<lb></lb>son ill with a cold at that time—I might be there three quarters of an hour, talking to the prisoner—I was standing at the yard-door with him, and she was standing there at the time—I was within sight and hearing of her—I did not see her vomit or sick during that time—I was called up about half-past three o'clock in the morning by my wife, and came down—Mrs. Clif<lb></lb>ton was not quite dead then—she drew her breath, but was just near death—Mr. Garratt was there—I was in the back kitchen with Mr. Garratt and the prisoner after her death, about a quarter or half-past four o'clock—when the prisoner came in, I heard Mr. Garratt say that his wife had said he bad given her three powders, but she had desired him not to tell him, or he would kill her—I do not remember that the prisoner made any reply to that—Mr. Garratt left shortly after—he said nothing else then, to my knowledge—when he returned again, he told the prisoner it was a serious thing—the prisoner said, yes, it was, but, he was innocent of it, he had given her nothing but cream of tartar—I was then left in the house with the prisoner and my wife—he took a piece of white paper out of a closet, and went into the yard, and emptied two water-butts—I told him it was a bad job—he said, yes, it was a bad job, but he was innocent, by G—d; but if the worst came to the worst, they could only bring it in manslaughter, and they would transport him for life—my wife was by at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and have been in practice about ten years on my own account—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and conducted it jointly with Mr. Garratt—I have only a slight variation to make to his evidence, which is, that the smallest in<lb></lb>testines were not inflamed, except at the commencement of them—I did not see her before death—my opinion is, having heard all the symptoms described, and from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, that she died of some acrid poison—I cannot swear to it, but that is my unqualified opinion—I would say that a large dose of medicine might produce similar effects—an inordinate dose of a powerful medicine, such as gamboge, or a large dose of calomel—hardly any quantity of the blue pill would produce it, except numerous doses—a drachm, or sixty grain?, would be about twelve times an avenge dose of blue pill—I think an extraordinary quantity of drastic medicine might possibly produce those symptoms—cream of tartar is certainly not a very drastic thing—I cannot conceive that any quantity of cream of tartar would produce it—I did not analyse the contents of the stomach, they were given to Mr. Lunn—supposing no poison to be found through the coats of the stomach or intestines, that would have no effect on the opinion I pronounce, as to her having died of poison, because I apprehend, if poison were administered in small doses, repeatedly, and for a considerable period, the symptoms, as indicated, might supervene, and yet no poison</p>

               <p>be discovered—suppose, for instance, a person taking for three weeks con<lb></lb>siderable doses of the corrosive sublimate or arsenic, precisely the same symptoms are found—that is the only way I can account for the absence of poison either in the stomach or intestines, or their contents—it accu<lb></lb>mulates in the system, and the effects suddenly come on—it is absorbed—I think the absence of poison may be accounted for, on the supposition of a violent sickness, or purging carrying it all off, but then you could detect it in the matter thrown off—the first discharge upwards and down<lb></lb>wards would carry the greater part of it off, yet the patient may die, although it is all discharged—the sickness may last after it is all thrown off—the latter sickness would show nothing—vomiting is more likely to get rid of it than the other passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, supposing the earlier discharge of sickness not to be ob<lb></lb>served, do you think the patient might die of metallic poison, and yet the contents of the stomach would not detect it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, that would be another position, independent of its being taken in small quantities—I am of opinion, that although all the poison may be discharged at the first sickness, the patient may nevertheless die—I believe it is possible that the presence of poison in the stomach for a short time might create an irre<lb></lb>coverable inflammation—if metallic poison, such as arsenic, be given in a large dose, I should expect sickness to come on within half an hour, if given in a quantity sufficient to produce death—it would be sickness of great intensity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then, if you had found arsenic, it would not have strengthened your opinion, at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unquestionably it would—I have not said arsenic was the cause of death, I said some acrid poison—finding arsenic would add very great strength to my opinion, but I say it may accumulate in the system, and you will not find it—a couple of grains may cause death—it is a very small quantity, but it is just possible—it pro<lb></lb>duces inflammation, and frequently mortification of the coats of the sto<lb></lb>mach—it affects the coat of the stomach by producing inflammation—it does not <hi rend="italic">erode</hi> it, that I am aware of—I never observed that effect—I will not say that effect does not exist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you whether medical men in general will venture to assert a person to have died of poison without finding the presence of poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly—I have seen a person who took arsenic for the disease of the stone, and very violent inflammation of the stomach and bowels was the consequence of it—medical men assert the possibility that death may take place from poison without ever being able to detect poison in the in<lb></lb>testines—they will not say that death must have taken place from poison—it is not a matter which can be positively stated—it is possible, but it is not by any means certain that death may not have followed from some other cause—I mean to say it is possible a person under these circum<lb></lb>stances may die of common causes, and where no poison is detected, I should certainly say a person might have died under common causes—from the symptoms detailed in this case, I might venture to assert that a person might die of common causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But without the detection of some specific poison in the interior, a medical man would not give a positive opinion that death arose from poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that is my answer—I think it might be—that is the result of my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then in this case you say you think it highly</p>

               <p>probable death arose from poison, but you will not positively assert that it did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so—that is my evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and am accustomed to analyse. I have been in the habit of analysing poisons—I was seven years assistant to Mr. Jonathan Pereira, lecturer on chemistry at the Medical School in Aiders<lb></lb>gate-street—I received two bottles from Mr. Garratt, containing a brown liquid—it was not feculent, neither was it food—it was not ejected from the stomach during life—I could not tell whether or not that stomach had been washed out by sickness before—I could not form any judgment whether the stomach from which it came had previously been washed by frequent discharges of liquid from it—when a person is sick there is solid matter at first, and when there is nothing more, liquid—that is the conse<lb></lb>quence of previous discharges having taken place—I can hardly say whe<lb></lb>ther the liquid I saw was the residum after repeated discharges from the stomach, for although the stomach might have been perfectly empty dur<lb></lb>ing life, there might after death be a fluid found in it—I made an experi<lb></lb>ment upon the contents of both bottles—I am acquainted with Mr. Marsh's process, which is the application of hydrogen in a particular manner, which is supposed to detect the 500, 000th part of a grain, but that I could not detect here—I applied four experiments—I know of no experiment which could be applied beyond those I did apply—I could not detect the small<lb></lb>est portion of arsenic or any other mineral poison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From what you know, supposing arsenic to be given, is it not possible you must have discovered some portion, if it was admi<lb></lb>nistered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell that—(Mr. Garratt produced to me a white powder in a blue paper—I tried that every possible way—it is not arsenic—I believe it to be a salt of potash—most likely it is cream of tartar—it is certainly not arsenic)—at the first examination I was not satisfied, and asked the best authority—I tried an infallible test, and found none.</p>

I met Mr. Garratt about four o'clock on the morning in question—something passed between him and me—I afterwards went about a quarter to five o'clock to the prisoner's house, No. 1, James-street, Tottenham Court-road—I said, I supposed he suspected my business there—he made no reply—I then said, "The doctor, who has been attending your wife through the night, has very strong apprehensions that you caused her death by those powders that you administered to her, and until the doubts as to that are cleared up, you must consider yourself in my custody"—he made no answer to that—I desired him to come to the station-house—he said, "Stop till nine o'clock, and have some break<lb></lb>fast with me"—I said I would not, and told him to come instantly with me—he then wished the witness Golden to accompany him to the station-house—Golden went up stairs to put his coat on, and while he was up</p>

               <p>stairs, the prisoner put his hands into his pockets, whistled for a while, and walked about—he then said, "I think I shall feed my dog at any rate before I go"—he did so, and then came with me to the station-house—before that, he said he wished to speak a word to Mrs. Golden, who was in the back-room at the time—I said he might do so—we were standing close by the door—he went in and attempted to close the door—I said, "You will not shut the door, I shall hear what you say, you shall not go out of my sight"—he said something to Mrs. Golden, but spoke so low, that I did not hear it—I took him to Mr. Lockwood's a little before eight o'clock, and he said to Mr. Lockwood, before I spoke to him, "You know me, Mr. Lockwood, have you not sold me a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cream of tartar about a fortnight ago?"—Mr. Lockwood replied, "I have sold him cretin of tartar"—I asked Mr. Lockwood, if he had sold him poison, arsenic—he said, "I don't keep poison"—I said, "It is very strange if you keep no kind of poison in your house, being a chemist"—he then said, "I keep it, but do not sell it"—I said, "I suppose you mean you don't sell it distinct to common persons, but in prescriptions"—he said, "That is my business," and I left the house—the prisoner said nothing more than asking him about the cream of tartar.</p>

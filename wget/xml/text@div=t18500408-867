                  </hi>. I live with my parents in Northampton-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey. On Monday night, 1st April, I was playing in Northampton-street with some more boys—there was about half a dozen of us—we were playing rather rough together—we hit each other—the pri<lb></lb>soner, who was one, took a knife out of his pocket, and said, "If you hit me again, I will stick this knife into you"—I went to hit him again, and he stuck the knife in me, and ran away into the Wellington public-house—I went and pulled him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There were eight boys. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There were about six, but we had left off playing when the prisoner and I got quarrelling—we did not all rush on him and knock him about—nobody hit him but me—I am not bigger than he is.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my grandmother at 112, Long-lane, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey. I was playing with the other boys on Easter Monday—we had just done playing <hi rend="italic">hi-bobaree,</hi> and the prisoner and Loveday were striking each other rather roughly; it was not fighting—the prisoner said, "If you do it again I will take out my knife to you"—Loveday ran and hit him again, and then he pulled out knife and thrust it into him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never touched him at all; I only pulled out the knife to frighten him, and he ran against it, and stuck it into his arm. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was flourishing the knife about as if to frighten him—Loveday ran at him while he was flourishing it, and struck him with it—Loveday struck him with his right hand, and was holding up his left as if to guard himself—there was nobody striking the prisoner but Loveday.</p>

                  </hi>. I and a friend were standing at the bar of the Wellington, when the prisoner ran in, followed by Loveday—there was a regular skirmish with them at the bar, and the landlord pushed them out—Loveday said, "See how my jacket is cut"—I followed them out, and saw that it was cut, and we detained the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw Loveday on the Monday—he had received a superficial wound, about an inch and a half long and three-quar<lb></lb>ters of an inch deep—it was at the back of the left shoulder, on the edge of the arm-pit behind—that could not have been given by a person standing in front of him—from the appearance of the cut I imagine that what the prisoner states is true, and that it was done by a thrust outwards in flourishing the knife, and not a cut—it was not a serious wound—it has nearly healed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not mean to stab him, only to keep the blows off; he ran at me with his head down, and stuck the knife in the back of his shoulder.</p>

               <p>ELIZA BROMETT. I live in Bernard-street, with my mother, who takes in slop-work. On the 26th of November I was coming from Mr. West's with four jackets for my mother. I went home, and my mother not being at home, I went out again. As I was going over London Bridge, I met the prisoner; it was about twelve o'clock in the day. He asked me where I was going, and if I would have something to drink. He was going to East Smithfield, and I was going to Cornwall-street the same way. I went with him; I had never seen him before. He took me to the sign of the Crown, in East Smithfield; he gave me a quartern of gin. I drank the whole of it, as I was very wet, and had had no victuals for two days. I do not think that he drank any of it. We came out together. He then wanted to carry the bundle; I would not let him. He did not want to carry it before. He struck me in the stomach; I fell down, and as I fell he

             the bundle from under my arm, and ran away. I got up to look for the bundle, and it was gone. I cried out stop thief! I could not see any body. A gentleman went after him. About a quarter of an hour after, I saw the gentleman come back with the bundle; I stopped in the same place all the time. Mr. Moses shewed me the bundle; it was covered with my apron. I can swear to the apron. It was in the apron when Mr. Moses brought it to me; he gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not ask me to go with you - A. No. He said he was going into East Smithfield, and I said I was going to Cornwall-street. He said, that was the same way; and if I would go with him, he would give me something to drink; and he asked me if he should carry the bundle.</p>

            . I live in Parsons-street, East Smithfield. I am a slop-seller. I was standing at my brother's door, which is opposite the Rose and Crown public-house, on the 26th of November, I observed the prosecutrix come out of the public-house with the prisoner, at about a quarter before one o'clock. At the instant they came off the steps, I saw her fall into the Kennel, and the prisoner take a bundle from her, and run away. I did not see him do any thing else to her. We pursued him, and overtook him. I saw him run all the way till I took him. I asked him what it was; he said, it was a bundle that he was going to carry home to the person whom it belonged to, as the woman he had taken it from had stolen it. I took him back to the public-house, and sent for an officer, and gave him in charge. The bundle was given to the officer also. We took him to the magistrate; the girl swore to the bundle. the bundle which I took from him is the same that I saw him take from the girl; it contained four unmade sailors jackets, wrapped up in a check apron.</p>

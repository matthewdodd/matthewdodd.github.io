               <p>JOHN DRIVER. I am servant to Mr. Abdy, of Seymour-street. On the 28th of April, about a quarter to nine o'clock at night, I was looking into a pork-shop, in <placeName id="t18270531-184-crimeloc976">Oxford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18270531-184-crimeloc976" type="placeName" value="Oxford-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Did you see him take it? A. No; there were two or three others, who appeared of his party - he at first said he had not got it - another boy was taken, but not detained; I do not remember his friends talking to me about it - the prisoner's father came to me on Sunday, and said his son did not take it - I told him I wished to get the money and not attend, for fear I should lose my situation; the Magistrate asked if I had received 10s. for my handkerchief; I told him I had; I value it at 4s.; the man said he would give me 1l. or 2l. - I said I wanted nothing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you say to him? A. I said, "You have got your father into a nice disgrace, by taking this handkerchief;" he said, "I did not take it, it was a boy named Doyle, who put it into my bosom, in Oxford-street" - in a short time the prisoner's brother came to the watch-house; I asked if his brother knew Doyle - he said he did - I and the brother went to Oxford-street, and found that boy - he said the same when he saw him - the prisoner's father is an industrious man - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

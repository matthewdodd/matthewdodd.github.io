             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, on the 25th of April the prisoner whom I have seen before, more than once, brought a man's cloth coat, which I have here, to our shop, it appears by my ticket to be on the 5th of April, I am sure as to the person of the prisoner; I lent 13 s. upon it, I take that to be very near the value of it; on the 27th following she brought a scarlet cloth cloak, and a linen shift, I lent 3 s. on the shift, the cloak I lent 14 s. on; the value is 16 s; I do not observe any particular mark upon them of any kind, and they are new; there is nothing distinguishable in them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You would not venture to swear to them? - I would not myself swear to them by no means; I have been in that way of business ten years, or more, and from any observation I could make of these, I could not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Having looked at them attentively, if they had been out of your hands a day or two, would you venture to swear to them? - No; the prisoner was in the habit of coming to our shop from another person, and I understood from her that the coat was the property of that person, and the cloak and the shift of another person, she described them so.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - It was in daylight I am confident, I think it was somewhere between eleven and four, but nearer than that I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. These are such things no person can swear to them? - I had them in my possession, with the duplicates upon them, if anybody had substituted others for them, I could not swear to them, but I have no reason to suspect that; the coat is the 25th of April, the cloak and the shift on the 27th following.</p>
               <p>(The things looked at by the Prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. By what marks do you know them? - I can say with a safe conference that they are mine; the shift is new, it has no mark.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is impossible for you to be mistaken? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Might anybody else have such another cloak? - They might.</p>
               <p>Had nobody else a new shift at that time? - I believe they might.</p>
               <p>Now about the coat? - It had been worn two or three times.</p>
               <p>So has one I have got at home. - I dare say you wear better cloth than this.</p>
               <p>Did you make the shift yourself? - No, I never makes nothing; the cloak was made at No. 2, Houndsditch, I have worn it twice.</p>
               <p>To the best of your belief do you think it is yours? - Yes, my husband has not had the coat on since it was at the pawnbrokers; I believe this to be the coat; I know such things were missing on that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my councel.</p>
               <p>Jury to Pawnbroker. Do not you often take in things upon which you do not immediately put a ticket? - It frequently happens in the hurry of business that we do not put them on immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear that that was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290132"></xptr> same woman that brought you these things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who all gave her a good character.</p>

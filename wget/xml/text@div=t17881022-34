             were with me when we took them; on the 17th of September they brought a boat with them to the Island; we saw them coming up the stream; we were on the island; the prisoners were in the boat; nobody else; I saw them land, we concealed ourselves before they came; we saw the lead on the island, lying in a little sort of gutter, covered with grass and leaves; there was near eight hundred pounds weight; the prisoners went directly up to the lead; and as they went along, I think it was Hutchinson, that said, he supposed the bird was fled; the other had a pole in his hand, and he hit the lead with it, and said, no, here is the nest, and the bird, as we left it; they proceeded to load it, and carry it away; there were fourteen pieces; they took six pieces; and as they were coming with two more, we rushed out upon them, and took them; they made a strong resistance, and asked what we were going to do with them; I had a gun in my hand, and Wild strove to take it away; one of the men gave him a blow on the head, and he let it go then; and I secured his hands, and tied them, and his legs; they did not say where it came from, nor what they were going to do with it; I secured Hutchinson too, and put them both into the boat; we left the other lead behind; and lodged the prisoners in the round-house; and between six and seven the next morning, we went for the remainder of the lead; and it is left with Mr. Taylor, a justice of the peace; some of the pieces weigh near an hundred weight; it appeared to be old lead, and to have come off some building.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen, Prisoner Wild's Counsel. This is a little island on the river? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is a stream, and locks upon it? - No locks that I know of; I am very sure there are none; there is a back water comes down.</p>
               <p>Is there no way of running to keep flush the water? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Has this lead been claimed? - No.</p>

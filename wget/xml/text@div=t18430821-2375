I belong to the brig <hi rend="italic">Martingale.</hi> I fell in with the prisoner, on the morning of the 28th of July, in Bluegate-fields—I had been in a coffee-shop, and asked a woman there if she could get me a bed—she took me to the house where this prisoner was—I took off my clothes and went to bed by myself—I put my trowsers just on one side of my pillow—my watch was in my trowsers' pocket, and two half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences—the woman who showed me the room went out—I paid her for the bed—I went to sleep, and when I awoke my watch was gone, and the two half-crowns—my trowsers, which I had put at my pillow, were lying on a chair at the bed's foot—I called for the mistress—the prisoner came in and said, "Don't put yourself out of the way, the woman that put you to bed probably has your watch, and you will see her in the course of the day, and get satisfaction; there is the ticket of your watch," and she put the duplicate on the table—I called a policeman, and went with him—this is my watch, and this is the ticket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said, "Let us go and see if we can find the ticket," and we found it in the room. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No—I said I wanted to go on board the ship to do my duty, and you laid the ticket on the table.</p>

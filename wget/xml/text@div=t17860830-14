               <p>Had the man any weapon? - he had a pistol, and as soon as I gave him the money, he went off instantly.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any thing else but money? - Nothing else.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the chaise with Mr. Hathaway, when he was stopped; at the distance of about two hundred yards, I perceived a carriage stopped in the road before; at the bottom of the hill; this was nearly the top of the hill; it was about a quarter after seven in the evening; the prisoner came from that carriage; when he came up to the head of my horse, I perceived a very small barrel pistol in his pocket; I quitted the chaise and jumped out on the near side, before he stopped it; I jumped out as soon as ever I perceived the pistol; I had hold of the reins that stopped the chaise; on my jumping out the highwayman insisted on my getting in again.</p>
               <p>Did you get in again? - No, I said, I would not; and he pointed the pistol in this manner to me; and I had taken up some stones; there were plenty in the road; and I told him if he did not take away his pistol, I would throw stones at him; he had a large silk handkerchief; Mr. Hathaway remained in the chaise, and attempted to reach the reins; in the mean time he demanded his money, and robbed him; I heard him demand his money, with the expression of come d - n me your money; he then insisted on having my watch and money; the coach was behind, in which my wife and Mr. Hathaway's wife were; I tossed a guinea across the horse, which sell on his hand; it fell to the ground; he says, d - n me Sir, what do you throw it on the stones for? I insist on your picking it up; he did not pick it up nor I; he then rode to the coach, which I suppose was one hundred and fifty yards distance from us; he told me I might pick up the lousy guinea myself; he then robbed the coach; I followed him towards the coach; when he turned round and saw me following him, he shook his pistol at me, and he says,</p>
               <p>"come on, come on, d - n</p>
               <p>"me, come on, I am double armed by</p>
               <p>"God;" this transaction took up about five minutes; he rode down the lane and returned to pick up the money that was dropped in the coach; that was a quarter past seven; it was full day-light; there was a silk handkerchief round his neck, and sometimes it was reached up to his mouth but no higher; it was once or so off.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity during this time of observing the man's person so as to know him again? - I had as much opportunity as I have of seeing your Lordship; I have every reason to believe the prisoner at the bar to be the man; yet I do not swear to him positively.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you saw him? - It was eight or nine days.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - Yes, my Lord; I believe I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Where? - At Woolwich.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before so as to know his person? - No; it occurred to me then that I had seen him before; I saw him seven or eight days after; he was then in custody at Bow-street; I was more flurried and discomposed when I saw him at Bow-street, than when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300044"></xptr>Did you know him immediately? - Yes, I said then, and swore, that I really believed and suspected him to be the person that committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Now from what you have seen of him now, and since, and the time of the robbery, can you say whether it is the man who robbed Mr. Hathaway or not? - I would not wish to be positive to any part of the time.</p>
               <p>I do not wish you should be more positive than the conviction of your own mind enables you? - It was with reluctance I agreed to the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Court. Probably so; but however, though it is a painful duty, it is a duty to prosecute offenders, and to give full evidence upon that trial, but to be sure in that situation a man cannot be too cautious not to go beyond his certain knowledge; therefore the question to you is, whether you are perfectly satisfied in your own mind that he is the man? - I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt at all of it? - I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Who were in the coach? - Mrs. Hathaway, Mrs. Wheatley, Mrs. Hathaway's nurse, one Mr. Mason, and two young ladies; the coachman was brought to Bow-street, but they said, his evidence was not material.</p>
               <p>Why were not the parties that were in the coach brought here? - They never attended any time.</p>
               <p>Court. Their knowledge might be material one way or the other; they might be able to say one way or the other, they certainly ought to have attended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, there was a coachman that was present at the examination, he took upon himself to say, I was not the man, and Mr. Hathaway likewise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wheatley. The coachman could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. As you went afterwards to the coach where the ladies where, certainly you had an opportunity of seeing his face? - The same Sir, that I have of you now, for afterwards returning from the lane, he got off from his horse, and turned back and spoke as he got on the horse directly, and said, d - n me I will mark you.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Wheatley had given information of the robbery, and said, that Shepherd was the man that robbed him -</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Wheatley. How is this? - Coming home, we stopped at Shepherd's-bush, and whilst we were there the patrol came, and I only described the man to the patrol, and they said, they supposed it to be Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. In consequence of this information I looked out for Shepherd.</p>
               <p>How long after did you see the prisoner? - I think it was on the 8th of August; that was a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Where did you take him? - In St. Martin's-lane, in a public house.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what he was charged with? - Yes, he denied all knowledge of the robbery; I searched him; there was nothing upon him that answered to any part of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Did you find any pistols upon him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Wheatley. Was there any thing lost but money by any of the parties? - A locket, but it has never been found.</p>

               <p>Court. I could very much have wished that the persons in the coach had attended, for it is right all persons should attend.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. Sir Sampson desired both the gentlemen to enquire of all the parties in the coach, whether they could give any account of the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, my Lord, I am quite innocent of the robbery that is alledged against me.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think it necessary that the coachman should have been examined, he is much in my favour.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Wheatley. Have you any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300045"></xptr> particular knowledge of the prisoner by his voice? - No.</p>

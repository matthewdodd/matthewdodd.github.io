On the 15th of June I settled with his lordship at Portland, I received a twenty pound bank post bill, and a fifteen pound bank post bill, and seven guineas and three or four more, I cannot justly say, when I got to the Charterhouse I locked it all up in my desk. On the 1st of November, the prisoner Nicholson, came to me to the Charterhouse, he came to see me then, but he did not light of me, the next day the 2d of November he came again.</p>

            Did you know him before? - Never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him now? - O, Yes, I know him now very well, it is the outside one next to the jury; he came to me with a presence he had an acquaintance he wanted to get into the Charter-house, I took him up into my room, and shewed him the rules of the Charter-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he desired to see the rules? - I cannot say whether he did or did not; I took him up to my lodgings, my desk was in the lodging room, after he had read the rules he said he liked them very well, they were very good; then we came down to the gateway, leading to the square, and he asked me to take a walk with him, I took a walk with him, we went about a quarter of a mile together, I cannot say to what street; we went to a public house, and just at the going in at the corner Chappel met us; I don't know the name of the public house, nor what street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Chappel before? - Never saw him in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him now? - Yes, he is the middlemost, Chappel said to Nicholson have you seen any thing, yes, says he, I have seen what I am very well satisfied with, and I have got what I want; then we went into a large room, Nicholson, Chappel and I, Nicholson called for a glass of liquor, and paid for it; then Jones came into the same room with a glass of liquor in his hand, and when he came in, he said, gentlemen, I hope no offence, no, says Chappel, no offence at all, then Jones said he had come out of Coventry, he was a ribbon weaver, and his aunt was dead, and had left him four hundred pounds, and he had come up to receive it; he said she was the farmer of the workhouse, Chappel asked him what character his aunt bore? he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150007"></xptr>afraid her character was that she was a pincher of the poor; Jones then pulled out a quantity of notes; Chappel said to

             I suppose you think nobody has got no money but you? no, says Jones, I lay you ten pounds a piece that you don't produce forty pounds a-piece in two hours, then we all came out into the street, and Chappel said that he would go to the Spotted Horse, near Moorfields. Nicholson and Chappel had asked me whether I could shew so much money? Jones was there by them at the same time, they said they could, I told them I believed I could, then we went into the street; Jones went with Chappel, and Nicholson came along with me to the Charterhouse, to my room, he went up with me to the room, and was there when I opened my desk, and I took out two notes, a twenty pound bank post bill, and a fifteen pound bank post bill; I took them out and laid them in the window myself, and he looked at them, and said they were very good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the number of the bills? - I cannot say I did, I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any indorsement on the nores? - There was Mansfield on the back of both of them, I see my Lord Mansfield write the name on them.</p>

            After Nicholson had said they were good, what did you do then? - I took out five guineas out of a little box, to make up the forty pounds, from the same desk, Nicholson said I had better take another guinea or two, so I took another, and one guinea I had in my pocket, that made up seven guineas, then we came down and walked till we came to where there were some coaches, and Nicholson called a coach, and he ordered the coachman to drive to the Spotted Horse or Dog.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you desired him to call that coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you desired him to tell the coachman to drive to the Spotted Horse? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Spotted Horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the Spotted Horse what happened then? - We got out of the coach, and went into the Spotted Horse, into a back room, and there were Chappel and

             both of them, then we sat down, and Jones put down a paper of ten pounds for each that could produce the forty pounds, I shewed my forty pounds, and then I won the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was on the note that was given you? - I did not, I put it in my pocket, my own notes I put them on the table to shew them, and whether I put them in my pocket or no again with the ten pounds I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. After this what happened? - Jones wrote out four letters on the table,

            , he went and turned his back at the end of the room, and he said he would lay a guinea a-piece that he would name a letter that they were to make by the side of these, and to put under a bason. and there was a letter made, and he went and turned his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the letter? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the letter? - I can not tell whether I did or no; the letter that was to be made was made by the side of these four, then the letters were covered, and Jones named a letter, and he did not name the right, then I, Chappel. and Nicholson, won a guinea a piece, then they would lay again, Nicholson and Chappel said we might as well have some of Jones's money as not, as he had received so much, for he was sure to lose it, both of them said so, and there was another letter made, Chappel and Nicholson said we may as well make it more, we are sure to win, and there was one sum mentioned, and then another sum mentioned, I am not certain by whom and what, and then I laid all my notes and the seven guineas on the table, then they would make a letter again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150008"></xptr>which Jones was to guess again, Jones did guess right the next time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you guess at all? - No, I never did. Then he came and swept the money and notes all off, and went to the door, my notes and money were on the table.</p>

            What did Nicholson and Chappel do at the time he swept them off? - They sat still; the officers then came in, and they all got up and begged and praved, and the officers said that they should go to justice, they begged and praved to be let lose, the officers said they had been doing me, and they should go to justice, then Jones, after the officers had been in some time, came to me and put some papers into my hand, a lump of papers, and I put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see what that paper contained? - No, I took it to the justice and delivered it before the justice; one of them said that I had some money in my pocket, I don't know which it was said so, I said, I don't know that I had, except some of them had put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else, with respect to the prisoners? - Yes, they found six guineas in Jones's smock pocket that is all.</p>

               <p>Q. You say they produced notes on the table, did they appear to be bank notes? - Jones had pulled out one and shewed it to Chappel, and he said it was good.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever played at this game before in you life? - Never saw it in my life.</p>

            Why you gambled pretty high on this occasion? - They told me.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you could got some of this man's money, you liked it well enough when you won, and you would have liked to have got his forty pounds well enough? - I believe my senses were taken away by what was in the drink.</p>
               <p>Q. You first of all betted a guinea on naming of the letter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went there you produced the forty pounds? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You put down forty pounds on the table and there it lay before you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And by that means you won a bet of ten pounds? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you the ten pounds? - He gave me a note.</p>
               <p>Q. For any thing you know to the contrary it was a ten pound note? - I never looked at the note.</p>

               <p>Q. Then however afterwards you played at this game of betting and there were four letters marked? - There were, and the prisoner Jones he went and turned his back and was to guess which of the four had been pitched upon.</p>
               <p>Q. The first bet of that fort you won, did he pay you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And the money you expected? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if you had ended there you would have gone away with a guinea in your pocket, you would not have thought of returning him the guinea? - No, I should suppose not.</p>

            When Jones won that bet he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150009"></xptr>and took that money, did you object at the time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You let him take it as a thing that he had won? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you propose to the others, why don't let him go off with the winnings, we will try again if we can have it back? - No, I did not make that proposal as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys addressed the court, that he thought the desendants from the circumstances that had come out in the evidence of the prosecutors, ought not to be put on their defence.</p>
               <p>But the court were of opinion that it was for the jury to judge whether they had not dominion over this property from the very beginning, and if they should believe, that, all that followed, was in order to get the whole into their own hands, then it would manisest a full design of sraud on their parts.</p>

               <p>I am one of the police officers at Shoreditch; I went to the Spotted Horse on Saturday, the 2d of November about one o'clock at noon, and I see the three prisoners, Jones then was by the side of the door as if he was coming out of the room, I returned out of the Spotted Horse and called Harper and Blackiter in, Jones went into the room again, whether he came out to order any thing I don't know; we went into the room and there were the three prisoners there and Mr. Cartwright, we all being in the room I told the three prisoners they must go to the magistrate, the prisoners said the man had lost no money, and begged of us not to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you attacked him and told him that the man had lost any money? - No, I had not, I see them do nothing, but I see there had been some kind of chalk on the table and there was some liquor in a bowl; we took them to the magistrate and sent for another officer to take care of Cartwright, we took them to the magistrate and Mr. Cartwright gave his information to Mr. Flood and Clark, I was ordered to search them, I searched Jones, and found these papers, some are notes of linen drapers, and some belong to tea shops, they were in this pocket book, I found in this canvas bag these halfpence sewed up in this piece of linen, four guineas and a half in gold, a two guinea piece, about three-pence farthing of loose money, all that gold was returned but one guineas, which I was ordered to keep. During the examination, Mr. Cartwright pulled out of his waistcoat pocket these notes I now produce, here is a fifteen pounds note and a twenty pounds note, and four or five other notes which were delivered to me with them, notes for two-pence, and false notes; in Mr. Cartwright's pocket these guineas were found, then I had orders to search Mr. Nicholson which I did, there were a guinea and a half, I believe I found in gold on him, and some notes like the others, slash notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what these notes were that you found on Jones? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any good notes? - None. Blackiter searched Chappel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in John-street, Cambridge Heath. I have known Hatwell five years—he told me to make him some clothes, and he brought me a pig—I did not see Kenny till the last—Hat<lb></lb>well came to me again, and said he had got another pig for me—I asked if it was as good as the first—he said, "Yes, rather better"—I was to make him a coat for two pigs—that was the agreement—I did not know what two they were, but he came to me, and said, "You will want a couple of pigs"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I will tell you what I was thinking of; if you will make a fustian coat, I will find you a couple of pigs"—he then came and said he had a sow and pig, which he could put me in reasonable; but I found it would not suit me, and dropped that agreement—he then said I should have two store pigs—he came on the Monday before Christ<lb></lb>mas, and asked if the coat was done—I told him not quite, but if he would go with me, and fetch the two pigs, the coat should be ready against he came back—he refused—I told him I should keep the coat till I had the pigs—he came the next morning, and I was called to him—Kenny was with him, and so he was the evening before—Hatwell then asked if</p>

               <p>the coat was done—I said it was, and I saw one pig in the "cart, but whether there was more than one I do not know—I refused to try the coat on till the pigs were brought on my premises—Kenny brought one pig on my premises—I then laid the coat on the table—Hatwell took it up, took his own coat off, and put that coat on—he took his own coat on his arm, and walked into the yard, where Kenny and the pig were—I said to him, "Put the pig down"—Hatwell said, "No, Kenny, put the pig in the bag; the pig is yours, and put it into the cart"—I said they should not go off my premises, but Kenny put the pig into the cart—then came and dragged Hatwell out—Hatwell said if any body attempted to take the coat off, he would run ab—y knife into him—I then gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present when there was some conver<lb></lb>sation with Hatwell and my father about the pigs—Hatwell and Kenny came about eleven o'clock in the morning, with one pig in a cart—they brought one in, and Kenny held its leg in the yard—my father fetched the coat down, and laid it on the table—Hatwell was to bring two pigs for the coat, to the amount of 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we expected the pigs would be brought that day—when Kenny went into the yard, Hatwell put the coat on, and took his own coat on his arm—he then went into the yard, and said to Kenny, "Put the pig into the bag; the pig is yours"—my father told him to let it go—Kenny said, "Will you buy this pig?"—I said, "My father has no dealings with you, you may take the pig away"—I gave him a string to tie it up.</p>

On the Friday evening, Hatwell came to the station-house, and asked for Kenny—I said he was gone to the office—he said he wished to go there with him—he had this fustian coat on—he said it was very wrong of Mr. Stevens to charge him with a theft; that he had not robbed him, but there was a debt due from Mr. Stevens to him of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Mr. Stevens was to make a coat for 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for him, and he was to give him the difference; and the pig that was taken then, had nothing to do with the coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hatwell's Defence.</hi> I gave Stevens an order for a coat, which was to be in payment of a debt which he owed me—I had applied to him several times for the money, and could not get it—I then applied for a coat—he agreed to make it, and when he had made it, I told him I would pay him the difference—he then said he should wish to have more pigs of me—I said I had no objection, after we had a settlement—I said I had more pigs at my father's, if he would come and see them—he came and saw one, and said he wanted a couple—I said I could get another if he liked—he then said the coat was not done, it wanted a little more pressing—I went for it—he said, "Joseph, the coat is done," and they fetched it down—I pulled off my coat, he helped me on with the other, and said it was a very good fit—I said, "Well, here is the difference of the coat, what I owe you"—he said, "No, I will have the coat, or else I will have a pig"—I said, "You owe me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., here is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that will settle our account; now, if you think proper to buy the pig in the cart, well and good; if not, we part as we did before"—he then told me to pull the coat off—I refused, and said if he did not choose to take the money, I could not help it—Kenny took the pig away, as Stevens told him.</p>

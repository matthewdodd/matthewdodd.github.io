On Wednesday night, the 5th of June, a witness brought me an order which was produced in Court last session - I have not seen it since I left it in Court; I do not know what has become of it - it was for 2lbs. of long sixes. 1 lb. of rushlights, 1/2lb. of curb soap, and the remaining change of a sovereign, to be sent to Mrs. Nicholson, No. 40, Sussex-street - I had a customer named Nicholson; I afterwards went to that house, and saw the name of Nicholson on the door, and ascertained that Mrs. Nicholson had been gone to the Continent - I sent the goods according to the order, by the boy; he soon afterwards returned, and gave me a yellow medal, with George IV., and a head; it was given to the officer, and produced on the last trial - one side had the appearance of a sovereign, and the other side had not - the prisoner was afterwards apprehended; no conversation passed between us - I sent eighteen shillings and one penny in change, with the goods - all I ever got for it was the medal, which is not worth a penny.</p>

From the de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170017"></xptr>scription he gave I can fix on nobody so likely as yourself; he said he was rather darker than myself, and rather older, that he had an apron on, and his coat off. He said you had neither hat nor coat on - I did not ask the other to describe you?</p>

            . I am errand boy to Mr. Thompson. On the 5th of June, I took out two pounds of rush lights, half a pound of curd soap, and change for a sovereign, which was eighteen shillings and a penny; I was to take them to Mrs. Nicholson, No. 40, Sussex-street; when I got four or five doors from master's shop, the prisoner met me - I am sure he is the man - he said, "What a while you have been gone;" I did not make him any answer - he said, "I have got to give you a yellow boy, have not I?" I said, Yes, and he gave it me, and I gave him the change - he took the change before he gave me the yellow boy - he asked me if I had got the change, and he took the change and candles - I am sure he is the same person - I gave master the same coin as the prisoner gave me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long were you gone from you master's house? A. Not two minutes - I swear he is the man; there is something particular by which I know you - you are dark, and have dark hair - you had a white apron on, and were in your shirt sleeves - I did not know you before.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I produce a certificate which I got from Mr. Clark - (read) - it is of the former conviction of the prisoner - the prisoner is the man - he was then tried by the name of Robert Baron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) This circumstance took place on Wednesday the 5th of June, at half-past nine o'clock at night - on the Saturday following I had occasion to go to the Hampstead-road, to purchase a sugar-bason for a tea-caddy; coming from there, I met a young man, who informed me a Mr. Newton of Sussex-street, almost opposite Mr. Thompson's, had called where he worked inquiring for me, with a man like an officer; I said, "What can they want of me, I will go after dinner and see;" accordingly I went on Saturday afternooon, and Mrs. Newton said Mr. Newton was not at home; I called again on Sunday morning, and again on Monday morning at nine o'clock, as requested; and an officer crossed from Mr. Thompson's, and said he wanted me; I asked him for what, he said I should see - we went over to Mr. Thompson's, and Mr. Thompon asked his boy if I was not the man; the boy said he thought I was - I was then taken to the station-house, and one or two persons went to the little boy's house, and said they had got the man, and the boy must go with them to the station-house; when the boy came they asked him if I was not the man, he said he thought I was - I was then sent to Clerkenwell-prison, where I had not been above four or five days, when a young man was brought in for a similar offence; that is the prisoner Ogden - and on the following Saturday I was taken again to Hatton-garden office, where the two notes were compared, and both hand-writings were alike, and nearly the same things sent for on the notes, and the papers torn one from the other that the two notes were wrote on; likewise the two coins both the same, and the phrase made use of to the two boys, are all convincing proofs this is the party I am accused for - my Lord and Gentlemen, does it occur to your mind, I should go and wait within five or six doors from Mr. Thompson's house for things to be brought out of his shop, from a man who knew my person perfectly well? or should I have gone three times to give myself up, had I been guilty of the deed? I have no doubt these boys thought I was the person, because I was taken up for it, for I am sure it is impossible for the boy to know, in the short period of time that the man must have been with the boy, who the man was, and at that time of night, unless he had known him previously - the prisoner Ogden says he found the note in Thornhaugh-street, it occurred to my mind then that he said so because he had been informed I lived in this street; and hearing I had been in trouble before, I have no doubt he thought it would be laid to me - now, Gentlemen, was it possible I could have wrote that note, and placed it in that street - I was in Clerkenwell-prison when he passed the note, providing he did as he says, find the note - how very well he was aware of going to purchase a counterfeit coin, and to get things under false pretences with it; the fact is, the prisoner Ogden, or some one he is acquainted with, has succeeded in getting the goods from Mr. Thompson's, and a few days after they send a note to another shop for similar articles, but gets pursued, and he is detected; and because I have unfortunately been in trouble before, the transgression is laid on my back, which I am entirely innocent of - I am in the habit of getting my living lately by making tea caddies and work tables for several respectable tradespeople, which the policeman knows to be true, as he has been to some of them - my Lord and Gentlemen, I solemnly declare, and call my God to witness, I never knew or saw the prisoner Ogden until he was brought into Clerkenwell-prison, where I was then laying for this charge; and I likewise declare, in the presence of my God, and all present, I never knew or had anything to do with the transaction whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at home that evening, finishing a tea-caddy for Mr. Graham in Holborn - is it not a shameful thing that a child like that should be allowed to swear a man's liberty away?</p>
               <p>Jury to MR. THOMPSON. Q. How long has the boy lived with you? A. Ever since the 3rd of June, he lives with me now and conducts himself well - when he saw the prisoner he said, he thought it was the man, and the other boy said, he was positive he was - Nicholson only lives eight doors from my house - it happened about nine o'clock - it was light enough to discern a person's countenance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am known personally to Mr. Thompson; is it likely I should go to a man who behaved generous to me? when I was in trouble before he got me off with a month's imprisonment.</p>

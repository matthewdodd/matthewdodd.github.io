            . I am a shoemaker. I was going up King-street, Smithfield; I saw Mr. Foster and another gentleman arm-in-arm: I saw the prisoners try two or three gentlemen's pockets before they came to Foster, and get the handkerchiefs half out: I saw Holland lift up Foster's pocket two or three times, and saw him take the handkerchief out - Parsons was alongside of him; directly he got it out, he gave it to Parsons: I was five or six yards from them; they crossed over the road to me -I crossed, and went to lay hold of them both; I got Parsons, but Holland ran away on my taking the other; directly I took hold of Parsons, he threw the handkerchief down: a gentleman picked it up, and delivered it to me- I sent a young man whom I met after Holland, who was brought to the watch-house in about half an hour; I gave the handkerchief to Wildey - the prosecutor claimed it; I am quite certain of Holland: I knew both of their persons before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not a Police-officer? A. No; I was not out with the officers; I have been present accidentally when robberies have been committed: I do not go out to look for these things; it was on Sunday night- I had been up Holborn, Brook-street, and round that way, and met Young; we were together when this happened - we were never engaged in a case together before; I saw Holland lift up the pocket two or three times before; I told the prosecutor the instant it was done; I may have been examined here six or seven times; it is not half so profitable as shoemaking - I can earn twice as much at my business.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are Toole's friend? A. We live close together; I went out to take a walk - not to look for thieves; I never gave evidence before; I was five or six yards from the prisoners - I cannot be mistaken.</p>

                  </hi> I am a sawyer, and live at Barnes. On the morning of 30th April, I was walking towards Barnes—it was just after twelve o'clock when I started from Richmond—I had met the prisoner there at the Locomotive, and drank with him at the Bricklayers' Arms at Richmond—he made a call on some friends, and I waited for him half an hour—when he came out, he put his hand on my shoulder, and asked if I was asleep—I said, "No, not exactly asleep"—I was a little the worse for liquor—my hat fell off; I reached after it, but did not get up after it; I picked it up, as I expected, and put it on—after he was gone, I missed my handkerchief, neckcloth, knife, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a halfpenny, which had a mark on it, and which I had had more than four months—I spoke to a policeman, and followed the prisoner, and met with him at Blue Anchor-passage—he had my hat on, and I had his—I found that the lining of my hat had been torn, and the maker's name taken out.</p>

I met Green on 30th April—I found the prisoner in Blue Anchor-passage—Green said, "That is my hat"—it was on the prisoner's head—I took him into custody, and found in the hat this handkerchief—he took the tobacco-box and knife from his pocket—at the station I found a half-penny, a halfcrown, Is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces in silver, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he was quite sober, but Green was a little the worse for liquor—when I took the prisoner he said he had often played such tricks before—he said it seriously—he did not add anything to it—the hat had the lining torn out.</p>

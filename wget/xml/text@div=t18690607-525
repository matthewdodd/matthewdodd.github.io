                  </hi>. I live at Northfield, Kent—on Friday, 21st May, about 1 o'clock, I was inside a hoarding in the Poultry, about to look at some Roman pavement that had been discovered there—I had a watch in my fob, with a chain and seals attached, it was pulled out of my pocket—I saw the prisoner the moment I felt the watch was gone—he darted under the barrier—I took hold of his coat, but could not keep him; he escaped from me—somebody else tried to detain him, but he escaped and got across the new sewer, and was then in a minute in the hands of the police—I went up, and my watch was then in the constable's hand—this is it.</p>

I was on duty inside the hoard<lb></lb>ing—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running across some scaffolding that is erected over the sewer—I stopped him, and took him by the collar—someone said he had robbed a gentleman of his watch—I put my hand into his left trowsers pocket, and pulled out a handker<lb></lb>chief, and as I did so he put his right hand into his right trowsers pocket and pulled this watch out, and endeavoured to pass it to somebody behind him—a gentleman took it from him and gave it to me, and the prosecutor came up and identified it—when the prisoner was charged he said that I put it into his pocket.</p>

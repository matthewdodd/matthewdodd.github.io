             delivered these two gowns and this waistcoat on the over night at Mrs. Josephs's house, as her mistress's things; the next morning she came and said Mrs. Joseph wanted these things; I delivered them to her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lived with Mrs. Joseph some time before this, she keeps a bawdy house; the reason I left my mistress was, her girls kept bad hours, they came home at two o'clock; I was very cross; she told me in the morning she would pay me, she did not; she said she should want the things by nine o'clock in the morning; I told the mangler my mistress wanted them; I took them from her with intent to iron them, as I knew they were wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. to Edwards. Does this house that Mrs. Joseph live in bear the reputation of a bawdy house - A. In my mind it would bear that character.</p>

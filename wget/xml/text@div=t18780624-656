                  </hi>. I live at Adam Place, Rotherhithe—on Friday night, 17th May, the prisoner's wife was in charge of a policeman—she asked for Mrs. Wickham—I was not exactly close enough to hear what was said, but when I got close to the door I heard the prisoner say that he would take his wife a jug of coffee and put a dose in it to settle her by the morning.</p>

When he first came in he came in with a key and went upstairs—I thought he had gone to bed, but he came down again—I don't know whether the two women were with him—I did not open the door for him—I did not see the two women that night—it is false that I opened the door—there was a little disturbance, and I told him that I could not have that disturbance at my door—he came in and shut the door and asked me for a light—it is perfectly incorrect that I opened the door for him, or that I heard what he said—there was a noise in the passage at the foot of my stairs—he had taken his niece home when he came in with the key—he spoke to the women before he took his niece home—I had the coffee ready made—he has it when he comes home at night—I had to warm it up—it was as near 12 o'clock as possible when he left the house with the coffee, and when he came back it was 12.30.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Rotherhithe—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 18th May some coffee was given to me in the station—there were about 14 1/2; ounces—I found thatitcontained both mineral and vegetable poison—sulphuric acid and opium—there was nearly half an ounce of sulphuric acid, exactly 10 per cent.—I did not find the precise amount of opium owing to the vitriol in the mixture—every process that I used failed, owing to the carbonizing effects of the vitriol, but there was abundant evidence of its presence—there was enough vitriol to destroy life most undoubtedly, irrespective of the opium—I should say that it was coffee and chicory—I withdraw my statement that there was enough opium to destroy life, as in working it out subsequently I thought that some objec<lb></lb>tion might be raised to the process.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There were two parts of coffee to one of chicory—I am only acquainted with chicory in the dry state—I have heard that it is used the same as opium is, to smoke—I have not been in Germany—I have read that it is largely grown there—I don't know that any country has actually attempted to grow chicory as a substitute for opium—I have paid particular attention to the subject of coffee, and chicory with reference to the adulteration of coffee.</p>

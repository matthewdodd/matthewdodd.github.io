                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. I was at work in a new house in the Old Kent-road, on the 13th of August—I left the tools stated the lower floor of the house, about half-past six o'clock in the afternoon—I fastened up the place with a padlock—the lower part was boarded up—I went at six o'clock in the morning, and found a person had climbed to the first floor window, and taken them—these are ray tools—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they are stamped with my name—here is the stamp.</p>

I met the prisoner on the morning of the 14th of August, at half-past nine o'clock, in Artillery-passage, Spitalfields, about four miles from the house—he had these tools in a bag—I asked where he was going—he said his father was a carpenter, and he was going to take them to him at Holy well Mount; but he was going the contrary way—I took him to the station-house, and then he said they belonged to his grandfather, who was dead, and his grandmother had given them to him.</p>

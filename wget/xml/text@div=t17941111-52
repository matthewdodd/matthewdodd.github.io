               <p>Q. How many did you lose? - I cannot justly say, my boy says four; on Tuesday evening the prisoner at the bar came into my house between the hours of six and seven, and said, he had a complaint in his bowels; he asked for a glass of something at the bar, of my wife, I belive he was served; he then set down in the tap room a bit, and asked the way in the yard, he went there a little, and as he was coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110110"></xptr>out of the passage of the yard, the bell rung, and I went by him, and felt something brush against me like a pot; I immediately caught him by the arm, and walked to a table in the tap room, where a light was; I told him he had got a pot of mine in his pocket, he was a little crusty at it, and I took one out of his right hand pocket, a pint pot; I put my hand in his left hand pocket, and I said, there is another in there, which he took out himself; I told him that was my property, and I would swear to them, and I immediately sent for a constable, before the constable came, he begged leave to go backward to the yard, and he went to the little house; while he was there I kept a person to look over him till the officer came, and he staid there till the officer came, when he took him to the Compter, after which I went and looked at the necessary, and I found a pot down the necessary, which I supposed he had in his breeches, because I rubbed him down before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I disguised in liquor very much when I came in your house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. You appeared to me to have come from your business at work; he had been doing some business for me that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is frequently done in tap rooms, to put pint pots in other peoples pockets.</p>
               <p>Court. I am very sorry to hear it.</p>

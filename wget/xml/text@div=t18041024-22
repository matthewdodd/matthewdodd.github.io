             sworn. - I am a carpenter, I worked at the Hummums: On the evening of the 15th, I saw the prisoner Follett in the coffee-room, and I saw Collins, who is not yet taken, with Follett's great coat on, Collins had no great coat of his own there; I saw Follett put something under the coat that Collins had on, and Follett buttoned it up, I could not see what it was, being under the coat; I missed them before I went out, I did not say any thing to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know, at the time, what they were taking? - A. No; they went out two or three times, the waiter said, but I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say so before; mind my question - was Welch in their company at the time? - A. Welch had been in the course of the day drinking with me; I went up to the Duke's-head, and Welch came in with this same mahogany.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you think he is sober?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I am instructed to put some questions to him, but he is so drunk I certainly shall not.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a sad thing persons cannot keep themselves sober. (The witness was ordered to stand down being intoxicated.)</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, I live at the Northumberland arms, Russell street, Covent-garden: Welch, the young man at the bar, came into my house on last Monday morning se'nnight, about six o'clock, and stopped drinking there a good while; the men that worked at the Hummums they came, and Follett with them; Welch did not work there, nor his partner, he had a job in the country. I heard one of the men, that worked at the Hummums, say, that Nest had lost his place, he was foreman before; the other men said, that Collins had got the place to be foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Collins one of those men that came in? - A. No, not early in the morning; he came in afterwards, between nine and ten o'clock, when Welch and his partner were going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing in with him; - A. He brought in a piece of mahogony with him; he asked me to put it inside of the bar; it was a small shelf, he put it in one corner of the bar, and it was there the greatest part of the day; I did not see any body take it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. First of all, Welch and his partner came into your house, they were not at work at the Hummums; Follett, and the men that were at work at the Hummums, came in by themselves; after they were in, did he join in company with those men? - A. They were drinking altogether in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Collins came in at the same time with this piece of mahogany? - A. Yes; and they all drank together.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street: I was standing at our Office-door when Mr. Nest and Mr. Headson came; I went with Nest to the prisoner's lodgings, at No. 26, Litchfield-street, on the 17th of this month, where I apprehended Follett, I found no property there; I brought him down to the watch-house at the same time; this Follett, he behaved very well; I told him I had got information from Mr. Headson, the head carpenter, that he had robbed Mr. Brown, of the Hummums, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him if he told you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he do to you? - A. That was flung out; we generally meet with a small trifle of a skirmish; we do not call that any thing, that was flung out by the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You hang upon that it was flung out; was there any circumstance of an axe in the case? - A. When I entered the room along with Nest, he took up his axe and struck at me, but he did not hit me; he was very much intoxicated with liquor at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. There is a deal better behaviour; what did he say to you? - A.Says he, I will be the death of you; I was glad to get out of the room.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know what you can make of that fellow Nest's behaviour; and as to you, you have behaved very improper; you have not told the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240013"></xptr>truth, but you have represented that he behaved extremely well. From that situation that you are in, you ought to be removed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On the morning of 11th March I was on duty in Brandon Street, Walworth, about 11 o'clock—I saw a par<lb></lb>cels delivery cart drive up to No. 28, and I saw this bag delivered—it had a white luggage label on it—when I saw it afterwards in the shop the label had been cut off—I did not see the prisoner there when it was delivered—I saw him about ten minutes afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as Franklin &amp; Co., foreign im<lb></lb>porters, at 18, Noble Street—we had some cloth consigned to us, and when we received it there was a piece missing, and some paper put in its place—this is the piece I ought to have received—it is a peculiar pattern—it was the only piece of that pattern we were to have received—it is a peculiar make—I have not seen a pattern of that kind in London up to this time—I received the case in which it ought to have come on 5th February—this piece corresponds as near as possible in the number of yards I expected—it should have been 27 3/4, but the police in measuring made it 27—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> The case in which this piece should have been, contained about twelve or fourteen pieces done up in parcels, with a stiff piece of card between every piece; and when the case was opened there was the space at the top where, the piece had been withdrawn; therefore it must have been withdrawn only recently.</p>

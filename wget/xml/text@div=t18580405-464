                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mark Wyeth, a labourer. In Oct. 1856, we lived at Wellington Terrace, Wells Boad, Sydenham, a four roomed house—theprisoner lodged with us for six months, and occupied the front room up stairs—other persons lodged with us, but they were all absent from the house—on 7th Oct., 1856, he left to go to work at 8 o'clock in the morning—I had 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the house in two different purses; 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the other—they were both kept in a tea caddy, which was locked, and I had the key—I had seen them that morning—the prisoner was not at home when I left home, and I never saw him again till last Tuesday at Greenwich; he had given notice to leave—he worked at the new reservoir at Sydenham—next morning I went to my caddy and found it broken open, and the money gone; and the two purses—it belonged to my husband—I gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and am the daughter of the last witness. The prisoner lodged with my mother—on the day he left, he did not go to his work—he sent me for half a quartern of gin in the course of the day, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of walnuts, telling me to go down to the Fox, or I should not get it good; that is quarter of a mile off—it was then about half past 12 o'clock—there was another lodger in the house, but he was out—I left the prisoner alone in the house—on my return from the Fox, I met the prisoner a little way from my mother's house, he told me that he would be back in half an hour to drink the gin, and eat the walnuts—left my mother's bed room door shut, but not locked—the prisoner never returned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many people lived in the house altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four; there were three more men lodgers besides the prisoner—my mother often kept her door locked, but not when she was in the room—the prisoner came down from his bed room about half past 8 o'clock—all this was nearly two years ago—I am now only thirteen—the prisoner gave me the money to</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, R</hi> 49). I received information of this robbery on the morning of 8th Oct., and searched for the prisoner, who I knew was living about Sydenham, but found he had left the neighbourhood—hewas taken by a constable on the morning of the 6th, at St. Alban's Gaol when his time had expired there, and brought up to London—I told him the charge, he said, that he never lived in Sydenbam, and knew nothing about it—andwhen the prosecutrix said that he lodged with her, he said, that he never lodged with her, and never was in Sydenham in his life.</p>

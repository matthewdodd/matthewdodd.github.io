                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Thomas Winkley—we live in High-street, Borough, and are watchmakers. In Jan., 1842, I took the prisoner into our service in consequence of an advertisement, and fully approving of him, I raised his wages to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—he boarded and lodged in the house exactly as one of my family—on Sunday evening, the 20th of Nov., he was taken ill, and on the Monday morning he was not able to get up—about a fortnight before that, or between a fortnight and three weeks, I had put into his hands a French gold hunting-watch to have the upper case raised, that the works might be free of the glass—the cases should have been taken off the works—when I gave it to him, I said, "I have determined on having the case raised so that it may free the glass, I have determined not to go to further expense," and I think I said, "It shall go to Fielder, in St. John-street-road," but whether I did or not, he knew that, because he was the only person I employed for that purpose—he was to have sent it by a lad I keep for that purpose, and I should have expected it would have been ready in two or three days, for the boy to have called again for it—it was not necessary that the works should have gone with the case—the prisoner knew that, decidedly—he was taken ill on the 20th of Nov., and a day or two af<lb></lb>terwards I missed the movement of this watch—he was then very ill—I said nothing to him about it—he resumed his work on the 3rd of Jan., and on the following evening I brought him the whole of his work, which I had taken away from his work-board in the shop—I said to him, "Where is the French gold hunting watch, it is high time that was completed, and fit for stock?"—he said, "Bless me, sir, has not that French gold hunting-watch come home yet? why I sent it pretty nigh a month before I was taken ill; John took it"—I said, "Where to?"—he said, "To Jackson's"—I said, "Who is Jack<lb></lb>son, is he a respectable man?"—he said, "O yes, a perfectly respectable man; the watch is safe enough"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "At the back of Clerkenwell prison"—I said, "Well, but how is it I don't see the movement of the watch amongst this work which I have delivered to you; there was no occasion for the movement to be away?"—he said, "That is with it"—I said, "For what purpose is the movement with; the case?"—he said, "O, sir, the movement was foul of the dome, it would not close"—I said, "Well, I shall send John after it in the morning"—it was then about six in the evening—he slept in the house that night, and the next morning he got up to assist the lad in opening the shop—I was uneasy, and got up as soon as he did—I was down in the shop some time, and then I went to break<lb></lb>fast, expecting him to follow me, but he did not come—I found he was gone, and never returned—he had never assigned any reason to me for going, but he seemed to be better that morning—I took some pains to find Mr. Jackson, and inquired at the back of Clerkenwell prison—I found the prisoner on the evening of the 12th of Jan., at No. 4, Victoria-place, Kent-road—after some other conversation, I said, "Now, where is the French gold hunting-watch?"—after some hesitation, he said, "At Mr. Carter's"—I said, "Where</p>

               <p>does he live?"—he said, "In President-street"—I gave him in charge—on the following evening I went to Mr. Carter's, I there found the gold hunting-watch—Mr. Carter also produced to me this pencil memorandum, which is the handwriting of the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"New cover and dome—Deane and Co., 169, Borough"—the dome is the inner case which coven the move<lb></lb>ment, and the cover is this outer case which I had given instructions to have raised—the effect of putting a new cover and a new dome on this watch, would be that I should not know the watch myself—it would take away the maker's name and the number, and destroy the identity of the watch alto<lb></lb>gether—I had never given him the slightest authority for any such alteration—it was altogether unnecessary.</p>

I am in the prosecutor's service—it is my business to carry out watches—I received this watch and another from the prisoner, to take to Mr. Fielder's, to inquire what it would come to to alter them—I took them, and brought them back, and told him Mr. Fielder said it would come to about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he never gave me this watch back to take to Fielder—I do not know Mr. Jackson living behind the new prison at Clerkenwell—I never took anything there for the prisoner.</p>

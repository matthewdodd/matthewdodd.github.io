            , at a public-house door. They stopped me, and asked me, would I have any gin. I said it was rather late. I wanted to go home to my lodging; if it had been earlier I would have no objection. Quick caught me by the right shoulder, and Williams by the left. They brought me into the Coach and Horses yard, from the public-house door; there was a light in the public-house, but the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the public-house door to the Coach and Horses yard - A.About twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How could they drag you twelve yards. Did you resist - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity to cry out, had not you. Did you know them - A. They were quite strangers.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way they do in your country, because it is an odd way in this country. Did you strike either of them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were after consenting to their getting you there - A. No, not in the least, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed the watch box, did not you - A.No. William Quick gave me a dig, and tripped up my heels, and knocked me flat on my back. I came to the ground. He catched hold of me by the handkerchief, clapped his hand upon my mouth, and as I shifted my head to call out he shifted his hand, and when he got his hand upon my mouth, John Williams bound my knees. He put his head upon my belly. I had thirty-six shillings in my pocket. He took away from my pocket a two foot rule, and six three-shilling bank tokens. Then he and Quick ran away. I jumped up immediately after they left me. I ran after them. They ran down Charles-street, towards Newton-street. Charles-street goes into Newton-street. Williams was a little before Quick. I catched Quick by the breast at the corner of Charles-street, at the Newton-street end.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you catched Quick had you called out watch - A. I was not able to cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite capable of jumping up and running after them, then what should hinder you from calling out - A. I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. That makes a little wonder in the transaction - A. I did not know that there was any assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a different story from what you told me a moment ago; you told me you were not capable of crying out - A. I thought I should come up to Quick before the watch came up to him. I cried for Mr. Orton; he came to my assistance, and lling was secured; then the patrol came up to my and I gave charge of Quick for robbing mor and Quick gave charge of me. The patrol took us both to the watchhouse to have it decided.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's shop, the corner of Newton-street. About one o'clock I heard Cogan call out for assistance, and said he was robbed. I opened my door, and ran to his assistance. I have known Quick a long time; he is a printer by trade. I never knew him work at it. Cogan is a carpenter; he works for a man in the Horse-ferry-road. Cogan has been a customer of mine a fortnight. He told me that Quick had robbed him of eighteen shillings and a two foot rule. Cogan was all over dirt. He told me the money was taken from him in the Coach and Horse yard: they got him down and fastened on him by the throat; his throat was scratched and bleeding. Oram, the patrol, came up; Quick said, I give charge of him.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was coming my regular round; I saw Quick in custody of Cogan. A number of people were round him; some were persuading Cogan to let him go. The moment I came up they gave charge of one another. I think Cogan gave charge first. I took them both in custody, and took them to the watchhouse. I searched Cogan. I found his pocket torn, and his back all over dirt. He appeared as if he had been down. I think Roberts searched Quick. No money was found upon either of them.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse keeper. At the office, Cogan took his handkerchief off, and shewed what manner his throat was in. Since then it has turned blue, and a little part scratched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Saturday evening I went to a public-house to take a pint of porter with a few friends, with several of the trade that came from the house where I was an apprentice. I stopped until eleven o'clock. On my coming down Charles-street the prosecutor laid hold of me and asked me for his money. I asked him, what money, and told him I had no money. Mr. Orton came out; he insisted upon the prosecutor taking me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Oram. What is the sign of this public-house in Charles-street - A. The Bull's Head, it is about ten yards from the Coach and Horses yard. There is no watchman stationed in Charles-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cogan. You did not indict Williams - A. Yes. On the Monday following I went before the grand jury for Quick. Williams was not taken at that time. On Thursday last I indicted Williams.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, at Wood-street, Walthamstow. On the evening of 2nd Nov. I turned a pony into Epping Forest—I looked for it next morning and could not find it—in Feb. I went to Mr. Wood's public house, at Crayford, in Kent, went into a field there, and found my pony in his possession—I told him it was mine, and that it was stolen—he mentioned the name of James Russell—I knew the prisoner all the summer; he lived and worked close to me—I last saw him a few days before I lost the pony.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, at Bexley, in Kent. Between 24th and 27th Nov. I saw the prisoner at the Ordnance Arms, Blackheath—he had the pony there, and said he had bought the pony he had been telling me about—he had told me at Greenwich market the same day that he had the pony—he said he had got a pony he thought would suit me; he knew I wanted to change my big one for a smaller one, and it was in the marshes, and I was to meet him at the Ordnance Arms—I gave him my horse, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and half a gallon of beer for it—I kept it between two and three months, and then sold it to Mr. Wood, at Crayford, for two guineas—about a fortnight after I sold it, Staples came to me, and I told him who I had sold it to—I went with him to Wood's, and there saw the pony.</p>

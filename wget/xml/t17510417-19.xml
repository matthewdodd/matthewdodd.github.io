               <p>Thomas Johnson. I lost these things mentioned the 13th of March about half an hour after eight, I had seen them about half an hour before, I detected the prisoner in Leaden-hall street on the 15th of March with two of the waistcoats on his back and the trousers on, I took him up; then he confessed he had sold one and pawn'd another of the waistcoats; I went to the pawnbroker's where he said he had pawn'd that, and fetch'd it out.</p>

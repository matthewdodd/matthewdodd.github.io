            . I know the prisoner. I have seen him write once. I saw him write this (looking at a letter).</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the paper on the other side; do you believe it to be his hand writing? A. Yes, (No. 1). I believe the signature</p>
               <p>"F. Wilson" to this (No. 2), to be his writing. (Looking at two other letters.) I believe these to be his hand-writing. On the 20th of January, I saw Mr. Morse and the prisoner at the Vine Inn, Bishopsgate-street, about ten o'clock in the morning: I was there first, and found the prisoner there. I said to him,</p>
               <p>"You don't know Mr. Morse, and you should make some inquiry as to his respectability before you do business with him." When Mr. Morse came, the prisoner said he would discount any bill which he chose to draw at 5 per cent. discount, and 2 s. 6 d. per cent. commission. He said that his brother-in-law Oglivie kept an account with the Bank of England; that they got their bills discounted at 3 per cent, and were contented with the other 2 per cent. for risk and the commission. Mr. Morse assented at once, and asked how he was to draw the bill. The prisoner at first told him, and then Morse said,</p>
               <p>"You had better write it down." The prisoner wrote down at the back of the letter what I have identified as having seen him write, and Morse copied it on a stamp, which he had sent the waiter out for.</p>
               <p>Q. When they met, did they address each other by name? A. We had first understood from the waiter at the Vine Inn that his name was Wilson, and we addressed him as Wilson, I believe. - Mr. Morse said he had received a letter signed Oglivie, which he produced; and that had brought him up to town. He asked if his name was Oglivie - he said it was Wilson; and that he did business for his brother-in-law Mr. Oglivie. He wrote the copy of the bill on the back of the letter, which Morse produced. When the bill was drawn, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"On the Wednesday following you shall receive the money." The note was put into the prisoner's hands; (looking at it) this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him write but once, and that was when he wrote the form of the note? A. Yes; and I saw him at the same time write a letter to a Mr. Markworth, and do believe this endorsement to be his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Look at the endorsement again? A. I think it is the same writing as I saw on the back of the letter, and on the letter written to Markworth, and, I believe, the letters produced to be his writing.</p>
               <p>These letters were here read, as follow: -</p>
               <p>No. 1. was addressed to Mr. Morse, at Daventry, dated January, 1825 - stating, that having been informed by a gentleman on 'Change, that he (Mr. Morse) was in want of a sum of money, and offering to discount his bill. - signed,

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to THOMAS VECK. Q. In what position did you sit when he wrote the note? A. On the opposite side of the table, so close that I could see what he wrote. Mr. Morse is my brother-in-law - he has been sued on the note, and has filed a bill in Equity.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the letter written to Markworth? A. The same morning, my Lord. I saw him direct it after the note was drawn. He said he had some money transactions with him; we afterward saw the letter on the mantel piece. I took it up, and looked at the direction - it was sealed. I had not seen the contents - I was there when he wrote and directed it.</p>

            . I live at Northampton. I know the prisoner, and have seen him London; he went by the name of Oglivie. I saw him twice - he answered to the name of Oglivie overnight when I saw him at the Ram Inn, and next morning answered to the name of Wilson. I inquired at the Ram for him by the name of Oglivie. I had called there in consequence of receiving a letter, signed</p>
               <p>"Oglivie." I answered that letter by saying, I should be at the Ram, and there I met him; he answered to that name, but next morning drew a bill, and signed it</p>
               <p>"Wilson." I then told him, I had not a very good opinion of him, and could not think of signing any bill, because he had written to me in the name of Oglivie. He was going to cash this bill for me, but I objected to accept on account of his using two names; he said he had a brother-in-law of the name of Oglivie.</p>

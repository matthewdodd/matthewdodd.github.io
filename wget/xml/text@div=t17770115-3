               <p>Did he say any thing? - I cannot recollect that he did; he had a stick or bludgeon in his hand, but did not do any thing with it: they ran back towards Canonbury-house; I followed them to Canonbury-house, thinking I should hear of them; I told several people afterwards of it and they were taken up, but my watch was never found; I had a full view of their faces; I am certain the prisoners are the men that robbed me.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Hancock give the same account then he has given now? - Exactly; he is very ill now; he was very well then; he is about 80 years of age: Hall confessed that they shared the money, and he disposed of the watch.</p>

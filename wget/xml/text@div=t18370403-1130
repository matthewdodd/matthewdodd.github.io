On the 28th of December I had been at home the whole day, and for a fortnight before, as I was very ill—about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock that night, as I was reading the newspaper in the bar parlour, I heard a strange noise in my house, and Mrs. Ivory rushed in, and ran through the shop, into our parlour—she tried the door at the bottom of the stairs, and Mrs. Spicer, who was in the bar, said, "Your husband is not here"—she replied, "You are a d—d liar"—she then went against the street door, and opened the half-door to go out, and when she got her back against the door, she turned round, and abused me</p>

               <p>in very bad language—I was inside the bar, standing at the beer-engine—there is a door to the bar, which was shut—there was no means of my getting to the street door without opening the bar door—I told her if she did not go away I would call in the police, and take her away—she looked round and saw Hornsby, the policeman, standing on the pavement, close to the door—one of the doors were open—her back came against the door—when she saw the policeman she walked away—Hornsby was quite near enough to hear and see me all the time—I had not gone out of my bar at all at that time—I was not within striking distance of the woman at any part of the time—I was never within ten feet of her, at least a long distance—I never touched her in my life, not even her clothes—I did not push her on the back, nor throw her down—I did not see her fall over the curb—I saw her fall when her husband knocked her down in the shop—that was when she came back the second time, about ten minutes after the policeman had driven her up the street—she had gone to another public-house—when she was nearly up the street, I looked out at the door, and there was not a soul in the street but the policeman and her—in about ten minutes her husband and brother came into my house, and a few minutes afterwards she came back—she began to abuse her husband, and he knocked her down, with his left hand, in her eye—I never saw the prisoner near my house that evening—I never saw him at all, to my knowledge, till he was in custody—I saw him at the Court—I am quite positive he was not in front of my house when Mrs. Ivory left it—there was not a soul in the street but the policeman and her, for I looked out at the door to see—when her husband knocked her down, she did not (all backwards, but all in a heap—she put her hand to her eye, and said to him, "You shall suffer for this; I will give you a month for this, as I have done before"—she and her husband, and brother, left the house together—I told them to go and settle their quarrels at home, and they all went—Pendry was the last man in my house, and I shut it up—I swear I never touched her at all.</p>

               <p>assault, nor fined—I gave bail—it was only a word between me and a neighbour—I have charged my husband with an assault, and sent him to prison for a month, because he came home abusing me, and had spent all the money—that was last July, the month before I married him—and when he came home he was married to me directly—he said he would never strike me any more—he did not strike me in Mr. Spicer's house—he pushed me back, and said I should not speak to Spicer, bat he did not strike me.</p>

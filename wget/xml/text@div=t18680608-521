                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of Enfield, and am one of the trustees of the prisoner's marriage settlement—my co-trustees are Mr. Drinkwater and Mr. Jordan—it is for the benefit of the wife first, who has separate use, then to the husband, and then to the children—the prisoner has applied to us from time to time to alter it—he filed a Bill in the Court of Chancery, which we answered; after that he sent letters from time to time without threats, but of an angry nature—I afterwards received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know the prisoner's writing—it is his writing, but it is not signed—I heard him admit writing it, at the Mansion House—I am the person to whom it is written—I have received other letters from time to time, and have been the subject of other threats—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was addressed Joseph Henry Jackson, dated 25th April, 1866, and contained the following expressions</hi>) "Although this letter is addressed to you, it is intended equally for your co-trustees. My wife distinctly stated that she would not oppose me, whether she approved of my course or not. I have to tell you that if you do not withdraw from the trusteeship of my marriage settlement, you must make up your mind to go further, and apply that I shall be placed under restraint, for as sure as there is a Heaven and a Hell, so sure shall I, and take this in its most extended meaning, be driven to an act of violence of no common or remediable kind. The uncontrollable feeling of revenge now raging in my breast must ere long end in a crime, the result of which will be a scaffold, if this country will consent for a person to be sacrificed when he has been driven to commit murder. I trust that the three weeks granted to a criminal to make his peace with God will be sufficient to enable me to do so. It may be that the time is at hand when the wife and the children of one of you will be a widow and fatherless."</p>

Gills and Gordon—I suppose I signed the answer to your bill in Chancery—my belief</p>

I am one of the trustees—I married the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife's sister—I am a clerk in the dividend office of the Bank of England—I met the prisoner in Bartholomew Lane, a short time before his arrest—I addressed him cordially, and he said, "Do you intend to give me that trust?"—I said, "No, it is in the hands of the Court of Chancery—he said, "You do not intend to give it up?" I said, "No"—he said, "Then, by God! I will stab you to the vital parts"—my only object has been to protect his wife and children—he is separated from his wife.</p>

I took the prisoner on 5th May—he would not hear the charge, but said he would go wherever I wished—the warrant was read at the station, and he said that he was glad it had come to a charge; that he had written to the Lord Chancellor praying him to put him under restraint, or he should be sure to do some harm, as he had not got control over himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence stated that the settlement was a voluntary one, and that it secured to him certain powers which the trustees would not allow him to exercise; that they refused to act up to the deed or to transfer their trust to others, but had always striven to injure him when he endeavoured to obtain his rights, until goaded and driven to absolute madness he wrote the letter in question, but denied any intention to carry out his threats, although had he had the command of language ten thousand times stronger he should have felt it his duty to use it. He begged that he might not be sent out into the world again while the present trustees continued, lest his feelings, now dormant, should arouse him to greater fury, for so long as the cause of those feelings existed, and his rights were not restored to him, he preferred confinement to liberty</hi>.</p>

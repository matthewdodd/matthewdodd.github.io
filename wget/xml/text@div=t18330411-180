            . I live in Jewry-street, Aldgate. I was going home one afternoon, about the 21st of March, between four and five o'clock, and had a handkerchief in my outside coat pocket; my attention was drawn by the footsteps of a person very close - I walked rather slow, thinking as the pavement was narrow that the person wanted to pass me - I stood on one side to allow him to pass, but he did not, and I walked on; the same footsteps again followed me very close, and I stood a second time to allow him to pass me, but he did not - I turned round to see who it was, and found the prisoner close behind me; he instantly jumped off the pavement from behind me - he was then in the act of stuffing a pocket-handkerchief up his back, under his jacket; part of it still hung down behind, not out of sight - it appeared the same pattern as my handkerchief; I immediately felt and found it was gone, and accused him of taking my handkerchief, which he denied - I asked what he had done with the handkerchief I saw him put behind his back; he denied having done so - I kept hold of him, and walked a little way to find an officer, and gave him in charge; he was searched, but no handkerchief was found - but while we were talking to him a witness came up with it; he had picked it up on the spot where I had seized him - he still denied it.</p>
               <p>WALTER BEATONSON. I am a labouring man. On the 21st of March I and my wife were standing at my door, and saw the prosecutor pass by, and two boys following him close; in a few moments after the gentleman had gone down the passage, I heard a cry that the gentleman's pocket was picked; I went off the step of my door, and picked the handkerchief off the grating at my door - I went down the alley, and asked the prosecutor if it was his; he had hold of the prisoner - he immediately claimed it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were there not two lads following the prosecutor? A. Yes; the other walked away when he came by my door.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 19th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I and the beadle were walking together, and looking up Northumberland-alley, I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner - he said he had robbed him of his handkerchief, and had got it up his back, and while Devey, the beadle, was searching him, Beatonson brought the handkerchief up; he said he had picked it up on his grating - the prosecutor claimed it - the prisoner denied taking it.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Olive's. I was passing the end of Northumberland-alley with the Policeman, and saw Mr. Ray, with the prisoner; he said he had been robbed of his handkerchief and the prisoner had it up his back - I was searching the prisoner, and the witness brought it up; I found no handkerchief behind his back.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, simply declaring his innocence.</p>

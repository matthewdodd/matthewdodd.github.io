            . I am a constable. On the 25th of November, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing in Portland-place, and saw the three prisoners coming down Weymouth-street, playing together; Sheehane had a hair brush in his hand - I stopped him, and asked where he got it: he said the other boys had given it to him - the others had then run away; I took it from him, and he made great resistance. I took him to the Police-office, and searched him. I found this piece of leather in his breast - I asked where he got that; he said he went about selling them, and had sold the fellow to it that morning, for 1s.; it was wrapped up in paper, and a direction written upon it, "No. 28, Marchmont-street, Burton-crescent." I went there, and they identified it. I took the other prisoners next morning, but found no property on them.</p>

Tunks and Harris came to our shop between two and three o'clock on this day, but did not buy any thing; I did not see Sheehane near the premises.

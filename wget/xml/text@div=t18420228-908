                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, St. Giles's, and sell fruit in the street. On the 1st of February, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I went into the prisoner's shop, in Buckeridge-street—she keeps an eating-house—Holland was with me—I had some bread and meat which Holland paid for—after we had done eating, I went inside the counter, being invited by a young man named Odell—there were three or four of them sitting by the fire—he <hi rend="italic">tossed</hi> a young man for a pot of been he lost it, and asked me to come inside, and have part of it, which I did—I sat down—the prisoner immediately turned round, and called me a thief—I said I was as good a character as any in the house, and then she <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me, and I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her back—she said, "Will you go out of my place, you thief," putting her two hands up, and <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> me away—she then seized a knife off a dish on the counter—I directly ran outside, and said "Are you going to take a knife to me?"—she said, yes—she followed me out from behind the counter—she went to hide the knife under her apron till I saw it—she then followed me outside, and made a blow at me, which I received on my right finger, then closed towards me, and I thought to get the knife away, but received another blow inside on my left wrist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not your hand cut by endeavouring to get the knife away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we both fell when we closed in the struggle—I was not wounded in the struggle, but before—she rushed on me before we struggled—while we were struggling, she held the knife out from behind her, and told a person to take it from her—she was then down, and me uppermost—Fits-gerald took it from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any thing to prevent her stabbing you during the scuffle if disposed to do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called out when we were down, and he took the knife from her—she might have injured me if she chose—I am sure I did not receive the cuts in the struggle—my hand was stretched out</p>

               <p>towards her at the time I received the cut on my finger—I did not run my hand against the knife—I got my wrist cut in coming towards her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had gone out, you would not have got either cut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was aggravated directly she called me a thief, and went towards her, and the <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me—the cuts could not be accidental—she followed me out from behind the counter—I thought if I had ran away, she would have given it me in my back—I closed on her with the knife—I never had a word with her before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ivy-street, St. Giles's. I went into the prisoner's shop between four and five in the morning, and had some soup—the prosecutor came in with another man—there were two men and a female behind the counter—they were <hi rend="italic">tossing</hi> for beer, and a witness won two pots—the challenger asked O'Neal to go inside the counter, and drink tone with him—he went in, and the prisoner accused him of being a thief—he said he was as good a character as any there—she pushed him, and he pushed her—she turned round, seized the carving-knife off a dish, and made several attempts to chop him—she was close to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what prevented her doing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—she was flourishing the knife about, trying to hit him if she could, and when he got her down, she said, "Take the knife out of my hand"—O'Neal said he was cut, and I took the knife from her hand—O'Neal had refused to go out of the place, and resisted—he pushed her, and she pushed him—he kept within the counter till she got the knife—he was obstinate about going out, and would not be pushed—he refused to go out, and returned her push—she fell in the struggle underneath him, and at that time he said he was cut—that was the time he complained, but I do not know when he received the injury—I did not see him try to get hold of the knife—his hands went up, but that might be to save his face—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—it is down here—that "He tried several times to get hold of the knife, and his hands went up"—I do not know that I said those words—it was before the struggle—it was after she called out to have the knife taken from her, that he said, "I am cut"—she held it out for me to take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he strike her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him—I was close by him—I did not see him squirt beer over her—I was not by the fire—it might be done without my seeing it—I sell fruit in the street</p>

                  </hi>. I am a basket-maker, and live in Lawrence-lane, St. Giles. O'Neal came into this house—I tossed with a man who invited the prosecutor to come to the fire, and when he had sat there a little while, the prisoner said, "I allow no thieves inside my counter"—he said he was no thief—she said, "Come, instantly get out of my place"—he got up—she pushed him, and he pushed her—she immediately caught hold of the carving-knife in her right hand, and pushed him with her left-hand—when he got near the door, he rushed on her, and they both fell—he was undermost, and she uppermost—O'Neal hallooed "Take the knife away, I am cut by this woman"—that was the first I heard of his being cut—the prisoner held the knife out, and called to somebody to take it, and she said it was Fitzgerald had cut the man with the knife in taking it away—I do not know how he got cut—he did not complain of being cut till he rushed upon her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not know whether he might not he cut by Fitzgerald's taking it away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw no blood come from his hand—I did not see O'Neal uppermost at all.</p>

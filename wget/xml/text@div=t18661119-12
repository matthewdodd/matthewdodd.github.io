                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at No. 19, Nicol Square—on 20th October, about half-past twelve in the morning, I was going along St. John Street—at the corner of Compton Street I passed a woman and a man—the prisoner is the woman, I am positive—there was a bright light from the public-house, so that you could see to pick up pins in the street—I did not speak to them nor they to me—as soon as I had passed about a yard and a half my hat was knocked off, and I received a blow on the side of the head, I believe from the man, but I did not see—I could not see a soul in the street besides those two—the blow was a very severe one—I was knocked down, and I remember nothing afterwards till I recovered my senses in the Royal Free Hospital—I had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pockets that night, when I got to the hospital it was gone, except a few coppers.</p>

About a quarter to two on the morning of the 20th October I was in St. John Street—I saw the prisoner there in company with a man—the prisoner was kneeling down by the prosecutor's side, and the man was standing up at the prisoner's feet—when I got within about fifteen yards of them she got up and ran away, I ran after her, caught her, and brought her back—I did not lose sight of her—the prosecutor was taken to the hospital by another constable—he was insensible—he had been drinking.</p>

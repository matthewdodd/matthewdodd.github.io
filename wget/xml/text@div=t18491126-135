                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Horton. The prisoner slept two or three nights at our house, with her mother—on a Saturday she brought these three rings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she told me she had found them on Mount-pleasant—I said she had better not part with them until she saw whether there was an advertisement—on the Sunday fortnight after she brought them, she made me a present of two of them, and I pledged them as my own property—on 24th Oct. she gave me another one to mind, and that I gave to the policeman.</p>

Q.</hi> How long had you known her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between four and five months—I believe the first night she slept at our house was the night she found the rings; at least she did not sleep, we sat up all night, because we went to see the fire in London-wall—I did not ask her to go—we said we were going, and she said she would go with us—we went at ten o'clock, and it must have been past twelve when we got home—there is only one bedroom in our house—the prisoner and I did not go to bed at all the night of the fire—no young man was introduced to the prisoner on the next night, Sunday, at our house—there was a young man there on the Saturday night, Jobs Sutton, who lives at the beer-shop—he is a friend of my husband's—he and my husband went to bed, and we sat up—I did not invite the prisoner to sleep with Sutton, and he did not ask her in my presence—on the Sunday night I put a mattress on the side of my bed, and she slept there; it was on the same bedstead; my husband, me, and she, all slept on the same bedstead—we all three undressed in that bedroom—Sutton did not come that night—I knew she was servant to Mr. Maintree—I knew her mother lived in Crown-court; I do not know how far that is from our house—I cannot say whether it is a quarter of a mile; it may be.</p>

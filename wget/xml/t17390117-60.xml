On the 6th of December I went to my Mantua-maker in the Evening, and left the Prisoner at home to take Care of the House, and clean out my Room: When I came back, I found the Street-door open; so I call'd Nanny! Nanny! bring a Candle! but no body answering, I li't a Candle, and ran up Stairs, and found my Chest of Drawers broke open, and all the Things which are mentioned in the Indictment were taken out of the Drawers, and out of another Room. I saw no more of the Prisoner till the 28th of December; then a Person that knew me, stopp'd her in Drury-Lane, and sent for me; we carried her before Mr. De Veil, and there she told me the Watch was stole away from her, by her Uncle, when she was in Liquor, and some of the Money she had spent at Rochester, the rest she had bought fine Cloaths with, which her Maid had run away with, and pawn'd she knew not where; she own'd every Thing but the Sheets.</p>

These Creatures get a poor raw Girl into their Houses, and then if they won't come to their Terms, they think it no more Harm to swear their Lives away, than I do to kill a Sheep.

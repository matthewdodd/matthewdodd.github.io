                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Richardson, who keeps a shop at the corner of Judd-street. I was outside delivering bills, and saw Henry Thompson take a stick from one of the boys who was delivering out bills with me; he then went up Judd-street, took the boots off, and gave them to his brother—he ran down by Burton<lb></lb>crescent, and we cried out, "Stop thief"—the policeman caught him, and he was brought back to the shop—he said, "Let me go, I have not had any food for two days"—James Thompson ran away—I am sure of their being the boys—I know them by seeing them about—I never spoke to them.</p>

I was-in the New-road—Hatch and Cummings came to me; I went with them, and saw James Thompson drop these boots—as soon as he saw me he ran off—I picked them up, and he was stopped in Judd-street—I did not see Henry Thompson, that I know of—he might have been there, but I was in too great a hurry to go after any others—on the Wednesday after Henry came to the office to inquire the fate of his brother—Cummings went out, and said, "That is the boy who stole the boots."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Henry Thompson's Defence</hi>. I was out with my muffins, and had been gone about an hour, when I heard my brother was taken—I was at Cam<lb></lb>den-town at that time—on the Wednesday I went to take my brother some meat, and see how he came on, and was taken.</p>

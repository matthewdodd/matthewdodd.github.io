I was not above ten minutes in the house; I was drinking. The prisoner, and one Murray, was sitting in a box, and had a girl with them; the girl struck me five or six times; she was going to strike at me again, and I shoved her from me. Murray jumped out of the box, and came and held me by the shoulders; and the prisoner came and held me round the middle, and pulled my watch out of my pocket: they both ran out at the door. I thought I felt the watch go; I called out directly: I never got it again; it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this in the open publick room? - Yes. There were several people saw him, but they do not like to come; I have asked them. The landlord seemed to laugh, and take the prisoner's part, and said it served me right. I am a <rs id="t17890114-76-viclabel398" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

There were twenty people saw me look at my watch not above a minute and a half before; so did the landlord: he will not come. Forrester was sent for, at last, to search the house. I got a warrant, and caught the prisoner in Ratcliffe-highway, between ten and eleven. I told him, and he asked me to have something to drink; then he began d - mning of me, and knocked me down two or three times. I took him to the watch-house, and the girl went along with us; she struck me several times in the watch-house, and spit in my face. The next day I heard Murray was at the same publick-house; I went and asked the landlord for him, and he laughed, and said, it was no business of his.</p>

I went out of doors to a publick-house in Wapping; I came back again, and I heard the officer had been after me. I staid there better than an hour, and he did not come. I went over the way, and had a pint of beer, and the prosecutor took me. I am a <rs id="t17890114-76-deflabel399" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

In about ten minutes after, he said he had missed his watch. This prisoner was gone out of the house. An officer was sent for, to search the tap-room; and the prisoner came and waited in the house till past eleven, and the man never came. As he was coming home, the prosecutor charged the watch with him.</p>

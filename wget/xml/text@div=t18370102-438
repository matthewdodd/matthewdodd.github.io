                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in Oxford-street. On the 19th of December, about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner came for a pennyworth of tobacco, and offered me a half-crown—I gave him two shillings and five penny pieces; they were good; I rang them first on the counter—I am a good judge of silver—I gave him the change, and turned to a of—male to ask what she wanted—the prisoner said, "I don't think this is a good shilling"—I said, "I am certain I gave you two good ones, and if you don't like it I will give you another"—I threw him down a good one, and be threw down a bad one—I said, "What! is this a bad one? you have rung the changes on me?"—he said, "I have a right to rub it to see if it is good—here are my hands, I have got no more than what you gave me"—I said, "Go along with you"—he took it—I wrapped up the shilling in a piece of paper, and ultimately gave it to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I was near Holies-street on the 19th of December, about half-past nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner—a person with me desired me to follow him, which I did—I saw him go to Mr. Minton's shop—he came out there, and crossed over to Mr. Morgan's—when he left that shop he went to Mr. Sharp's—I waited at the door, and heard the dispute about the bad shilling—he was drinking the half-pint of beer-we went in and saw Jane Andus by herself—she said, "This man has given me a bad shilling"—I said, "Mark it"—I took it, and detained the prisoner till the policeman came—I kept the shilling till I went to the station, and marked it there—the prisoner struck me violently on the hand, and caused the shilling to fall—he used all his endeavours to get possession of it, but was prevented—I took it up and gave it to the inspector, and it was given again to the constable.</p>

I went and took the prisoner—I found on him two shillings, one half-crown, and sevenpence in copper—when I went in, he put the two shillings into his mouth—I told him to take them out and give them to me—he answered he would let them stay a little longer—I saw him attempt to swallow them—I took hold of him, and he dropped them out—I had not then been to Mr. Minton's,</p>

               <p>floor is used as stables—Mr. Evans occupies one room on the first floor—on the evening of 22nd Aug. the prisoner came to me about 7 o'clock, and asked to be allowed to get some nails out of the shop, to put a shoe on a horse, and Mr. Evans's daughter asked me to take the key and go down, and let him have the nails—he is in Mr. Evans's employment—I went down, opened the shop, and went in with him—it is inside the yard, facing the dwelling house—he walked up first between the two forges, and took a piece of canvas; he then went to the bags of nails, took a handful from one bag and two from another, and then he took a handful from the bag from which he took it first—he wrapped the canvas round them, and placed them in his hat; he then took a few more out of a box, and put them into his pocket—he went out of the shop, and told me to tell Mr. Evans that he was going to put a shoe on for Mr. Biscow—I told Mr. Evans's daughter what I had seen—I should think he took two or three pounds; it was as many as he could take up with his fingers without folding his hands—they were horseshoe nails.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier, in partnership with Mr. Harris, at No. 26, London Wall The prisoner had to go to Mr. Biscow's on this evening, to take off a horseshoe and put it on again—I received informa<lb></lb>tion when I came home, about half past 8 or 9 o'clock, but did not examine the bags of nails that evening—the nails he would require for shoeing the horse would be sixes or sevens; that is not the description in the box standing in the shop—that contained nails of all sorts for common use—I understand that he shoed Mr. Biscow's horse the next morning—I have not been paid for it, because he runs a bill—the nails in the bag were nines and tens—I understood he was very much the worse for liquor, but he is a good servant, and does not get drunk at his work—I do not think he knew what he was about.</p>

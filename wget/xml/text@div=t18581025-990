I live at 26, Devonshire-street, Queen-square—the house is kept by Mr. Geary; I lodge there—on Sunday morning, the 17th of October, about 3 o'clock, I was coming home—I intended to put the latch-key in to open the door, but the door was open—I went into the house, and heard a noise, but I could not decide whether it came from up<lb></lb>stairs or down-stairs—I went down-stairs after I had a light; I went part of the way down-stairs—I put the light over the balustrade, and I saw the prisoner lying in a passage leading to the coal-cellar; he was on the stones—I went up-stairs and knocked at Mr. Geary's door; he came out—I went for a constable, and brought him to the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Devonshire-street, Bloomsbury; it is my dwelling-house. On Sunday morning, 17th October, I went to bed at nearly 1 o'clock—I left my street door shut, fastened with a latch; not locked—I keep a lodging-house, and we don't know the time the lodgers may come in—about 12 o'clock at night I had seen three pairs of boots on a shelf in the passage over where the prisoner was found lying; they were my own boots—about 3 o'clock I was awoke by the last witness—I got up and dressed myself—I found the prisoner lying down apparently tipsy in the passage—I remained in the passage till the policeman came—I gave him into custody.</p>

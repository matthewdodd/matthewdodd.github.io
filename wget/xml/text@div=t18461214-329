                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Tooley-street. I have a flour<lb></lb>loft over a passage that was formerly used as a back entrance to the Colonel Wardle public-house—that entrance is now inclosed for a coal-cellar—Wil<lb></lb>mott was my journeyman—on the 1st of Dec. a police-officer brought a loaf of cottage bread to my bakehouse—I was in the habit of allowing Wilmott four quartern loaves and one quartern of flour each week—they were delivered to him in the shop as he was going out—I have no recollection of ever giving him any cottage loaves—I am certain I did, not the last week he was with me—I never put any bread down by my flour-loft, into the coal-cellar underneath, and certainly never gave directions to any one so to do—when the policeman brought in the loaf of bread I told Wilmott it was abominable for a man like him to do it, with the wages I paid him—Beavis is potman at the public-house next door—I have examined the floor of my flour-loft, and find there is a loose board which will take up—on taking it up I could see into the coal<lb></lb>cellar below, which belongs to the public-house—the board was four feet long and ten inches wide.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be nineteen years old next Aug.—I live with my parents, at No. 24, College-street, and know Beavis—he is potman at the Colonel Wardle, which is next to Mr. Hunt's—I was employed by Beavis to clean out the tap-room, and to fetch coals and coke from the cellar which is under Mr. Hunt's flour loft—I went there about ten o'clock every morning,—on Monday, 16th Nov. I saw a bag and a string coming down, and a baker's hand, which was all over flour, through the flooring of the loft-there was something letdown—it appeared to me like bread—it was smoking hot from out of the bakehouse—I did not see Beavis while this was letting down—the person that let it down shook the string, and it broke—the bag tumbled down a little way—Beavis came in and put it into his wife's apron, and she went out with it, bag and all—some of the string that was let down was pulled up again—there is no cupboard in the cellar, there is in the tap-room—the next morning I was in the cellar, and a bag came down with flour in it—this was repeated every morning for a whole week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was for a week, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from Nov. 16th to the 23rd—I went into Beavis's employ on the 16th Nov.—I staid in his employ two weeks—I went every day, at seven o'clock in the morning when the house was opened, and came away about half-past ten o'clock to go to work—I went again at night, to help him a little—this used to happen about ten o'clock every morning—on the 16th Nov. the string broke, and the bread tumbled on the coals, then Beavis came and picked it up—he did not untie the string—I cannot read or write—before I went to Beavis I was employed at Mr. Newell's rag shop in Tooley-street, for about six weeks—he did not turn me away—I was still there when I went to Mr. Beavis—Mr. Beavis did not turn me away—I went away, because my mother would not let me go any more—I have been out at service in this way for about fire years, at different places—I bought this jacket that 1 have on—the cellar it dark—I did not swear before the Magistrate that Beavis came and untied the string—I could see in the cellar, because the door was open—he used to send me into the cellar to fetch coals, and he came in just afterwards—I told the Magistrate that it was five weeks ago I went to Beavis's, but I forgot two weeks. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to the Magistrate, "the prisoner Beavis came into the cellar, untied the string, and placed the bread in a cupboard in the cellar?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No sir, I did not say that—this is my mark—I did not mention the cup<lb></lb>board at all—if I did I must have forgotten myself—perhaps I might forget when I said he untied it from the string.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living with my brother-in-law, William Holt, who keeps the Colonel Wardle public-house; Beavis was in his employ as a pot<lb></lb>man. I found some cottage loaves lying in the cellar—two were covered over with a shovel, and two were behind the skittle-frame—I gave information to Mr. Hunt, and the policeman marked the bread—I went into the cellar the morning afterwards, and missed two loaves—I found that the two loaves were moved into a cupboard in the tap-room, and covered with a bag—the cupboard is on the opposite side to the coal-cellar—Beavis keeps the key of that cupboard.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant M</hi> 10.) I was called in by Mr. Martin to the Colonel Wardle. I went into the coal-cellar, and saw four loaves of bread—I marked them—I afterwards saw Mr. Martin take a cottage loaf out of the cupboard in the presence of Beavis—Beavis said at first he did not know how it came there—he afterwards said he received it from the baker's man next door, Mr. Hunt's, to take care of it for him—that was one of the loaves I had marked in the cellar—Beavis also stated that he bad never taken more than nine or ten, that he had received from the baker's man.</p>

I live in the front room on the first-floor, and let the rest of the house out in lodgings, but the whole house is mine. On the 17th of March, between eight and nine o'clock at night, Mary Gassine came into my room and said there were thieves in the back yard. I went into the back yard, and saw a piece of glass broken out of one of the squares in the back window-the window was half open; I looked in and saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards in the room; I ordered him to walk out, which he did, and I collared him as he was coming out of the window. I asked him what he got there for? he said for a night's lodging. He had got in at the window, it was shut before - He broke the window, it was tied with a cord; I had not fastened it.</p>

            . I fastened the window with a cord. I saw it fastened about half an hour before the prisoner was taken-it is a sash-window; I tied the cord round the button of the window-it must have been entered by violence, and the glass afterwards broken. The room is on the ground-floor, I rent it with the shop. I saw the prisoner in custody-there was nothing found on him.</p>

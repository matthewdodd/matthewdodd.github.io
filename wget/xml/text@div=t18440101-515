                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Mahon; we live at Peckham. These two gowns are my daughter's, who is in place—they were at my place, and I had the care of them—this shawl and petticoat are mine—they were safe in my bed-room, on my bolster, on the 11th of Dec.—I went out at half-past nine o'clock—I did not leave any body in my house—I locked the house door, but not the bed-room door—I returned about five minutes past twelve—my husband was then at home—my husband had cracked the win<lb></lb>dow, and there was a bit of putty put in it—when I came home it was broken in two halves, and it was out of the frame—I missed the articles which I had left on the bolster in the bed-room—the window that was broken was better than a yard from the bolster—a person could not get these things through that pane of glass, except with a stick, which I saw on the ground outside, but there was no hook to it—I know nothing about the prisoners, but these things are mine.</p>

On Monday morning, the 11th of Dec, at half-past eleven o'clock, I was at the bridge at Camberwell, leading towards Peckham—I saw the prisoners together, coming from towards Peckham—they stopped in the middle of the field, and Bond gave Levy a bundle—they were nearly half a mile from where the prosecutor lives—Levy put the bundle into his bag, and went towards Peckham, and Bond came towards me—I asked what he had given to the Jew—he replied, "Nothing"—I said, "Yes, you have, a blue bundle"—he said, "That was a bundle that fell from a coach"—I said I was not satisfied, I should detain him—I left him with a gentleman, and went after Levy—I said to him, "You have received a bundle from a young man in the field"—he said he had not—I said, "You have"—he said, "Oh, I have got a bundle, and I am to meet the young man at a public-house in Peckham"—I took the bag from him, and found in it this blue cotton, these two gowns, and this saw—I found these two petticoats under Bond's coat, and this shawl he had with him.</p>

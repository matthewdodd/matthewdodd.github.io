               <p>one item, but it will all have to come out now"—I took him to Bow Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Six or seven months ago I entered Mr. Spencer's service as postal telegraph clerk, understanding I was to have nothing to do with the other business. I had only been there two or three days when he gave me to understand that I should have to copy certain, particulars into his book, and to write labels for medicine and other matters, which took up a great deal of my time. With reference to the omitted deposits, if the amounts had been in the till, the accounts will show so much over. When I entered his service I asked him what notice I was to take of these columns. He said "Take no notice whatever whenever we are short, and put it as balance; and when we are over, it is deducted from the cash." During the whole time I have been in his service he has caused me to falsify the accounts night after night, sometimes 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being money he has had for his own purposes. I can prove that he has embezzled money himself from the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Calloway.</p>
               <p>W. G. <hi rend="smallCaps">SPENCER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">recalled</hi>). It is utterly false that the accounts were falsified under my instructions, or that I have taken money for my own purposes—there is no such case; in fact, I have a deposit in the bank.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You know very well that so much was put down as in the bank when it was not there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Only when you took the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know Mr. Calloway very well—it is not true that in December last, when he had a sum of money paid to him on account of post-office orders, he had under-estimated the amount, and that I knew it and kept the amount back—I paid him right—I gave you 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to deposit in the bank on the previous Thursday, and you did not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You are a rogue, and you have put it all upon me. You have cheated customers before my face, and told me to do the same, and your own assistant in the other department can tell the same. I cannot afford counsel to speak for me, and therefore I know the case will go against me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. This letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is in the prisoner's writing—it is addressed to me.

I am very thankful to you for overlooking the last occurrence. I must confess that for a long time I have falsified the accounts, for which I am thoroughly ashamed, adding what was deficient of the money and making it appear correct. The deficiency has been taken a little at a time, I thinking sure I could make it up, which I have been unable to do. It makes it worse when I know I am capable of doing the accounts correct. I can say no more in explanation, only that whatever appears deficient I will endeavour to repay, and throw myself on your mercy. For the sake of my father, who is dangerously ill, I beg you not to expose me this 'once, and for the future, if you should think fit to retain me, you shall never have cause to complain again. F.

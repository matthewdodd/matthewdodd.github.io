On the 28th of November, the prisoner and another woman was by the door looking at some goods, I invited the other woman to walk in, she declined coming in. I looked at the prisoner; I saw a bulk in her apron, and a piece of print hanging out; I asked her what she had in her apron, she said nothing; I took her apron down, I found it to be a piece of print. This is the print.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that print being in your master's place. - A. I do. This print was hanging on a rail in the shop near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it. - A. Twenty three pence a yard. When I found the print in her apron, the prisoner then said the other woman gave it to her, she made her escape.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a woman drop this print, I picked it up. I returned back to the door with it on my arm, he asked some woman what I had got there, I said I did not know rightly myself, he took it to the counter, and wrote upon it himself, and at the watch-house, he said he would swear to it; if I had known of its being stolen, I certainly should have gone away with it; but I did not, I went to the door with it.</p>

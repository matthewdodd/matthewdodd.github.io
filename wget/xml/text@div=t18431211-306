                  </hi>. I am a native of Cork. On the 25th of Sept., about five o'clock, I was at the Ram-yard, Smithfield, and left to go to my lodging, in White Horse-alley—I there saw the prisoner standing at Pemberton's door—I had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with Edward Pemberton, who called me to account for striking his brother—I told him I would serve him the same if he deserved it—Thomas Pemberton struck me with a stick—I pulled it from him, and struck at him with force—I missed him, and, I think, just touched the prisoner, who said, "I will cut your belly out, you b—, with a knife, if you hit me any more"—I did not bit him again, nor have any words with him, but he struck me with a knife—I felt myself wounded, went into my lodging, sat down, and sent for a doctor—I saw nothing of the knife till he struck me.</p>

I was out in the alley, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner take a knife out of his pocket and immediately run at the prosecutor, stooping down, and attempting to stab him—I did not see him stab him—he said he would rip his guts out.</p>

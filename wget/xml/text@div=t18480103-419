                  </hi> I am assistant to Mr. Winter, a perfumer, in Oxford-street. On 16th Dec. the two prisoners came there, about a quarter-pass five o'clock in the afternoon—Jones asked for a piece of sponge—I showed her some—she selected piece, which came to half-a-crown—she tendered a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay for it—I took the note into the parlour, to Mr. Winter, who was there at tea with Mr. Winter—Mr. Winter came from the parlour to give the change—she took out a purse and a pocket-book—she took four sovereigns from the purse and laid them on the counter, and was proceeding to take the remainder of the change from the till—she took out a half-sovereigh and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—Jones took up one of the sovereigns, and put it in her purse—Mr. winter had asked me the price of the sponge—I told her—Leavy remarked, that the sponge being only half-a-crown, she had half-a-crown, and she would pay for it—she produced half-a-crown—Jones then requested the note back again—Mr. Winter gave it her, and took the change up again—Jones took a sovereign out of her purse, and laid it down—they then went out—Mr. Winter counted the silver, and put that and the half-sovereign in the till—in consequence of what I said to her, she placed the sovereigns on on the glass-case and was looking at them with me—one was counterfeit—I immediately went in pursuit of the prisoners, I could not find them—when I returned, the sovereigns were on the glass-case—I saw this one amongst them—I weighed it with another, and found it was deficient in weight—there was then a bite on it—Mr. Winter wrapped it up in paper, and put it in the glass-casethe</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of my mother, Mr. Johnson, who keeps the George Inn, in Smithfield. On Friday, 17th Dec., between one an I two o'clock, the two prisoners came and asked for some port wine—I am sure the prisoners are the persons—it came to a shilling—Jones asked if we could accommodate them with change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I took the note to my mother, and she could not—I took it into the parlour, and obtained the change from some persons who were paying for stock they had bought in the market—I obtained four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns, and gave them to Jones—I then took one half-sovereign to my mother, to take a shil<lb></lb>ling for the wine—she gave me change, and I put down two half-crowns and four shillings—while I was getting the change for the half-sovereign, a con<lb></lb>versation commenced between Jones and the barrnaid respecting one of the sovereigns—I did not exactly hear the conversation—I think it was, that she thought that sovereign did not sound so well as the others did, and she should not like to take it—my mother overhearing it, and being vexed, got up, and said, "Give me your money back again, and I will get you your note"—they did so—my mother took the money back to the gentleman, got from him the five-pound note, and gave him the money—she then gave the prisoners the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and they went away very quickly—Jones received the money, and she returned it back again—I belive the wine was paid for by a shilling; but I did not see that done—I saw my mother take back the change to Mr. Young; and immediately after he had it given back, he com<lb></lb>plained of one of the sovereigns my mother had given him—that was in the sitting-room—the prisoners had then left—I had left them at the bar when my mother took the change in to Mr. Young, and when I returned to the has they were not there—the bad sovereign was given to Inspector White.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Purcell, of Cornhill. On Friday, 17th Dec., the two prisoners came there, about two o'clock or past—Jones asked for half-a-dozen puffs—they came to a shilling—she asked if I could oblige her with change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said, "Yes"—I gave her four sovereigns, one half-sovereign, a five shilling piece, and four shillings—the shop was full of customers—I gave the change into Jones' hand—as soon as I had done that, my attention was called to another customer—Levy then asked me the price of half-a-dozen puffs—I said, a shilling—she said, "Bless me, only a shilling! I will pay for them"—I replied, "I have taken for them out of the note, and given the lady the change"—she replied, "I will pay for them"—I received from her the shilling, and Jones gave me the change back—I had not given back the note—I saw one of the sovereigns was bad—I said, "This is your game, is it? I will send for a policeman"—while I was looking at the money, Levy said, "Give me sixpenny-worth of mixed biscuits, young man"—that did not call off my attention—I looked at the money and found one sovereign was bad—the young man who was in the shop went out called in an officer who happened to be outside the door—the prisoners could not understand what I meant—they said, was it a bad 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said, "No bout you have changed one of my good sove<lb></lb>reigns for a bad one"—they said, "I do not know what the young man can mean, is it a bad note?"—I had noticed the four sovereigns which I had given in change to Jones—I took them out of the till one by one—I saw</p>

               <p>they were good, and directly the money was returned, I saw one was bad—the officer took the prisoners to the station—this is the sovereign—I gave it to the officer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell the officer to do anything particular when he came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "I will give these two ladies in charge"—I told him to take hold of their hands, and take care they did not swallow the sovereign—I believe the policeman found nothing on them but an empty purse—when I had given the change, I had two or three sovereigns left—I had taken them in the course of the day—I did not weight any of the sovereigns.</p>

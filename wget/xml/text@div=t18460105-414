                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 8.) On the 17th of Dec, in consequence of instructions, I placed myself near Reid's brewery, in Liquorpond-street, about half-past six o'clock in the evening—I saw Mr. Smith's cart under the shoot of the brewery and the grains were shot in—there was a lad in the cart treading the grains down as they were shot in—I saw Tubbs standing between the wheel of the cart and the brewhouse wall—he had something like a part of a tin kettle in his hand, and as the grains came down the shoot into the cart I saw him guiding the grains so as to fall into a bushel basket which he had—he filled his basket, the grains were hot and smoking very much, which prevented the boy in the cart seeing what was going on below—when Tubbs bad got his basket full he took it across the road, and I saw a cart standing near Laystall-street—Badham was in the cart, and Tew standing close to the back part of it—Tubbs took the grains to Tew—I drew as close as I could get—Tew said to Tubbs, "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this"—Tew then took up the grains and handed them up to Badham, who was in the cart—Badham emptied them out, and returned the basket to the ground—Tew then gave Tubbs 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and said, "Can't you get me another bushel?"—Tubbs said, "O yes"—he took up the basket, but he saw me, threw it down and ran away—I secured the other two prisoners, and Coombs who was with me, ran after Tubbs.</p>

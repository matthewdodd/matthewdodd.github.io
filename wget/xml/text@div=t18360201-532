                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Capps, a pawnbroker, of Old-street-road. On the afternoon of the 2nd of December, I missed a tea-caddy from a stand outside the shop—I had observed the prisoner about there some time, looking at several articles—she several ques<lb></lb>tions to me—I afterwards found the caddy pawned at Cotton's, in Shore<lb></lb>ditch, and redeemed it—I know it by a private mark on it—it has been sold—the prisoner was afterwards brought to the house, and given in charge.</p>

I never was in his shop in my life—I saw the caddy exposed for sale at the prosecutor's door—I went to ask the price of some goods, and this young man said, "Why did you pawn a stolen tea-caddy?"—I said, "I did not." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She acknowledged at Workship-street that she did pledge it at our shop—I have seen her several times—our premises were burnt in November, 1834, and it was before that she used to pawn it our shop—she has not pawned any thing since with us; but I recollect her well—I am quite certain she is the person—the foreman took in the pledge—he cannot swear to her, as he did not know her before—I was in the shop at the time she pawned it—she was the only customer in there—I heard that it was stolen in about half an hour.</p>

I had a javelin screwed on the end of my walking stick (it went on with a socket, the blade about nine inches long) but the scabbard happen'd to be on.

I judge by the size of the men; they are the size of two of them. When I went into Bridewell, Ball pulled off his hat to me as soon as I came into the place; I ask'd who he was?

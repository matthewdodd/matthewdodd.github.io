            . I am a Police patrol of Bow-street. On the 14th of November, in consequence of information, I went to a house in Jubilee-court, Parliament-street, Dogrow, Bethnal-green, in the County of Middlesex - the house consists of two rooms, one over the other, and a small shed; there is an internal communication between the lower-room and the shed, and there is an outer-door to the shed - I went in company with Keys, Drew, and Messrs. Powells'; I went down the court and saw the door open - I ran into the house directly, and saw the male prisoner sitting at dinner; the female prisoner was there, another female, who gave her name as Hounsom, and a child - there is no passage, the door opens into the room; the male prisoner was sitting at a table at dinner and the female prisoner also, but Hounsom was sitting away from the table - I understand she is the female prisoner's mother; the room is very small - I said to the man "Coleman, what have you got in the house?" he said Nothing; I handcuffed him, and commenced searching the place - I left him in the custody of Keys while I searched the lower part of the place - the door of the shed leading from the room was ajar, about half a yard open; I went into the shed, and directly I got there I saw a tub with some straw in it - there was a donkey and some fowls in the shed; here is the tub with the straw in it, and in this piece of paper, under the straw, I found these moulds, which I now produce - they have the impression of a shilling on them; there is a mark of the letter T on one of the impressions - I afterwards saw a shilling produced, and that shilling corresponded with the mould, and had the letter T on it; I took care of the male prisoner while Drew and Keys went up with Rhoda to search up stairs - and while they were up stairs

             said," Thank God you have not caught me making any thing;" he repeated this again, and I said "No, you were sitting at your dinner" - he afterwards said,"Vann, tell me the worst they can do with me for having the things in my possession;" I said "You had better say nothing, it is a capital offence, you had better hold your tongue" - he stood still for a minute or two, and afterwards said, "Did you ever know any body hung for it?" I said,"There was a man convicted at Kingston;" he said, "Oh, you mean ireland, but he was not hanged" - he then said,"Well, I don't mind, if they send me and my old woman away;" there was a little scuffle with the prisoner - he was in a state of agitation; he pushed against the table and some things fell down, but I do not know that it was more than an accident - Drew came down and threatened him unless he was quiet, and went up again; when they all came down I commenced searching the lower room - I searched a cupboard by the side of the fire-place, and found a pipkin containing fused metal quite cold, but it had been fused, and on the floor of the cupboard I found a similar piece of metal and two tobacco-pipes, one of which had part of the same kind of metal in the bowl of it, and that pipe was black from the smoke of fire; I also found in the cupboard a pot containing some glass-paper and pieces of leather, and a piece of rag - they have been used with something of a white description; I found a tin canister in the cupboard that contained the paper and rags; I found a counterfeit half-crown and shilling in a canister on the mantel-piece over the fire-place - there was some matting before the fire-place; I examined that, and found several splashes of metal on it; they had fallen on the matting and adhered to it - I tore it off and have brought it here; I found in the room a file, which appears to have a particle of white metal in the teeth of it - the outer-door of the shed was closed; Drew examined that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What time of day did you go there? A.Between one and two o'clock- the door leading from the room to the shed was ajar; there is another door which opens to the street - there was a donkey and fowls there; I found nothing in the shed which appeared to have been used with the metal, except the mould - there were no tinker's tools in the shed; there were such tools in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know he is a man who works in metal and travels the country? A. No; I had rather say nothing about that - I do not know it; I did not search his person - I should think it was about three yards from where he sat to the tub in the shed - directly on entering the shed the tub stood close to the threshold of the door: it might be four yards - he did not say the donkey and things in the shed did not belong to him; he said he was a costermonger, and got his living by the donkey - he did not say he had lent the donkey to any body; I had found the things before I had the conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, "Well, you did not catch me doing anything, and so you cannot hang me?" A.Those were his words; that is part of what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards, with the same danger before his eyes, he asked you the worst of it? A.Just so.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You asked the man whose the donkey was? A. Yes; he said it was his own - he did not say he had lent it to any body, nor that he had lent the shed to any body, in my presence - there are a number of poor persons living about there.</p>

I accompanied the other officers to the house; I stood at the back part of the house till the prisoners were in custody; I then went round, and went into the shed with Vann - he went to the tub, lifted up the straw, took something out, and said, "What is this?" he gave it to Mr. Powell - I went up stairs, and found five Britannia metal table-spoons on a shelf; the shelf seemed to have white on it, as if wet had been put on it - plaster of Paris or something; I found several pieces of leather, and a knife with plaster of Paris on it, two old tooth-brushes, with the handles covered with plaster of Paris; I found a cup with some paper and powder in it, and sandpaper, which had been used, apparently, to rub white metal - I found the bottom of a plate with plaster of Paris on it; I also found a large piece of cloth, with drops of metal on each side of it - in the cupboard, I found four Britannia metal tea-spoons; I went down stairs, and saw a woman who goes by the name of Hannah Hounsom; I searched her, and found a purse, containing three sovereigns, a half-crown, a sixpence, and two shillings, all good; the prisoners were present at the time - she said it was her money, and before I asked her how she got it, she said,"The two shillings I took of my daughter, for making a shirt, which I brought home this day;" I have since looked at the shillings, and a mark, like the letter T, is on the head side of one of those shillings on the neck - I have that shilling, and produce it; while I was up stairs, I heard some words below - I went down, and asked Vann what was the matter; he said Coleman seemed very restless - I said, "Coleman, behave yourself as you ought to do, you will have nothing but civility from us; if you make any resistance, by G-d I will shoot you!" he said I might shoot and be d-d; he then addressed himself to Vann, and said, "You did not catch me doing any thing; you cannot hang me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You found marks of white on the shelf - that might be whitening? A. It might; I found sand-paper, which had been rubbing white metal - not leather; leather is used to clean spoons, or metal goods, no doubt.</p>

            .

This mould is capable of making the impression on both sides of the shilling, by the process of casting, and a very perfect one; both the obverse and reverse sides; I have compared the impression in the mould<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040076"></xptr>with the two shillings, and have no doubt it was made from those shillings - the mould is capable of giving a very good impression of both sides of a shilling; they are the best I ever saw - I have examined the various articles produced by the officers; the greater part of them are such as may be applied to the process of casting, or making money - I have seen sand-paper and leather, which may be used to give it a brighter appearance after it has been cast, to render it fit for circulation; I cannot say much about this file having been used with white metal; here are some small pieces of glass-paper, which have apparently been used to metal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. All these materials are applicable to ten thousand other purposes? A. They might be used for other purposes - the impressions are quite white, but the mouth of the mould is discoloured, which I suppose to have been done by hot metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the beat of the metal produce the same degree of discoloration in the impression? A. No; you might pour metal into it several times without producing discoloration on the impression, but the metal is at an increased heat at the mouth, but is much diminished as it goes down the channel; if it had been used very much, it would be more discolored, certainly; I do not swear, from the appearance of the impressions, that any shillings have been made by it - I rather think there has, by the general appearance, from the channel.</p>

            . I am a lecturer on natural philosophy, and am assistant to the natural philosophy class at the London University; I am a chymist, and have analyzed the materials of which this mould is made: I find it to be what is commonly called plaster of Paris, sulphuric-acid, and lime.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Could you discover sulphuric-acid in the analyzation of it? A. Yes; there is not any chalk in it - it is called sulphurate of lime.</p>

            's Defence. I am entirely innocent - one of the officers (Drew) never entered the shed; he took the money from our mother, and gave it back to her again, because it was good; they put us into a coach - a man called him out of the coach, and talked to him - he came in again, and said "Old woman, give us your purse, will you?" she gave it to him, and when he came to the office at night, he said he had found a shilling in the purse which corresponded with the mould - I have witnesses to prove the shed-door was open at the time, and was never fastened.</p>

            . I live in Jubilee-court, and know the male prisoner - he lives at No. 3; I do not know what trade he is, further than seeing him go out with a donkey, and with fruit; I know his house and shed, but was never in it much - his shed is open at all hours, day and night; I have seen it open at twelve o'clock at night and five in the morning; I have seen several people going in and out- he lent his donkey to Lyons, his next-door neighbour, who is a costermonger - he used to go to the shed - it was left open a good deal for the use of both parties; I never saw any thing carried into the shed.</p>

            . I live in Jubilee-court, next door to the prisoner - he frequently lent me his donkey for about seven weeks at times when he was not using it; his shed has an outer-door leading to the court; that was left open; the bolt was broken off about eight weeks ago: since that, it has been fastened with a nail just put through into the doorpost; I have seen it open, for the ass could open it by knocking his head against it, and I have had to go to the field to find the ass, as it has got out - I have gone into the stable to feed the ass.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen other people go in and out? A. I have seen people who I have brought with me go in.</p>
               <p>MR. ATKINSON. The prisoner was never employed by the Mint - he had no authority from the Lords of the Treasury, or any body else, to make money.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. FIELD. Q. Is it your opinion that the good shillings have been polished? A. The brightness on the shillings is produced by the plaster of Paris being on it; some spoons have been produced which are made of similar metal to that found melted.</p>

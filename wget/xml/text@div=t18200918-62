            . I live with my father, who is a silversmith, near Temple-bar. On the 23d of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, I was coming towards home, and was within six doors of <placeName id="t18200918-62-crimeloc349">Temple-bar</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200918-62-crimeloc349" type="placeName" value="Temple-bar"></interp>

I turned round, and saw Tobin and Garner (I had seen a third person with them before. I first saw them near Johnson's-court.) On my turning round, Garner said he perceived I wanted a pocket handkerchief, and he would lend me his with a great deal of pleasure. I said I did not want his, but was sure that he or one of his party had taken one belonging to me; he and Tobin abused me, and wanted to know how I could be so impudent as to charge such persons as them with it. I told the watchman at Temple-bar, that I had been robbed. He said point out the party, and I will take them. I pointed them out; there was a crowd, the watchman took them, and Temple came through the bar. They recognised each other; and said they had all been together the whole of the morning. I should not have known him without that. My father was with me, and with assistance they were taken to the watch-house. Temple had my handkerchief in his hand when he walked into the watch-house. I am certain it is mine. They spoke to each other as companions.</p>
               <p>MR. T. HARPER. I was with my son; I did not see the prisoners till he said he had been robbed. I then saw Temple go through the Bar in the road-way, and the other two went through the foot-way. Temple came round and met them; they all identified each other; observing, they had been together all the evening. It was Sunday night, they were decently dressed. I desired the watchman to take them to the watch-house. He quitted his hold of Tobin, and took hold of Temple; Tobin said he would go with us. But a little way further I met another, and desired him to take him. My son looked at Temple's hand, and said, that is my handkerchief, it was taken from him, and proved to be so. Three very good gloves were found in Temple's pocket. I asked what he wanted with three gloves; he replied one was his father's; but Garner cried out, that is my glove. They still continued to identify each other till the handkerchief was found. Then the other two declared they never saw Temple before in their lives.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did Temple conceal the handkerchief - A. I rather think he had it in his hand all the way; it was rumpled up in his hand in a very small compass. He held it between his hands.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty near Mr. Harper's door; the prosecutor, his father, and some others of the family, came home about eleven o'clock - the son came up, and said three notorious thieves had been at his pockets. I said point them out - I stepped with him under the foot archway of the bar, and there he pointed out Tobin and Garner. I collared them, and the instant I had done so Temple got to the entrance of the Strand side of the bar, coming into it - he advanced a few paces, Mr. Harper said</p>
               <p>"This is another of the fellows, I think." I let go of Tobin, took Temple, and with assistance the prisoners were taken to the watch-house. Garner was exclaiming against Mr. Harper for charging him with a crime - Temple said</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue, there will be plenty of opportunity to say what you have to say afterwards." When they got to the watch-house, the prosecuter saw his handkerchief in Temple's hand, I also saw it at the same time, he said</p>
               <p>"That is my handkerchief" - Temple immediately laid it on the table - he claimed it, and Temple said nothing to it - one of them had three gloves, another who had only one claimed it. I cannot exactly say who it was.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the watch-house, when the prisoners were brought in. I found three gloves on Garner, and one on Tobin - Garner said they were his father's - Tobin said it was his. Temple had Mr. Harper's handkerchief rumpled up in his hand.</p>

               <p>TEMPLE'S Defence. You will plainly see I am not the individual. I heard Mr. Harper charge the two with picking his pocket, I naturally stopped, picked up the handkerchief, and followed them to the watch-house with it, and when I heard it was the same handkerchief which was lost I immediately produced it. I was not charged with the robbery till then. If I had intended to rob him of his property I should not have gone to the watch-house; I voluntarily produced it.</p>

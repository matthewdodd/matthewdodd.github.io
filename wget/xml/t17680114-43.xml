            . About the middle of November, I was at home in my counting-house in New-street-square, the prisoner came to me, and said he had some oak laths to sell; I knowing it was an uncommon thing in our trade for people to have such smull parcels of laths to dispose of, I imagined he must not come honestly by them; I desired to look at them, and asked where they were; he went away, and in about half an hour he returned, and brought two bundles; then I said I really believed he had stole them; he said they were sent him from a tenant out of the country, I could not give credit to it; then he said if I went to his lodgings, they would give me an account of his character; I went to the house where he said he lodged, the person of the house came to the door; I said do you know this man; yes, said he, he lodges with me; I said I believed he has stole some laths, upon which the prisoner began to move; I said you must not go away; then he went into the house and up stairs, and in about a minute the man of the house cried out there is something broke; we ran into the back yard, the prisoner was got out of the window, and got up upon the top of the house, I saw him running on the ridge; I got a constable and he was taken; I went with him to Justice Girdler, he was committed for farther examination; then there appeared an advertisement in the paper, that a person had stopt some laths in the same way.</p>

            . On the 17th of November the prisoner brought four hundred of laths, and offered me them, and a large chimney-pot, and some Dutch tiles; I asked who they belonged to; he told me they belonged to the widow Young, who lived at, or near the White Swan, Fetter-lane; I sent one of my men to enquire after this widow Young, there was no such person to be found. I advertised the things on the 24th of November, and I received a letter from Justice Girdler to attend him on the 30th; I went, and there I found the prisoner.</p>

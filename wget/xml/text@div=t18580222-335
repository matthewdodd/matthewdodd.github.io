                  </hi>. I am a leather seller, of No. 69, Dudley Street, St. Giles's; I rent the house and sleep there. On 9th Feb., about 1 o'clock, I went to bed, having made the house fast—about 5 o'clock I was awakened by a policeman, and found a window broken and the shutter removed—I missed these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the window; they were safe overnight—they are my property, and are worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen the prisoner once or twice before; the last time was about a month before—here are marks on some of these boot fronts.</p>

On 9th Feb., about 5 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Dudley Street, and saw the prisoner and two other men—I concealed myself in a doorway about fourteen yards off and saw the prisoner go up to Mr. Virgo's shop, put something between the shutter and pull it away, and likewise break a pane of glass—he then deliberately put his arm through the hole and pulled out several boot fronts, and the two others assisted him—they took the property to No. 27, opposite, threw it down in the passage, and then came back again, and I saw the prisoner bring out a roll of leather—I followed them across the road to No. 27—they went in, and almost directly the prisoner came out and I took him in custody—the others escaped—I told the prisoner the charge; he made no reply—I took him back to No. 27, and found all this property in the passage I then roused Mr. Virgo.</p>

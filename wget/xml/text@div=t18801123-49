I live at 53, Gloucester Street, Bloomsbury—on 7th November, at 11.15 p.m., I came from a refreshment-house in Fox Court, Holborn—some women were quarrelling—I stopped to look on—the pri<lb></lb>soner came in front of me, struck me on my head, and knocked me down—my head went against the Wall, and I was insensible—when I came to I missed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a penknife—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I am a widow, and live at 9, Green Street, Paddington—on 7th November, at 11.15, I was waiting in a house in Fox Court and heard a great noise—after it was over I saw a lot of men and women, who had been quarrelling—I saw the prisoner knock Laird down, and his head came in contact with a window—one of the men fell on him, and the prisoner knelt down and put one hand over his mouth and the other in his trousers pocket—I heard money rattle and ran for a policeman, who took the prisoner, and took the money out of his left hand.</p>

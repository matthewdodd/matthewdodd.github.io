               <p>to the back window, but did not see any one—I sprang my rattle, and got assistance—I then found the back window on the first floor broken to pieces—103, Shurety, came to my assistance—we searched the house, and found the attic front door broken open, as if it was done with a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—the window of the front attic was open—I and the other policeman got on the roof and searched it—we went along the roofs from one end to the other—there are 21 houses—the other constable apprehended the prisoner 15 houses off from No. 25—I searched him, and found on him pick-locks, a latch-key, a wax taper, some lucifer matches, and a song book—he had his boots in his hand—he had, to stoop down to put his boots on, and I saw the other constable take a watch from him—he seemed to take it from the back of his neck—I produce the watch—the prisoner was taken to the station-house by the other constable—I returned to the empty house—the next morning I went to No. 28, and found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> outside the window—it was in the gutter at the top of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who occupies that house - A. My husband. On the 29th of July, between the hours of ten and eleven, I finished washing; I left a blue cotton striped jacket, two waistcoats, and three pair of pantaloons in a pail of water, close by the kitchen door, for the purpose of hanging them out in the morning; in the morning they were gone; I heard a rustling as I thought in the morning between three and four o'clock; when I got up between seven and eight o'clock, I found the yard door open; I had fastened my doors on the over night and the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find your front door - A. Shut; it goes on a spring lock. I have seen one pair of pantaloons since.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to Marlborough street office. Mr. Alder brought the prisoner Spencer up to the office and delivered her in my charge; I asked her how she came by these pantaloons; after some hesitation, she said she would take me to the person that gave them to her. I went with her to a house in a court by Fitzroy market; I went up one pair of stairs to a room door, she put her mouth to the key hole; she said it is me; the door opened. There was a woman behind the door; she pointed to the woman, and said that is the woman I had the pantaloons of. The prisoner Macklin did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Macklin's Defence. I was going up Tottenham Court road, I met a young man, he asked me if I would go along with him; I agreed; when I went with him he had no money, he said, about him, but he would give me that which would fetch me half a crown; I went to this woman and asked her to pawn them for me; I said the same at the magistrate's as I do now.</p>
               <p>Spencer's Defence. She came to where I lodged in the course of the day; she asked me to pledge them; I took them to Mr. Alder's, they stopped me; she said they was hers.</p>

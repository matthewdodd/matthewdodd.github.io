All the prisoners were at my house that evening; they came there about two o'clock in the afternoon; that afternoon I was cleaning out the skittle ground, and was coming in and out every moment. When I had done, I heard them talking in a low voice in the back parlour. In consequence of hearing that, I listened, and I heard Morgan, (a man who is not here,) say, we are in a bloody mess now; he was in the back parlour, sitting right facing me. He addressed himself to the whole company, as I supposed. There was a stranger in the back parlour, whom I did not know. I next observed the prisoners, all except Mayn, lay their heads together, and say, let us go and stall him off as he comes down stairs. I believe that means making a bustle about, so that a person might not be seen. With that, I ran through the back parlour, past the stair foot door, and I saw a person coming down stairs. There is a room for the accomodation of company on a Sunday and Saturday night up stairs; but it is not used for that purpose at any other times. This was a Tuesday. When I saw this man on the stairs, he had a silk handkerchief in his hand, which he threw over his shoulder behind him. I collared him immediately; I afterwards picked that silk handkerchief up. I called out to my wife to go up stairs; she at that time in my presence, pulled the key of the room we found was broken open out of her pocket. She immediately went up stairs, and when she had got to the top, she cried out we are ruined, for the door is broken open. She then came down stairs, and I went to search the man's pockets. I had continued hold of him all this time. I was going to search him on the stairs at first. The men in the parlour were in such a situation that they could hear what my wife said to me. They followed me out to the foot of the stairs; it was light enough to distinguish faces at that time. I was going to search the man, when the prisoners at the bar began to bustle about, four of them; I can't say Mayn was in that bustle. They came close to me, and pushed me about; I did not at that time distinguish Mayn. I then dragged the man into the bar, for fear they should rescue him, and pushed him into a chair. There had been two strangers in the house; the one I saw in the parlour, and the other was the one I caught on the stairs. Then Thatcher, Baxter, Jones, and Phillips came round the bar. Thatcher said, let the man go, for he is drunk; I said, I can't think of letting the man go, when I have had my place plundered; I will have justice done. With that, Thatcher said, d-n your eyes, if you are all of my mind, he shan't be taken. Thatcher then addressed himself to the other prisoners. They were all then round the bar, as close as possibly could be. After he had said that, they immediately came round to the other side, where I had taken the man, and Thatcher dragged my wife away, and I immediately closed the doors upon them. She had been by the side of me, telling me to let the man go. There are two glass windows at the top of the bar, which bolts, and the lower part locks. With that, they took the shutters which stand by the side of the door, and they battered the door all to pieces. They dragged the man by the hair of his head and the collar of his coat over the door, and opened the side door going into the passage, and carried him out of the house in triumph; three of them had hold of him; I am certain Thatcher, Phillips, and Baxter. At that time that they were endeavouring to pull him out of the bar, and I was endeavouring to hold him, I received several blows. I had a bit of the door in my right hand to defend myself, and that hand was grazed. There were several blows struck at me; but Field warded them off; Field is a man who lives at the back part of the house. I did not see him when he first came in. After they carried the man off in the manner I have described, I saw nothing more of them for about a quarter or half an hour. I sent for some officers while I had the man in the bar; but none came. About five or ten minutes after the man was carried off, officers came in, and said, they would not go, unless they had seen them in the fact. Other officers came about ten o'clock; Thatcher, Baxter, and Phillips had then returned, and called for a pot of beer; it was half or three quarters of an hour before they returned. I served them the beer, while I sent for the officers. In the mean time Baxter came round to the bar, and was drinking there, and Thatcher and Phillips staid in the tap-room. When the officers came in there were seven or eight, and an extra watchman. Baxter went off quietly; but there was an attempt to rescue Phillips and Thatcher, and the officers were obliged to use cutlasses. Phillips and Thatcher heard the charge I gave the officers. The officers asked me if they were the men that had been robbing me, and I told them they were, and to take charge of them on that account. It was after that, that the attempt to rescue was made. Thatcher and Phillips both got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290048"></xptr>out at the window; but Thatcher was taken after a long struggle. The officers then asked me to go out into the mob, and see if there were any more, and I went out, and secured Mayn.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I recollect the 23rd of April; I was up stairs in the bed room, about four o'clock in the afternoon of that day; I locked the bed room door with a padlock, and put the key in my pocket; the stair foot door which leads into the passage is locked with an inside lock, and not a padlock. I put the bedroom key in my pocket, and the other on the mantle piece of the bar. When I got down stairs, my husband had the same man in the bar who had been on the stairs. At the time the man was struggling on the stairs, the prisoners were in sight; I am quite sure some of the prisoners were present, when he threw away the handkerchief. I had a full opportunity of seeing that. They were near enough to hear me say I was ruined, I was ruined. When my husband was in the bar, I saw the men by the bar door in the passage, I took hold of my husband's arm, and begged him to let the man go, for we should all be murdered. There was then a number of others rushing in at two other doors beside. I knew them by seeing them before on other days and that day also. Thatcher then rushed into the bar, and siezed hold of me by my handkercheif, and pulled me away from my husband. There was a carving knife that laid on the table close by the bar door, he took it up, and said, she can swear to her property, let us do for her. I said for god's sake, spare my life, for the sake of my baby. Baxter then come on my right hand side, and got his hand into my pocket. I struggled very much with them, and they cried pinion her hands;

            . I live in Bridgewater court. The prosecutor's backside of his house is within four steps of my door. I recollect the 23rd of April last, I was standing at my own door, between seven and eight o'clock, and I heard a great noise in the Bridgewater Arms. I went into the house, I saw Mr. Hales in the bar with a man, as he said, was a prisoner, whom he had found robbing his house. He had hold of that man, he said that aloud. There were a great many person, standing round at that time, and four or five came into the bar, and said, let the prisoner go. I was in the bar at that time. He said, he would do no such thing, as he had been robbing him. The people said, come, go it my boys, we shall have him. They opened the door then, and went round to another door that went into the parlour, and laid hold of two shutters, and broke the upper part of the bar door open; I was outside the bar when they did this. Mr. Hales and the man were in the bar at this time. As soon as they had done this, Mr. Hale cried out and said, neighbours, is there any one that will come forward and save my life, and assist me. I stepped over his counter then, and laid hold of a large pair of tongs, which were by his fireside, and went to the door to defend him, and prevent the people coming in. At the same time, the people behind threw a pint pot, and a half pint pot, and hit me at the back of the head. I turned back to know who threw them at me, and while I turned about, the man got from Mr. Hales, and got half way in the door that was broken, and the people who had broken the door had him by the head, and breast, and collar to pull him out; the people without, were pulling him over so as to get him quite clear. I stopped for about half a minute more; I don't know whether that man whom they got over the bar door was taken out or went out.</p>

            . I am a ward officer of Cripplegate Ward. I recollect on the evening of the 23rd of April last, being sent for to the Bridgewater Arms, about ten o'clock; when I came there, I went in along with some of my brother officers, and I saw Thatcher, Baxter, Jones, and Mayn; I saw Mr. Hales; he said to me, that is one, pointing to Thatcher; he likewise told me, Baxter was another. I went to take hold of Thatcher, and he was rescued from me by Jones, and a chimney sweeper, and others. I went to catch hold of him a second time, and he was torn from my hands again, and he got out of the window. A minute or two afterwards, I heard a cry help, out side, and I went out, and saw Everett struggling with Thatcher. I immediately secured Thatcher, and he went quietly along. I had to take them in charge. We did not know of the robbery at first. I never knew them before, nor did I know whether they knew me. I had my cutlass with me, and was obliged to use it, I considered it necessary.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was there on the night of the 23rd, with Vint. I saw Baxter in the bar when first I went in, and Mr. Hale gave charge of him for a robbery. I left him there with Cousins and Moore. I and Vint went into the taproom with Mr. Hale, and he pointed out Thatcher and Phillips as two of them. I said, you must go with us. Thatcher said, what for, and I told them for a robbery. Harry Phillips then said he should not go, and Thatcher said, he should not go. They then began to fight with us, and we drew our swords. Then the women and people in the place closed our arms, and they got out at the window. I have every reason to believe that the woman closed our arms on purpose for them to escape.</p>

            . I am a ward officer of Cripple-gate. When I got to the Bridgewater Arms on this occasion. I saw Baxter and Jones was apprehended afterwards; Baxter was in the bar, and was very much elevated in liquor. The landlord gave me the eye to him that he was one of them. The landlord at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290049"></xptr>that time, made a charge of robbery; I am positive it was robbery. Further assistance was sent for, as Everett thought it necessary. When we persevered on apprehending three of them, only three were taken at that time. I saw Mrs. Hales in a little trouble; she did not make any charge at that time, she was very much flurried and in a great deal of agitation.</p>

            . I am another officer of Cripple-gate ward. I went into the Bridgewater Arms, and saw Baxter, Thatcher and Phillips; Phillips got through the window, and I took Thatcher coming through it; Phillips got of entirely for that evening. Hales gave me an intimation that Baxter was one; he told me for what to take them into custody for breaking his up stairs room door. We met with a great deal of opposition in apprehending these men. I saw Mrs. Hales, she was very much frightened, and very much alarmed, but by no means in liquor.</p>

            . I live at 34, Bridgewater Gardens. My husband is the proprietor of those gardens. I was going through the court on the evening in question, about eight o'clock. During the time I was there, I heard Mrs. Hales cry out they are robbing the house; she was in the passage; I was in the court adjoining the house; I was looking through a window; I had been there about ten minutes. I saw ten or twelve men rush out of the parlour towards the bottom of the stair case, towards the bar; they rushed from the parlour. Mr. Hales had got a man by the collar, and pushed him into the bar, and Mrs. Hales had a handkerchief in her hand, which she said, she had picked up off the stairs. Mr. Hales called out for somebody to fetch Mr. Stevens; Mrs. Hales begged me to fetch him, and I directly went for him, and returned with him; I was gone about two minutes, not more. When I returned, Mr. Stevens went into the bar, and a person said, they have opened the back door, and I went round directly and went in, and saw Mrs. Hales in the passage. I shut the door directly, and put my back against it, and said, no one shall go out this way. Mrs. Hales then went into the parlour. There is a passage between the bar and the parlour. She was in a very violent passion, and raved very much; when I went into her, she was laying on the bench, and kicking; I thought she would go into fits. There was one woman in the room. From the time she went into the room until I went away, there was not one man in the room. There was no men knocking her down, or putting a knife to her throat, or putting their hands into her pocket; if that had been so. I think I must have seen it. I assisted to recover her. She told me she was in the family way, and I was much afraid of her. I stopped with her until five or six men tried to force the bar door open, and finding they could not, they broke it open with the shutters. As they were forcing the door, one of them said, tip it him, and I was alarmed for my husband, who was in the bar. I directly opened the side door to get out. In the situation in which I was, I could not look into the bar. As I got to the front door, they were bringing the man out, two of them. I left her in the chair, and heard her cry out oh, three times. I don't know who the woman was that was in the room with Mrs. Hales. After the man was taken away, Mr. Hales went for officers. Field shewed me a half pint pot, which he said, they had thrown at him; I took it out of his hand, and told him it was not meant for him, and therefore not to make such a noise about it. During the whole time, there was no man in the back parlour put a knife to Mrs. Hales' throat, or rided her pockets. On my being served with a subpoena, I went to Mrs. Hales, and told her I had been so served. I told her as my husband was out of Town, to ask her solicitor, Mr. Burgess, whether I was bound to attend; she said, that my own sense ought to have told me better, for I had no business to accept the subpoena. I am positive that I never told her that my evidence would hang the men, or any thing to that effect.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker. I went to the Bridgewater Arms just as the man was dragged into the bar; I was standing in front of the bar. I saw the man rescued, and taken away. I heard Mrs. Hales scream, and they said, she was fainting; and Mr. Hales called for a person of the name of Stevens, and when he came, he said it was a very troublesome piece of business, and I said, it is; he said, I will have nothing to do with it, for it is a troublesome job. Mr. Stevens went out, and fetched one Mr. Wood, and he would have nothing to do with it. Mr. Hales had hold of a man in the cradle; and a man named Stevenson asked for some brandy for Mrs. Hales, and the servant girl gave a glass of rum; I don't know where Mrs. Hales was then; but I believe she was in the parlour. Some man said, it is a shame for a man to be dragged to prison who has been drinking in the house all day, and a voice said, he sha'nt if they are all of a mind like me; and the top door was shoved open, and I dare say there were twenty men pulling at this man, who had got out of the cradle. Before the man had been rescued, Mrs. Hales came into the bar. I asked her what she had lost; and she said, a row of beads and ear-rings, and she set such store by them, that she had been offered three pounds for them, and would not take it. They knew me very well, because they have a public-house in Petticoat-lane. She said, it is very fortunate that the man did not get to my middle drawer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290050"></xptr>where all my property layed. She said to me, it is immaterial, for she knew two of the men, and they should suffer if ever two men suffered on the new drop, should it cost every bit of property she had left; those were

            . I was helping Mr. Hales to clean the skittle-ground. I recollect the circumstances of this disturbance. I saw Mr. Hales draw a man down stairs, and charge him with robbing him. I could command a view of the stairs at that time. I was going in with the skittles; I saw a great many persons round the bar, and they shoved the top of the bar door in, and pulled the man out. I can't tell whether that was done by one or more. I was in view of the bar all the time. Mrs. Hales fainted away, and I took her into the parlour. She fainted away against the bar, and I took her from there to the parlour; she was then in an insensible state for some time. I saw no violence used to her during the whole time. She did not faint in the parlour; she fainted between the bar door and the parlour, and the people were conveying her in. leading her in. I fetched the glass of rum; I asked the maid for a glass of brandy, and she said, she had none. When I took her the rum, she drank it off in a minute, and seemed better. She never mentioned a word about her having her pockets picked. She never said, a word about a knife being held to her throat.</p>

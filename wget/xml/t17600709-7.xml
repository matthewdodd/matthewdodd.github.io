On the Saturday before the 2d of June, when I came down in the morning, some things were missing in the shop; I concluded they must be taken by somebody in the shop; the prisoner had been backwards and forwards with me for 16 years; I always before look'd upon him to be a very honest man: my son said he suspected him; I said, then we will soon catch him; we put 19 pair of silk stockings upon a shelf, and when the prisoner came to work, my son gave them to the prisoner to finish them. When night came, the prisoner took his hat, and was going away, I told the stockings, and miss'd a pair; my son call'd him back, and told him there was a pair missing; I bid him pull off his coat, he did, and in the lining of it I found one of the stockings put in at a hole at the back of the coat. Then he said he had lost the fellow to it, and he had put it there fearing I should be angry. Then in searching farther, one

               <p>I do not deny but I had one of the stockings, but I know nothing of the other; I should have cut off the tops of them, and brought them again, if I had found them in my pocket. I have been 21 years in the King's service, and have people here to my character.</p>

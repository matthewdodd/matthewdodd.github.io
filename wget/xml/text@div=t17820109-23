               <p>I have been employed for the Mint thirteen years; there was information given to me by Mr. Campbell, on Saturday the 15th, I appointed to come on Monday, at five o'clock; I went, and was put into a warehouse, which came to the back of the house where these people lived, and about half past five they came up to tea; just before they came, I heard a thump, the warehouse was as near as I am to you; after they had drank tea, they went down again; after they had been down about five minutes, the thump went as it had done before, it was the fly for the cutting-out press, it goes with a force, so as to force out a thick piece of copper, therefore it makes a noise; I appointed to come again on Wednesday with some officers, to see what they were; I went then, and knocked at the door, a servant opened it, on the door-plate was the name of Smith; I asked if Mr. Smith was at home, the girl said no; I immediately pushed the girl on one side, and went to the cellar, I went to go into it, but they had put out the candle, and I kept every body down till I got a light. In the first cellar I saw Corn and Morgan, in the cellar where the big press was, where they had been coining halfpence, and Mr. Clark I likewise found there, it was the stamping press; Corn and Morgan were standing by the press, it is a narrow cellar, that the fly had only just room to go round, they were in a working dress, their coats off, and shirt sleeves tucked up; I put them in custody; I went into the furthermost cellar, where I brought out Acton, he was in a working dress, the same as the rest, his wig and all his cloaths were in the kitchen; he was near the cutting-out press, where somebody had been at work, I am sure of that, for the chair was warm, where somebody had been sitting at the press; I did not observe whether he was warm or not, only found him in a working situation, I put him in custody; I put all the prisoners in one cellar, and then went and fetched Mr. Campbell; in the first cellar I saw a cutting-out press, and a large press, and a quantity of half-pence; in the further cellar, another press,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090043"></xptr> blank coppers; cecil, and one halfpenny in the die, which was cut out, and given to Mr. Campbell; the dies were fixed in the press, Mr. Campbell saw the prisoners there. I kept every thing very quiet, and the people down in the cellar; knowing the master of the house was not at home, I set a person at the door to stop whoever came, I heard a bell ring, I applied to the door, and the master,

            , came in; I took him into custody, and searched him before Mr. Campbell, I found this die upon him; (produces a die) it appeared to be a new one, or it had been cleaned up, it is not much wore, he had it in his side pocket, it is a die of

             the Second, and the impression is faint, I found the reverse die to it in the house, in the parlour drawer, I think Mr. Campbell took it out himself; they were all committed that night, and the wife, being found in the cellar; when before the magistrate, Clark owned all the things, that his wife might be discharged.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ask him any particulars, when he came into the door? - He was asked who he was, and he said he came to ask for Mr. Johnson; I never ask a man to say one single word, for fear he might say any thing that might injure himself, I let it alone till he comes before the magistrate; Mr. Prothero has had the custody of all the things, I have some halfpence that have been finished, I found them there. (Produces the finished halfpence.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did the things you found there contain a compleat apparatus for coining halfpence? - As exact as can be.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You said you first went into a warehouse, how was that situated, was it near any place? - There is a small yard at Mr. Clarke's house; the kitchen is above stairs, it was about half past five, it is not a very light place, but there was a light in the room; but you will have that from Mr. Campbell. I saw Clarke write in a book, and put the book in this place again.</p>
               <p>I understand you then, that you saw these four people in the kitchen; and they left the kitchen for some time, and you suppose that they went down stairs, and came up stairs again? - I said, they came up stairs to drink tea, and went down stairs again.</p>
               <p>You went a little further than that at first, now you only mean to say, that you do not know where they went; you said you went below stairs? - I said, I believed I did.</p>
               <p>Will you undertake to say, the noise could come from no other quarter but that? - I would not swear from whence the noise came; we were not very silent when we went into the house; the girl made a noise when I pushed her on one side, which I wish I could have prevented; I should have gone down, and they would not have heard me; there is just room in the place for the fly to turn; I did-not see them at work, they stood close to the press.</p>
               <p>Could they stand otherwise, on account of the smallness of the cellar? - I do not think they could; we looked for other tools but could not find any thing else, we passed directly to the other cellar, I did not see them then as I did afterwards; after they came up into the kitchen, there hung up all their coats, and Acton's wig hung up on the mantle-piece; their coats and their great-coats; the front cellar I look upon to be a very large one, where the other cutting out press was; it was a long cellar, and they stood at the further corner of it.</p>
               <p>You did not see Acton do any thing? - I only found him in the room.</p>
               <p>So as to the people in the first cellar, and the people in the second cellar, you did not find them doing any thing; you only found them standing there, and doing nothing? - That is all, sir; then Abraham Clarke came in, and said, all these things were his.</p>
               <p>It has been said, you have been employed thirteen years by the mint; I wish the jury to understand, who you are; are you not one of the officers at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect some share of the reward? - As much as you do with your brief, sir, for the conviction; this is an imputation thrown on me, which I do not deserve, I will appeal to the Court, and Recorder, who knows me; I am perhaps worth as much money as you are.</p>
               <p>Court. Whatever the operation of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090044"></xptr> question may be, is for the judgment of the jury; the question is certainly a proper one; whether there is a reward, and do you expect a part of it; your being entitled to it, is no sort of imputation upon your conduct; it is a proper question; the jury have a right to know the circumstance in which a witness stands.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that halfpenny you took out of the die, warm? - The rest were then warm; I do not know for that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you say, that you took the halfpenny from the die yourself; and yet you say now, you do not know, whether it was warm? - I let that halfpenny stay in the die, till I went and fetched Mr. Campbell; here is a quantity of other dies that were found there, a dozen, or more.</p>
               <p>PROTHERO sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with Mr. Clark at this place, on the 19th of December; I was going down stairs after Clark, he said, here they are; I retreated for a candle into the kitchen, seeing no light there, and in my hurry, I ran my candle too far into the fire; Corn, and Morgan, with Mrs. Clark, were standing behind the press; Corn immediately asked me how I did; I told him I was very well, and laughed at him; we tied them together directly, Morgan and Corn; the witness Clark, went into the further cellar, and brought Acton o ut; he had on a very dirty shirt, and no wig nor hat on; Corn had his waistcoat on, but Morgan had not; I am sure both had their coats off, their shirt-sleeves were tucked up, and both very dirty and greasy; Morgan, and Acton, had no waistcoats on I am sure; Corn, I think had, to the best of my recollection; the snuff of the candle was burning by the press, it was knocked down, I told the prisoners of it; then I tied Acton, the other prisoner, by himself; and they were all four kept there, till Mr. Campbell was fetched, and nothing touched further, till he came; there was a vast quantity of blanks, cecil copper at first, this is the proper sheet of copper (produces a sheet of copper in two pieces, with the blanks cut out of the middle) only the blanks are taken out of the middle of it, what remains of the copper, is called the cecil; the cecil is laid on the side of the press, and that half sheet was in the press; here are a great quantity of halfpence, finished, that were found there, by the great press; after they strike the impression, they drop; they are all finished, all to colouring, they have a way of colouring them afterwards; I did not touch any of the halfpence for some time afterwards; Clark brought Acton out of the other cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Whether if people cut copper to make buttons, or any thing else, they do not cut it in the same way? - I should imagine so, I am no judge of it, I never saw any buttons made.</p>
               <p>Is not the same instrument made use of, either for buttons or for halfpence? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>The same question to Clarke? - There is not the least doubt of it, though not of the same stuff, it is a mixt metal; they would out out with the same press, but not with the same tools.</p>
               <p>To Prothero. You are an officer of justice belonging to Bow-street? - Yes, Sir, I am; I am not ashamed of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of December, Mr. Roe, a neighbour of mine, suspected that coiners lived at No. 24, in Little St. Thomas Apostle's, and not chusing to trust our own constables, as it was a house of credit in the front, I applied to Bow-street; I saw Mr. Clarke, and mentioned the circumstance of the noise, and the condition the men were often seen in, to him, and he said he had little doubt but they were coiners; on the Monday he met me at Roe's, I took him into Roe's warehouse, to see the men, and opened the shutter a very little, of one of the windows, which looked directly into their kitchen; there were tea-things, and bread and butter; we heard the thumping very fast, and after waiting about half an hour, there came three men into the kitchen, two of them had their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090045"></xptr> coats off, and might have their waistcoats off; one of them (Morgan) had his coat on, they all looked very warm, I have very little doubt that these are all the men; I would not chuse to swear positively to them, I believe these to be the men, and Morgan the man that had his coat on, Corn, Morgan and Acton, after tea they went down stairs, and the thumping began; we had no light in the warehouse, because they should not observe us, as there never were any candles at night there, and they had candles and the light of the fire, that we could distinguish them, I was very near them, it was a very small yard, and the warehouse window looked down into the kitchen; then we went into Mr. Roe's cellar, thinking we might hear the knockings more distinct there, we heard it much in the same manner, in a line from us, I have no doubt where the noise came from, for there is no man in Mr. Robinson's warehouse, and the other side a widow lives, I have very little doubt but the noise came from there. Mr. Roe and I did not chuse to appear as the informers at that time, it was said they were people come out of the country; Mr. Clark appointed to meet us on Wednesday, at twelve o'clock; he came with his men, before he went in he said, if they are coiners, I will send a man with a red face; he came himself in a few minutes, and beckoned; I went into the cellar, there the three men were tied together, with their coats off, and all very dirty, they all appeared as if at very hard work; I looked into the small cellar, there was a cutting-out press, Clark turned the fly round, and took a halfpenny out; he wished me to put a mark on it, and to swear to it; I bid him put a mark on it, and I would keep it; he put a mark on it, what it is I do not know, here is the halfpenny; (produces a halfpenny) round the die there appeared to be a great quantity of halfpence, that appeared as if just put into the press, and fresh cut off; they lay round it in the inner cellar, where the cutting-out press was, it was a very small place, something of a wine vault at the end of it, there was a table, with a hole through it, and a cutting-out press on it, and a box with blanks; in the front cellar there was another cutting-out press, there was no halfpence in that, but there was a table standing by it with halfpence, told out in sixpenny-worths; they appeared to be coloured like halfpence, they were all told out, but not tied up; the men began pulling the presses to pieces, Clark told them to make little noise; we went up stairs to see if we could find any thing; in one of the drawers I found some of the dies, that was all; we went to the closet in the kitchen where we had seen the prisoner Clark go, we found nothing there; somebody ringing at the door, the prisoner Clark came in, and the door was shut, and Mr. Clark went up to him, and told him to walk into the kitchen, that he might search him; he came in very readily; Mr. Clark pulled a die out of his pocket, he asked him how he came by it, he said he picked it up that morning in the street, Mr. Clark said it is unfortunate that the paper should be so dry and clean, it was a very rainy morning; he was very anxious to know where his wife was, he was very anxious for her safety; he said every thing belonging to the house was his, one of them wished to change his shirt, their shirts were very dirty and black; they put on their cloaths, and went to Guildhall.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you feel any of the halfpence that you saw round the die? - No; not till I had been there a great while; there was all the appearance as if the men had been at work, I have not a doubt in my own mind but they were all fresh done.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You did not see them till they were in the hands of the officers? - No, Sir; not till they were all tied together.</p>
               <p>You say you never saw these men before Monday night? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of all their persons before? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You said you still had some doubt? - I would not chuse to swear positively that they are the men; I have not a doubt in my own breast that they were the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090046"></xptr>Mr. FLETCHER, one of the Moniers, sworn.</p>
               <p>Proved the halfpence to be all counterfeits.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CLARK's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I wish to ask Clark and Prothero whether they did not take some carpenters tools out of my house?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not see any thing.</p>
               <p>Prothero. No; I am sure there was none in the house, but an old rusty saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clark. I am an unfortunate man; the things were all my own; these three men are innocent, which I hope they will be able to prove; this man (Acton) keeps a sale shop, an infirm man, not capable nor likely to work; this carpenter I had to work, I was apprehensive that I should be over-heard, the over night I called to Morgan to desire him to come and help me to take down my tools, he took me for a button maker. Acton has two children at nurse at Islington. Corn has made me many things, this man has done me many jobs; they came with no other intention, my lord, but to take down the tools; and with respect to the witness, Mr. Clark, observing that the halfpenny was hot, it is impossible, were I to call on the solicitor of the mint, he knows it is impossible for a halfpenny to retain heat a minute, or a moment; and after the candle was out, there was some time before that candle could be lighted again; as for the halfpenny between the die, it is what I generally leave, nobody ever worked at it but myself and my wife; a touch will cool it.</p>
               <p>Court to Fletcher. Will a halfpenny retain heat for some time? - I know the pressure is so great, that the heat remains some time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clark. But observe the difference between the halfpence here, and the half-pence at the mint.</p>
               <p>Fletcher. Oh, I know there is a great difference in the weight, as 70 is to 48.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clark. I have no witnesses, I thought it needless; I have been an unfortunate man, and a large family, and have had great losses in business.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner MORGAN.</p>

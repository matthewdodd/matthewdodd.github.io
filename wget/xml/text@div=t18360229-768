                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Joseph Gramshaw. The pri<lb></lb>soner was my servant—I lost this property—I have only found some of the ribbon—the prisoner was about four months in our service—she had lost her character, and I took her out of charity—she went from me to Mr. West's, in Banner-street, a hardwareman—I missed two nightcaps and some cotton the first week she came—she said she had not seen the caps, but she might have misplaced the cotton—I missed some galloon, five yards of gauze ribbon, some bobbin, and mitts, and half a dozen caps—we went to Mr. West's and found them in her basket—she had lived there ten days—I had no quarrel with her—she had a sister who had come from Ireland—she sent for her unknown to me—I got a friend, a captain, to take her home, and I took her as my servant till she went home—I gave the prisoner an excellent character to West—the sister lived with me about a fortnight, and was very impertinent indeed—she did not sleep at my house—I went to her lodging, and found several trinkets, and then the prisoner was taken, and these things found on her.</p>

I am servant to Mr. West, a hardwareman, in Banner-street, I went into his service three weeks next Monday—I gave some things to the policeman, which I got out of my bed-room—the room was not used by any body but myself—the prisoner used it before I came—I never saw her there—she had left when I came—I merely found the things and gave them to Reed.</p>

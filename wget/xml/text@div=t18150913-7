After that, she asked me if I had ever tasted turtle soup; I answered, no. She promissed she would bring me some. I knew her by her frequently coming to purchase articles in my father's shop, and always understood she was Lady Say or Seles servant. She left the print she had bought on the counter, without paying for it, and went as I thought for the soap. I never missed any thing until the next day, when my father missed a piece of cotton print, and spoke to me about it. I had not particularly noticed that piece to have been in the place where she stooped down.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's lodgings, at No. 14, Shuldam-street. Mr. Walker had got some information that she was there, and having procured a search warrant delivered it to me to execute. When I went to her lodgings, she was at home. I found these two pieces, (producing two pieces of cotton,) in the room in which she was sitting. Mr. Walker had gone in first and said something to her. I asked her if she had any more: the woman of the house said, that she had got six yards of her, and was to give her eighteen pence a yard for it, to make a gown. I took this piece (producing another piece.) out of the woman of the house's premises. Then the prisoner said, that her landlady did not buy it of her, but took it in lieu of rent. Mr. Walker asked the prisoner what she had done with the remainder; and she said she had sent it into the country. I then took her to the office.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, residing in Blanford-street. A piece of cotton was missing from my shop on the morning of Thursday, the 22nd of June, it contained twenty-eight yards, and stood with others against an iron pillar in the centre of the shop. I was not at home on the day previous, when the prisoner came to my shop; we had in general understood that she was a servant of Lady Say and Sele, but on enquiry, we found she was not. Subsequently I was informed by my boy, that he saw her taking in milk at 14, Shuldam-street. I accordingly got a warrant and went there with an officer; I found her sitting in the window at work, with a piece of cotton in her own hands, but not the whole piece. I asked her how she came by it; and her reply was, that she bought it. She then said, she had bought a piece of print at my house, and was coming for it. I said to her, Melina, you did not bring the turtle soup to my daughter; and I then put my head out of the window, and beckoned to the constable. She then gave us part of the print, and the constable asked her if there was any more, and we got some from the woman of the house, to whom she said, she had given it in the place of rent. We got all three pieces, and they are all parts of one piece, which was the one I lost. These pieces has my shop mark upon it, and I saw it in the shop the day before I missed it.</p>

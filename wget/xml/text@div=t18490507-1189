                  </hi>. I live at 49, Lower Marsh, Lambeth, and am a grocer and cheesemonger. On 25th April, between eleven and twelve in the morn<lb></lb>ing, the prisoner, who I had never seen before, came to my shop and told me he had brought me an order to supply the regiment with coffee, tea, sugar, pepper, mustard, and salt—he was dressed as a soldier, and had his band on—he ordered a quantity of goods—I wrote them down, and he signed his name to them—I asked him who I was to look to for the payment, and he said, "Sergeant M'Intosh, of the left flank Fusileer Guards, will pay you as soon at the goods are weighed and found correct"—as he was going out he returned and gave me a further order for the non-com missioned officers—I asked him to have a glass of ale, and while going to the the public-house for it he said, "You have to thank me for getting this order for you; what are you going to stand for myself?—you will bear in mind it is an order to be sent every day"—I gave him half-a-crown—he then left, was away about three-quarters of an hour, then came running in and said, "I have made a mistake in giving you the first order; I have now got Sergeant M'Intosh's order, and here is his name"—I took the things down on some paper, after<lb></lb>wards asked him for the order, and he left it with me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"26th Feb., 1848,—Sir, you will serve the battalion with grocery—Sergeant M'Intosh")—it also enumerates the articles ordered—he told me he had given the half-crown to the cooks, and asked for another for himself—I was to meet him at the Park-gate at four o'clock, and I said when I got the money from Sergeant M'Intosh I would give him something else—while I was speaking to him a neighbouring grocer sent his man to speak to me—the prisoner saw him coming and ran away as hard as be could—the goods were</p>

               <p>to be delivered at the Wellington Barracks, in St. James's-park—I found that none of the regiment were stopping there—the prisoner was to meet my boy at four at the gate, and I said I should come round with him—I was almost afraid it was a <hi rend="italic">do</hi>—I went to the gate, met one of the Coldstream Guards, and he told me there was none of the regiment there—I saw the prisoner between seven and eight in the evening near the Victoria Theatre, and gave him in charge—at the station he said he was not the man, and had never seen me before—I am quite positive he is the man—I did not part with any of my goods.</p>

                  </hi> I am pay-sergeant of the left flank Company of the first battalion of Fusileers, which is stationed at St. John's Wood barracks—the prisoner was a private in that company—I knew a sergeant of the name of James M'Intosh—he died on 4th last March—there is no other sergeant of that name in the battalion—orders for goods for our company are given through me or the commanding-officer—I order a man to purchase them, and give him the money—he pays ready money for them—no one but those J authorize have authority to purchase goods—this order is not Sergeant M'Intosh'8 writing—I have seen the prisoner write—I believe this signature, "James Mills," is his.</p>

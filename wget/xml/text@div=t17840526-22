               <p>The prisoner was found in the house of Mr. Curling, on the 19th of March, between the hours of seven and eight, I only saw him after he was taken; Mr. Curling had just purchased the house and paid for it that morning, and he desired me to take care of the things for him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any of the family sleep there? - I put a man in.</p>
               <p>Had any of this family occupied it? - No, there was some furniture in it, not much.</p>
               <p>How long before had it been bought by Mr. Curling? - He bought it by auction, and paid for it that morning; there was some furniture of mine in it, I paid a man one shilling a night to sleep in it; I saw the prisoner in the passage just within the door, and two more with him, and three or four of my men with them.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said they took hold of him as he came behind the door; I saw one of the others run.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was this - This was the 19th of March.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for the prisoner. In what way are you connected with Mr. Curling? - I had the sale of the house and the furniture</p>
               <p>You however continued in possession? - Yes, by the desire of Mr. Curling.</p>
               <p>At the time you came to the door, I take it for granted there were many people assembled? - There were seven or eight.</p>
               <p>So that in that confusion you might very well mistake this man for somebody that came out of the house? - I might.</p>

               <p>Upon the 19th day of March last, about eight in the evening, I was at the next door when this accident happened; one of the witnesses gave me the key of Mr. Curling's house, to go and unlock the door whilst he went to get the candle, I unlocked the door and it unlocked very easy, but there was a catch or bolt withinside that stopped the door from opening, I locked it again; with that I spoke to Maggot, says I, there is somebody in the house, he came out with the candle, I unlocked the door again, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260049"></xptr> unlocked very easy, and I pushed it and it flew open to its proper bearings, and there was something stiffish from the door flying open; when I opened it I saw the prisoner at the bar and another man come up to me, I caught hold of him, and cried out thieves! or robbers! or something of that kind, they were in the passage, the man on my right-hand got away, this prisoner I held in my left-hand, and he threw me out of the passage upon the pavement; we took him again and we searched him, and in his pocket we found the handle of a turn-screw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman says there was three men came out of the house, and this gentleman says there was only two.</p>
               <p>Court. I observed that.</p>
               <p>Did you see any more than two? - Yes, afterwards I saw another come out, but they both ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How happened it that you did not tell us about this third man? - Sir, I never was asked.</p>
               <p>Never was asked! why you was told to tell your story, did not you know you was sworn to tell the truth; I take it for granted the man could not break open the door with the handle of a turn-screw? - No.</p>
               <p>You found nothing else upon him? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Now do you think you could not mistake this man, who was passing by, for one of those that were in the house? - No, he never got out of my hands till the door was fastened upon him, and then we searched him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sammes sent for me to be at his house at night, I went and staid a little, and I went to the house and saw the prisoner come out of the house, myself and Mr. Field took him, it was half past seven, or rather better; I went with Mr. Field and some others, and when I had done my business at next door, he desired me to look into the house, and pull down the windows if any were open, that was my business there; I gave Field the key to open the door, he could not open it, whether it was bolted the inside, or the latch stuck within-side I cannot tell; however they forced it open, and three men came out, and the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you imagine that there might be windows open in the house? - I went with a view to pull down the windows if there were any open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many windows were open? - I had not opportunity to see.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath do not you know that some were open?</p>
               <p>Court. We certainly shall not presume that they were shut.</p>

               <p>I was ordered to Mr. Sammes's, I was there about seven o'clock, and his apprentice gave the key to one of the witnesses, to see if there was any windows open, and we went to see; we saw but one half shutter up stairs open, says I there is not much here open, says he we will go and shut it; we tried to open the door and could not, the next time he shoved hard, the door flew open, and the first man that came out of the house kicked me, and got away.</p>
               <p>Had you been in the house that day before? - No, then I called for assistance; here is a dark lanthorn that was found under the bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How do you know? - Another man found it.</p>

               <p>I am porter to Lord Mansfield; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260050"></xptr> sitting in my Lord's hall, at the second outcry I heard stop thief, and murder! I went soon after, and took my candle in my hand, and went next door, and there I saw one of the porters here had got hold of the prisoner at the bar by the collar, standing at the door; one of the people said he had flung something away, and this little instrument was found, I looked in the highway, and picked up these keys.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You found them in the highway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Sammes. What time had you been in the house? - Not after twelve or one, I took three or four people with me, and went round the house, and found every window shut but one garret window, which was open.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, there is no occasion to put this man on his defence, because there is nothing stolen; I will explain the law to you in this case: the offence of burglary is that of breaking and entering a dwelling house in the night, after day-light is gone in the evening, and before the return of it in the morning, and that breaking and entering is a capital offence, even though nothing should be actually stolen, provided it is done with intent to steal, or commit any other felony; but where nothing is stolen then the fact of breaking and entering, and the doing it in the night is the whole fact upon which the offence is to arise, and if you are satisfied of that fact, then you are to consider whether it was done with a felonious intent; now, in this case, there is no evidence before you that a felony was actually committed, because, in order to constitute this offence, there must be a breaking and entering, and that must be in the night; and in order to prove a breaking and entering, you must have actual proof of some part of the house being broke and forced open, of which there is no proof in this case; or at least you must have proof that the whole of the house, all the doors and windows were so shut and fastened, that no person could by any possibility get into that house without breaking it, in this case there is no such evidence, for there is no evidence at all that the windows were shut, on the contrary, one of the windows is found open, the sash open, and it is plain that the witness went with an expectation that some of the windows would be open, and went to shut them; there is therefore no evidence to the breaking, and nobody having been in the house since twelve at noon, there is no evidence how this man got into the house after day-light was gone, especially as on the 19th of March it is day-light till near seven, and these men were found in the house at half past seven; therefore, though there is every reason to suspect that this man intended to commit a burglary, there is no evidence in this case.</p>

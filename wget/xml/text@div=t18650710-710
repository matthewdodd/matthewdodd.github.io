                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 220). On 17th June, at 1 o'clook in the morning, I was in Hall-street, Deptford, and found three men, of whom the prisoner was one, and five or six prostitutes quarrelling—I requested them to move away, and called another constable, Allcock—the prostitutes went indoors, but the prisoner said, "I am not going to be done in that way"—I said, "What way?"—he said, "I am not going to be done out of my girl like that"—I said, "They have gone in doors, now you go home"—he made use of very bad language, and went away into High-street—after he had gone a short distance, he came back, and said that he would have our b----y lives before he went to bed that night—he commenced feeling in his pockets, as though for a knife, and before I could get my staff out he ran at me, knocked me against the wall, knocked my hat off, and I felt a very heavy blow on my head—blood came pouring all over me—I said to Allcock, "Look out for the knife, he has let me have it'—I saw something shine in the prisoner's hand, and then saw blood streaming down Allcock's face—we both seized the prisoner, he put his hand in his pocket, and kept it there till we got to Deptford Broadway, where we met Greenay, who took the prisoner's hand out of his pocket, and found the knife in his hand, partly open, with the handle up his sleeve—I had two slight cuts on the head, and the doctor ordered me home, but I took my duty again that night—the prisoner had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>

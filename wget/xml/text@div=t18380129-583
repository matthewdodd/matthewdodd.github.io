                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside in Brunswick-street, New-road. I am acquainted with Fanny Wellard—I also know William Sym, a prisoner in the House of Correction—they were on intimate terms—Mrs. Wellard resided at Manchester—in November last the prisoner called on me several times—he brought a letter to me to be given to Miss Wel<lb></lb>lard—I forwarded it to her—this is the one I forwarded to her—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am certain he is the person—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>.) "Coldbath-fields, Sunday, Nov. 12, 1837.</p>
               <p>"My dear Fanny,—You will be a little surprised at receiving a note from me, as it is quite against the rules of the prison; but even here I have found two good friends who have kindly undertaken to allow me the privilege which I eagerly embrace; my turnkey, in his great kindness to write for me, and a friend of his, one of the engineers, to convey this to you, and will also return me an answer. Now, my dear girl, my writing to you must be kept a profound secret, as should it be known I have writ<lb></lb>ten, or got to write, I should not only lose my situation and be punished and sent to hard labour, but both the turnkey and engineer would in all probability lose their situations; therefore, for God's sake, be very circum<lb></lb>spect, and do not allude to my having written in any letters you may send to me through the gate, as they are all first read by the Governor before I get them, do therefore, for my sake, keep it to yourself as much as possible; and any thing you wish to say to me privately, transmit it to me in writing, through Mr. Greenway, the engineer, who will send one of his men to call upon you once or twice a week. The bearer is a distant rela<lb></lb>tion of his, and one he says he can put every confidence in, though he will not know where this is from, and you need not say. I shall not, ac<lb></lb>cording to the rules of the prison, be able to write to you myself until the expiration of six months, and then, they say, nothing but the Governor will see; and if you should get another order to see me, the time is so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290099"></xptr>
               <p>short, and we are so overlooked, there is no speaking what I could wish. I was very glad to see you the other day, but it made me very dull after<lb></lb>wards. Do not say any thing about Mr. Willmott's business, except in the letters sent through my friend, and in them you may say any thing, as I shall receive them perfectly safe. This is a privilege I do not suppose there is a prisoner in the house has but myself, which I may thank my two friends for, who have got me placed in the situation I am, which entirely exempts me from work, as I have nothing to do but to look after the men, and to see that they do their work, and attend on the turnkey, keep an account of the men on slates, and to look after the yard when I am stationed. Oh, my dear Fanny, what a happy release it was for me or when relieved from work on the tread-wheel? I think it would have killed me. I may, through proper conduct, keep my place the remainder of my imprisonment; therefore be most careful in any letters you may send in to me through any other way than by my friends, or whatever way, or when you call, if you should be able to get another order before you go into the country. Now, my dear, I will acquaint you with my wants; and I feel confident you will, as far as possible, send me what yon can If you will get me two Guernsey frocks, such as fishermen wear, let them be a large size, long in the arms and body, as we never see a fire all winter, and my place exposes me very much to the frost and cold; also a pair of warm gloves—worsted. I received the pair you sent, but as they are leather, they are so cold; get any you think the warmest, and a comforter for my throat. You can, at the same time, send me the flannels you bought for me the other day; and I should like a change of apparel—a coat, one or two waistcoats, a pair of trowsers, a pair or two of stockings; and if I had my great coat, I could wear it in the mornings, before the Governor goes round, and in the evenings, after he has been. Do not think me too troublesome, as my situation is uncomfortable. I know you feel pleasure in making it as comfortable as you possibly can; and my friend will get these things conveyed to me unknown to the Governor, as any thing of the sort is not allowed. If you can, also send a shirt or two, and a pair of shoes, strong and warm, for the stones are very damp; and I have all the winter to get over. Call at (my dear girl) Mr. Blackburn's, about my father's picture; you will find the paper of it in ray pocket-book. Call before the 8th of next month. I hope you found all to your wish respecting Mr. Willmott's business. I shall be glad if there is enough for you to benefit from. Send me word, when you write, by my friend; but if you should write to me in any other way, do not mention it, as I do not want them to know: or at least, if you do, let it be in a very dark manner. I send this to Mrs. Jenkins's, as I do not know whether you are at your sister's, or where you are. Let me know how you are, and all particulars—how far you have succeeded in Mr. Will<lb></lb>mott's business; and remember me to all my sister's family, and accept my love to you. Believe me to be ever yours most affectionately, "<hi rend="smallCaps">WM. SYM."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"P.S. I write this on a slate, and my turnkey is going to copy it for me on to paper, as I durst not be allowed pen and ink; so he will write it as if he was writing from himself. At present, my dear F., I have acquainted you with all my wants, which if you can, relieve me; and I trust you will, and by so doing, alleviate as much as possible my present situation. His friend, the engineer, will send it to Mrs. Jenkins's by one of the men,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290100"></xptr>
               <p>as I have mentioned above, who you must satisfy for his trouble; and tell him when to call again; and in respect of the things in your letter, I will write again, and tell you more about my way of living and my duty. My living is very low indeed, but I am happy compared to some; I have very many extras in my present situation.</p>
               <p>"Sunday, Nov. 12th, 1837.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>.) "I hope you will keep up your spirits, and continue in good health. Send me word when you expect your things. Put in all particulars, for I shall send in a person to assist in getting the things into the house, and arranging them. Our engineer says I cannot have a better than the bearer, who is used to furniture and wood-work. I shall expect to her from you by Wednesday, and Mr. Greenaway will send his man up for it Mind and pay the man for his trouble, and let me hear from you as soon as possible, as I am very anxious to hear about Mr. Willmott's business and how you are. Give my love to all your sister's family. Do not fail to write soon, and send the things I have mentioned, if possible, Pack them up as small as possible, and tie them in a handkerchief, as I went one very much. All the things I had on, and brought in with me, are taken from me, and I cannot get any of them until I go out; and they take every thing from us, money and every thing, and clothe us with their nasty clothes, as cold as they are coarse. I do not feel like myself in them, and to put some of my own things on will be a great treat; and I can slip the others over them about the time the Governor comes round Do not fail to send me whatever you can, and I must add another want to those already made, which I am afraid you will think too many; that is, if I had a trifle of money, I might get many little comforts bought for me; though it is strictly prohibited, yet my friends will oblige me. If you can spare me a little, do, my dear F., and sew it in one of the pockets of the trowsers or waistcoats; and when I get out, I hope, through God's grace, to make you every amends for the great trouble I have caused you Forgive me, my dear F., and we may yet see many happy days together. God bless you, is the ardent prayer of your most affectionate.</p>

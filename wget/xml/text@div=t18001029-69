            , at the White Swan, Fetter-lane, Holborn; I met with him there, according to appointment; when I went in, he was sitting in the tap-room; I said to him, have you any thing with you; he said, no; he said directly, I could have anything I wanted to-morrow; I told him I must have half a piece of whites, that I had not got any left; he asked me if I had not got a guinea; I told him, I had only half-a-guinea and a few shillings; he said, well, have what you like, give me the half-guinea; I gave him the half-guinea, which had been marked by an officer before it was given to me, and said, let me have half-a-guinea's worth, let the shillings be of a good colour, and good found; he went away, and returned in about ten minutes; he put a paper into my hand; I said, are the shillings of a good colour now; he said, they were as good as I had before, if not better, I might depend upon their being good, what I had of him, for he was the real maker; after that, I was coming away, and chucked down a sixpence, and, he said, that would be a good one for a pattern; I said, it was rather large; he said, so it was, but if ever I had a shilling, or a sixpence, that I liked the pattern of, send it to him, and I might have it craft to that pattern; I then came out to the door along with Horne, the prisoner; I then gave the signal to the officers, Armstrong, Ray, Vickery, Mason, and Clarke, and they immediately secured him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What situation of life are you in? - A. A hair-dresser.</p>

               <p>Q. You were employed, I take it, to carry on this business? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That is, in plain English, you laid down your trade of hair-dresser, and took up the trade of entrapping this man into the commission of a crime that he would not have committed, if you had not entrapped him? - A. I did it for the good of the public, that he might be detected, and brought to justice; I am not a common informer.</p>

               <p>Q. It was for the purpose of prosecuting, that you did this? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. Between seven and eight at night.</p>

               <p>Q. That is just about the time that poor people go to the public-house to refresh themselves with a pint of beer, after they have done work? - A. Some may.</p>

               <p>Q. How many people were in the public-house? - A. I do not know that any body was there, except Horne and me, and another man or so.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear there were not several people there? - A. I think I saw one; I was in a separate box from the rest.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted, a waiter attends there? - A. The landlord brought in the beer.</p>



               <p>Q. How was the bar situated? - A. In the passage.</p>

               <p>Q. Commanding a view of the top-room? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that a publican would have this beer in such a situation, that he could not have a view of the tap-room? - A. He could see but a very small part of it.</p>

               <p> Q. Had you any other money in your pocket, besides the sixpence? - A. I had another.</p>

               <p> Q. Was it by accident, or design, that you pulled out that sixpence? - A. By accident.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any halfpence? - A. I had three or four pennyworth; I cannot say exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. What did your beer come to? - A. We had had three pints, and I paid for all of them, and Horne said, he would be a pints.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any boy here to prove this conversation, but yourself? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. He said, he was the real maker; are you sure that was the particular expression? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, if that was the expresion you used before the Lord-Mayor? - A. It was, that he was the real maker.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any more than that he was the maker, omitting the word real-</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Where is the difference? He might have said it, and they not put it down; it certainly is not in the deposition.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am an officer belonging to the Police-office, Worship street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any directions,respecting Horne? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you, before that, learned where he lived? - A. Yes, in Elim-court, Fetter-lane: On Monday, the 20th of October, I apprehended him at the door of the Swan public-house, in Fetter-lane;I, after that, went to his house, in company with Mason and Clarke, leaving the prisoner in custody with Armstrong and Vickery; I knocked at the door on the left, below stairs, and enquired for Horne; I received information which room he in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290044"></xptr>habited; I went up stairs, in company with Mason and Clarke; when I got up stairs, Mrs. Horne was just coming out of the room that I had been directed to; I knew her very well; I asked her name; she told me her name was,Baresford, I think, or some such name, though I knew her person perfectly well, and knew her to be Mrs. Horne; I immediately laid hold of her, and said, we must search your apartments; says she, we have got none here; I knocked at a door fronting of her's, upon the same floor; a woman came to the door, and I asked her, in the presence of Mrs. Horne, which was Mrs. Horne's apartments; she said, why that is Mrs. Horne's apartments, which was the room I saw her coming out of; we took her into that room, and proceeded to search the chest of drawers, and, in the top-drawer, I think, I found nineteen shillings, and twenty-two sixpences; they are all base, and sit for circulation; they were wrapped up in a paper, screwed up; I opened them, Mrs. Horne stood close by; I informed her, that her husband was in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not tell us what she said? - A. In the window was a white mustard-pot, and three or four phials; while we were making a farther search, Mrs. Horne had shifted herself from the place where they were standing; I turned round, and she was gone; I ran down stairs after her, and she was then returning out of a yard from the privy; I immediately laid hold of her, and desired Clarke to come down stairs; I got a light, looked down the privy, and took up a mustard-pot, the soil being very near the top; it laid upon the surface of the soil; it was the same kind of mustard-pot I had seen in the room by the phials.</p>

               <p>Q.From this, its appearance, do you believe it to be the same? - A. I really do; when I went up stairs, I missed the mustard-pot that I had before seen; I was present when Clarke found two files, and, in the teeth of the files, were some fresh filedust, that had been apparently used for filing white metal.</p>

               <p>Q. You are acquainted a good deal with this kind of business; were those the sort of files used by persons in the business of coining? - A. They were; Mason has got the mustard-pot, and Clarke the files.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these coins in the same state now, that they were when you found them? - A. I believe they are.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. All the coin that you found, you have now produced? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.When you have apprehended persons for this sort of offence, have you not generally found some in the process, and some in perfection? - A. Sometimes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any file-dust? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you find any thing fixed upon which coiners usually work? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q.Neither did you find any grease, aqua-fortis, or corks? - A. No further than I found in the mustard-pot.</p>

               <p> Q. You do not mean to say you saw any aquafortis in that mustard-pot? - A. No; I did not see what was in the mustard-pot.</p>

I am one of the marshalmen of the City of London; I was with Ray; I was directed, by a warrant from the Lord-Mayor, to search the prisoner's apartments, in Elim-court, Fetter-lane; I was with Ray when he found the base metal that has been produced from that room; I went to another room, where there was only a door and partition divided one from the other; I searched the beds; there were two in the room; I found nothing there, but in searching a little box that stood by the wall, I found these two files, (producing them); they are now in the same state in which they were when I found them; the first that I saw of the mustard-pot, was on the table, in the middle of the room; it was a white mustard-pot.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see it in the window? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Ray. I put the mustard-pot upon the table, after I had brought it up stairs.</p>

               <p>Clarke. There was a liquid in it, that appeared to be like a thick cream; I could compare it to nothing else.(Peter Mason produced the mustard-pot).</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I went to the apartment of the prisoners, while the officers were there.</p>

               <p>Q. You have had a great deal of experience in this business; are files of this description necessary to finish base coin that is put into circulation? - A. I should believe this had been used to file the edges of the counterfeit money, or blanks, before it comes to money.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these files? - A. The dust appears to be a composition of brass and copper, and other metals mixed together, of which blanks are genenerally made.</p>


               <p>Q. Have those blanks any silver in them; or are they made of other metal? - A. Sometimes; this mustard-pot was produced before the Lord-Mayor on the 21st of October; and to shew his Lordship what it would effect, I rubbed it over that farthing,(producing it), which I have had ever since; it was a good copper farthing that I had in my pocket; it is done by the finger and thumb, without the necessity of using aqua-fortis. (The witness shewed the Jury the experiment upon a halfpenny).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that if a composition, in which there is any silver, is used, they make use of aquafortis, in order to bring that silver to the surface? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290045"></xptr>Q. But is this mixture of that description, or not? - A. No; I should think this mixture would do it in an easier way; it produces an uncommon strong colour, is sooner done, and does not subject the hands of the people who work, to be discoloured; aqua-fortis will always make their nails yellow, and their hands, as if they had been using uncommon dye; and, if thrown down, when you go into a room, you must perceive the smell.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you whether this mixture is calculated to produce a colour resembling silver upon any blanks? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You never saw this mustard-pot, till Ray, the officer, brought it up? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. If you put your finger into aqua-fortis, you would feel it burn? - A. Yes, undoubtedly, if it was not killed; but whatever composition has been put to this, it has killed it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am one of the moniers of his Majesty's mint.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that parcel in brown paper? - A. They are all counterfeits, both the shillings and sixpences; there is not one good one among them.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Raine. (To Armstrong). Q. Look at these shillings; the monier of the Mint has told us they are counterfeits; how does it appear to you to have been done? - A.(Scrapes one of them). This appears to be of a copperish cast.</p>

               <p>Q. Does it appear to have been a blank of base metal? - A. It does.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say how that surface has been produced? - A. If you please, I will try it. (Tries it).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe that that surface has been produced upon a blank of base metal, by rubbing that composition upon it? - A. I should believe so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I take it for granted, if there is a small portion of silver in base metal, dipping it in aqua-fortis will drive that to the surface? - A. Certainly; the people who are in the habit of doing this kind of business;some make them out of a metal which costs more money, and therefore they sell them at a certain price; but these are, what are called in the trade, fig-shillings, worked by the finger and thumb.</p>

               <p>Q. You are not able to ascertain, merely by scratching off the surface, whether it is done by that mixture, or by aqua-fortis? - A. I should believe this to be a solution of silver, aqua-fortis, and salt, killed, on purpose for them to work it without putting it into that pickle, which would be too strong for this kind of metal.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man in the apartment?</p>

               <p>Q. How often have you met him? - A. I may have seen him as many times as three, but I was not conscious that he was my tenant; she has had in six or seven weeks; she paid me weekly.</p>

            's defence. Last Wednesday was a fortnight, a person came to me of the name of Jones, and asked me to be so good as to go and get him half a piece of goods; he told me, it would be of great service to him, his wife being in trouble, and he should get something by it; accordingly, I went to the White Swan, in Fetter-lane, with him; when I went in, there was a gentleman that he called his friend, who had come from Portmouth; he said, that he kept the two Blue Posts, at Portsmouth; that he was a man I could trust, and not be afraid of him; accordingly, this Portsmouth gentleman gave me half-a-guinea; they said, how long should I be gone; I told them, about an hour; I came back in that time, and brought the things, and gave them to them; then they drank,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290046"></xptr>and paid the reckoning, and went to the King's Arms, upon Holborn-hill; there we had beer and spirituous liquors, till it got into my head; I gave Jones four shillings out of it, and had but sixpence for myself; we made an agreement to meet the next Monday, at the White Swan, in Fetter-lane; There I met the man, and he gave me half-a-guinea, and I went to fetch the goods, part I brought with me, and part I left behind, and then I was taken.</p>

            . Q. Are you a single woman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In October, 1810, did you live at Tottenham - A. Yes; I occupied the whole of a house, I intended to go away, and I advertised the house. I carried on dress-making, and millinery business. I saw the prisoner in October, 1810; I had not known him before; he was a perfect stranger to me. He came there to take the house; he said he had no objection to take the furniture if I meaned to dispose of it. I understood he had been there before, and had conversation with somebody about taking the house. I do not know what day it was in October; it might be the latter part of October. He took possession on the 20th; it was not long before the date of the bill; the bill was dated the day it was given, November the 12th, 1810. He told me, he would take the fixtures of the shop, and my furniture that I had to dispose of he was willing to take, if I would consent to take two bills in payment for the furniture. The fixtures of the shop, he said, he would pay me ready money for, which amounted to twenty-six pounds fourteen shillings; but instead of paying the twenty-six pounds fourteen shillings, he made a payment of twenty pounds, and the six pound fourteen shillings were added to the bills. He sent for the stamps, and when the stamps arrived, he wrote the bills; he did not ask me to write the body of the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the same bills again if you were to see them; look at the bill for nineteen pounds fourteen shillings, and tell me if that is the bill - A. Yes; the name to this bill, is my hand writing. He wrote the body of the bill, and I put my name to the bill, as the drawer; he wrote the acceptance across the body of the bill.</p>
               <p>"Accepted Thomas Scott, No. 4, Staining-lane, London." He wrote the whole of it, except my name. He wrote

            , at Terris and White, Staining-lane, London. He called Terris and White his agents. I understood from him that was the place to which the bill would be payable, both in six weeks, but he said if it would accommodate me in making one of the bills for two months, it would suit him the better, than paying both together. I agreed to that.</p>
               <p>Q. He went at that time by the name of

            . He said if I enquired at Terris and White's, I should find it all satisfactory; they were his agents. I did not see him after that, until he removed into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did he come and take possession of the house - A. On the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what passed when he came and took possession of the house - A. I met him on the road, and gave him the key; he came to the Ship. I there gave him the key; he was in a chaise he asked me to get into the chaise with him, and to go to the Ship with him; I did so, I gave him the key of the house. He said his goods were coming down in the waggon; they were on the road. I staid some time with him, and then I left him. The stage called for me, and I came to town. I did not hear any more of it, until the first bill was due; I had paid the bill of nineteen pounds fourteen shillings to a Mrs. James, in Castle-street, a dress-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the bill that you had of the prisoner was the bill that you paid to Mrs. James - A. Yes, it was returned to me by Mrs. James as unpaid.</p>
               <p>Q. Three days after it was due Mrs. James sent for you, to tell you that the bill had been returned - A. She sent to me to ask me whether I would let Mrs. Garlick take the bill to Terris and White, to get it paid. Mrs. Garlick is a person employed by me. I agreed to it. Mrs. Garlick had the bill, and went for the purpose of presenting it; Mrs. Garlick returned, and I found it was unpaid; the bill was returned to me; it was the same bill that the prisoner gave me that was returned to me, by Mrs. James; upon it being returned to me unpaid, I went down to Tottenham to see after Mr. Scott; Mr. Scott was not at home, his wife was; she asked me to walk in, and to wait until he returned. The prisoner returned in a little while; he said he was very sorry, he could not take it up; if Mrs. James would wait he would take it up in a few days. I told him, I would speak to Mrs. James about it; and hoped he would not fail to keep his promise. I came to town then. In a few days afterwards, the prisoner sent a man to Mrs. James, requesting further time; Mrs. James granted a week longer time. I heard nothing more of the prisoner until after the second bill was due, that was two months I think after the first. I went to Tottenham again, when I found the other bill was not paid I saw Mrs. Scott, at that time. Scott was not at home. Mrs. Scott never asked me to sit down, and as soon as I got out of the house, Mrs. Scott put up the shutters. I returned to town again. I never saw Mr. Scott as he called himself, until I saw him on horseback in Chiswell-street; it was on a Sunday I never spoke to him. After that I saw him at Union Hall; a period of twelve months had elapsed then. At a broker's shop, opposite of where I lived at that time, in Whitecross-street, I saw some of my furniture for sale; I think that was in the following summer, after I had left my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever receive any of your rent -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020005"></xptr>A. I assigned away my interest; the bills were my security.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you came to Union Hall did you recognise the prisoner - A. Yes. I went there to see whether it was the prisoner; I saw him; it was the Mr. Scott with whom this transaction had taken place, I am confident of it; he was called by many names there. He was called by the name in which he is now indicted, and by the name of Smith and Jones. I then made my complaint to the magistrate, my deposition was taken, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE GARLICK. I assisted Mrs. Lawrence in carrying on her business at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time of the bills being given in the way the last witness has described - A. I was; the prisoner at that time represented himself to go by the name of Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that bill into your hand, and tell me whether you know that to be the bill that he wrote - A. Yes, that is the very bill; he gave his name as there described,

             the body of it, and wrote the acceptance. Directed to Mr. Terris and White; he stated Terris and White to be his agents; the prisoner said he was employed in making purchases for Government.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being desired by Mrs. James to go to Staining-lane with this bill I put into your hand - A. Yes; on the day it became due I went to No. 4, Staining-lane, I there presented the bill for payment. I saw an elderly man; I did not get any payment; he said he had no property in hand whatever, belonging to any such person of that name, nor had not known anything of him for some time past. I was desired to call on the morrow. I went there on the morrow. I then saw no one but the servant maid, who gave no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of Terris and White - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find there were such persons living there - A. I made no enquries but there. I returned the bill to Mrs. James, in Castle-street. I am sure it is the same bill. I had seen the prisoner write in my presence. I was with Mrs. Lawrence, when she went down to Tottenham; and afterwards went to Union Hall; I there saw the person of Scott, that I had seen write the bill; he was there called, Thomas Bontein, and several names. I was bound over to give evidence.</p>

               <p>COURT. Prisoner at the bar, you have heard the evidence given against you, what have you to say in your defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it entirely to my counsel.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS ALLEN. I live in St. John's-lane; I am a broker.</p>
               <p>Q. In the year 1810, and 1811, did you know the prisoner - A. I first knew him on the latter end of August, 1810; I knew him continually in the name of Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him by any other name than Scott - A. Not positively, he used to have a nick name of Bout, and Bontein at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you occasionally transacted business with him - A. To my sorrow, in the name of

            , and never by any other name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The latter end of August, 1810, was the first time that you became acquainted with the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew him before that - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, you never knew whether he had gone by any other name than Scott - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Since then have not you know that he has gone by other names - A. I know that he has from the public newspapers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been very intimate with him from that time down to the present - A. No. I visited him in the jail, Horsemonger-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been backwards and forwards here - A. I have not kept any account of it perhaps three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutrix - A. No. I have seen Mrs. Garlick since the prisoner was in custody. The prisoner begged I would call upon her to know whether the prosecutrix had any thing to say concerning the bills in question. I asked Mrs. Garlick when Mrs. Lawrence would be in town. She said, in a few day I said I wanted to see her for what purpose I did not know, only that the prisoner wanted to see her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Garlick. Do you remember that man coming to you - A. Perfectly well. I think it was about a month or three weeks ago. He said, he came from the prisoner in Newgate; he came to Mrs. Lawrence's lodgings, 198, Whitecross-street. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020006"></xptr>enquired for Mrs. Lawrence. I told him she was not in town. He said, he wished to know how the circumstance took place, and whether she was in possession of the bills against him; he said he had seen the prisoner that day; he wished to see Mrs. Lawrence. I said, she was not in possession of the bills, and if she was in town she would not visit the prisoner in prison. He expressed himself as sorry at the transaction of the prisoner defrauding an alone woman; he also said he had himself been a sufferer by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bombardier in the Royal Artillery. Carson was a fifer in our battalion—I did not know Westwood—I have since found that he is an artilleryman—Carson was quartered at No. 46 room, at Wool<lb></lb>wich-barracks—I was in No. 45—on 10th Sept., about a quarter-past 9 o'clock, Carson came and asked me the time—my watch was safe then, hanging up in my room on a peg, at the head of the bed—Carson could see it—I missed it about half-past 11 the same morning—I have seen it since—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I have had it about eight years—I am sure it is mine.</p>

On 10th Sept., I received infar<lb></lb>mation, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Davis's pawnshop, in Thomas-street, about half-past 7 in the evening—as I was going in at the door, I noticed the boy, Carson, outside—as soon as he saw me go in, he moved across the road—my suspicions were aroused that he knew something of the</p>

               <p>watch, and I went in to the pawnbroker's, and stood behind Westwood who was in the box—I found him offering this watch for pledge, it was then in the pawnbroker's hands—I heard him ask Westwood, "Is this your watch!"—he said it was—he asked how long he had had it—he said six months—he then said, "What did you give for the watch?"—he said, "A sovereign"—he asked who he bought it of—he said, "From one of our men"—I then stepped forward, and said to the pawnbroker, "That is the watch that was stolen this morning"—the pawnbroker handed it to me—I told Westwood that I should make him a prisoner—he said he had been nicely sucked into it, that it was given to him by a boy to pledge—I took him out, and found Carson there—I had told the pawnbroker's assistant to go after him—I asked him if this watch was his—he said yes, it was his watch—I showed it to him—he said it was his watch—I said, "How long have you had it?"—he said, "Six months"—I had hold of Westwood at this time—I said to Carson, "Now tell the truth," and after that he said, "I found it in the room."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Westwood's Defence.</hi> All I know about the watch is this: I was coming out from the barracks, and met the boy; he asked me where I was going; I said for a walk, he might come too if he liked; he came with me; in going along he said he had got his watch in his pocket; he had told me before that he had a watch in pawn, and his sister had fetched it out, and given it to him; he pulled it out, and let me see it; he said he was going to put it in pawn again; I advised him to keep it in his pocket, or take it to his sister; he said she would not take care of it; I said, "You had better take care of it yourself;" he said, "I don't care about that; I will go and take it to the pawnshop;" and asked me if I would take it; I refused him three or four times; he said they would not take it from him; and, at last, I went in with it; I wish to ask him if I knew anything about the watch being stolen, when he asked me to go and pledge it.</p>

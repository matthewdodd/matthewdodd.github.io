                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 295), On Tuesday night, 25th April, I was on duty in the Woolwich Road—Kidbrook Lane is attached to my beat—I went on duty at 10 o'clock, and remained on duty till 6 a.m.—on Wednesday morning, 26th April, I was in Kidbrook Lane between 1.50 and 1.45—I passed through the lane (I had not passed through it previously from the time I came on duty)—nothing attracted my attention at that time—Mortimer was the policeman that I succeeded on that beat—I don't think he was on duty up to 10 o'clock; he was in the fore part of the evening—I passed through the lane again at 4.15—nothing attracted my attention then—it was as I came back again in the lane—I did not come back the same way—I passed up on the foot-path, outside the lane—there is a hedge between the foot-path and the lane, so that I should not be able to see any<lb></lb>thing that was in the lane unless I walked in the lane—when I went down I went on the foot-path beside the lane—when I returned I came back in the lane, and I then found a young woman on her hands and knees, on the side of the lane next Eltham—the lane runs from Eltham towards Morden College—I came up on the right-hand side of the lane; the foot-path is on the side next Eltham—the lane is about 7 yards wide between the hedges—when I got up to the woman, she was on her hands and knees, moaning very faintly, "Oh, my poor head, my poor head!"—I asked her what was the matter with her, and she made no answer—I noticed that her right cheek was covered with blood—I put my hand on her left shoulder and gave her a slight shake, and asked her what was the matter, and how she came by the injuries—she raised her left hand, and said "Take hold of my hand," at the same time turning her head a little to the left, which enabled me to see her face, and I noticed a cut on her left cheek and a lump of blood on her forehead, which appeared to me to be her brain protruding; I should say it was just in the centre of the forehead—when I saw such a fearful sight, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100094"></xptr>
               <p>hesitated a moment to give her my hand; and as I stretched forth my hand she fell flat on her face, and said "Let me die!"—she never spoke after that—when I could not get her to answer any questions I turned round, and found there was blood just exactly behind where I was standing—I should say it would cover nearly a foot square, it was a large clot of blood, clear blood; there were spots of blood about a foot square, but there was one large clot, a lump of blood as it were in the middle of it—I saw some footmarks about, a good many, close by where the blood was—the ground was very soft and sloppy—her gloves were lying within 2 feet of her, one in the other, and her hat within 2 feet of her gloves—I looked about, but could not see anyone, and I ran down to Well Hall Farm, knowing that the ostler would be in the stables at that time, and I sent for a stretcher—as I went down to Well Hall, one of the men told me that Sergeant Haynes was outside—I told him what I had found in the lane—he went up to where the woman was lying, and I went to Eltham after a stretcher—she was then taken on the stretcher to Dr. King's surgery, and then to Guy's Hospital—when I found her, her head was lying close by the hedge, towards Eltham; her head was bobbing up and down from the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. I went on duty at 10 o'clock—I did not go down Kidbrook Lane before 2 o'clock—I was down the lane twice during the night, once at 2.15, and again at 4 o'clock—I heard no<lb></lb>thing when I went down the first time—I went as far as the brook then, I was coming from Eltham; I went to the brook, along the footpath—I passed the place where I afterwards found the woman—I came from Eltham the first time—my beat extends up the lane to the rivulet—that is the end of my beat—I then returned back again—I passed the place where I after<lb></lb>wards found the body, twice on that occasion, going up and coming down—I heard nothing on either of those occasions—that was at 1.45—I passed, going up, on the footpath outside the hedge, where the body was lying—there is a hedge between; the hedge was on my right, as I went up from Eltham the first time—I returned back down the lane, in the lane, and past this very spot—the width of the lane is 7ft. between the hedges—I measured it with a 2ft. rule, and made it 21ft. between the two banks, including the ditches—there is one little ditch on the left hand side—I was walking close to that as I was going back towards Eltham—when I found the body, at 4 o'clock, it was on my right hand side, between the place where I went when I went up the lane to the rivulet, and the place I passed when I came down at 1.45—at that time I saw nothing, and heard nothing—I found the body on the right hand side, as I was going back to Eltham, into the Woolwich Road, which leads from Eltham to Shooter's Hill, past the Greenwich Cemetery—at 4.15 I went on the path up to the brook, the same path I had done the first time—I did not go into the lane at all before I got to the brook—when I got to the brook at the end of my beat, I turned to come back, and came down the lane, and found the poor girl in the lane, on the right hand side; I walking on the left, near the ditch—she was in a spot between the place I had passed going up, and the place I passed in coming down—I bad a lantern with me—I did not turn on my light at all that night; it was getting rather light at the time I found her, so that I did not want my light; there were footmarks about, near the blood—the reason I did not use my lantern was because it was not so dark as I have seen it there; it was light enough for me to see—I did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100095"></xptr>
               <p>not use my lantern when I went up at 1.45, nor when I came back, it was light enough without—there seemed to be a good many footmarks about, but they seemed to be defaced, as if there had been dew falling on them during the night—they appeared to be going all ways—I did not see any blood besides the pool, except under her head; there was not much—it seemed to be clotted up in the mud—there was a little; I should say I might cover it with my hand—the pool was about 4ft. from her—the ground was trampled about where the footmarks were—she was at Guy's Hospital until the Sunday, when she died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The height of the hedge would be, I should My, about 10 ft.—from 10 to 11ft. opposite where the girl was lying; it was a high, thick hedge—it was not very dark, nor yet very light, before morning broke—I don't think there was any moon—by 4.15 the morning was breaking—I use my lantern to look at particular things—when it is a very dark night we use it sometimes in finding our way, especially in a place like that; it is a very lonely place—I could not tell from the marks on the grass whether she had moved or crawled along from one place to another, I did not notice.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant R</hi>) On Wednesday morn<lb></lb>ing, 26th April, about 4.10, Gunn came to me, in the gardens of a gentle<lb></lb>man named Langley, in the Woolwich Road—he made some communication to me in consequence of which I went into Kidbrook Lane—I went through the field by the side of the lane till I came to the spot where I found the woman lying on her back, with her head in the direction of Kidbrook from Eltham—she was taken away on a stretcher to Dr. King's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. I saw that the grass was trampled down round about the spot—it appeared as if there had been a struggle; that was near where the body was—I did not notice footsteps then, I did after<lb></lb>wards; about noon in the day; I traced them for some little distance towards the brook or rivulet—I was examined before the Magistrate, and Mid I found some spots of blood—there were three spots at the edge of the rivulet, on one stone, I believe, as if they were dropped there—I believe that was over 300 yards from where the body was found, on the Kidbrook tide of the rivulet; I mean the other side of it, as you go up from Elthem—there is a plank that goes over the rivulet in the lane—the blood was to the right of the plank, going from Eltham, and very likely four yards from it, in the lane—the brook goes right across the lane—going from Eltham, the plank would be on the left—it was where the brook ran through the lane that I found the spots of blood—I saw some long sliding footsteps going in the direction from the body towards the brook—I found a locket among the girl's clothing—I took that locket to Randall, a silversmith, in London Street, Greenwich—I took with me a man named Humphreys—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>hearings of the prisoner at that time—I saw Humphreys at the Blackheath Road Police Station—I went with him to Randall's, and had the locket with me—I produced it there—I saw Mr. Randall and some lady—I produced the locket to them, in the presence of Humphreys—I don't think he has ever been called as a witness for the prosecution, or Mr. or Miss Randall, either before the Magistrate or the Coroner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw marks of a struggle, and the grass was trampled down—I should not think, by the appearance, that it had taken place very long, some hours perhaps, four or five hours—I could not tell from the look of them whether they had been made in the early part of the night or not—there was a dew that night—it was a very dark, heavy night—I could not tell whether the dew had fallen on the marks, or the marks had trampled out the dew.</p>

                  </hi>. In April last, I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—about 7 o'clock on the morning of the 26th, the deceased was brought there—she came at once under my examination—I have my notes of it—she was quite unconscious, and very cold—the injuries were very severe which she had received, and were chiefly confined to the anterior half of the head; they were all of an incised character, clean cuts—there was one slight abrasion on the left cheek; with that exception they were in<lb></lb>cised—there were altogether about a dozen wounds on the face and head—there was one over the left ear—there was a wound down to the left temporal bone, and it was smashed in; the bone itself was fractured and depressed—on the bone being raised, the brain was discovered to be lacerated—the injury was external and internal—there were two other wounds which were more severe than the others on the face—one above the right eye, about 3 inches in length; the bone was completely smashed up, so much so that several fragments were lying quite loose, and the brain was protruding; that was a cut—the other was a transverse wound on the upper lip, which extended down to the upper jaw bone, which was broken, and a piece was removed; that was also a cut—those were the most severe of the injuries—there were altogether twelve or fourteen, the others were less serious, but they were quite separate, distinct wounds—there were several cuts on the arms and hands, at the back of the hands; they also appeared to have been produced by a sharp, cutting instrument—they were such wounds as might have been produced in a struggle, if she had been defending herself against violence—there were two cuts on her arms, just as they would be if she had put up her arms in front to defend herself; those were clean cuts, they were quite superficial, not deep—there was one very slight bruise on the right thigh—I think those were all the injuries I observed—the bruise on the thigh was recent, I should say a few hours—she remained under my care at Guy's till she died, on the 30th, about 9 o'clock in the evening—she died from the direct effect of the wounds—such an instrument as this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would produce the wounds I saw—it must have been a sharp and heavy instrument, and this is so—I think it might produce the wounds I saw—I think if that instrument had been used with violence, the wounds I saw would be the natural and probable result—I examined her after death, she was pregnant—I think she had been so about two months—the embryo was dead, and decomposed—it would be impossible to say how long it had been dead, I should say a week or two—I could not tell whether she had ever had a child before—I was shown certain articles of clothing by Superintendent Mulvany—I did not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100097"></xptr>
               <p>examine them, I only saw them—that was on the morning of the first police examination, on the Tuesday following her death, the 2nd May—there were some spots upon them, I thought they were spots of blood, they looked like blood; of course I could not say, I merely saw them, that was all—on the day I examined the girl, after her death, I cut off a portion of her hair; the length of it was, I should think, 5 in. or 6 in.—I did not measure it—I was directed by the Coroner to cut it off—I wrapped it up in brown paper and gave it to Mulvany—(<hi rend="italic">Dr. Letheby here produced it, stating that he had received it from Mulvany</hi>)—It was a lock resembling this, that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cut on the forehead was just above the eyebrow, on the right side—there is an artery there; that was divided—there must have been other arteries severed by other wounds—generally speaking, when an artery is severed, blood spurts forth; sometimes when it is completely divided, it will not bleed at all, but at other times it would spurt forth—ordinarily speaking, where there are such serious wounds as these, I should expect blood to spurt forth—when I was examined before, I expressed an opinion that it was quite consistent that the wounds I saw might have been inflicted as late as within a couple of hours—I gave that as a minimum, and I give as a maximum, ten or twelve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you speak of the clean cuts on the arms and other places, was there any appearance of bruising about those cuts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, none at all; they were quite clean cuts—there was no appearance of bruising about the sides of the cuts—I think an instrument like this might, if it was sharp, produce a clean cut, without any bruising, supposing a person to be lifting up her arm; I have not felt the edge*; may I do so?—some parts of it are very rough—I say ifr might, if it caught this part of the edge, which is sharp, but other parts of the edge are turned aside, and could not cut at all—I think the sharpest part of this instrument might do it; I think it would—I think it would produce a clean cut, without any bruise; if it came in contact with the roughened edge, I think it would bruise, but the sharpest part would produce a clean cut, such as I saw on the arm, without any bruising—the character of the cut must depend upon the force of the blow—there were two cuts on the sleeve of the dress that she had on—I don't know whether the material was cut through—I don't know what the material was; I suppose some kind of stuff; I did not notice it very much—(<hi rend="italic">The dress was here produced</hi>)—I believe this to be the dress she had on—I don't see the cuts here; I certainly saw them at the time she was brought in—I don't see any cuts on either arm here—it may have been on the mantle (<hi rend="italic">Looking at the mantle</hi>)—I was confusing the mantle with the dress; there are two cuts here—I believe this to be the mantle she had on—there is one cut on each arm—there is a jagged cut—the larger cut is about an inch long, the other about a quarter—the larger one is on the left sleeve, about 3 inches from the wrist or end of the cuff; the other is a three cornered hole; it is almost a cut—that is on the right arm, about the same distance from the cuff—it is a cloth mantle, worn over the dress—there is no doubt about the cuts on the arms being clean cuts—I am quite sure of that—each wound was about half an inch in length, just about the middle of the arm, in both having a direction downwards and inwards, about the middle of the arm, between the wrist and the elbow—she was plump altogether—I don't remember the arms especially—the sleeve seems to be confined at the wrist—it is a small wrist—the right wrist is torn—I did not notice whether it</p>

               <p>was so at the time; these things were handled by a great many persons—I don't remember whether the dress was next to her arm, or whether she had anything underneath—the nurse undressed her.</p>

I am an Inspector of the Detective Police at Scotland Yard—on 1st May I went with Superintendent Griffin to Mr. Pook's house, London Street, Greenwich—we went up stairs and saw Mr. Pook, the prisoner's father—I told him something, and eventually he called up the prisoner—I said "This is Superintendent Griffin, and I am Inspector Mulvany"—he said "I know Superintendent Griffin, he is the superintendent at Greenwich"—I said to the prisoner "I want to ask you a few questions relative to your father's late servant, Jane Clousen?"—he said "Oh yes, I will answer any<lb></lb>thing"—I said "When did you see he last?"—he said "On the Thursday she left here, and I have not seen her since"—I said "Have you written a letter to her?"—he said "No"—I said "People say you have"—he said "Do they? Have you the letter? If it is in my handwriting that will prove it"—he also said "I know nothing about her; she was a dirty young woman, and left here in consequence; I can account for all my nights," or "time, last week"—I said "Very well, do so"—he said "I did not leave work till 7 o'clock on Monday evening, I was about the town all the evening; on the Tuesday I went to Lewisham, came back, and was indoors by 9.15"—I asked him whom he went to see at Lewisham—he said "A lady," and was it necessary to mention her name—I said "Oh no"—he said he did not see her—I asked him if he went into any house—he said "No," and nobody saw him that he knew, and he came back by way of Royal Hill.</p>

I have been nine years a detective, before that I was a police officer—Griffin was with me when I went to Mr. Pook's, we were there twenty minutes or half an hour before the prisoner was called in, or it might be more—I examined the whole of his clothes—everything I asked for was shown to me, nothing I asked for was kept back, that lam aware of—I told the father, people said that his son was on terms of intimacy with the girl, and had corresponded with her, and that there was a letter to her in his writing—I did not say "There is a letter to her in his handwriting"—he said "It is absurd, I am positive it is not the case, Edmund is a different sort of boy altogether, it is almost impossible anything of that sort could have been going on without some of us dis<lb></lb>overing it."</p>

               <p>the father if that was his son's portmanteau, he said he really did not know—I asked if it was open, and he said "Look and see"—I examined two coats hanging behind the door, an overcoat and a frock coat, two pain of trowsers, and one or two waistcoats—we then went down into the drawing-room—it was the prisoner's father who suggested that he should be called up, and I began to ask him questions—I asked him where he had seen her last, and he said "On the Thursday that she left," and he had not seen her since—some time afterwards he recalled those words and said "Yes I did though, I saw her in the town, talking to a young gentleman, and I came home and mentioned it"—he did not directly recall his words and say "Yes, I did though, I saw her in the town, talking to a young <hi rend="italic">gent,</hi> and I came home and mentioned it"—I know that Griffin has said so, and it is the truth, but it was in a later period of the conversation.</p>

               <p>Royal Hill—if I was returning from Lewisham Bridge, and instead of going by the guns, were to go straight along by Dartmouth Road, that would take me into Royal Hill, past Mrs. Playne's shop—Royal Hill must pass Mrs. Playne's shop—I don't know that they close the Park gates at dusk—the most direct road on the map is Dartmouth Hill, Royal Hill, and so to London Street—the direct road is the steepest—about 100 yards on the Greenwich side of the hill it is very steep—the round about road is less steep than the direct road—another way would be up the Lewisham Road, round by Blissett Street, and then into Royal Hill—that would not be so steep, that is what I meant when I said he could go another way—a person going from London Street to Lewisham, if he went round the Park by the guns would have a less steep walk than if he went by the direct road—Lewisham Road is not so steep as the way round by Blackheath—a person going to London or to Royal Hill, might take the Lewisham Road still more to the left, and turn into Blisset Street—that brings them on to the Royal Hill, and that would avoid the steepness of the road—you could come round then at the back of Blackheath Hill, instead of mounting the higher ground—I did not hear him say that his shirt had gone to the wash, I was sitting at the opposite side of the room—I did not say that he said the stains on the shirt were caused by a small scratch, but it was small—there was a scratch on his arm—I was not at the Police Court when an observation was made about his standing with one hand over the other—the dabbling of the wristbands was in reference to their being crumpled—I handed the shirt to Griffin—I think he made a remark about expecting to find more blood on it—when I said I should have to take the prisoner in custody, be asked if he might take a book with him, and he took up a copy of "Pickwick"—I don't know whether he had been reading it—he took it with him to read—when he said he had seen the girl, he said "I remember I did see her in the street, on Saturday, with a man"—I said "Do you know him?'—he said "No, but I came home, and told my brother"—the brother was then called up, and I think his father asked him "Did your brother tell you he had seen Jane with anybody?—the brother said "Yes, I remember his coming home, and saying he had seen her with a <hi rend="italic">swell</hi>"—I did not take the prisoner's boots off when I took him—I believe they were taken off afterwards, by Griffin, I believe—I did not take them to Kidbrook Lane—I got this brush from Superintendent Griffin, with which the prisoner is supposed to have brushed his clothes, at Mr. Plane's—it is a dark brush, the centre is lighter than the outside—it was taken to Dr. Letheby, and submitted to him—the prisoner's trowsers were not taken off till half or three quarters of an hour after I took him—he did not sleep in them that night—they were not taken off the next day, because I brought them to London—he was put into a small room first, which is used by the Inspector as a reserve room; not into a cell—it was there his trowsers were taken off—the Inspector's private room would be the proper term for it—that was Monday, May 1st—I have been principally engaged in looking after this case—I issued two hand-bills—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "On the evening of Saturday, the 22nd of April, a man purchased a lathing hammer at the shop of Mr. Thomas, tool dealer, 186, High Street, Deptford.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Superintendent R</hi>). Kidbrook Lane is in my division—I received information of the murder on the Wednesday morning that it was discovered—on Monday, 1st May, I accompanied Inspector Mulvany to Mr. Pook's, about 1.50—I asked for the father in the shop—he came forward, and went up stairs with me and Mulvany—the prisoner was sent for, and after he came up, Mulvany said to him "I am Inspector Mulvany, and this is Superintendent Griffin"—he said "I know Mr. Griffin"—Mul<lb></lb>vany said "We have come to inform you that the young woman who was injured, and murdered in Kidbrook Lane, and died in the hospital, was your late servant, Jane Clousen; we have heard that she was a sweetheart of yours, and that you have been corresponding with her"—the prisoner said "It is not true; it is nothing to me; she was a dirty girl, and left in consequence"—Mulvany said "You have corresponded with her; you have written a letter to her"—he said "If you have the letter, that will prove it"—Mulvany said "You were the last person who was with her on the night when she met with her injuries; she left a person to join you on the Tuesday night"—he said "I can account for all my nights last week, I have not seen her since she left here"—he made some other remark to his father, and then he said "Yes I did though, I saw her talking to a <hi rend="italic">gent.</hi> in the town, and I came home and mentioned it"—Mulvany said that she left a person to join him, and it was mentioned that that was near Prince Arthur's—Mulvany was the principal spokesman—the prisoner said "I can account for all my evenings last week," and "Where shall I begin?—Mulvany nodded, and said "Well, do so"—he said "Where shall I begin;</p>

               <p>with Monday?" and Mulvany said "Yes, with Monday"—he said "On Monday I was about the town principally with my brother; I did not lose sight of my brother, or he of me, more than fifteen minutes at any time, and he can prove it," or "My brother can prove it; my friends seldom leave me, or lose sight of me for long at a time, as I am subject to fits"—either I or Mulvany said "Tuesday," and the prisoner said "Tuesday evening I left work about 7 o'clock; I usually leave work about 7 o'clock, and I went to Lewisham to see a lady, is it necessary to mention her name?"—I think we both replied "Cer<lb></lb>tainly not"—I then said "Which way did you go to Lewisham?"—he said "I went through the Park, and across by the guns," meaning the part of the Park where there are some cannon—I said "Then which gate of the Park did you go out at?"—he said "That by Mrs. Sainsbury's"—I said "Then that would bring you to the top of Groom's Hill, and by Prince Arthur's, where the girl told the person she had to meet you"—he made no reply to that—he was then asked where he went to at Lewisham, and he said "To Lewisham Railway Bridge," and he stayed there about forty minutes—he was asked whether he saw anyone there who he knew, and could prove he was there—he said "No," while he stood there he did not see anyone who he knew, or who he thought knew him, who could prove he was there—he was asked to produce his clothes, and whether those were the trowsers that he wore on the Tuesday night—Mulvany was sitting on a chair as close to him as I am to that board—I saw that Mulvany was looking at him, and scruti<lb></lb>nized the leg of his trowsers—he said "Are those the trowsers you wore on that night"—the prisoner said "Yes"—I was about three yards from him—he had a coat on, I believe—I have said that he was in his shirt sleeves, but upon reflection I think he had a short cut-off coat on—he was asked to pro<lb></lb>duce the coat he had on that night—he produced it—Mulvany examined it—he was asked to produce the hat he wore—he went for the hat, and returned with this flat hat, which we had previously seen in an up stairs room—Mulvany closely examined it, turned it about, handed it to me, and pointed to a spot or two on it—these are the trowsers and coat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are the spots here now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are marks where the spots were—there is one on the upper edge of the band, and one on the end, and one on the bridge—I believe something has been applied to it—they have been treated chemically—they are about the size of the end of this penholder, and one is scarcely so large—they would almost pass un<lb></lb>noticed, unless you were searching for them—there is another small spot between the band and the hat itself; it has run down one sixteenth of an inch; it is perceptible, and when I moved it, I noticed that it was a little under the band also—the spots would pass unnoticed unless you were look<lb></lb>ing for such things, which we were—it was not so large as those circular marks which are here now—I rather think there was a fourth found by Dr. Letheby, but I did not hear his evidence—J don't see it—the hat has been pulled about and knocked about a good deal since—it had not then the rough appearance it has now.</p>

               <p>had them—there only appears to have been one piece out from this leg—they have been in Mulvany's possession—these four spaces are cut from the left leg, and one from the bottom of the right—they were cut by Dr. Letheby—I believe no mark was found on the coat—Mulvany then asked for the shirt which he wore that night—he left the room, and said he could not find it, he thought it had been sent to the wash—Mulvany then asked him to go again and endeavour to find it—he left the room, and on the stairs, just outside the door, he called a female, and after the lapse of a minute and a half or two minutes, he returned and produced a shirt, which was handed to Mulvany, who examined it—I believe this to be it—a portion was cut out of it, and there is no mark remaining, except dirt on the left wristband—the mark was on the right wristband—it was a stain apparently of blood, rather more than an inch long, and I think, perhaps, extending three-quarters of an inch in breadth; at one portion it has gone through both folds, in fact there appeared to be three folds, it was through the thickness of the wristband—Mulvany said "There is some blood here, can you account for that?"—I rose up to look at it—Mulvany passed the shirt to me, and I said "Yes, there is blood"—the prisoner said "I can only account for it by this scratch on my wrist,'* showing me a scratch about an inch in length, on the inside of his left wrist—I had the shirt in my hand at the time, and said "But the scratch is on the left wrist, and the blood is on the right wristband"—he made no reply to that—Mulvany looked at me and said he thought there was sufficient to take him in custody—I said "Yes, there is blood on his things"—Mulvany said "I must take you in custody on the suspicion of causing the death, or being the murderer of, this young woman"—he said "Very well, I shall go anywhere you like with you"—Mulvany took possession of the coat and shirt—the father kept asserting his son's innocence, and the son asserted his innocence, and said he knew nothing of the girl, that she was nothing to him, and it was ridiculous to assert such a thing; be never thought a bit of her, and never sweet hearted with her or anyone like her—the articles were packed up in a parcel—Mulvany took him to the station, and I followed a short distance behind—I booked the charge at the station, and after it was entered, he was placed in a room till trowsers were brought from his house—these were taken off about an hour or more afterwards—the father's house is a quarter of an hour's walk, and a messenger had to be sent there and return with them, it would be about an hour before he reached the station—the prisoner asked me, that afternoon, if he might write a letter—I said that he might, but it would be read before it was sent away—he made no objection to that—he was furnished with pen and paper, and he wrote this letter—I read it—I after<lb></lb>wards saw him searched, and this other letter was found in his purse—he asked that the letter he wrote might be posted, so as to go out by the last post at night, about 9 or a little before—I handed it to the inspector, and asked him to comply with his request, which was done—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi> "Sunny bridge, March 20, 1871. My dear Edmund. I scarcely know what to say to you, it is such a difficult matter to get at the interior of a lady's heart; and, in Louisa's case, still more so. She is not, as you know, ex<lb></lb>tremely demonstrative upon any subject, and when you question her, she seems inclined, to use very refined language, "to shut up." The only advice I can give you now is to wait until you see her, and ask for yourself. If she should say no, I daresay you would survive the shook; because you must feel as I do, that she is uncertain. If she were left to herself, perhaps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100106"></xptr>
               <p>she would say yes; but while Alithea is single, they seem to cling together. I don't think she would like Louisa to be married before her. You are young, and can afford to wait until another opportunity offers. I told her if she was not inclined, there were others who would be if asked; so she was prepared, and will have time to think it over; she can please herself. As to your having a rival, no such thing at present at Lyonshall. Make your mind easy, therefore; it is no great matter which way it turns. Gentlemen can always get a wife, it is a very difficult thing with a woman. Mr. Norris, for instance. Alithea refused him; he is now married to a pretty, lady-like wife, and very happy. So, as I before said, wait your opportunity and take courage. Believe me, as ever, dear Edmund, your affectionate aunt. How is poor mother's health. Uncle's love. No more time.") This is the letter he wrote: (" Dear Alice. I am sorry I could not meet you last night as I wished; but I have been arrested on the charge of the murder of that girl at Eltham. Now it is almost too ridiculous, but still they have some circumstantial evidence, I presume, or they would not have taken so serious a step; but, of course, I shall come out all right, at least I believe so. I am writing from the police-station in Blackheath Road, and, between you and I, the idea is not pleasant, as I am not used to have the key turned on me. I shall be able to prove a complete <hi rend="italic">alibi,</hi> so that I have no fear for the future. You will see the report of the case in the papers on Wednesday morning; and if I am discharged, as I expect I shall be, I will keep the appointment I have made for Wednesday night; but if remanded, of course I must grin and bear it. Believe me, yours as ever, E. W. Pook. P.S.—Do not talk to many persons about this affair, as there is no honor attached to it. You must excuse the writing, as I am rather flurried.")—On the day after he was taken to the station his boots were taken off—they had been polished and cleaned—he said he had worn them all the week—on 16th May, after leaving the inquest room, I purchased two hammers at Mrs. Thomas's—the last two they had in stock, as they said at the Inquest—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one is a No. 2 and the other a No. 3—they have no strings—I particularly asked for the strings, and Mrs. Thomas reached a string out of the window and gave it to me, which she said had fallen off one of the hammers—I marked them in pencil at the time, and put a paper on afterwards.</p>

I was not in Court when Mulvany was Cross-examined—it is true that the prisoner repeatedly denied, in Mulvany's presence, that Jane Clousen was anything to him, or that there was any intimacy whatever between them; but the father denied it more—the prisoner repeatedly denied that she was anything to him, or that there was any intimacy between them—when I put that expression upon him, that he was to meet her at Groom's Hill, I do not remember his saying "It is not true"—I will not swear he did not, because his father, and he, and me, and Mulvany, five or six of us, were all talking—he may have done so—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at his deposition</hi>) it is evident that I said, before the Magistrate, that he said "It is not true," but I have forgotten it now—I have no doubt he did say it, now that I see it on my deposition.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that he made no answer; when you were before the Magistrate, did not you say "I don't think he made any answer?' <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did, and that was my opinion now, until this was shown to me; my impression now is that he did, and that when the matter was new in my mind I gave the correct answer, and that he did deny it—that would be consistent with what he said all through, that there was no intimacy of any sort between him and the girl—when he was speaking about his being about the town on Monday night, he said "principally with his brother"—I mentioned to-day about his not being away from home more than fifteen or twenty minutes—if the Coroner has not put down "between fifteen or twenty minutes," it is most likely he did not put down all I said—I believe I mentioned fifteen or twenty minutes before the Coroner, but he may not have put down the minutes—I cannot swear to what I said six weeks ago, but I have my belief that I mentioned fifteen or twenty minutes before the Coroner—my evidence was read over to me, and I signed it—I did not get a copy of it—what was printed in the newspapers was very different to what was given; many things were left out—I believe I stated it to the Coroner, though it was not written down—when he was asked as to when he had seen Jane Clousen last, he said "I have not seen her since the Thursday she left"—he directly recalled his words, and said "Yes, I did though; I saw her in the town, talking to a young <hi rend="italic">gent.,</hi> and I came home, and mentioned it"—he said a word or two aside to his father, but it was almost in the same breath, almost immediately—I have left out a small portion of my evidence; I could not remember it all; the conversation extended over an hour, and I was not twenty minutes giving my evidence—I can tell you now—when he was asked if he saw anybody who he knew, or who knew him, he said "By-the-bye, I saw our boy delivering a parcel"—that was in Mulvany's presence, but it was aside to his father and brother—he mentioned where, but I did not hear it—the room was large, and he spoke it aside—I heard him say "I saw our boy delivering goods," and to his father and brother he mentioned the name where he delivered them, but I did not hear it—when I asked him, "Did anyone see you at Lewisham who can prove you were there f' he said "No, I waited near the Plough, but I do not recollect that I saw anybody who knew me, or who I knew to prove I was there; by-the-bye, I saw our boy delivering a parcel," and he said at or to some name, which I did not catch—the Plough adjoins Lewisham Bridge, there is a pathway between the premises and the railway—the prisoner said he was innocent; he denied everything, and I have no doubt he denied going to meet the girl at Prince Arthur's—he denied everything of that kind—he took his boots off himself, and they were handed to me—I cannot tell how long they were in my possession—Mulvany carried them a day or two after to Dr. Letheby—when I went to the prisoner's father's house, nothing was kept back, every facility was given to me—we asked to see his room, and it was shown to us—it was the right wristband of the shirt that was marked—I said that his placing his hands one across the other would account for the mark of the blood, but I answered hastily; I found after that it would not—I was not asked if the left wrist was put over the right—I have no doubt I said before the Magistrate, "From the position the prisoner is now standing in, with his wrists across, the blood from the left wrist may have got on to the right wristband of his shirt"—those are the solicitor's words—I swore to them, and signed it—I wish to say that it was an accidental matter; the solicitor called my attention</p>

               <p>to it, but he stood with his right wrist crossed over his left, and not his left over the right, and it could not in that case—the wound was on his left wrist, and the blood was on the right wristband; but if it had been reversed, it would have been correct; that is all the difference—I made the remark that he would have bad to put the wound on the right wrist, but he happened accidentally in the Court to do the reverse, and I answered too quickly, without noticing how he stood; but it comes to the same thing, if the wrist which was scratched had been put over the other wrist, it might have produced the blood on the sleeve—the question was put to me very impulsively, and I answered as impulsively—there is a locket in the posses<lb></lb>sion of the police—I did not get it myself—I did not go to Randall's; Sergeant Haynes went there—I did not go to Humphreys'—Humphreys told me he had bought the locket at Randall's, and given it to the deceased—I sent Sergeant Haynes with him to Randall's.</p>

               <p>Deptford—on Monday evening, 24th April, I was standing at the door, on the step close to the window—I saw the prisoner—he came down the street from the direction of the railway, that is from the Greenwich way—I could not say exactly about the time, it was near about 8.30, to the best of my recollection—he asked me if I had a small axe of any kind; he told me he wanted it for some performance on the platform or stage, I would not be positive which word he used—I said I thought I had; with that we entered the shop—I went in and he followed me into the shop—I looked round the shelves where we used to hang them, we did not keep a large stock of those articles; I could not see one, and I asked my wife if we were out of the article—my wife was just inside the sitting-room door, or the door way, there is no door—she said she thought we had not got one—she came behind the counter from the sitting-room, opened a drawer and took out a cook's chopper, held it up and asked the prisoner if that would do; she stated the price, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it was marked on the handle—the prisoner said that would not do, it was too expensive, and he did not want an article of that description—I could not say the exact words he made use of, but words to that effect; he immediately left the shop—I followed him to the door, I directed him to Mr. Thomas's, the tool shop further down the street, on the opposite side of the way—I told him that Mr. Thomas's, was a tool shop, and he sold every description of tool, and I had no doubt he would get the article he wanted there—I don't remember the exact words—it was my practice to send persons to Thomas's shop for tools that I did not sell—I can see Thomas's shop from my door—I pointed to the shop, there was a large cheesemonger's, lit up, just before, and I believe I mentioned the place next door to the lights, or next but one—the cheesemonger's was all lit up—the prisoner left and went in that direction—the gas at my shop was alight—I have two exterior burners at the window, and inside one light over my head, throwing a light forward within about 3 or 4ft. from the edge of the window—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the police-station in the yard, I forget the date, it was one Friday in May, there were other per<lb></lb>sons there, I should say about a dozen—I was asked if I had seen any of those persons, and I picked out the prisoner as the man that came—I have no doubt whatever of his being the person—on that night he had on a round hat, one of those black soft crowned hats that you can push any where, and a black coat, or a dark one, I could not say—I have a reason for fixing the night as Monday, the 24th—one reason was that my daughter had gone to pay my son's club money, and the other reason is that Messrs. Price &amp; Dunn's traveller, Mr. Warr, called on the next day, which was Tuesday—he calls every alternate Tuesday, and he came the next day—my wife is here—my son was in the shop at the time the prisoner was there, and my errand boy, Renneson, was at the door.</p>

My shop is on the left hand side as you go up High Street, passing under the railway bridge, about twenty doors up be<lb></lb>yond the bridge—Thomas's shop is further down on the opposite side of the way, further from the railway bridge, going up High Street—I think it is about 50 yards from the railway bridge to my shop, and it is about 60 or 70 yards from my shop to Thomas's—my shop is nearer the railway than Thomas's—I went to the police-station to identify the prisoner on the Friday of the examination at the Police Court—I don't recollect the date, I should think it was about a fortnight after he came to my shop—that was on Monday evening, 24th April—I never took any account of the date that I went to</p>

               <p>the station to identify him—I know it was on a Friday—I expect it was the 12th May—I don't say for certain that it was that date—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—I saw a picture of him in the <hi rend="italic">Police News</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at one</hi>)—I could not say whether this was the one, I don't think it is—I will not undertake to say it is not—I saw the picture in the <hi rend="italic">Police News</hi> previous to my identifying him—I believe it was in the week previous, I could not say—I saw two, one previous to identifying him, and one afterwards, I can't say which that was—I believe it was the second one—(<hi rend="italic">Two were produced</hi>)—I would not swear it—I said before the Magistrate that I saw the prisoner on Monday evening, 24th April—I might have said "I believe I saw the prisoner on that evening," perhaps so—I could not say that I mentioned those words—what I said was written down and read over to me, and I signed it—that was what I said that "I believed I saw him"—my wife was not in the shop the whole time, not when he first came in—she came into the shop as soon as he came in, and she was there all the time—I believe she does not identify the prisoner—but she has not seen him—she has never been brought before him—I believe she has not identified him—she has not identified him, of course—she says she cannot identify him, she never distinctly saw his face—she came into the shop, went behind the counter and took out the chopper—the prisoner did not come near the counter, not nearer than I am to his Lordship—the shop boy was out against the door—my son was in the shop—it was 8.30 as near as I can recollect—I believe it to be 8.30 as near as possible—I could not say which side of the half hour it was; it might have been before the half hour or a few minutes after, within the scope of five minutes either way—that I swear to, I am positive—I was asked about his trowsers before the Magistrate, I said my impression was that he had light trowsers; that was my impression—my impression was not as strong about the trowsers as it was about the coat and waistcoat—they never asked me about the waist-coat—I never mentioned about the waistcoat—it was not as strong about the trowsers as it was about the coat and hat—I mean to say that I said nothing about the waistcoat—I did say about the waistcoat, but you have not asked me about it—my impression was not as strong about the waist-coat as it was about the coat—I did say before the Magistrate "My im<lb></lb>pression is that the man had a dark coat and light trowsers and waistcoat, but I am not positive; that is my impression"—I am positive about the coat—I am not positive about the trowsers or waistcoat—I think I said before the Cotoner "I do not recollect his voice, nor could I tell it if I beard it"—I believe that is true—I have no doubt about it—I do not recollect his voice at all—I could not say anything about his voice, I have never heard him speak since—Mr. Warr is the traveller—I could not say the time he came next day—my wife saw him, I did not—of my own know<lb></lb>ledge I don't know that he did come, I did not see him—I admit that, of course—that is correct.</p>

I remember the evening of the 24th of May, when my husband asked me some questions about a wood chopper—a young man came into the shop when he was there—my husband asked me if we had a wood chopper, and said he could not find one—we always keep them, but we had not got any at the time—I opened the drawer and showed this meat chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the young man; his back was to me—he asked the price—I told him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said it was too expensive and too clumsy—he stood about 3 yards from me, facing my husband, who was looking for the chopper at a distance from me—he did not come to the counter at all—the choppers always hung in a row at the other end of the shop—my husband had been looking for them and could not find them, and then he asked me, "Have we not got any?" and I said "No, perhaps not," and I opened the drawer and got this; but I never saw the young man's face—he never came near to look at the chopper, I suppose he might have looked sideways, he did not see the chopper—he never took it in his hand—he might have seen it—that I don't know; but he made answer and said it was too clumsy—he looked sideways, like—I saw more of his back than I did of his face—I did not know him at all—he was not a person that I had any acquaintance with—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—I should not know him again if I saw him—I know he wore a round little hat—next day Mr. Warr, the traveller came; that was his day, and I did business with him—he always comes every fortnight—I daresay I told my husband that he had been that day, when he returned home in the evening; perhaps I did and perhaps I did not—when travellers come I don't very often tell him, as I have more to do with the shop than he has—I can't say whether I did tell him on that occasion—I gave Mr. Warr an order.</p>

D'Albert—he has two or three assumed names, I believe—I had a little conversation with him—I did not catch the 7.22 train—I could have caught the 7.37 train, but I did not try for it; it did not matter whether I got down there at that time, because I knew there would be nobody there—I should think I was in Kirby's company half-an-hour, or three quarters of an hour—I parted from him at the bottom of High Street, but we met Robert Jellis before we got to the bottom of High Street—we met him opposite the Duke of Cambridge, in High Street—he joined us—we went into the Duke of Cambridge, and had a pot of <hi rend="italic">half-and-half</hi> between the three of us—after we had the beer, we went down together—Jellis had a little child with him; a little girl that could just toddle along—just this side of High Street the little child began to cry, and he said "Well, I shan't come any further with you, Walter," and he left us this side of the railway station, at Deptford—Kirby and I walked leisurely down to the bottom of High Street, opposite Hamilton street, in High Street, and when I got there I remembered that I wanted some nails, as I was outside this ironmonger's shop—my back was turned to the iron<lb></lb>monger' shop, and I said "Oh, by-the-bye, I wanted some nails"—I mean the ironmonger's shop at the bottom of High Street, which I now know as Thomas's shop—Kirby said he was going on to the Star, at Bermondsey—I bade him "Good-night," and went into the shop, and bought some nails—I can't positively say whether it was a pennyworth or twopennyworth of nails that I got—it was a small quantity—I did not know the shop before, or the people of the shop—a woman served me with the nails—I don't remember ever seeing her before—the next time I saw her was up here at the door, last Session, and I pointed her out to Mr. Mulvany—I said "Why, there is the woman that served me with the nails"—to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection I paid in coppers, but I would not be sure—I have known the prisoner by sight for some years—I have not known him to have any sort of conversation with him at all—I only knew him by sight—I only knew him by the name of Walter—there was another name that he went by but that</p>

               <p>I don't remember—I have tried to remember it, but I can't—he occasionally sang—I heard him sing once—he might sing under some other name than his own—I should think it was two years ago I first heard him sing—it is not at all an uncommon thing for young men to sing, and take another name—on the night that I have spoken about, when I parted with Kirby, and bought the nails at the shop I now know to be Thomas's, I saw the prisoner down at the bottom of High Street, coming across the road—that was on the 24th—I saw him as soon as I came out of the shop—he was coming across the road, going up the High Street, from Sparshott's shop, but it was not direct from Thomas's shop, crossing the road—he was coming from the side of High Street, on which Sparshott's shop is, crossing direct out of the door where I came out of—fie was coming down the street from the Broadway entrance to the High Street, and he came across right opposite Thomas's shop—he was coming down the street from Sparshott's shop, on the left hand side from the foot-path across—he was crossing the road when I saw him, in a slanting direction from Sparshott's shop—I would not be sure whether he nodded first or I nodded first—as near as I can remember he had a black coat and a dark pair of trowsers on—it was an ordinary coat, a sort of a frock-coat, and a dark pair of trowsers, as near as I can remember—he had one of those <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi> hats on—I think it was a soft one by the look of it, I could not say—I did not feel it—I did not take particular notice; I had no reason for taking notice—I, should think the skull part of the hat was soft—the brim was a hard substance of course; a stiff brim as near as I can remember—I have not a very distinct recollection on the subject; not the exact words, but as near as I can remember I will tell you—there was nothing whatever to lead me to take particular notice of the man's dress more than at any other time—as near as I can remember it was about 7.45 when I saw him; the gas was not alight, it was getting dusk—as near as I can remember I got to Sydenham about 8.25, or 8.30 it might have been—I caught either the 8.3 or the 8.12 train—when we nodded he asked me how I was getting on, and I said "Oh, middling"—he said "Are you still at Sydenham?"—I said "Yes"—he said "Oh, I should think you would live and die there, at Sydenham"—he said "I am just going in here, if you like to wait a minute we will have a liquor up"—those were the very words, I believe—I said that I had not time to stop, as I wanted to catch the 8.3 train; and I saw him go into the shop that I had just come out of—a van heavily laden with either flour or coals, I don't know exactly what it was, with three or four horses attached to it, caused me to stop on the edge of the pavement, prevented me from crossing, I stood there for the waggon to pass by—as the van was passing I turned round promiscuously, just a glance round, and I saw the same person who served me with the nails reaching a hammer out of the window—I went up Hamilton Street, and made my nearest way to the station, caught the train, and went on to Sydenham—that was the last I saw of him, or anything connected with him that night—there was no gas in the shop when I went in to buy the nails; it was not lighted when Walter left me to go into the shop—there was no gas alight outside the shop or in—I can positively say that I saw Mrs. Thomas reaching the hammer, at least I would not positively say that she took it right away out of the window, but I know she moved it off a brass bracket that was there—a brass thing that was standing there in the window—there was a hammer in the window, and I saw her move it—I saw handbills like this circulated about Deptford and Greenwich</p>

               <p>soon after they came out—I could not tell the day, nor exactly the time, I saw them—I noticed the date at which the matter about the hammer was spoken of in that, but I did not take much notice of it—I looked at it—it stated there on 22nd April, and I knew I was not in High Street on the 22nd—that is the fact, I was not at the bottom of High Street on the 22nd; I might have been in High Street, but not that part of it—it was on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 3rd or 4th June, I first came forward and gave information—some time after the Inquest, and some time after the investigation before the Magistrate—I saw Mrs. Thomas over the way at dinner last session, and I heard her name mentioned as Mrs. Thomas, and she was the person that I saw hand the hammer—I did not know her name at that time—I did not even know the name of the shop, because Thomas's shop was always this side of the railway arch.</p>

I was not at the Inquest—I was not in the room, that I will swear—I was not before the Magistrate, not on this case, not at any of the meetings, nor in the room—I heard of the case—I have been before a Magistrate, charged, about twice I think, as far as I can remember—twice it was, for an assault—twice I have been charged with that—only twice to my remembrance; once was for an assault upon a man who insulted my wife, and I would upon any man that insulted my wife—I was fined 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or fourteen days—I did not pay the fine, I would not pay it—I suffered the imprisonment, fourteen days—that was two or three years ago, I could not positively say—I did not get hard labour—I can't say positively to the time, nor I won't say unless I could recollect it—I don't remember—that is the only answer I can give you,—it was either two or three years ago—the other occasion was an assault—that was some little time back—I could not tell you the exact time—I was fined a sovereign then, I paid it, that was supposed to have been for an assault—the Magistrate fined me 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for a young woman breaking her parasol over my head—I did not pay it, a rela<lb></lb>tion of mine paid the money for me—a gentleman of the name of Perrin, the same as my own—I don't remember any other occasion on which I have been convicted—I will swear I don't remember any other—I won't swear</p>

I live at 2, Deptford Green—I know Mr. and Mrs. Thomas, the ironmongers, of High Street, Deptford—on 24th April I was at their shop, at 8 o'clock—I remained there about three quarters of an hour—I can fix the time, because while I was waiting there the church clock chimed a quarter past 8; that is the only thing by which I can judge the time—I was in the sitting-room, at the back of the shop, you can see from there into the shop—I purchased a pair of scissors—I was served in the sitting-room—I did not pay for them there—there was no light in the shop when I went in—only Mrs. Thomas was there then—several customers came in while I was there—I noticed a lady come in for some knives; but she did not purchase anything, and I noticed a young man come in for something, but I don't know what he purchased—I noticed that he had light trowsers on, and a dark coat, and a kind of a low round hat, of a dark colour—I could not see his face; he was standing sideways against the window—I believe Mrs. Thomas was in the room with me when he came in, and she went into the shop to serve the young man—I saw her reach something from the left-hand window; I mean the left-hand window going into the shop, and the right looking into the street from the sitting-room—she wrapped it in the brown paper, and handed it to the young man—I did not see what it was—I can't say whether that was before or after the clock chimed a quarter past 8—it was rather a small parcel—I saw the back part of it, under the young man's arm—I should think it was 18 inches long—I could see it under his left arm, as he left the shop—that is all I know of the size of the parcel—he appeared to be a tradesman, or something of that kind—he did not appear like a working man—the son, David Thomas, was in the shop when he was served by Mrs. Thomas—he is ten years old, I believe—there was no one else in the shop—I saw Mr. Thomas that night, just as I was leaving the shop; he was coming in at the front door as I was going out—the gas had been lighted before I left—it might be a little before 8.45 that I left—</p>

               <p>Mrs. Thomas lit the gas before Mr. Thomas came in—I can say it was 8.45, because I had to post a letter to go to Constantinople by 8.45, and I left in time, to post the letter—as near as I can remember, it was between 8 and 8.30 when the young man was served with the parcel—I should not know him again.</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Thomas, who keeps a shop of tools and cutlery, at 168, High Street, Deptford—it is on the opposite side of the way to Mr. Sparshott's shop-shortly before the end of April we had kept a shop on the other side of the railway bridge, and had removed to this one—amongst other tools and cutlery, we kept in stock plasterer's lath hammers—I have seen the article produced, in this case—I sold several dozens of them—we had such hammers as this in stock on 24th April—this would be a number 2 hammer—I have got my books here—up to the 15th April, I find we had three number 2, and three number 3 in stock—I had not sold any from November till April—one of the number 3 was sold on 15th April—there is an entry of it in my own handwriting—I have since found out that that was sold to a person of the name of Whitter—at the time of the Inquest I had two remaining of the No. 3—I have sold one since, and have given one up to the police—as to the No. 2 hammers, I find that one was sold on Saturday, 22nd April; that entry is also in my handwriting—I have since found that it was sold to a young boy of the name of Elliot—one of the remaining "No. 2 has been given up to the police since these proceedings, and the other was sold on the 24th, according to my books—I don't recollect anything particular about the 24th—I am more often in the shop than my husband—Miss Cavell was in the shop that night, and I sold her a pair of scissors—that is entered in the book in my writing; this is the entry: "One pair of scissors, Miss Cavell, unpaid, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the "un" was scratched out after the account was settled—you will find other entries the same—the last entries are "Lath hammer, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; turning for table leg, 2; one pair of scissors, Miss Cavell; nails, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" and so on—I have no doubt, looking at that entry, that I sold a lath hammer to some<lb></lb>one, or that day, but I can't tell who to—I am certain I sold it to some<lb></lb>one, or else it would not be in ray book—I have not the slightest recollection to whom I sold it; we have sold eleven hammers since that date, and only two we can account for, and those are two that Superintendent Griffin had—we have had a fresh stock since then—the hammers were kept in the left-hand side window going in; the right-hand side window is kept for cutlery—sometimes the hammers have a string, and sometimes not—if they are hung up in the window they have a string—the string is used for hang<lb></lb>ing them up.</p>

The man and woman I first saw were before us, going in the same direction that we were going—we passed them and left them behind—they were in the footpath then—I know Max<lb></lb>well's Farm—there is one brook there, and another further on—I spoke of the brook down the lane after you had passed Kidbrook Green—it was before we passed that, that we passed the young man and woman in the field—that is not on the Elthnm side of Kidbrook Green, but on the Kidbrook side—we had not got to the lane—we had got to Maxwell's Farm in that last field—there is a water brook going across that field—the place where we passed them is between Maxwell's Farm and Kidbrook Green; before we came to Kidbrook Green and after we had passed Maxwell's Farm—it was about 100 yards after we got over the brook, that we saw the young man running—I don't know how far that was from where we passed the young man and woman, I have not measured it—when we heard the screams we had crossed the brook and got into the footpath—we heard the screams two or three minutes before I saw the young man—I was examined before the Magistrate and Coroner—I told the Coroner, that, from the screams, I thought it was a young man and woman larking; I said it was more in fun—before the Magistrate, I said "I do now say that the screams I heard, were those of some one larking"—what I say now is, that the screams or cries conveyed to my mind the notion of a person in fun, and not in pain or anguish—it was just getting dusk at the time—I saw the man running by—I being in the field and he in the lane—we walked on the footpath, in the direction from which I heard the screams, and nothing attracted my attention till I got to Eltham, which is close to a mile, I should say, from the brook across the fields—Mill Hall Lane comes out <hi rend="italic">again</hi> Dr. King's, at the other side of the church—we walked on at the usual pace—it was when we got into the last field, before we came to Eltham, that I heard Eltham clock strike 9 o'clock—I was one of the first witnesses examined at the Police-Court—I saw the prisoner, and could not identify him as the person I saw in the lane—I can't say whether the man who passed us in the lane, running, had anything in his hand.</p>

I am single, and live at Jubilee Cottage, High Street, Eltham—on 25th April, I was walking with the last witness, in a field near Kidbrook Lane, about 8.30—we crossed the brook into the fields and along the footpath—when we were across the brook we heard screams, which appeared as if they were in the Woolwich Road; about five minutes after that we saw a young man run past us in the lane towards Morden College, very fast—he appeared out of breath—he was dressed in dark clothes, with a low hat—I did not see his face—I went on with Norton towards Eltham, and parted company with him there just before 9 o'clock—I think the screams were like lover's play.</p>

I am a gas fitter, of 2, Kidbrook Road, Shooter's Hill—on the evening of 25th April, I was coming from Eltham to my own house; that led me through Kidbrook Lane—I kept the footpath, which is not in the lane, but is in the same direction—I went up the lane for a little way, and then went on to the footpath—they are separated by a hedge—you have to come along some part of the lane first, and then get into the footpath, and then into the lane again—when I had gone some way along Kidbrook Lane, I came to the footpath, and followed it till I came to the lane again—while I was in the footpath, I saw a young man and woman in the lane, about 200 yards or 300 yards the Eltham side of the brook—the footpath there in some portions of its course is higher than the lane—you look through the hedge if you want to look down into the lane—the young woman had got her back to the hedge, and the young man, as far as I could see, was standing in front of her—I came up nearly opposite to where they were, and could see pretty plainly that there were two persons there—at the time I got to an open gap in the hedge, they got out into the middle of the lane, and the young woman wanted to turn towards Morden College, Blackheath, and I heard her say "Let me go, let me go" or "Let us go, let us go;" and I thought she mentioned the name of <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>—the young man took hold of her shoulder, and they went towards Eltham—I saw them go about two yards, then turned round and came on home—my path at first led me towards Morden College, and as I was going along I met William Norton and Miss Putnam going towards Eltham—I did not know them before, but having seen them since, I know they are the two per sons I met—I did not know the other two persons at all—he had a dark frock coat and a <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi> hat, his height was about 5ft. 6 in. or 7 in.—the young woman was much shorter; I should think about 5ft 3 in., middling stout; not very stout, and not over thin—she wore a dark frock, a dark jacket, and a light petticoat, but the petticoat did not look white, and a hat or bonnet, I am not sure which—between fifteen and twenty persons were shown me in a row at Greenwich Police Court, and I picked out the young man by his back—I did not see his face in the lane—he is the same height and same appearance in every respect, but I do not speak to his face—I</p>

I had been down to my father's, at 2, Straightsmouth, Greenwich, at the back of the church, which is at the back of London Street—I was not near Royal Hill, or anywhere in that direction, nor at Lewisham—I said before the Coroner, that the woman was calling out "Let me go," or "Let us go," and I did not catch the other word, but thought it was <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>—I thought she addressed the man by the Christain name of <hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> and I think so now—I picked the man out by his back—I did not see his face—I did not speak to Norton or Putnam—I passed close to them—I did not know them—they were not in the footpath, but in the lane; that I am sure of—I swear it—I saw them between the brook and Walker's cottage—I walked on; nobody overtook me—I was walking at about three miles and a half an hour—I heard no screams—I was alone—I had come from Pope Street, Eltham—I went up Millhall Lane, and across the fields into Kidbrook—I saw the back of the young man some 200 yards or 300 yards from the brook, towards Eltham—as you go from Millhall Lane, you come into Eltham Lane, either across the fields or through the lanes—I went through the lanes; I did not go by the footpath—I went up Kidbrook Lane a little way, and then came out and walked on the footpath, not right across the fields—when I saw them first, as far as I can say, the young woman had got her back towards the hedge, and he was in front of her—they were on the side of the lane nearest to me—his back was towards me—I did not see his hands, because the hedge would prevent that—when I got to the gap, I could see his hands—he had nothing in them—this was about 8.45; I feel certain—I have the means of fixing it—I picked out the prisoner—I never saw his features.</p>

I am a clerk in the department of the Solicitor of the Treasury—I had this whistle in my possession about half an hour—I received it from Inspector Mulvany for the purpose of taking Miss Durnford's statement—I used it in the course of taking her statement—that is the only time it was in my hands—that was the first time I was aware of its existence, on 18th May—after I had taken her examination, I immediately returned it to Mulvany—the Treasury did not take this case up for some time after the first inquiry before the Coroner—it was not till the 6th or 7th of May that the Solicitor to the Treasury received instruc<lb></lb>tions from the Home Office—after I received instructions, it was produced at the next examination.</p>

               <p>—I think Mulvany came to me first, and Griffin afterwards—I should not see them till 5th May, I think—I was in communication with the Police from the 5th to the 18th—I think there was only one meeting before the Magistrate between those dates, and that was on the day I first saw Mulvany—we were very busy—we went down to Greenwich Police Court with Mr. Poland, and a remand for a fortnight took place—I don't think we attended before the Magistrate on the 10th—I think there was a remand from the 6th for a fortnight—there was a very long remand, I know—I don't think there was a meeting on the 13th; but I would not say there was not, without referring to papers—I don't know when the meetings of the Inquest were—I did not attend them—I heard nothing of the whistle from the 5th to the 18th—the evidence was not given before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sussex Place, Regent's Park—I am a bachelor of medicine and professor of chemistry—I have made the subject of blood and blood stains a matter of special inquiry—on Wednesday, 3rd May, I received from Inspector Mulvany a paper parcel, containing a pair of dark-coloured trowsers, nearly or quite black, a shirt, and a wide-awake hat—on the following evening Mr. Mulvany came again to me, and on that occasion I received from him a lock of hair in brown paper, a pair of men's boots, and a plasterer's hammer wrapped in brown paper, the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi> of a woman, and a clothes-brush—I kept the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi> and the lock of hair, and the other matters I returned to Mulvany the following evening, after I had made an investigation—I found on the trowsers, a little above the left knee, on the inner side, a human hair 71/2 inches long, and there it is (<hi rend="italic">produc<lb></lb>ing it</hi>)—I have put it between glass—it was on the outside of the trowsers, on the cloth—I compared that hair with the lock of hair that I received from Mulvany—I am certain that it could not have got from the parcel to the trowsers after I had them, because the parcel was opened afterwards—I did certainly open it on the evening Mulvany brought it, but I don't think it likely that anything could have fallen out of it then, because it was on a different occasion; one evening the trowsers were brought, and next even<lb></lb>ing the lock of hair was brought: they were not together until I took the hair off, and then I examined it in comparison with the other—the hair was very closely attached to the trowsers, as it were felted into it—it was exactly the same colour as the lock of hair, and under the microscope exactly the same structure; there is a little difference in the structure of hair—I examined the trowsers carefully, and I found at the bottom, and on the front part of the left leg, several spots; I think I cut out seven, and here they are—there are some remains here of spots, even at the parts where I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100142"></xptr>
               <p>cut them; there is enough remaining about the spots, if there is any necessity for further examination—I cannot express any opinion about them—anything I thought it worth while to experiment upon I cut out, but we make it a rule in all our investigations not to destroy the material in such a way that no one else could have a further investigation if necessary—here is nearly half-an-inch remaining of this spot—here are two large spots, pointed out by the Jury, I don't think I could speak to that till I examined it—that one on the right leg I did not find to be blood—the larger spots on the back of the left leg, pointed out by the Jury, are the remnants of another spot which I found not to be blood; I could not recognize that as blood; one can hardly discover a negative; I did not recognize it as blood—when I test things, I ascertain whether they are blood or not—from the test I applied I did not find them to be blood, then you conclude, I suppose, that they are not blood, but I don't go quite so for as that, for the stain was so slight that I don't speak positively about it; but I don't think it was blood—there are seven spots which I have pointed out; I think on careful scrutiny you will find more, quite enough to test my investigations, if anybody is so disposed—I submitted the seven spots that I cut out to microscopical examination, and chemical experi<lb></lb>ments, and in my judgment they were blood stains—it is not safe to swear to the distinction between human and animal blood; I should not like to do so; I do not know any distinction, when we have small quantities like that to experiment with—I can't say whether it is animal or human, all I can say is, that it is blood—old blood gradually gets less and less soluble in water, until after exposure for some week or fortnight or so, it becomes insoluble in water; this was soluble in water; from which I judge that it was not Tery old blood.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After that time would the blood not be soluble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would entirely depend upon the condition of the atmosphere to which it is exposed; the insolubility is due entirely to the action of weak acids floating in the atmosphere—as well as my recollection goes, it loses its solubility in most cases in about a fortnight.</p>

SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Under the most favourable conditions of the atmosphere? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think precisely so—I had also a shirt sub<lb></lb>mitted to me; I found on the edge of the upper part of the right wristband six very small-spots, one had gone through—when I unwrapped it, that had every appearance of blood, here it is; I have cut out the spot, and I ascer<lb></lb>tained that that was blood; that was soluble—this hat was also submitted to me; I found three spots on the brim and one on the edge of the band; I examined them, they were spots of coagulated blood; I have marked with a pencil where I cut them from—there was a very great difference in the appearance of the spots on the trowsers and those on the hat; the clot was very different to the other—on the hat blood had fallen, and had coagulated there; it had not been in any way removed, but on the trowsers there was no coagulum as if the blood had remained untouched, but it had evidently been submitted to some process, whereby it had been to a large extent removed—the surface of the trowsers appeared to have had something passed over it; the bleeding did not remain for the blood to coagulate, whereas it did on the hat—I examined the boots also, there was nothing on them—this plasterer's hammer was also submitted to me; in the first place it was somewhat rusty on the surface, as if there had been wet on it, and in the next place I noticed at the top of the wood, on each side, red</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100143"></xptr>
               <p>spots, one of which I cut out, and found it to be blood—this is what I mean by the reddish stain (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>), it is not deep—this is where I cut the piece out; it was similar to this, only the piece I cut out was a little larger, I think—there is a sort of notch at one end, and standing up from it there was at that time some dirt, and there stood up from it three small hairs, varying in length—one I think was about one-eighth of an inch, and the other, the longest, was half an inch—I placed them between glass, and pro<lb></lb>duce them—I could not tell from the look of them whether they were broken hairs; I can't positively say, it is a very difficult thing—I made a large number of experiments whether you could judge as to a out or a broken hair, and I don't think you could—on the other side I placed some pieces of hair which Mulvany gave me—I compared the pieces of hair that I took from the end of the hammer with the lock of hair that was given me; they seemed to me to be the same colour and general appearance, and the same structure—I found some blood on the blade, in this notch—I scraped from the notch on each side of it a little clot, one of which I have examined, the other is there—the one I examined I found to be blood, and that I produce—I also examined a brush and a coat; I found no blood on either—that was all that I examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found nothing on the boots, the coat, or the brush—the single hair I have said was an ordinary brown hair—I could not tell whether it was the hair of a male or a female, except by the length—I could not form any opinion about it—I don't think I ever said that the single hair, the five pieces of hair, and the lock of hair, were, in my opinion, from the same person—I said they were alike, but that I could not say they were from the same person; I could not venture to do so—if it has been taken down so, I could not ever venture to say they were from the same person—there are certain points of similarity which might occur in 5,000 persons—the two or three smears at the back of the right leg, pointed out by the Jury, correspond with some that, in my opinion, were not blood—it would be impossible to say they were from the same person, or to express any opinion about it—I cut out part, and, in some cases, I daresay I cut all out—I said before the Magistrate "I can't say whether it is human blood or not, no one can say that; I can only say that it is the blood of a vertebrated animal, whether of a man or a mammal, I could not tell; they are certainly not old stains, it is the property of old blood to become insoluble in water; I should not like too much importance to be attached to this"—I said it would always be dependent upon the condition of the atmosphere—I also said "It is a mere opinion, but founded upon eiperience the acidity of the atmosphere in London has a tendency to change it into the insoluble form"—I give a certain amount of respect to Dr Taylor's book on <hi rend="italic">Medical Jurisprudence</hi>; at page 444, he says "After a period of five or six days it is scarcely possible to determine, from the appearance, the date of a stain even conjecturally; indeed it is extremely difficult in any case, after the lapse of a week, to give any opinion as to the actual date of the stain," that is so—I think that has no reference to a chemical examination, I think it is merely as to the appearance; the con<lb></lb>dition of the atmosphere being tolerably pure in one place, and acid in another it makes a difference—in one state of the atmosphere, for instance, in London, it might become insoluble sooner than it would in the country; and in one state of the atmosphere it might be insoluble in a short time; in another, it would remain soluble for a longer time—without taking the</p>

               <p>state of the atmosphere, you could not very well say the date of the stain; I say again, I have had a large experience, and my general observation is that it slowly undergoes change; but I cannot pretend to tell what time might elapse; I would not confine it to a week or a fortnight—I only know when it is soluble in water, as a rule, it is a sign of recent blood, whether a week, a fortnight, or a month, I could not say, unless I knew exactly the condition of the atmosphere to which it was subjected—I am referring to my own book, upon <hi rend="italic">Spectrum Analysis,</hi> to see if I had not put down here about the times—I could not tell the date of these stains, I don't profess to do so—I could not fix any time at which the blood might have got upon the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, and carry on the business of a stationer, in London Street, Greenwich—the prisoner is twenty years of age—before I took my business as a stationer, I was employed upon the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper for twenty-three years—I have been in business as a stationer in Greenwich ten years—my son lived at home as a member of the family—he was always a very quiet, well-conducted young man—there is no truth whatever that there was any intimacy between him and my late servant, the deceased girl—she had left my service on 11th April—we had given her notice on two or three occasions, and she had asked to stay—on the last occasion she seemed doubtful whether she should go or stay, but at last she left—she was very untidy—she left in consequence of the com<lb></lb>plaints—she was not fit to be seen, and I used to complain about her to my wife repeatedly—she would never clean herself, so much so that I would go to the door in order that she should not be seen, but we believed her to be strictly honest—I remember Mr. Mulvany and Superintendent Griffin calling on me on 1st May—the conversation with them lasted one hour and five minutes altogether, from first to last—they had full opportunity of examining all the clothes, and the prisoner's bedroom; every facility was given—my son was called up, and he came—I had been acquainted with Superintendent Griffin some time—when my son came into the room, he said "Good morning, Mr. Griffin, I know you," with a smile—it was said in a joking manner—he was laughing, in fact, he had just left the dinner table, where they were laughing and talking; I could hear them up stairs—he was not aware of why he was sent for, that I know of—I did not leave the room, I only called him—at that time no one knew what Mulvany and Griffin came for but me—I won't be certain whether he shook hands with Griffin, at all events he nodded to him—yes, I remember he did shake hands—my younger son, Thomas Pook, was sent for at the instance of the prisoner—Mulvany said "I am told that your son has been on terms of intimacy with this girl, he has corresponded with her and he said, tapping his hand, "There is a letter in her handwriting, and he has also given her a locket; and a servant of a near neighbour of yours was intimate with your servant, your son was intimate with both of them, and did as he liked with them;" all of which is totally false, and I told Mulvany so—I told him it was ridiculous and false, and that he was a different sort of boy altogether—I also said that, being subject to fits, we constantly watched him about the house, and in fact, if he was in his bedroom a minute longer than we thought he should be, we always went to see if anything was the matter or not, on every occasion—at that time my eldest son was staying with me, and had been two or three weeks—he is a married man, and his wife was absent in the</p>

W. Pook"—they were token in by Coutts and given to my brother—he only sang once, that was in the name of Edmund Walters—the letters were from other artistes—he did not sing at concerts; only once at the Lecture Hall and once at Tottenham—he and I hired the Lecture Hall between us for eight Saturday evenings, and that was his professional name, Edmund Walters, and mine was Thomas Birch—he did not sing at all—we engaged artistes to sing at the concerts, and they sent their letters to the Lecture Hall, directed to Edmund Walters—I was present on one or two occasions when Coutts handed letters to my brother, directed to Edmund Walters—the engagement at the Lecture Hall was not running at the time of the murder; but we were receiving letters from different parts of the country, at the Lecture Hall, within a month or so of April 25th—I don't know whether he received letters in that name after that—I did not see them in his hands, so late as the Saturday before; Mr. Coutts would know—my brother shaved off his moustache—that was not for the purpose of singing; it was a piece of joking between ourselves—he shaved it on the Saturday night before the murder, 22nd April—he had no moustache at all; you could scarcely see it—I have never seen the Thomas's in my life—I am sure my brother had no acquaintance with them—I did not know their shop, and don't know now the exact position in which it stands—my brother was home soon after 9 o'clock on the night of the murder—there was nothing in his</p>

I had seen him before, but not full-faced—I did not know he was paying his addresses to Miss Durnford—I saw him about there, ten or twelve minutes—I was sitting at the window, while the kettle boiled, waiting for my tea—he must have moved, because Mr. Eagle saw him about 20 feet from where I did, but he was motionless while I saw him, leaning against the rails by the tree, for ten or twelve minutes—no one was with him, male or female—I had nothing else to take my attention, and I thought he was the same person I had seen before, making a noise with a whistle, when I thought he was calling a dog—they bring dogs there, and get them into the water—he did not whistle on that night—when I returned from my tea, he had gone, as far as I could see—I was first asked about having seen him last Sunday, by Mr. Pook, the attorney, but Mr. Eagle told me I should have to attend on Sunday, as Mr. Pook was not at home on Monday—Mr. Eagle and I have not been talking about it—how I had to attend Mr. Pook's is rather a mystery to me.</p>

I am a baker and pastrycook, and live next door to Mr. Sparshott—I had a conversation with him—I can't say that it was the day after Pook was taken into custody; I can't state the day; it was after he was taken into custody; within a few days—we were speaking about the murder—he informed me that a person had called at his shop to purchase a hammer, he had not the article to suit him, he was under the impression that it was for some theatrical purpose or something of the kind, and he directed him to Mr. Thomas's across the road, and he told me that he should not be able to recognize the man again—we had some little con<lb></lb>versation about it after that, and be repeated it three or four times that he could not recognize the man—he said to the best of his belief he thought the man had light clothes on; he said he could not swear to him—I told Mr. Pook of this conversation last night, in consequence of seeing the thing in the paper—I read Sparshott's evidence in the paper, and I felt it neces<lb></lb>sary to go to Mr. Pook, the solicitor, because I thought they were two versions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. I was aware that Mr. Spar<lb></lb>shott had been before the Coroner, and before the Magistrate—I saw his evidence there—that was some weeks or months ago—I do not know young Pook, I never saw him before—Mr. Sparshott did not ask me any<lb></lb>thing about his age, that I am aware of—I don't believe he did; I have no recollection of it—I swear he did not—I believe, in conversation, I said the report was that he looked older than he was—I had never seen him—I can't recollect how that came about—I am not living next door</p>

               <p>to Mr. Sparshott now—I am now living at 1, Nelson Street, Greenwich—I was not at the Police Court, or before the Coroner; I merely read the proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My father carried on business in Nelson Street for many years, and on his death I took the business—I have not taken the business more than two months, but I was carrying it on for my mother—I men<lb></lb>tioned to many persons what Mr. Sparshott said to me, but I did not wish to have anything to do with the affair, not thinking my evidence was of sufficient value, but I felt it my duty to come and state it—he distinctly said he could not swear to the man.</p>

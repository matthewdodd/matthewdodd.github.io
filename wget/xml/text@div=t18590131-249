On the 29th December, I took the prisoner in custody at 7, Silver-street, Burton-crescent, about twenty minutes before 12 o'clock at night—I told him I was a police-officer, and I wanted him on a charge of embezzling the property of the parish of St. Pancras—he said "Yes, I knew it would come to this; I am quite ready for it," or "prepared for it"—I searched him and found on him a passport from Hamburgh, and some other papers as well—the pass-port is for Mr. Thomas Ridley.</p>

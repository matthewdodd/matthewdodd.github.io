               <p>MRS. EDWARDS. I lost my husband's watch on the 14th of September; it was on a drawer in my room. The prisoner took the watch out of the bed and put it on the drawers in the other room: I asked her where the watch was; she said on the drawers. I then asked her to look what o'clock it was; she replied, it was exactly twelve; some time after that she was walking about the room; I then had occasion to go down stairs, I gave her my young baby to nurse while I was gone; I took the other child with me of two years and a half old. On my returning back to the room, I saw the door open; the prisoner met me at the door with the infant in her arms asleep, she said the child was asleep, shall I lay it on the bed; I said, no, I will take her out of your arms in one minute; she said, as quick as you can. I want to go down stairs. I took the child, and she left the room immediately. About half an hour after she was gone I thought it very odd of her not returning, I looked on the drawers, and missed my watch. There was no one in the room after she left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a servant out of place - A. Yes.</p>

            . The prisoner I believe pawned the watch with me for thirty shillings, I am not positive; it was a woman; I cannot exactly swear to the prisoner; it was a woman something like her. This is the watch; it is a common silver watch.</p>

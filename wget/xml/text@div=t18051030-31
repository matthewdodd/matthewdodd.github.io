               <p>Q. Was it their business to carry out bread for you? - A. Yes; I serve the Foundling Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. You must confine yourself to one transaction? - A. On the 22d of October they brought up the bread as usual, and laid it on the floor while they went to put their cloaths on to go with it to the Foundling Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count the loaves - how many were there? - A. Thirty-seven, as I supposed, intended to go to the Foundling Hospital, but underneath a row of them there proved to be three white ones, which were not intended for the hospital: I knew the three white loaves would not go there; there were thirty-four proper-loaves for the hospital, and three white ones under them; it was the business of these three men to take these loaves to the hospital every morning; it was as much as they could carry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the whole thirty-seven were gone, or only thirty-four? - A. The whole thirty-seven; I remarked it when I came up stairs, which was about half an hour after they were put in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them put in the basket and taken away? - A. I did not; after they delivered the bread to the Foundling Hospital they all three came back; upon their return, Weyman brought me the book where the number of loaves is put down; he is foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that book here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who makes the entry in that book? - A. He, himself; I took the book and said, is there only thirty-four left; he made no reply, but went away down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask any questions of the other prisoners about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Weyman say that he had left more than thrity-four? - A. He did not: I was then convinced that I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 22d? - A. Yes; on the 23d they did the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot, in point of law, join these things together - did you do any thing on the 23d? - A. Yes; there were thirty-eight loaves went out on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any intelligence respecting the loaf that was missing on the 22d? - A. There was one found at the Lamb public-house, in Lamb's Conduit-street, that went out from me on the 22d, along with the three that were found on the 23d; Price and I went to the public-house on the 23d, and found four loaves; I then could distinguish the one lost on the 22d; it was a day old; I pointed it out to the Magistrate that morning at eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Are these loaves properly described in the indictment; are they not what you call brown bricks - that is the proper name in the trade? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 22d you were not present when they were placed in the shop, nor when they were taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Between that there was an interval of half an hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who serves in your shop besides yourself? -

             sworn. - I am beadle and constable of St. Andrew's: On the 23d of October I went to the Lamb public-house, Lamb's Conduit-street, just by the Foundling; I saw the two prisoners come in with their baskets and some bread in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which prisoners? - A. Weldon and Bateman; they brought some half-peck loaves in a basket; I could not tell how many; they stopped about half a minute, then they went through to an underground kitchen and had a glass of liquor, and went about their business. When they came up, they came up without the bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave them that liquor? - A. The landlord, at the bar, they paid for it all but one penny; I waited in the Lamb public-house; they did not return; then I went to the prosecutor's house; I took Weldon in the shop; I went out and took Bateman in Lamb's Conduit-street, and when I returned Weyman was in the shop; I took him; I went to the Lamb public-house again, and in the back-kitchen, on the dresser, I found four half-peck loaves covered over with an apron, three were hot and one was baked the day before; I took them to the prosecutor's house: I have had them in my care ever since; I produce them.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Lamb public-house; I know the prisoners: Mr. Pitcairn served me with a quartern loaf a day; the men brought it; they would ask me to let them leave some bread while they had time to call for it to carry to their customers; and sometimes they would call for it again in half an hour; what bread they left for me I always paid them for it; I was not at home when this bread was brought, nor when it was fetched away.</p>

            (To prosecutor.) Can you speak to that loaf which you have described to be a day old, found on the 23d - I am speaking of the bread lost on the 22d? - A. I observed there were three loaves then that were not marked with my W. and there was a roughness on the top of this bread not common for bread to have in general; it happened we had some Hertfordshire white that made it; all our other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300036"></xptr>bread was marked with a W. and my initials; when I saw the loaves that were taken at the public-house on the 23d, three of them were hot and one was a day old.</p>
               <p>Q. The three hot loaves could not be lost on the 22d? - A. No; I observed one that was made the day before; it was without any letter and it was rough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. The only way that you know the loaf was, because it was without any mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And with respect to the Hertfordshire white, other bakers use it besides yourself? - A. Very seldom they do, and very seldom that I do.</p>
               <p>Q. That you cannot tell with respect to others - can you shew us which is the loaf of the 22d? - A. I cannot undertake to swear to them now.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You only undertake to swear, from the observations that you made at the time, one of them was a loaf you lost on the 22d? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- FULCHER sworn. - I have been in the custom of using Mr. Anderson's house these ten years; I have seen two of the prisoners at the bar come in frequently and leave bread; I do not know their names; I have seen them leave them on one day and take them away the next morning.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their Counsel, and Bateman called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

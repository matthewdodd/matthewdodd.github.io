                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Britchard, confectioner, Tothill-street, Westminster. On Monday, the 3rd of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came to the shop—Hall asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of stale pastry—she gave me half-a-crown, (Grady stood close to her, and could see what was going on—they conversed together,) I felt the half-crown between my fingers, and said it was bad—she said, "I do not think it is, my husband gave it to me—he is a coal-heater"—I took a knife to cut it—a policeman was going by, I called him in, and gave Hall into custody—he took her, and another policeman took Grady.</p>

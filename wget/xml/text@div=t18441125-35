                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live in Dudley-court, Crown-street, Soho. On Wednesday evening, the 30th of Oct., I was in the Kentish-town-road, about a quarter-past six o'clock, and heard a person halloo out, "Hoy!" behind me—I turned round, and saw a woman just in front of a horse and cart—she was in the act of crossing the road—it was a tilted cart with two wheels, drawn by one horse—I saw there was a woman and a man in the cart when it came up to me—I could not see who was driving—the woman was run over by the cart—she was knocked down, I think, by the horse, or by the shaft, I. cannot say which—the cart went</p>

               <p>on, and went right over her—I could see that it knocked her down—I had got out into the middle of the road—I ran after the cart, and told them they had run over the woman, why did they not stop—they did not stop at all, but went on—they went at about the rate of eight miles an hour—I told them to stop, but they would not—I then went back to the woman—they were just in the act of the she was dead—she died in the doc<lb></lb>tor's shop—it was not a very light night, nor very dark—there were six lamps just where it happened—there are three gas-lamps belonging to the Wire's Head public-house, and three gas-lamps belonging to the street, close on the spot—it was at the parting of two roads—I should say I could see the cart twenty or thirty yards off, from the light there was, and I should say you might see a person walking twenty or thirty yards off.</p>

                  </hi>, I am single, and reside with my father, at Somers-town. I was in the cart on this evening with the two prisoners, coming along the Kentish-town road, towards London—Cloke was driving at the time of the accident—when we had passed the Wire's Head a good distance I observed a woman in the road, but it was very dark—she was crossing the road—she was quite close to the horse's head when I first saw her—Liman cried "Hoy!" three times very loud—she did not seem to hear him—it was loud enough for her to hear if she had her hearing—she was knocked down, and the cart went by, but I am not sure they were aware that it went over her—I did not feel the cart rise up after she was knocked down—it did not stop—they were not aware of the accident—they stopped first at Cumberland-market—I do not exactly know how far off that is—it is a good distance—it had gone faster that distance than it had before the accident—when we got to Cumberland-market, one of the prisoners looked out—I did not get down there—one of them said that there was no one coming after them, they were all right—I do not think they were aware the woman was run over—they knew she was knocked down, but not that the wheel went over her—I forget whether they said anything about the woman before they go to Cumberland-market—one said he was afraid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250062"></xptr>
               <p>she had been run over—the other one said he did not think she was hurt—after they had stopped a little while in Cumberland-market they went on—I went with them as far as the New-road—they did not say why they went by Cumberland-market—I do not know whether it was their straight way home—we were not going very fast before the accident.</p>

Cloke had been in my service some little, time, and had left, I think, on the Saturday previous to the accident—on the 30th of Oct. Liman was in my service—I sent him on an errand that evening, with a horse and cart, to different places, to Kentish-town, and as far as Highgate—Cloke had been my shopman, not a driver—Liman had been in the habit of going out with the same horse and cart on former occasions—he got back that evening about half-past six o'clock, or from that to seven—he did not mention that he had met with any accident—he was perfectly sober—I was not aware that Cloke was to have gone with him—it was not a very fast horse, and perfectly quiet—it is not very easy to pull up—it is rather hard in the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of driving? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Occasion<lb></lb>ally—I should not think seven or eight miles an hour a fast pace—he would go that pace—that is his pace, and you could not force him to more without getting him into a gallop—that is the best of his trot—it is very difficult to pull him up on an instant, and perhaps it would be more so if he was going towards home.</p>

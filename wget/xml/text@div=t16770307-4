The same Wednesday morning two of the Prisoners S. and J. came to a house in Knight rider street, where they had lain three weeks by the name of Clarke and Trueman, had been gone a week or thereabouts; and upon inquiry, finding the Room not lett, told the people they were come to lie there again: J. brought in a bundle under his coat, and that night only he lay there, but had a fire, and next day brought down a small quantity of silver Lace, as he said, to burn at the Kitchin-fire; and borrowing a hammer to beat it in his Chamber, lock'd his door and continued beating about three hours: Next morning his Companion came, bringing their other Crony, and that night they all three lay together: On the Friday they all went forth, but carried away the Key of the Closet: Their Landladies daughter going up to clean the Room, observes a great many Spangles of Gold, and about six small Pearls, which prompted her curiosity (having before some suspitions) with a Knife to open the Closet-door, where under a cloath she met with the Coronet on the top of the Mace, and part of the body of it; the sight whereof strangely surprized her, and made her call up her Mother, telling her, they had got the King's Crown: She is no less amazed, but desires a Neighbour to inquire what News there was abroad at the Coffee-house; there he is told of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16770307005"></xptr>my Lord Chancellor's being robb'd; and then concluding this must be his Mace, honestly gives information; whereupon several of my Lords servants, with Officers, plant themselves over the way. That night none of the three Prisoners came there, but a woman to enquire for them (who since pretends to be Sadler's wife) she presently is secured, so likewise was Johnson, who came next morning; and soon after Sadler coming also thither, spying a Croud about the door, strikes down a Lane towards the Waterside, where he is pursued, and after some small resistance, taken. The Closet is search'd and besides most part of the Mace, some of the Purse, and several other pieces of Plate found: And upon search before Sir W. T. in Sadler's Almanack was found a Note where

Carrying her away; she was observ'd to fling a piece of Gold, part of the Mace, into the bed, and upon stricter search in a pot of water they found two pieces more. This Renninger, though bred to the Tap, pretended to be a Working Goldsmith; and 'twas prov'd that the Sunday before the Robbery committed, he was between four and five a clock in the morning with the other two walking to and fro in Queen-street, hawking as 'tis thought for an opportunity to accomplish their designe. Sadler confess'd the Robbery, and charg'd Johnson as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16770307006"></xptr>his only Confederate therein and that he gave Renninger and the woman what they had: Johnson denied that, and would onely confess himself an accessary after the Fact; but such was the clearness of the Evidence, that the Jury could do no less than finde them all three <rs id="t16770307-4-verdict16" type="verdictDescription">

We all left the room, except Miss Welchman; we went into the adjoining-room, the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. In the front room could you hear what passed in the work-room - A. Yes; we could hear. We heard him name to her, to go out to supper with him; she said, she could not go. Then he wished her to send for salmon, that he might have supper there after eleven o'clock. After we had done work, I went into the work-room again, into the middle room, were the deceased was. I desired the prisoner to go; he said, he would not go until Miss Welchman had given him a letter which she had of his. Miss Welchman said, she had destroyed it.

               <p>Q. How long had you been in the kitchen before you either saw the prisoner or the deceased again - A. About five minutes; I saw the deceased, Miss Welchman; the deceased came down to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner follow - A. No. Miss Welchman was in the kitchen only a minute; she said, she must return to the prisoner, not for us to wait supper for her; she must return to the prisoner, and she hoped she should soon get him out. In about five minutes, I was alarmed by Miss Welchman screaming; next was the report of the pistol, and instantly the report of another. I ran up stairs, not farther than the parlour. I did not go at all to the first floor; I stopped in the parlour.</p>

The scream was followed immediately by the report of a pistol; the report of a pistol was followed by the report of a second pistol. I ran up stairs as quick as I could; when I got on the top of the stairs Miss Welchman was laying half way out of the room; her legs were in the room; her head out.

I gave orders that the house might be searched. I immediately went up stairs to the first floor. On entering the first floor front room I saw the deceased, Miss Welchman, supported in a chair, with two wounds upon her head. I observed a wound in the right temple. I found the pistols in about a quarter of an hour afterwards. The pistols were both found in my presence. A hat and one pistol was found in the front room where the deceased was supported, and one pistol in the middle room, called the work room. These are the pistols, and that is the hat.

               <p>MR. RUSSELL. I am a surgeon. On the 4th of August last, I was sent for to Miss Macey's; I went, and saw Miss Welchman; she was just expiring; the cause of her death was the two wounds she had received, one in the right temple, the other on the left side of the head. They appeared both pistol wounds. The pistols were found in the room. I had the holding them, and on putting my finger in them they were damp, therefore I think they had been recently discharged.</p>

I asked him how he came to be without a hat; he said he happened to get himself into a hobble at Bartholomew fair, and lost his hat. The fair was over that day, I believe.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's lodgings, 16, Grosvenor-mews; I found the cases of a pair of pistols, the bullet moulds, four bullets, and a key. The bullets, cases, and the key, fits the pistols I have produced to-day.</p>

            . I am a farmer at Sutton, near Salisbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you formerly know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, sir, he worked for me formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Early in the month of August, did you see him near Salisbury - A. Yes, on Tuesday the 9th of August; I caused him to be apprehended. I read the description of him in the newspaper, and caused him to be taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How near Salisbury was it - A. Between eleven and twelve miles the other side of Salisbury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am certainly innocent of the charge. It was never my intention to murder Miss Welchman, nor ever did such a thought enter my head; and that hat Mr. Chapman, the hatter, knows is not mine. I lost my hat in Burlington Gardens. Them pistols are not mine; I never had any pistols since I left Spain. I never offered or asked for supper, the witness knows it well. I went down stairs with my hat a little before eleven o'clock, or about that time.</p>

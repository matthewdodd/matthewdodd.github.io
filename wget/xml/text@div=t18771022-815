                  </hi>. I am the wife of Wm. Brunt, of 2, Calthorpe Court, High. Street, Chatham—on Tuesday, the 7th August, at about 12.30 in the morning, I went upstairs with my husband, having latched the front door—I had heard him come in—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I heard a noise downstairs and the noise of the parrot, and my husband went down directly and followed him—the parrot was gone, and a few feathers and my hat and jacket were on the doorstep—I had left them on a chair covered up in the same room with the parrot—I gave information to the police, and went to the Marine barracks next morning, when Edwin Rate showed me the parrot, and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it.</p>

I am a private in the Marines stationed at Chatham—on the morning in question I saw the prisoner at 5.30 in his room sitting on his bed with this parrot, not with the cage—the prisoner went down bathing, and he gave it to the cook till we came back—he said he was going to sell it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—afterwards he told me he found it on the Chatham lines—when I—found the parrot belonged to Mrs. Brunt I sent for her, and gave it to her, and she gave me my shilling back and fourpence for my trouble.</p>

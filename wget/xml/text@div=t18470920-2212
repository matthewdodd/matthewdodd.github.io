                  </hi> I live at Plaistow, and am a farmer and gar<lb></lb>dener, in partnership with Elizabeth Frances Ireland and another—we had some onions growing in our field—I observed footmarks there, and saw about a bushel of onions which were taken out of a bag—they were very remarkable—there were some foreign onions among them—I knew to be ours.</p>

On the 15th of Sept., at half-past five in the morning, I was on duty in the Barking-road, and saw the prisoner coming in a direction from the field where those onions were—directly he saw me, he put this bag down, sat on it, and pretended to be lacing his shoes—I went and asked him what he had got—he said a few things belonging to him—I</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live at Vauxhall. On 30th Oct., about a quarter past 11 or 11 o'clock at night, I was in Victoria Street, Westminster; two soldiers came up to me, knocked me down, and tore open my coat—they were knocking me about while I was on the ground—they tore away my watch, and gave me a blow on my forehead and another on my nose, and knocked one of my teeth out—I could not distinguish which took the most active part—they ran away, and I stood up, and called out, "Soldiers have robbed me of my watch out of my pocket"—I had not time to distinguish their features, but I believe the prisoner is one of them, the other was younger—I was not intoxicated—my watch was safe five or six minutes before; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was fastened by this chain which I have on, and which they snapped, and left it hanging round my neck.</p>

I saw the prosecutor running; he called out, "Soldiers took my watch!" and attempted to follow, but fell down—I saw a soldier running in front of him, who I followed, and lost sight of in Gardner's Lane, near the bottom of York Street, having first made a communication to another constable, Lavers, who went one way while I went another, and then saw the prisoner in Lavers's custody—I took the prisoner to the station; he was searched, but the watch not being found on him, he was discharged from the station about two hours after<lb></lb>wards—I went back with Lavers, and close to the spot where the prisoner was taken I found this watch under a heap of rubbish—I then concealed my<lb></lb>self, and saw another soldier come up, look about as if he had been sent and then go away; he did not look under the heap.</p>

I saw Clayton running in York Street; he spoke to me, and I saw a soldier who I had previously met walking; he had turned round into Blue Anchor Yard when I met him—that is a thoroughfare—he could not then be seen from York Street—he had turned the corner about four yards when I met him—from a descrip<lb></lb>tion Clayton gave me, I turned back, and went a different way, after the soldier, and he went to meet him—I overtook him; I found he had made a stop in the yard, and told him I wanted him for a robbery of a watch in Victoria Street—he said, "Do you? I know nothing about it"—Clayton came up soon after—I searched him on the spot, but could find no watch on him—(I had no light at that time)—I took him to the station, and he was discharged—I went back, and found the watch on the very spot where I had taken the prisoner in custody half an hour before.</p>

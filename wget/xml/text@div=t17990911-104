             sworn. - I have no friends in London, I do what I can for a livelihood; the prisoner lodged in the room over me; my landlord and landlady were in confinement, and she came to help me; I had the care of the children; I am subject to fits, and instead of helping me, she took the money out of my pocket and ran up stairs, and locked herself in; it was on a Friday, I think, in the afternoon; when I asked her for the money, she called me every thing that was bad, and would not give it me; I had seen my money about ten minutes before, and there might be about four shillings in silver, besides halfpence; when my sit was over, I went to get something to relieve me; I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had no money left; I went up stairs to her to ask her for my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge her with stealing but half-a-crown? - A.Because that was all the money that I could swear to that was marked; there was an infirm man in the place at the time, but he could not help me; the constable has got the money; he found the money upon her; one shilling has got an E upon it, and another an N, and the sixpence has a B upon it; I had saved this money to buy me something, I had had it about three days.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MESSENGER sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen-square-office: On Friday, the 28th of last June, a person came to the office for a constable to go to No. 28, Dartmouth-row, and the prosecutrix gave me charge of the prisoner; I searched her, and found some money upon her; I kept two shillings and a sixpence, which the prosecutrix swore to; the rest I gave back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I can swear to this money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The money was my own, and it is only spite, because I refused to fetch a gown and petticoat out of pawn for her; and there was a little boy she brought before the Justice, and told him she would give him a penny if he would say what she bid him, that he saw me take the money out of her pocket, and if he did not, she would beat him and turn him out of doors.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mrs. White tell you to say any thing against Mary Skinner? - A. Yes; Mrs. White said, if I did not say that I saw her take the money out of her pocket, she would lather me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it, or did you not see it? - A. I did not see it; and Mrs. White wanted me to say that I did see it; and Mr. Moore said, he would give me a halfpenny if I would say so; Mr. Moore and Mrs. White both said, they would lather me if I did not; Mrs. White was in fits when she was going to dinner, and all dinner time; Mrs. Skinner and Mr. Moore dined together.(

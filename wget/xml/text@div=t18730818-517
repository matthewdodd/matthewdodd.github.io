I am the wife of Henry Lovegrove, a coachman, of 7, Reeves' Mews—on Friday, 1st August, I was looking out of my first-floor window, and saw the prisoner throw some water over the deceased, who took his hands and switched it off—the prisoner said something I could not hear, and the deceased went into the stable, and after he had been there a moment the prisoner seemed to run him out with his knee and the back of his collar—the deceased stood for a moment or two, and held his hand out as if asking for something, and then I heard the prisoner say "Summons me for it"—he still stood there, and the prisoner said something which I could not hear, and struck him with his open hand on the left side of his head, and he fell—a cab was fetched and the prisoner helped him in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital—on 1st August the deceased was brought there suffering from compound fracture of both bones of his right leg, and a wound on the outer side of his right eyebrow, about three-quarters of an inch long, leading down to the covering of the bone, but not exposing the bone—he was sober and sensible, but after three or four days he became delirious, and remained so till the 7th August, when he died—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he died from exhaustion, following on inflammation at the base of the lungs, and <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—in an injury of that kind it is common to have <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> where a man has been a drunkard, because the system is so lowered by alcohol that as soon as he is knocked down he cannot recover—I found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180123"></xptr>
               <p>inflammation of the lungs, which is not uncommon when a person has had an injury, and has been a drunkard, and lying on the back is a common cause of it.</p>
               <p>

            . I was informed the next Morning after these Things were lost, that I was robbed of my Linnen. I saw that it was advertised; I went and enquired after it, and found it in the Hands of the Headborough, Mr Lindsey, at the Corner of Darby-street, in Rosemary-Lane. - I cannot swear to the Linnen, but I believe it to be my Linnen by the Marks; I can swear to the Stockings.</p>

             proved the Linnen to be the Property of Mr Cunliff, and said, that she hung the Linnen out in the Garden to dry, between twelve and one in the Day, on the 21st of June, and left them out all Night, and that they were gone the next Morning.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner about a Fortnight; about two o'Clock on a Tuesday Morning, I cannot tell the Day of the Month, the Prisoner got over a great Wall, into the Church Yard, and then into Mr Cunliff's Garden, and took all these Things off the Lines; there were four of us; the Watchmen beset us all. I was taken up by Mr Lindsey, the Watchman, with the Things upon me; the Watchmen popped out upon us all of a sudden; the Prisoner, and the two others ran away. - The Wall was so high that he could not get over it without his Legs being helped up; nobody was over the Wall but the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Lindsey. I took the Linnen from Burton; he stood upon one Step, and the Linnen lay upon another. I saw three of them together at first; two of them flew down like two Birds; at first I thought they had been Figures chalked up against the Wall, I did not reckon there was any Men there. - I believe the Prisoner was one that run down the Steps. - I saw but three in all. - I took Burton upon the Steps: I believe if Webb, the Watchman, had not come to my Assistance, they would have knocked me on the Head. I think I heard an Expression, if I had known he had been coming, I would have knocked his Brains cut: Burton said I was a Watchman, but I am an Officer: Burton said, he wished I had been damned, and in Hell, before I saw him. G - d d - n your Blood, says he, I can tell what you can do; you can send me to New-Prison, and then I shall go to Kingston. <rs id="t17430629-40-verdict227" type="verdictDescription">

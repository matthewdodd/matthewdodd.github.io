            . I am one of the collectors of the assessed taxes for the parish of St. James's. On the 18th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was standing at my parlour window, I saw a cart pass, and the prisoner Coombs, whom I have known for many years I saw opposite of my window, at the tail of my cart. I did not see the carter; the prisoner was off the foot-path, he reached his arm over, and pulled the coat towards the tail of the cart; I immediately went and stood at the street-door; the cart had not got more than sixteen yards before the prisoner made the second go off the foot path; he laid hold of the coat and put it into a smaller compass; he took the coat of the cart and put it under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080033"></xptr> his arm and turned off with it towards Titchbourn-street, I was not certain at the time whether he was not taking his own coat out of the cart, and I followed after the prosecutor with his team; I overtook him in the Haymarket, I asked him if that coat did not belong to him. Yes, sir, he said, it is there; I said a man whom I know very well has taken it out of the cart, but at the time I did not know but it was his own coat. On the Saturday three weeks afterwards, the 14th of March, was the first time that I saw the prisoner afterwards, he was standing at the corner of Coventry-street, within a few yards of where he had taken this coat from the countryman's cart; I got Knight and Wilding, two constables, to apprehend him, and took him to Marlborough-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the coat ever found - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY, aged 30.</p>

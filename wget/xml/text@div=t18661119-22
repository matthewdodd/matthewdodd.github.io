                  </hi>. I am a servant, and live at No. 56, Burlington Road, Paddington—on Sunday evening, 21st October, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another man walking up and down on each side of the way opposite Mr. Answorth's house—at about half-past seven o'clock I saw the prisoner come off Mr. Answorth's steps with something shining in his hand, like a basket—(he had nothing when I first saw him)—the other man crossed the road to him, they walked to the side of a lamp-post, covered the basket over, and then walked up to me—I men<lb></lb>tioned what I had seen to two policemen.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife, and live at No. 41, Burlington Road—on the night of 24th October I had an ornamental clock with a glass shade over it in the dining-room, which is downstairs—the dining-room door is six or seven feet from the front door—I saw the clock safe at a quarter to seven o'clock, and missed it at twenty minutes past—our house is opposite No. 56.</p>

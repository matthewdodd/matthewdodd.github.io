I lost these handkerchiefs out of my shop between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, on the 25th of March. I shewed the prisoner some handkerchiefs: there were two other customers came into the shop: I called my wife to attend her. When she was going away my wife charged her with having something in her pocket: she put her hand in her pocket, and took out two silk handkerchiefs, which she said she had when she came into my shop. I looked at them, and found a ticket with my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>- Scott. I went to Mr. Mayor with a gentleman. He called Mrs. Mayor; she attended the prisoner; Mr. Mayor attended us. Mrs. Mayor said the prisoner had something of hers in her pocket. The prisoner said she had a couple of handkerchiefs she had bought at another place: she pulled them out of her pocket. Mr. Mayor looked at them, and said there was his mark upon them. The prisoner said she had money in her pocket, and she would pay for them. Mr. Mayor would not take it. Then she offered to down on her knees to beg pardon, and so on.</p>

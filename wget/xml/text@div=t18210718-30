I confined him in the school room alone, for not learning his lesson; I returned in three quarters of an hour; I asked him if any one had been, I found him still in the room - he said No, and I dismissed him instantly. I missed a pocket-book from my desk, containing twenty sovereigns, it was not locked nor had I locked the room door. The school-room does not join the house.</p>
               <p>Q.He might have gone out if he liked - A. Yes. I have not recovered it. I did not see him till the Wednesday following, when the constable brought him. He has a father and a brother whom he lives with.</p>

            . I am a constable. I have known the prisoner some years, and his parents - they do not take care of him. I found him down Well-street Mews on the 19th; he had been absent from them three days. I told him next morning that he had taken his master's pocketbook away - he said he had not seen it. I took him home to my house, my wife was talking to him; what she said I do not know - I think she said he had better tell the truth.</p>

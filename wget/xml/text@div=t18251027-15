            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Widegate-street, Bishopsgate. On the 1st of September, sixteen handkerchiefs were pawned by the prisoner, and on the 17th twenty-eight yards of print, in the name of Munns; eight or nine days afterwards he brought twenty-six yards of Irish linen, and having suspicion, I asked him whose it was - he said his own; I asked what he was going to do with it - he said to make some shirts of it; I asked where he bought it - he said at Cook and Gladstones, Cheapside, at 12 1/2 d. a yard; I asked if he had a bill of it; he said he had; he felt in his pocket, and said he thought he had brought it with him, but he had not; he went for it, returned in ten minutes, and said he had lost it, and that he had bought the handkerchiefs and print at the same place; this was about twelve o'clock; I said if he called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270011"></xptr>about half-past twelve o'clock I would see if I could advance any thing on it - that I should go to Cook's, and inquire; he came to the shop - Mr. Gladstone was outside, and saw him; we all three went to the prosecutors' shop, and on the road I asked if he was certain he had bought the handkerchiefs there - he said Yes, of one of the young men in the shop, whom he could point out - we went there, and all the men were brought before him - he could not identify either of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Though you said you should go and inquire, still he was there ready to answer any questions? A. Yes; ten or eleven young men were brought before him - he said it was a shortish young man - there was a short young man.</p>

About the 1st of September, we were repairing the house - the prisoner was at work as a carpenter - bricklayers and plasterers were also at work: I was fetched to Clamp's on the 8th of October, and saw him come out of the door with Clamp; when we got to our house, I asked if he could fix on the young man who sold him the goods - he said he could; I called them singly - he selected none of them; he pointed out the part of the shop he bought the articles from; such goods were never placed there, nor sold there; he said he paid 10 d. each, for the handkerchiefs - they cost us 1 s. 5 d. - they have our private mark on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Stephen Child and three others, distillers, in the Borough-market, by St. Saviour's church. On the 1st of July this letter and cheque were brought to the house by the prisoner about twelve o'clock in the day—(the cheque being read, was dated June 30th, 1840, drawn by G. Redman on Pocklington and Lacy, West Smithfield, for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—letter <hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"July 1, 1840, Yorkshire Grey, Park-street. Mr. Tute's compliments to Child and Dickers, and would feel greatly obliged if they could cash the enclosed cheque for him, being in immediate want of it, and not having sufficient time to send to the bankers for the same, or else he would not have troubled them")—Mr. Tate is a customer of our house—I asked the prisoner from whom he brought it—he said, "From the Yorkshire Grey"—I then, as my custom is, took it into a private office to one of the partners, who opened it—it contained the cheque—I was desired to give the money—I was in the act of putting it into an envelope to deliver to the prisoner, when one of the partners opened the door, and asked if I knew the boy—I believe the prisoner could not hear that—I then told him to go home, and I would send the money round by one of our clerks—he went away—I have not the slightest doubt of his being the person.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 13th of April I was at Twickenham, standing with some other boys, near Mr. Warner's—the prisoner splashed me with dirty water, and then struck me—I threw a stone at him, which did not touch him—he then threw one at me, larger than my double fist, which hit me on the top of my head—I fell down on my face—he then knelt on me, and beat me on the back of my head with a flint-stone larger than my fist—my head bled like a stuck pig—I was taken to a surgeon.</p>

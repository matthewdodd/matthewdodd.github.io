A builder named Stavey, and he employed others under him - I had no connexion with the persons by whom the work was actually done - Stavey is not here - I know nothing of the orders he gave to his workmen -

               <p>JAMES RANDALL HOBBS re-examined. I have compared it with other wood on my premises - I am enabled to say, from the pattern of the moulding and the colour of the wood, that it is my property.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MRS. JONES. Q. Have you been in the habit of buying wood of him while these premises were pulling down? A. Yes - my house is about three doors from Mr. Hobbs' building - the sale was made openly, and other neighbours bought it as well as me - there was no disguise about the prisoner.</p>

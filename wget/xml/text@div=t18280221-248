            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 2d of February, I was in Paternoster-row, Spitalfields, and saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm; I asked what he had got; he said his work, which he had brought from the Borough, and that he was going to take it to a house in Lamb-street, next door to a dry-salters; I followed him, and as he did not seem to go into any house, I asked him again, where he was going; he said, "Stop, I will tell you - the skins are my father's;" I took hold of them, and he ran away - I pursued, and took him.</p>

On the 10th of July, I gave him 10 l. 1 s. 6 d. to carry to a pawnbroker. After all the change was counted on the counter, I asked the prisoner to count it, he did, after he had counted it, I shewed him a paper that I had entered it on, the prisoner said it was all right, I put the money and the paper in a handkerchief, he went out with it to carry it to the pawnbroker, after he returned I asked him if it was all right, he said yes, only four shillings that were bad. In half an hour after that, Mr. Walker's young man came to know what change I had sent, I told him ten pounds one shilling and sixpence, he said Mr. Walker had not received so much, when the prisoner came in, I told him Mr. Walker's young man had been, and he said the change was not all right, I told him he must go to Mr. Walker's, he said he would go in the morning. In the morning he told me had been, in a few minutes Mr. Walker's young man came in, and asked about the prisoner, I found he had not been, I told him then he must go with me to Mr. Walker; he did, and there I found he had only given 7 l. 11 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>MR. WALKER. On the 10th of July the prisoner came to me, it was the first time I saw him, he said he came from Mr. Ledsham, he had brought 7 l. 11 s. 6 d. I said here is only 7 l. 4 s. good, take these, and tell your master I only keep 7 l. 4 s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. to Ledsham. This boy had lived with you how long - A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding that there were some wages due to him - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. You had given him this money to carry to this gentleman, who is a witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect speaking to his brother upon the subject, and that the boy said if the money was not right, he must have lost it, his brother would pay it - A. I remember the prisoner would not own to his taking the money.</p>
               <p>Q. And the brother has promised to pay you the money - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. John Warwick - he has two partners - they are surgeons, and he is a <rs id="t18260406-313-viclabel1682" type="occupation">gold refiner</rs>

On Saturday, the 25th of February, I locked up their iron chest, about six o'clock in the evening; this gold and silver was in it; I had bought the piece of silver, just a week before; two pieces of massy silver I had bought on the 25th of Otton; I had put them into the fire and melted them in the kitchen, by his request - they came out in a particular shape, and I can identify them - the chest stood in the counting-house, which was never locked; I went into the counting-house again on Monday morning, about seven o'clock; it joins the workshop by a passage; part of the workshop is tiled in; I saw a large hole in the tiles of the workshop, enough to admit a man's body; I had not been there on Sunday - I only passed through the passage to go into the house; I then went into the counting house, the door of which was open, and I found the iron chest open which I had left locked, and missed the gold and silver, and the two massy pieces of silver; I then missed a sovereign from the till of the counter in the counting-house, which I had seen there on the Saturday night; I had locked the till, and had the key; the lock had been forced open; the lock of the chest appeared to have been opened with the key which had been in one of the partitions of the till, where the sovereign was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Was that the only money in the till? A. No, there was 3s. in halfpence, and they were taken too. The surgery business is not carried on under the same roof - they do not live there; one of the prosecutor's brothers went away on the night of the robbery - the other I saw a fortnight ago; I know that he was acquainted with the prisoner, and that he is not now to be found - the counting-house is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am constable of St. James. Westminster. I went to the prisoner's lodgings on Tuesday, the 28th of February, at No. 5, Bow-yard, Drury-lane, and found him in bed - I told him I wanted him on a charge of felony; he dressed himself, and I searched him- he refused me at first, and I observed him put his hand into his left-hand breeches pocket, and draw out something, which he dropped on the bed. I then tied his hands with a handkerchief, and looked on the bed, where I found three pieces of silver - I took charge of them immediately. I searched the room, and found a pair of shoes - the Magistrate asked at the office if they were his, and he acknowledged that they were. I went two days afterwards to the prosecutor's workshop - I observed the opening, and saw the print of a footstep ont the chimney, within half a yard of the opening; I fitted the right shoe to the footsteps - it appeared to correspond exactly - I found in the prisoner's room one new and some old crucibles, and a basin with some sort of metal in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search his pockets before he dressed himself? A. No. I compared one of the shoes with the footsteps, but I did not mention that at the first examination. Mr. Warwick's brother said he did not know where he was; I took a deal of trouble to find him, but I could not. I found some property of Mr. Warwick's brother's at the prisoner's lodging.</p>

            . I am an engine-turner. On the 25th of February I sold Mr. Simpson those pieces of silver - they were in one piece; I begged he would put them into the fire, to ascertain their quality; it is in the same shape as when he brought it from the fire - they are worth about 1s., and this piece of spoon is worth 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean it has the same surface that it had then? A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. Did he say how he got the silver, before the Magistrate? A. Yes - he first said that he found them in Peter's pocket, and then said Peter gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 27th of February Peter,(the prosecutor's brother,) came to my place before breakfast, and gave me 6s. to fetch a coat from the dyer's, that wanted repairing; I repaired it for him - he said he wanted to meet a friend, and he could not go in his fustian jacket - he pulled off the jacket, and put on the coat; I removed the jacket, and the three pieces of silver fell out- he has never been found since.</p>

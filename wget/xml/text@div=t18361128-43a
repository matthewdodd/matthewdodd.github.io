                  </hi>. I live in New Montague-street, Spitalfields, and am a widow—I work for Kendall and Bridge, Friday-street. The prisoner was employed about four years by me as a warper—I gave her silk to warp a cane of 195 yards—I received information that she was taking silk off the cane when she had warped it—I went to her, and said, "What are you doing?"—she said, "I was only taking my top cross"—I put my hand into her bag, and found this silk, which she had taken off the mill—she then said, "I have had an accident with it"—I looked, and saw she had had no accident—I gave her in charge—I took my candle and looked round, and under a wheel I found some more silk—I went to her at the station-house, and said I had found some more—"Yes" she said, "I am sorry to say I have robbed a good mistress"—the silk is not mine.</p>

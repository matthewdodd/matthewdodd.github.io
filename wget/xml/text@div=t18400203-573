                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Bishopsgate-street Without. On Saturday morning last, a little before five o'clock, I was awoke by the breaking of glass—I laid still a few minutes, and then heard a voice say, "Whose beat is it on? why did not you stop them?"—I instantly got up, and on looking through the window, I saw one or two persons on the oppo<lb></lb>site</p>

               <p>side looking towards my shop—I dressed myself and went down stairs—I heard the clock strike five, a few minutes after I was awoke by the breaking of the glass—I am sure it was five o'clock—when I went down I opened the shop-door, found the bar of the shutter bent very much, two shutters down, and one pane of glass broken quite out—I put the shutters up, and received information that a man was at the station-house—I went there, and found the prisoner in custody, and two dozen pairs of gloves on the table, which I can swear to being mine by the make—I have others that correspond with them now at home—they had not been made particularly for me—I came back to my shop—I found the shutters as I had left them, but I had not time before I went to the station-house to examine the window—I found it had been very much disturbed in the course of the night, and missed three dozen pairs of gloves—the shop was properly se<lb></lb>cured when I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, the shutters and doors also—I went back to the station-house, and saw the third dozen pairs of gloves, which corresponded with what I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning in question I saw the prisoner enter Devonshire-square, which is fifty or sixty yards from the prosecutor's shop—knowing the square was no thoroughfare at night, I hastened to the spot, and asked the prisoner what he did there—he appeared very drunk—I took him into custody, and in going to the station-house, he dropped a packet of gloves, which I took up—after we got to the station-house another packet, which was a second dozen, was brought in by a country boy not more than half a minute after we got there—I have no doubt the prisoner saw him bring it in—I do not think he heard what he said—I found a third packet of gloves about five minutes after he got to the station-house, part in the prisoner's hat, and part under the seat in the cell he was in—he was quite alone in the cell—the gloves were af<lb></lb>terwards shown to Mr. Bartholomew—the prisoner appeared to be drunk, but I believe it was put on, for before I got him to the counter, he appeared as sober as I do now—that was about a quarter past six o'clock, after I had got him to the station-house.</p>

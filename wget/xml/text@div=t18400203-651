                  </hi>. I live in Harris's-court, Ratcliffe, the prisoner lives next door to me. On the 31st of December, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I came in, and as I went in, I heard the prisoner at my door abusing me very much—I made him no answer—I think he was very much intoxi<lb></lb>cated, from what I could learn—I went out and came in again at half-past twelve o'clock—I asked my wife if he was in bed—she said she believed he was, but I heard him say, "I am not in bed, you Scotch b——, I will be the death of you this night"—I said, "Go to bed, and I will answer you in, the morning, I never did you any harm in my life"—he said, "So I will, old man, I will go to bed," and he wished me good night—about five minutes after, he came and rapped at my shutters, and said, "Come out here, I want you"—I said, "Just let me alone, I am not well"—he said, I want to speak to you"—I went out, and he stood at his own door—I went up to his door—he caught hold of me round the neck, and struck me on the head with a hammer—the first blow almost knocked me senseless—the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> flew from my eyes, and I thought they were knocked out of my head—the first blow was struck just at the top of my head—I said to him, "Craven, what do you mean by this? I thought you would have been the last man to use me in this form; do you mean to murder me?"—he said, "Yes, you Scotch b——, I mean to murder you"—he took me, and was dragging me into his own house, beating me on the head repeatedly with the hammer—his daughter said to him, 'Father, don't pull him in here, see his blood is lying on the threshold of the door"—he made a tremendous blow at me, which I kept off with my hand, or it would have killed me—he then handed the hammer over his</p>

               <p>shoulder to his daughter, and she concealed it—the policeman came directly after, and took him into custody, and I went home to my own house as well as I could—I received between eight and nine cuts on the head from him—it was a two-clawed hammer, about a pound and a half weight—I have had the hammer in my hand many times—he struck me with both parts of it—where he struck with the claw part, it made two wounds, and the other part made only one—I went to the hospital imme<lb></lb>diately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter, and live with him. I was in bed when the prisoner called my father to the door—I heard my father go to the door—I instantly ran down stairs in my night-dress—before I could get down he had got to the door, and the door was opened—my father was on the threshold of the door then, just going out, when I got to the door the prisoner had got one arm round my father's neck, and with the other arm he was striking blows on his head with the hammer—he said, "You Scotch b—, I will do for you now"—he was still striking blows on my father's head with the hammer—I screamed out, "Murder"—my father said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi>, it is murder you mean, is it?—the prisoner said, "Yes, I will do for you this night"—he was trying to drag my father into his own house, and his daughter said, "Oh, father, don't drag him into your own house, for see at the blood on the threshold of the door now"—the policeman then came up and took the prisoner away, and my mother and I led my father in-doors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pupil at the London Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there about two or three o'clock in the morning—his wounds were dressed when he came, and I did not undo the dressings till the next morning—he slept in the hospital that night—I found eight or nine wounds on the head and forehead—they were such as might have been made by the claw-end of a hammer—I did not probe them—I cannot tell whether the skull was fractured—no portion of the bone was displaced, that I am aware of, but it might have been—I should say the wounds were not very severe—they were dangerous—I apprehended erysipelas from them—he had erysipelas subsequently—I attribute that partly to the wounds, but I think exposure to the cold air at the police-office might hare had something to do with it—at one time his life was in danger—I cannot say whether the wounds went to the bone, not having been the first person to dress them.</p>

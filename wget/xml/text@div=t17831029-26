             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at No. 20, New Gravel-lane, Wapping. My husband is a <rs id="t17831029-26-viclabel144" type="occupation">clock-maker</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17831029-26-victim430 t17831029-26-viclabel144"></join>. A lodger of mine having gone away from my house, she took a warrant out against me for striking her, and the prisoner is the person that took me to New Prison in a coach; it was the 11th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can guess: the prisoner would not give me time to stay till my husband could get bail, but he hand-cuffed me in the public-house, and while my husband was gone to get bail, he took me away; he took me away in a quarter of an hour after my husband went. I had a shilling in my hand, and I told him if he would let me stay till my husband came back, I would give him that shilling, or half a crown: I was hand-cuffed with a man, though there was nothing against me but that warrant.</p>
               <p>When did you expect your husband? - He was gone to seek a gentleman to bail me, and he could not come till the evening. My husband was out at work when the officer came to take me at my own house, and I offered to send for my husband before I went before the Justice, I was very much terrified. I had a shilling in my hand, and the prisoner took it out of my hand, and said this will get us glasses a-piece.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did not give him the shilling? - No, I did not give it him. As we was going along the road, he called at a public-house in Long-lane; I think it might be about Barbican: he asked me if I had any more money: the chap that was hand-cuffed to me, rather shook my pocket a little, and the prisoner said, if I had as much as would pay the coach, I should not go to prison, for he was sorry for my children; and the prisoner took three shillings out of my pocket, and said, I shall bring you back from prison: I said, I am very unhappy to go to prison, because the thoughts of my children distresses me; and he said, I shall bring you back again.</p>
               <p>Court. And did he take the three shillings out of your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the three shillings? - He took it from me; but if he had brought me back, I should have been willing he should have had the three shillings to pay the coach.</p>
               <p>Did he bring you back? - No; he carried me to prison hand-cuffed to the chap, and put me into the prison so: this might be about four in the afternoon, when he took me to New Prison, and my husband came about eight, with an order from the Justice to take me home.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he took this money out of your pocket without your consent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290084"></xptr>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Though you would have consented if he had brought you home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a house? - Yes; we have a house of ten guineas a year. I have two children.</p>
               <p>Court. There was no danger of your escaping from him? - He hand-cuffed me, my Lord, and I thought it was cruel; I thought he had no right to do that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How long did the prisoner stay to indulge you, before he carried you to New Prison? - It might be about half an hour.</p>

               <p>Did not he stay from twelve o'clock till three, waiting for your husband? - No, he did not wait half an hour for my husband; it was about two when we set off, and then we waited above an hour before we could see the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. The charge was only for an assault: this is a very material thing as I have tried this whole sessions.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. After I had done at the Justice's, he did not wait half an hour: he treated me very ill, and he put me into a nasty stinking place, where there were fellows.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do not you know it is the common place where the Rotation Office is kept? - It was at the King's Arms, a public-house.</p>
               <p>You were in a room there, in that house? - There was the chap that came in the coach with me, and two chaps more.</p>
               <p>Did you propose any thing about bail? - Justice Green did not say any thing about bail: I think the Justice said we might go and make it up, but I am not sure: we would have had it bailed in an hour's time: the bail was not spoken of by the Justice at that time.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner take you away till Mr. Green was gone? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you drink going to prison? - Yes; I took a glass along with him in Long-lane, because he told me he should bring me back; we had a glass of gin a-piece.</p>
               <p>Did you pay any thing for the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, give him the shilling to pay for the gin? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you agree to be a quartern of gin? - No, I did not, he took the shilling out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Did not that shilling pay for the gin? - He changed it to pay for the gin, and he took the change.</p>
               <p>Did you pay any thing for the accommodation of the coach or did you not? - I did not pay any thing.</p>
               <p>Or was it agreed that the residue of that shilling and the other money should pay for your coach? - No, there was no such agreement.</p>
               <p>Court. What occasion was there to carry that woman to goal in a coach handcuffed?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I believe it is reckoned an act of humanity to put them in a coach.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very odd act of humanity to hand-cuff people in this manner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The prisoner put a handkerchief to my mouth when he took the shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you express any dissatisfaction when you stopped to drink? did the coachman drink? - The coachman drank, I never spoke when he called for the gin, I never spoke when he changed the shilling.</p>
               <p>When did he take the three shillings from you? - About ten minutes before we came to the public house in Long Lane.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it there? - I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it at the prison? - Not then, but they put me backwards, and I mentioned it to some of the women in prison, and when my husband came I mentioned it to him, and to the young man; I went to the keeper very simply, and said, Sir, I am to go out again, and he said, no, you are to stay here now you are here, I told the keeper of it before I came out; when people are frightened they have not all their wits about them just at the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290085"></xptr> I spoke of it to some of the women that were there.</p>
               <p>Had you a coach from your own house to the Justice's? - No, from Shadwell to East Smithfield, Justice Green was gone from Shadwell to East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Did you pay for that coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did that coach wait till your examination was over? - I cannot tell that, I did not know whether the coach waited, or whether they called another when I was to go to prison I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure you begged to stay till your husband came? - I went down on my knees to him, and he handcuffed me, I was so frightened; and he kicked me all the way into the coach before him, just as if I had been a dog.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This man did not take you from your own house? - No.</p>
               <p>You were taken up by the parish constable? - I do not know who it was, it was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did not you make your escape from that constable? - As for making my escape, I did not think the thing was of any consequence, my husband was to get bail, and I was told I might go up to bail it at any time.</p>
               <p>You were apprehended by a lawful warrant by a constable, now I ask you simply, did you or not escape from that constable? - They gave me liberty to come home, and we were to find bail, and he said, we might come up in the evening or any other time; and then the runners persuaded the woman to take me up with another warrant.</p>
               <p>How came you before Mr. Green? - This prisoner took me there.</p>
               <p>Did not you escape from him? - No, I did not, he gave me leave to go home, and then he came and took me with a warrant again; a man came to me in the evening and told me to come up in the morning, for Justice Green advised me to make it up.</p>

               <p>I am constable of Clerkenwell, I know no more, than apprehending the man from the warrant that was granted by Mr. Blackborough, I heard the prosecutrix say that she did not mean to hurt the man and was very sorry for what she had done, and I have people to prove that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did the prisoner abscond? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Was he open and public about his business? - Yes, he is a servant to the Governor of New Prison, a man that bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Perhaps you do not think he has done any thing wrong at all? - I cannot say any thing to that my Lord.</p>

               <p>My Lord, when the prosecutrix was at the Lock-up House at East Smithfield, her husband was there a drinking a pot of beer, I staid an hour before the commitment was made out, and afterwards I said to the husband, do you mean to go to find bail or no? I do not wish, says I, to take your wife to gaol, says I, I will stay an hour or an hour and a half longer, says he, take her whereever you like, I will have nothing to do with her, says I, do not be so cruel; I tell you, says he, that I will have nothing to do with her at all; I immediately says to the woman, will you chuse to have a coach, or will you not, as to the man that was hand-cuffed to her, he had made his escape from Shadwell Lock-up House, and this woman was put into my hands by Mr.

             a headborough at Shadwell, for she had escaped from him: Now my Lord, the reason she did not get a warrant that way where she lives is because her name is so bad, she is so well known: So they having both escaped, I said to the man, I will marry you together.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon my word Sir, I am quite ashamed to hear things talked of in that manner, I never heard such an expression before; marrying them together by handcuffing, I never heard any thing like that in my life!</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutrix. Is your husband here? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. Did your husband refuse to have any thing to do with you or not? - No, my Lord, he is too good a husband to behave in that manner, says he to me, the man will not take you to prison before I get back, them were the words my husband said.</p>
               <p>Court. What crime was the man taken up for, to which this woman was handcuffed?</p>

               <p>I am a coachman, I drove this coach with three people to New Prison from East Smithfield, it is three weeks ago last Saturday; there was another man in the coach, and this woman, they were hand-cuffed together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you call on the road any where? - Yes, we called in Long Lane Smithfield, on the left-hand side before you get into Smithfield, and ordered some gin.</p>
               <p>Did you see the behaviour of the people in the coach? - There was no bad behaviour, they drank together and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Did the woman drink like a woman that was refreshing herself with a glass of liquor? - I did not see her refuse it.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the liquor? - Mr. Gascoyne paid for it, I am sure he gave a shilling, I was at the coach door when they drank it, I heard no complaint, I believe he gave it to he landlord with his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any objections from tho woman? - None at all, I did not know whose shilling it was, she never said a single syllable that it was her shilling, or whose it was.</p>
               <p>Did you drive them to New Prison? - From there I went upon the box and drove them to New Prison, I heard no disturbance in the coach all the way, as if a man had been robbing a woman; the windows in front were down, and the side windows, and the two prisoners sat at the back of the coach, and Gascoyne sat in the front of the coach: I should imagine I must have heard if there had been any robbery committed in the coach: When she got out of the coach she desired the prisoner to take her back; she said, I will pay the coach back, or I will satisfy any thing if you will not take me into prison.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she say, or pretend to say, that she had already paid for the coach, or any thing about it? - She did not, the prisoner said, he must take her to his master, he could not carry her back.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was that money all you had? - I had five shillings and sixpence in my pocket when I went up to East Smithfield, and a bad sixpence, and there was a tankard of beer, and I changed the good sixpence to pay for it, I had four shillings in my pocket, and three shillings he took out, and one was got into the lining of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it altogether? - It was altogether in my pocket, but one shilling was in the lining of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Then that was all that he could come at? - Yes, that was all he could get, he could not get the other shilling, for I had much ado to find it myself when I got into prison.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him before he put his hand into your pocket and took out the three shillings, that he might take it? - No, I did not tell him any thing of taking it, I said, I had none; but after he took it, I told him, I would be content to pay the three shillings, if he would but bring me back from prison, and he promised me he would.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner upwards of twenty years, and during the whole of that time he had a very good character, I never heard any thing amiss of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you had any connection with him lately? - He lived near me, and I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. When were the three shillings taken from you? - About ten minutes before he called at the public-house. The shilling was taken away out of my hand before the three shillings were taken away; then we stopped at the public-house: he said that shilling would get glasses a-piece; and as he promised to bring me back, I would have been willing to have paid the coach, if he had done so.</p>
               <p>Court. There was some change of the shilling? - That he got.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. How much was the change out of the shilling for the gin? - I do not rightly know how much he got back: there were four glasses of gin.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is an indictment for a robbery on the highway, which is a capital offence; and the question is, whether, under all the circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290088"></xptr> of the case, you are satisfied (for so it must be) that this hand-cuffing, and this carrying away in the coach, against the power and without the consent of the prosecutrix, whether this carrying her in a coach, when she begged not to go, was a means used by the prisoner to get this woman into his power, and under his controul, with a felonious intent of taking her money away. It is certain, that in all felonies, the mind must be guilty; and it is the inte nt with which money is taken, that must constitute the offence. It is not absolutely necessary in every robbery (though you see this was in the street on the highway) that they should be committed in the usual way, with a pistol held to the head; for if there is a means made use of colourably under a specious pretence of law, or of doing justice, when the real intent is to rob a person of their money: the robbery may be committed, though the pretence is quite for another purpose. If a man comes to your house under a pretence that he has a search-warrant, or an authority to make a distress, and you open the door, and he gets in by that means, no man that is not acquainted with law would think that was a breaking and entering; but the fact is, that if he had no search-warrant, or no right to distrain, it would be in point of law, if it was in the night-time, a burglary, and if in the day-time, it would be a breaking and entering the dwelling-house. It has been determined, that where a man charges another, or threatens to charge him, with sodomitical practices, and tells him he will carry him away to a Justice of Peace (which was the case of Fielding), he then being in the street, and being then under immediate apprehension that he would be so carried before a Justice of Peace, and charged with that crime, out of fear and terror he parts with his money; that was construed by all the Judges as an highway-robbery, because it was only trying an ingenious scheme with a fraudulent intent to get the money from him against his will, being the owner; and it was intimidating him, by threatening to carry him before a Justice of Peace. With respect to the present case, I declare, for my own part, I never did hear such an one in all my life; and I do hope, from my heart, I never shall hear such another; and the question, under the particular circumstances of this case, will be, whether there has been any thing done more than was necessary to do, to put the poor woman in that state, that it was impossible for her to make any defence; and that the prisoner could do what he pleased with her, without her being able to make any resistance. Now, what would be so effectual to secure her property, as to handcuff her? What pretence for it? The woman was only charged with an assault; no felony: no fear of her escaping from him: she was no dangerous person; she would have walked with him if he had insisted on it, without being put into a coach, and linked, as she was, to another offender, let it be who it would; but it was not to a woman, it was to a man. Now, with what sort of view, or to what intent or purpose, could this be? Could it be with a good intent? Why, you hear, as soon as he comes into the coach, he takes a shilling from her: she would have given him all she had, to let her return to her children; but he is not content with the shilling; he puts his hand into her pocket, and takes all the money he could find: - What pretence for that? Then he begins to try to soften her a little, by telling her he would give her a glass of gin, and that shilling would pay for it; then he throws out, that he would carry her back to her husband (and the coachman says she offered to give any thing in the world): then it is that she consents to his keeping that money, on those conditions. He promises to do it, but does he do it? No, he carries her immediately to gaol. But if you had been robbed on the highway, and you had promised the robber that if he would do such an act, you would consent to his keeping your money, yet that leaves it in the same state in which he took it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290089"></xptr> without the consent of the owner. I think this is a matter to be left to you entirely, whether you think he took this money from the prosecutrix with a felonious intent, putting her in a state of incapacity to make any defence, when he thought proper to invade her property; and if you think so, then, under the circumstances of the case, I think you may find the prisoner guilty of the felony charged against him in the indictment; and if you should find him guilty, I shall take the opinion of all the Judges upon it: but if you are not satisfied in your mind and conscience, then some other mode of punishment must be found out for him; therefore, I leave it to you, If you think it was only a fraudulent scheme, a mere delusive invention of his to colour over a fraudulent and felonious intent to take her money, you may in that case find the prisoner guilty; if you are not of that opinion, you will acquit him.</p>

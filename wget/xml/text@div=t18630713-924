I am an engraver of 30, Castle-street, Holborn—on 3d July, at 11.30 at night, I was coming down Holborn, and, at the corner of Castle-street, I met the prisoner—he inquired the way to Euston-square, and I directed him—he then asked me the way to Leather-lane, and left me suddenly—when he was crossing the road I put my hand to my waistcoat<lb></lb>pocket and missed my watch—I had seen it safe about five minutes before—I cried out, "Stop thief," and he was in the constable's hands when I came up—I never lost sight of him—he was just off the kerb, walking in the road, when I missed it—when he found I was coming after him he ran as hard as he could.</p>

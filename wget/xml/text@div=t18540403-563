                  </hi>. I am the widow of the late George William Giles; he was a law writer, and was aged thirty-two years—we lived before this oocur<lb></lb>rence, in Feb., at No. 1, Princes-street, Commercial-road, Lambeth—I have one child. On Saturday night, 25th Feb., he came home about 12 o'clock at night—in consequence of what he said he and I went out together, a little after 12 o'clock; we went to the end of the Cornwall-road together—I saw the prisoner, who was then a policeman, <hi rend="italic">L</hi> 103—my husband said to him, "103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will go and report you"—the prisoner took hold of him by the collar, and said, "You are come out again, are you? now I will take you"—I put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said, "Don't take him! don't take him! he will not report you"—the prisoner said; "If you don't get away, I will take you both"—my husband struggled—I had bold of his right arm, and he had a roll of paper in his right hand—he had' no stick, only a roll of paper—I believe he struck the prisoner with the roll of paper, but it must have been very slightly, for I had hold of his right arm—the prisoner had bold of him all the time—when my husband struck him, or was supposed to strike him, the prisoner said, "That will do, old fellow; that will do, old fellow; come along, old fellow; come along, old fellow;" and he took his staff out of his pocket, and struck my husband across the head twice—he struck him behind the left ear, towards the back part of the head; the blows were very severe—when the prisoner struck my husband he dropped the paper, and took hold of me with both hands round the waist, and I and my husband both fell on the ground—it was the weight of my husband taking hold of me made me fall—I heard some one say, "You are exceeding your duty, policeman;" that was said at the same time that the blows were given, or directly afterwards—I did not see the person come up who said that—when I and my husband went down, I remember the prisoner kneeling on one knee by the side of us—I am sure no one but the prisoner struck my husband—the prisoner sprung his rattle, and another officer, <hi rend="italic">L</hi> 181, came up—the prisoner took my husband to the Tower-street station, and I went there too—my husband was locked up and in the morning I procured bail, and he was liberated—I brought him; home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about half-past 10 or 11 o'clock—he complained very much of his head, and he went to bed directly after he got home—he did not get up till tea time—I called him to get up, and he again complained—I felt his head, and found a lump on his head behind the ear, on the left side; that was the position in which the blow was given, in which the staff came down—the blows were delivered very near together—from that time down to the time my husband died, he very often made complaints respecting the pain in his head—he complained at times, and at times he went to his work—he did not go to his work continuously, as at other times—he was irregular, and one week he stayed away entirely; that was the middle week—he complained of his sight failing; he said his sight was going away—he often complained of being giddy, and of a weight in his head—I requested him to go to a surgeon—on Sunday, 19th March, I went to the station, in Tower-street, about 10 o'clock in the morning—I found my husband there; he did not know me, he was quite unconscious—from there he was taken to the workhouse; they would not allow him to go to the hospital—he never spoke to me again—he expired the next day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you know that he was taken up drunk on the night he was taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not seen him since the morning—it was quite uncertain about his coming home to dinner; sometimes he did not—it was on Satur<lb></lb>day night he was taken—when he went out he was going for some deposi<lb></lb>tions—this occurred in the Commercial-road, near the Cornwall-road—there were not a good many persons about when I went up, there was only the prisoner and an old woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a batter, and live at No. 52, Commercial-road, Lam<lb></lb>beth—on the night of the 25th Feb., I was at the corner of Cornwall road, about 12 or half-past 12 o'clock—as I was turning out of the Cornwall-road to the Commercial-road, I saw a policeman (the prisoner) and a man strug<lb></lb>gling together—the policeman was shoving him forward by the collar—I saw the man resist him a little, and say he would not be shoved, or something, and the policeman took out his staff and hit him upon the head with it, and the man, I think from the effect of the blow, fell on the ground—I saw two blows struck, on the left side of the head, as near as I could tell—he had hold of his collar with his left hand, and struck him with the truncheon in his right hand—I should say they were very severe blows—I went up to the policeman and told him I thought he was exceeding his duty by striking the man with his truncheon—after the policeman struck the man, the man went down on his side or his back, and the policeman went down on his knees, and held the man on the ground for some short time—he then got up and sprung his rattle, and another policeman, Kennedy, 181<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., came to his assistance—he told the other policeman that this man had struck him with a stick, and he took the deceased man to the station—I likewise fol<lb></lb>lowed, to state to the inspector what I had seen—the widow went with me, and the other policeman—I stated to the inspector, after the charge was made, what I had seen of it; and the prisoner turned round and accused me with throwing him down first, and attempting to rescue the deceased—I had not attempted to rescue the deceased man—I had not laid my hand on the policeman—when the prisoner charged me, I was locked up for the night, and brought before the Magistrates on the Monday morning—I was bound over to appear on the next Monday—eventually the deceased man was bound over to appear at the Sessions, and I was discharged—I did not see</p>

               <p>again to its position—the deceased exhibited signs of consciousness about 2 o'clock in the morning—I never left him at all—as I sat on the bedside he lifted up his eyes and looked at me—I said, "Where do you feel the most pain?" he could not speak—I said, "Is it your head?" he nodded his head—I took his hand, and said, "Can you place my hand where you feel most pain?" he lifted my hand, but he could not do it—he died at 5 minutes before 2 o'clock in the middle of the day, on Monday—I see a great many accidents—this was a fracture, one part was under the other—I saw the fracture after his head had been shaved—the fracture was where I saw one portion under the other—that was immediately under the puffed swelling—I am quite sure that after they took the scalp away, I saw the scull was fractured; it was a long fracture, running along about the midway to the ear—it was a fracture that would come from external violence—there was a little mark below the ear, as there will be after a blow has been given some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and am assistant to Mr. Juke; he is the medical officer of the Lambeth workhouse—I saw the deceased man on Sunday, 19th March, between 11 and 12 o'clock; he was labouring under compression of the brain, arising from an effusion of blood and serum—I treated him for compression of the brain—I caused his head to be shaved, and afterwards examined his head—I found a long, puffy swelling on the left side above and behind the ear, about 3 inches in length, and 2 in width, and about 1/4 of an inch deep—an incision was made in the swelling, by Mr. Juke; a large quantity of coagulated blood was found in the swelling, which was removed—on further examination we found the edges of a fracture—he continued to grow worse—we thought it necessary to trepan him, which was done with a circular saw, and immediately under the bone of the scull coagulated blood was seen, very firmly coagulated, and as far as we could find out, a very large quantity—as much of this blood as possible was removed, but the man never rallied—he died on the Monday, a little before 2 o'clock—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination made in my presence—we found the brain was healthy—immediately below the fracture the dura mater had been separated from the scull; that would be separated by the effused blood, and that was very firmly coagulated—the scull was found to be very extensively fractured—a fracture, from 5 to 6 inches in length, extending along the side of the head above the ear, from front to back, on the left side—I observed more carefully the character of the external bruise—I believe the bruise had existed for some days—I do not think that coagulation of the blood could have taken place on the Saturday night—I should think it had been coagulating for several days; for a fort-night, or perhaps more—the fracture might have been occasioned by a blow or a fall—I should think a common fall in the street would not have caused it—supposing it was done with a short stick, like a policeman's truncheon, it would have required considerable force to cause it—there was a rupture of one of the vessels of the dura mater—the cause of the man's death was compression of the brain, brought on from external violence—supposing that force had been used two or three weeks, and a slow effusion was coming on, the effect would be dimness of vision and giddiness almost constantly—if a man were to hold his head down, the effects would be disagreeable; it would produce giddiness and pain—the effect of such a blow on the brain would cause excitement—it would appear like the excitement of intoxication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose there was a pressure of blood on the brain, causing apoplexy, and so death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the blood of course being extra<lb></lb>vasated</p>

               <p>from one of the vessels; that arising probably from the blow—I cannot say conclusively that it arose from the blow—in point of fact, these vessels burst from drunkenness, constantly; but in drunkenness, when they do burst, they are generally more inside—this, I should rather say, would have been the result of an injury—if this had been a blow on the kerb, it would have broken his skull if he had fallen with violence—the brain, generally, was healthy—I did not see any indication of drunkenness.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect the night of 25th Feb., when there was this disturbance—I and my wife were sitting together; we had just finished supper; I heard a disturbance—my wife went to the window and looked out, and then threw up the window—she was at the window previous to my being there—she said, "Here are some men going to fight"—I said, "Is there?" and I went to the window—she said, "There is a policeman coming round the corner"—I went to the window that my wife was at, and there were two men and a female, and the policeman had just come up under the window—I passed from that window to the other; I thought I should have more view—by the time I got to the other window they were all huddled in the doorway, the policeman, the female, and two or three men, and they were striking the policeman over the head with a stick, or cane, about the size of a man's fore finger—I had a good view of them—I could not see who it was struck the policeman, but he was struck twice or thrice—he ran, and got hold of one man by the collar, and pulled him from the doorway—they were all knocking against the door, ready to break it in—the policeman pulled him away from the door—the female clung either to the policeman or another man, and the policeman pulled him out with violence, and they all fell backwards on the ground together, and the policeman was undermost—they had scarcely been down a minute or two before I saw the policeman's arm go upwards—I then heard some one call out, "Murder! by a b—policeman, 103!"—he still continued these epithets for five minutes or upwards, and during that time the policeman sprang his rattle three distinct times, and the bystanders were uttering the most offensive epithets, and told him they wished his b——soul were burning in hell—I considered that the policeman acted with great patience, according to the way in which he was treated—from the time he got on his legs he did not strike any blow or utter any epithets, to my knowledge—from the manner in which he was lying down, with those persons on him, there was a difficulty in his getting up, because he was lying down on his back—I had sufficient light to see that he was undermost—I saw one man run away—I heard the other man call him for that a b—coward—I saw another man come to the police<lb></lb>man's assistance, and I heard him say, "I give this man into custody;" but what man it was I could not see—inquiry was made about me on the Monday month afterwards—I was at my work—I was called for, and was examined before the Coroner—I told the same story—I am quite disin<lb></lb>terested; I never knew the prisoner or the sergeant—I called out of the window, "Lock him up, policeman, for disturbing the neighbourhood"—my wife said, "He is taken to the station house," and she said to me, "You had better come to bed," or I would willingly have gone down.</p>

               <p>a man and a woman—I could not distinguish who the others were—I could see a policeman with his coat and shining hat, and not only that but by the way in which he was using his staff on the ground—he struck him only once—I might say they were about nine feet from me when he was using his staff—from the confusion, I do not know whether the woman was clinging to the policeman or the other man; she might be clinging to both—I did not say before the Coroner, that somebody said they hoped the policeman's b——y soul would burn in hell—it took me by such a <hi rend="italic">nonplus</hi>—when a thing of this kind happens, we think no more of saying any more of it—I did not think about it from the time it happened till I was called on—the only reason why I did not tell this dreadful language to the Coroner, was I was taken at a <hi rend="italic">nonplus</hi>—the blow the policeman struck, appeared to me not a very hard one—he laid on his back—my opinion is he did not strike him hard at that time—I do not think it was such a blow as would fracture a man's scull.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 181). On the night of 25th Feb., I came to the assistance of my brother constable—I did not distinctly hear the rattle, but I heard a noise—I know the house where the Mitchells live; it is right opposite there—I found the prisoner, and Giles, and Scott there—Giles was the worse for liquor; he was not drunk but in a very excited state, and using very bad language—they were taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the district surgeon of the <hi rend="italic">L</hi> division—I saw the deceased at the station; he was drunk—I considered at the time that he was suffering from nothing but drunkenness, but since I have heard the evidence of the other medical men, I consider there were joint causes—he spoke to me that evening at the station sensibly, as far as a drunken man could—he complained of having pains in his head.</p>

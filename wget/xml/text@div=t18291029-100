               <p>ANN FREEMAN. I am a widow, and live in Spitalfields. At ten o'clock at night on the 16th of September, I was in <placeName id="t18291029-100-crimeloc555">Whitechapel</placeName>

            . I was on duty, and the prosecutrix called Watch! I took the prisoner, who had then got away from her; she charged him with stealing eight shillings and a half-sovereign - she was a little in liquor, but told her story sensibly, and she knew the prisoner next morning; when I got up he said she was his grandmother - her hands were black and blue. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to me; the prosecutrix did not appear quite sober, but was not drunk; she charged him with stealing a half-sovereign and some silver - I asked what money he had; he said two sixpences and some halfpence - I put my hand into his pocket, and found a half-sovereign, a sixpence, and 5d. in copper; the prosecutrix's wrist was very much bruised, and some blood was on her apron and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were three of them fighting together; she was so intoxicated she was forced to be dragged to the watch-house - she first said she lost 8s., and then 14s.; at the watch-house, when she saw the half-sovereign, she said I took that - I knew I had the half-sovereign, but I wanted to keep it back to give my sister in the morning, when I thought I should be let out- I never said she was my grandmother; I was going to Mr. Robinson's, a hair-dresser, at Bow, for whom I had worked; the prosecutrix, a man, and a woman were fighting - she asked me to wipe her face, and I did; she then forced me into a gin-shop, to have something to drink, and when we came out she said I had robbed her.</p>

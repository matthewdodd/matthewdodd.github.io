I reside at 23, Nelson-square, Peckham—the deceased, Mr. Briggs, was a relation of my wife's—I believe he was sixty-nine years of age, and about five feet nine or ten inches in height—he came to our house on 9th July, almost exactly at 5 o'clock; he came very punctually—he had a black bag with him, out of which he took something at our house—he dined with us that day, and left about half-past 8—I accompanied him from my house to the Lord Nelson, in the Old Kent-road, and saw him into an omnibus—he would get out at King William-street, for the purpose of going to Fenchurch-street railway-station—when I parted with him he was in his usual health and spirits—I know the general appearance of the watch be used to wear; I could not swear to it—I know he wore a watch and chain; be used to wear it in his waistcoat-pocket, attached to a button-hole, the chain attached to his button-hole at one end and the watch in his pocket—he had a small seal attached to the watch, and two keys—I am sure he had his watch that night, from his referring to it before he left my house to see whether he was in time for the train—in consequence of some informa<lb></lb>tion that I received I went next morning to the railway, and then to Mr. Briggs's house; it was between 10 and 11 in the forenoon—he was still alive, but quite insensible, and remained so until he died—I left before he died, but I understand he died before midnight—while I was there he did not recover consciousness.</p>

               <p>about twenty minutes past 10, on the night of 9th July—in consequence of a cry I heard on the line, I went up the embankment—it is a steep em<lb></lb>bankment—I dare say it is about eight or nine steps up to it—there is a kind of path made there, by persons going up and down, at the corner of the bridge—I saw several persons carrying a gentleman down off the line—I accompanied the persons who carried him, to the Mitford Castle public-house—I saw his condition, and sent for a surgeon—I searched him, and found four sovereigns and some keys in his left-hand trousers' pocket—in the vest pocket I found a florin and half of a first-class ticket of the North London Railway—in the right-hand trousers' pocket there was ten shillings and sixpence, in silver and copper, and some more keys—I also found a silver snuff-box, and a number of letters and papers, and a silk-handker<lb></lb>chief, and there was a diamond-ring on the little finger, which I took away—there was a gold fastening attached to his waistcoat, but I could not undo it—it was a patent fastening—I saw that his shirt was much rumpled, and there was one black stud in the front, which I took also, only one—I have measured the distance from Bow Station to the spot where the body was found—it is 1,434 yards, and from the spot to Hackney-wick Station is 740 yards—the whole distance from Bow to Hackney-wick is a mile and 414 yards—I have not measured the distance from Hackney<lb></lb>wick to Hackney.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, carrying on my business at Lower Clapton—I was the usual medical attendant of the late Mr. Briggs, and had been so for some years—I believe him to have been in his 70th year—he enjoyed very good health until this spring, when he had an illness, erysipelas, from which he had perfectly recovered, but he was in danger for some time—on the morning of 10th July, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was sent for—I arrived between 2 and 3—I cannot speak to half an hour—it was before 3—I found Mr. Briggs still living—he was groaning, but perfectly unconscious—I was with him from time to time, until he died at a quarter to 12 on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose it was a hopeless case from the commencement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever could have been done in a surgical point of view—I made a careful post-mortem examination on the Tuesday following, in the presence of Mr. Brereton, Mr. Cooper, and other gentlemen—I made notes of it immediately afterwards, as soon as I returned home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I dare say, from your recollection, you can tell us what was the state of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The cartilage of the left ear was severed by a jagged wound—about an inch anterior to that ear was a deeper wound, that extended to the bone, if not <hi rend="italic">into</hi> it; that I will not undertake to say exactly, but it was <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the bone—over the temporal muscle was a contused wound, a superficial and grazed wound, not a deep wound, what one would call a contused wound—there were several wounds on the scalp, incised wounds; I think as many as four, and one other, that was near the crown of the head, (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position</hi>)—it was rather behind the others, but on the crown of the head, a little behind what we term the vertex—that was an incised wound, three inches in length—the others were about three-fourths of an inch in length, and all having a direction from before to behind—that applies to all the wounds on the top of the head—those wounds all extended through the hairy scalp, down to the pericranium, the membrane that invests the skull, but had not divided that membrane—on removing the scalp, the skull was found to be extensively fractured, the fissures extending in various directions, radi<lb></lb>ating as it were from the centre—I have here some sketches that were taken—it is not quite possible to say whether that implies one blow, or more—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240008"></xptr>
               <p>in this centre, a portion of the outer commencement of the parietal bone was separated entirely, about three-fourths of an inch in length, and half an inch in width—that was perfectly separated, and fell out—it was a triangular portion, quite detached—there was effusion of blood between the scalp and the calvarium, or skull-cap—there was a large quantity between the scalp and the skull, or bones of the skull—there was further blood between the skull-cap and the dura mater, or investing membrane of the brain—I have not described all the wounds, though probably enough—besides these, the temporal bone was driven in upon the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the wounds all, or any of them, in your opinion, inflicted by a blunt or a sharp instrument? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The wounds on the top of the head I cannot account for, except upon the presumption that they were inflicted by a blunt instrument, used with considerable force—the wound on the left ear I believe to have been also inflicted by a blunt instrument, but of that I will not speak so certainly; that was my impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether many blows had been struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were four or five distinct wounds on the scalp, which would account, I pre<lb></lb>sume, for so many distinct blows—my observation as to their being made with a blunt instrument applies to all of those, and I am especially guided to that, by what I referred to just now, namely, that the pericranium was not divided, which I assume it would have been if a sharp instrument had been used—there was no wound about the head that could be attributed to a sharp instrument.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you judge from the appearances in what manner those wounds had been inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made, at the time, two distinctions between the wounds; that is between the wounds on the vertex of the head, and those on the left side of the head—I thought the wounds on the left side of the head were owing to the fall from the carriage, and the wounds above I attributed to some blunt instrument, probably used with violence—he did not recover his consciousness during the time I was with him—I was with him the whole night, up to 6 next morning—he was then attended by Mr. Toulmin, his ordinary medical attendant—I made some examination of the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 55, Cheapside, and am by business a jeweller—I know the prisoner very well—I first saw him on Monday, 11th July; he came into the shop just before 10 o'clock in the morning—a chain was pro<lb></lb>duced to my brother—I was called into the shop by my brother—chains were being shown to the prisoner on the counter—my brother handed me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240012"></xptr>
               <p>a chain, saying that the customer wished to part with it in exchange, asking me to value it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the chain and appendages—(<hi rend="italic">This was numbered</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">produced by Kerressey</hi>)—I examined the chain closely with a magnifying glass in the presence of the prisoner—I then went behind him to weigh it in some scales that were fixed there—as I did so, he turned round to see me do it—I weighed the chain, and then told him that I would give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he silently accepted that; tacitly accepted it—I understood him to accept that price—he was to take a chain in exchange—there were chains before him at the time—he then said, "I want one of the same cost"—I under<lb></lb>stood of the same value; but that was the term he used—I then selected a chain at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was the nearest in price there—he made some objection to that—he said he objected to it on account of its having the drop appendages like this—it was a chain that hung in this form—it was objected to, but I persevered to sell that chain, and he then said he would take it if I would give it to him for the same sum, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—that I said I would not do—I then looked in my stock, and found a chain at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I showed him that, and he very shortly accepted that chain—I then asked my brother for a box, which he handed to me—I put the chain that he had bought into the box, and made a parcel of it, and gave it to him—after a moment's pause, I said, "What will you take for the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—he immediately answered, "A finger; ring"—I showed him about half a dozen on a card, one of which was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took that from the card, and gave it to him to try—he put it on his finger; it fitted him, and after some little observation of it, he accepted it for the balance—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is the box; the same shape, size, and colour as the one in which I packed the chain—I believe it to be the same box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now just take into your hand that chain the prisoner left with you, and that jump-ring, as it is called. Can you tell me whether or not that ring ever formed part of that chain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There must have been a jump-ring to this chain at this junction to connect the two parts of the chain and the hook together—there is now a piece of wire to it (<hi rend="italic">examining it through a magnify<lb></lb>ing glass</hi>) it is the same as when I examined it at first—it is a common pin without a head, bent round, which serves the same purpose; but the two parts of the chain are likewise held together by a piece of string, which con<lb></lb>nects this T with the chain, and that piece of string must have connected the chain for a length of time, so that the chain would not break when the jump-ring was taken away—the piece of string has been used for the purpose of attaching a gold key to the chain, so that the chain would not part on the jump-ring being broken—it is in the same condition as it was when I first saw it—I sent a letter by post to Inspector Kerressey at Bow that same afternoon, as the prisoner had been there in the morning, and afterwards went with the officers to New York—the ring had a white Cornelian stone with a head rudely engraved upon it.</p>

               <p>not he came in the slipper on the Saturday—he wore a slipper during the day, on the right foot, in fact, he wore two slippers, because he was in the habit of taking off his boots when he came to my house, and putting on his slippers—I remember seeing him with slippers on during the day—I did not see him leave that night—I was out when he left—I have here the slipper of the left foot, which I found after he was gone—the right slipper was gone—he had his boots with him during the day, two boots—whether he came in them or not on the Saturday morning I can't say—he might have had one in his pocket—the two boots were by the side when he changed them, to put on his slippers—when he left neither of those boots remained, they were both gone—he took away both boots, and one slipper—I recollect his changing his clothes that day; he had on a pair of green and black trousers when he came to my house in the morning, and he changed them for a pair of striped ones, an older pair, to sit at work in—when he went away he put on the newer pair, for the working pair was left—I saw him on the Monday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock—he then had on a pair of light trousers—he came in both boots on the Monday morning—he showed me a chain on that Monday morning—I believe this chain (No. 2) to be the same that he showed me—he said he had paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it in the Docks that morning—he had a ring on his finger—it was a plain gold ring with a white stone—he said he had paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that—he said he had got it at the same place that he bought the chain—my husband saw him on the Monday morning as well as myself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Saturday, 9th July, according to your recollection, what hat had Muller on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief that is the one, the old one, the</p>

Hodgkinson were sending him out to New York—we of course knew different—he said that he had told Mrs. Blyth that Mr. Hodgkinson was sending him over to America—he did not tell me that he had said he was to have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my husband wears a hat—I could not tell you what was the lining of it—I have constantly had Muller's hat in my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What business had you with the hat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have put it in my way, and I might have moved it—if it was in my way I had a right in my own place to move it—I was asked just now to describe the hat before it was produced—I saw it at the police-court and before the Coroner—I had it in my hand there—I know Haffa—I have known him about twelve months or more—he has been in the habit of coming to my house, but not of working for me—he works for Mr. Hodgkinson—he does so at the present time—I have known Muller nearly two years—Huffa was constantly in the habit of coming to my place—he wore a hat—I can't tell you the lining of it—I have several male friends who come to my house—I cannot tell the lining of any of their hats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then this is the only hat that you looked into so often? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the lining that took my attention—I cannot say how many times I looked into the hat—I cannot undertake to say whether I looked into it thirty, forty, or fifty times—I cannot say whether I looked inside it each time I had it iu my hands—I will not say that I have looked into it thirty or forty times—I may have done so—I know a person named Jonathan Matthews, a cabman—my husband knows him—I have not known him so long as eight years—I should think about six—it was six years ago when I first met him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after you heard of this murder did you see Matthews? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not until after he came from New York—I had not seen him for years, not for all three years—I did not see him before he went to New York.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the habit of visiting Matthews at all, or he you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I went there about twice, not more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner, about a month or two months before the 9th of July, buy some new clothes, to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Merely a pair of trowsers—I did not ask him about a month or two months before to lend me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—</p>

               <p>oh! yes, I did—I cannot remember his saying that he could not do it because he was going to buy a new hat—I do not swear it—I don't believe I said, "Oh! pooh, pooh, you may as well lend me the money"—I don't think I did—I cannot swear it, because I do not remember it—I cannot swear it did not pass—I don't remember his saying it—I remember asking for 5 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he lent it to me—I did not say that just now, because I was not asked—he did not say he could not lend it me, he gave it to me—I did not say that just now in answer to your question, because you put another question to me and I had not time; that was my reason, and no other—I don't remember his making any excuse about his going to buy a new hat, because he gave me the money—I have repaid him that;—we settled it—I believe that was the only time I borrowed money from him—I cannot swear it—I cannot swear whether I have borrowed money of him before—my husband was not by when he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he knew nothing at all about it—I do not remember Muller saying anything to me about anew hat, nor do I remember saying to him, "You can buy a new hat next week," or anything to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me that you had not seen Mr. Matthews at all until he returned from New York; had you seen Mrs. Matthews? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only at the Court—she had not called on me—I saw her at the Court, and only at the Court—I am quite sure of that—I do not expect any of this reward—I cannot say whether the prisoner had the same dress on, except the trousers, on the Monday that he had on the Saturday—I could not say whether he had the velvet-collared coat or the morning coat on.</p>

I am in the employment of Mr. Hodgkinson, and have been so for some time—I have known the prisoner about four years—I don't know particularly how long the prisoner Was in Mr. Hodgkinson's employment; I came to Mr. Hodgkinson after him, so that I do not know how long he had been there—on Tuesday, 12th July last, he came to me in Mr. Hodgkinson's shop about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—he offered me a gold watch—he said if I would not buy it he had not money enough to go to America—he said he had a gold chain pledged with a pawnbroker for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he did not say how much he wanted me to buy the watch for—he said he would go to the pawnshop and pawn the watch and chain together, and then he supposed he should get 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the watch—I had seen him wear ring that watch before; it was his own watch that he had been in the habit of wearing—I told him to come again the next morning; he did come about 9 o'clock next morning, and he and I went together to a pawnbroker's, named Barker; I forget the name of the street—we both went into Mr. Barker's shop and took a chain out of pawn [No. 3]—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get that chain out of pawn—we then went together to Mr. Cox's, in Princes-street, Leicester-square, and there pawned the watch that he had offered me the day before, and the chain that I had just got out of pawn, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Muller took the money, I took the ticket—this is it; it is in my name—I gave the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the ticket—I gave the pound <hi rend="italic">to</hi> redeem the chain, so that I paid 11. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—he and I then went together in an omnibus as far as the Bank—we there parted—he said he was going to the London Docks to get a ticket to go to America.</p>

               <p>—on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> June I took in a gold Albert chain—I have got the ticket—I believe I took in the chain of the prisoner—this is the chain—I advanced 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—the ticket was renewed, that is, the prisoner had a fresh ticket, on 12th July, his ticket having got damaged, and it was redeemed on 13th July, the next day, I believe, by Muller, but I did not deliver it myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver—I know the prisoner—I had known him two years and some few weeks before 9th July last; I could not say exactly—I became acquainted with him by his working with a brother-in-law of mine—he frequently came to dine with my brother-in-law, being a stranger in the country, and by that means I came to know him—from that time I have seen him, from time to time, perhaps twice or three times in a month—he sometimes came to my house, and I have several times been to see him; I always found him at work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember anything passing between you and Muller on the subject of a hat, towards the end of last year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—I should think it must have been the latter end of November or the beginning of December, I could not say to a week—I had a new hat, he came to dine with me on the Sunday after I bought it; he saw me have it on, and said he should like one like it—he looked at the hat, and put it on his head—it was a little too small for him—he asked me what I gave for it; I told him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he said he would like one like it, and I told him I would get him one if he pleased—he put it on his head, and said it was a little too tight, and I said, "If I get one a little too easy for myself it will suit you nicely"—he said, "Yes," and consequently I got one for him—I got it at the same shop, Mr. Walker's, a hat-maker's, in Crawford-street, Marylebone—the lining of that hat had a kind of resemblance of being a striped lining—I ordered it on the Friday or Saturday—I told one of the men I should want one, and I went on the Saturday evening and bought one, and my wife went with me—I took it away with me in a hat-box—it remained in my house until the Sunday week following, when Muller came for it—he took it away in the hat-box—I paid for the hat; I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—Muller did not pay me again; he made me a waistcoat in return for it, which I now wear, a black waistcoat—after that I frequently saw Muller wearing that hat—about the latest time that I saw him wearing it, was, I should think, about a fortnight previous to the murder—I gave a description of that hat to the police before I saw it—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) to be the hat that I purchased for him; it corre<lb></lb>sponds exactly—before I brought it out of the shop I had it turned up a little extra at each side—after I had purchased it I said I should like it turned up the same as the one I had the week previous, consequently they it while I was there—I noticed that there was a little curl in the brim</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240024"></xptr>
               <p>the last time I had it in my hand, and I said to Muller, "Have you had it done up?"—he said, "No"—I said, "The hat wears uncommonly well"—the under part of the brim is merino, the same as mine—all my hats were much about the same—if I buy a hat I prefer it being merino, because of its not wearing so greasy as the nap—there is no nap on the under part of this brim—I remember seeing a box at my house, a small jeweller's box—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same box—it is the box that I put <hi rend="italic">my</hi> foot on, on the Tuesday morning—I noticed it on the Tuesday morning—that was the Tuesday week following the murder—I subsequently saw a handbill, and gave information to the police—I took the box to the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As I understand, be par<lb></lb>ticular in answering me, you identify this hat by the side portion of the rim being turned up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not only by that; that is one thing—I am quite sure of that—I had that done in the shop; I had the rim so turned—my hat was exactly like this, as near as they could possibly get it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say before the Magistrate that one of your means of iden<lb></lb>tifying that hat was this: that three weeks prior to 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July you saw the prisoner, and that the brim of his hat was turned up in one part of it more than another, and you told him so? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> did so—I never mentioned before to-day that I had the two edges turned round myself, at my own request, at the shop where the hat was bought—I said, before the Coroner, "I saw him frequently wearing that hat, and I had noticed and remarked upon its wear<lb></lb>ing so well; I fancied one side was turned up more than usual, and pointed it out to him; I said it was not altered in shape, and I suggested that it might have been done from his lifting it from his head on that side"—I cannot tell you how many hats I have bought—I could not tell you the number that I bought within six or twelvemonths of 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July—I could not say what has become of the hat that I bought, which was just like this, but I think I left it at one of the hatter's shops that I have bought hats at since the one I bought at Mr. Walker's—the hat I now wear I bought in Oxford-street, at Mr. Mummery's—I did not leave my other hat there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not stated that you left it at Mr. Down's the hatters in Long<lb></lb>acre, three weeks before 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stated that I left one there, but I could not say to the time—I did not say so—I believe it was some time, bat I could not state the time positively—I said, "I purchased a hat also at Mr. Down's in Long-acre, and left my old one there; that was about three weeks before I bought the one in Oxford-street; I wore my old hat home when I purchased the new one in Oxford-street"—I bought the one in Oxford-street, I should think it was, I could not say for a few days, before I went to America.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you buy the one at Down's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I have had two hats; when I came to look at home, and I could not say which of the Down's I bought it at, whether it was the one in the Strand, who used to make for me, or the one in Long-acre, but I find I am in error about my hats altogether; I have had so many that I could not say how many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say this, "The next hat I purchased was about June, of Down's in Long-acre; it was a cheap one, I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it I left the other one at Down's?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say so; that was not true, because it was longer ago—I could not say the time exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you bought a hat a few days before you went to America; when did you go to America? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell at this moment—I left home on 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July, and sailed on 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> from Liverpool—I went with Mr. Tanner—I mean when I went to America on this matter.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240025"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want particularly to call your attention to what you said before the Coroner, "The next hat I purchased was about June, of Down in Long-acre; it was a cheap one, I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> for it. I left the other one at Down's;" did you say that before the Coroner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said so, but it was a mistake of mine; I did not know bow many hats I had had till I got home—I found I had several there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you since found out that three weeks before you were examined before the Coroner there was no such shop as Down's a hatter in Long-acre? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did make that inquiry, and then I looked at home to see what number of hats I had had—I found that Down's shop in Long-acre had been shut up for some time—when I came to look at my hats I was surprised to see that I had so many at home as I had; that made me make inquiry—I had two of Down's hats before—I said before the Magistrate, that I had bought that at Down's a fortnight or three weeks before this job—I found out that was a mistake of mine—Mr. Clark went with me to Long-acre—he is one of the detectives; the sergeant who went to America with me—I told him at the time that I was under a mistake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you believe the hat is now that was just like this; have you any idea whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not—I occasionally throw my hats into the dusthole or some place—I said that before the Coroner—I could not swear to the lining of any of my hats—I could not swear to some of my own hate—I first heard of the murder about the Thursday or Friday of the week following—I think it was the Thursday; that would be about six or seven days after—I mean to say that I had not heard of it before—I had been out with my cab—I have occasionally put on the rank when I wanted something to eat, but I never heard of it—I am not a public-house visitor—I may have been to a public-house perhaps once a. day, to have a glass of ale, not more—I do go into public-houses for refreshment every day—I sometimes take in a newspaper, not regularly—I don't take in any particular paper; occasionally I take Lloyd's—I take a Sunday paper; sometimes I buy a daily paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you saw no paper from 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not bringing the murder to my mind—I never looked at the paper—I did not see it in the paper at all—I did not see it in large conspicuous letters, over and over again, before the Thursday—I live at 68, Earl-street East, Paddington—I know the police-station—I pass it—I could not swear whether I passed it every day from 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—I never saw the placard or noticed it—I did see a placard at the latter end of the week, but not to read it—I knew that Muller was going to America—I gave information to the police on Monday, 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—at that time I knew that Muller had gone by the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> sailing ship to New York—I knew that he was going to sail, according to what he had left word at my house—he called to wish me and my family good-bye. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell me what you were doing on Saturday, 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> was out with my cab, I find—I did not know at the time I was called upon to answer before—I said before the Coroner, "It is impossible for me to say where I was on the night of 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July, I was about with my cab, but I could not say where"—I have since made inquiries to find out where I was—I made inquiries to know whether I was out with my cab or not, on account of losing a pocket-book which I carried, which I have found since, and it is here—I took a piece of paper out of my pocket just now—here it is; you are at liberty to look at it—it is to prove that I was out—Mr. Beard wrote down after my character—this piece of paper is dated September 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—that is the date I wrote to know what day I was out, and that is the return</p>

               <p>letter from my employer, Mr. Perfitt, that I was at work for on the 9th—that inquiry has been made by me since I was examined before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe that your master, Mr. Perfitt, failed, or was "sold up," to use your own expression? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was sold off; that is a mistake, "sold up"—it was a mistake in print—I never said, "sold up," I said, "sold off."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here it is, "Mr. Perfitt lived in Lisson-grove, and was sold up the week after 9th July," you say you said "sold off?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—the deposition was read over to me—I could not tell what day it was that Mr. Perfitt was sold off—I first saw Repsch after I had given information, at Bow-street, when I returned from America—I did not see him before I gave information to the police—I am quite sure of that; not for years previous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a cabman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been licensed be<lb></lb>tween times I suppose about seven or eight years, or eight or nine years; I could not say to a year or two—sometimes I do not hold a license for three or four years between—I have been something else besides a cabman; I have been a coachman, and I have been in training stables—that was, I suppose, twenty-two or twenty-three years ago—since then I have been a cabman—not ever since—sometimes I have been in business—I was in a small fly business, and I was foreman to Mr. Hubble of Camberwell, and to Mr. Langley of Westminster—I have driven for the London General Omnibus Company—I have always been a driver during those twenty-two or twenty-three years—I have never followed any other occupation—I have been an ostler—I have never been coachman to a private gentleman—I know a gen<lb></lb>tleman named Linklater—I was not his coachman or anything—I never lived with him—I never drove for him—I was not in his service—I knew him by living in the neighbourhood—I have never been insolvent or a bank<lb></lb>rupt—I am sure of that; there is no mistake—I was in business at Brixton—I did not fail there; that I swear—I was in business at the Prince of Wales-yard, and at the White Horse-yard, Brixton-hill—that was two years ago last January—I did not fail, or compound with my creditors, nothing of the kind—I gave up the business because I was not getting a living—I owed some money, and I was not able to pay it—I am still in that position.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been to some of your creditors, and stated that as soon as you got your portion of the reward you would be able to settle with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have not been to one of them—I will swear that—I will swear that I have never said that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course you expect a portion of the reward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you are the only person in Court who does not. Do you or do you not expect a portion of this reward of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I leave that entirely if I have done my duty to the country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you do expect a portion of it, do you not, after you have done your duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If they are only satisfied that I have done my duty; if they think proper to reward me, very well—I have no expectation of any<lb></lb>thing—if it had been a plain bill without any reward, I should have done my duty—I did see the reward, but if it had been a plain bill I should have done the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will have an answer; do you expect a portion of the reward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I am entitled to it, I shall expect it—I have never made use of the words that if I had kept my mouth closed a little longer, they would have made the reward 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor anything like it—I said I was given to</p>

               <p>understand on that morning that they were printing bills for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, but had it been a shilling I should have done the same if I had thought of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were once convicted, I think, of a little petty theft, were you not? No theft; it was for absconding, leaving a situation without giving due notice; I swear that—I was conductor of a coach, like most young men at that time, I made a little free, and got out on what we term a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—I merely went away and left the coach without any one to start it—I was convicted of that; the result was that I had twenty-one days, because I could not pay anything—I have been at Norwich—I was not at Norwich in the year 1851—I was there in 1850, not in 1851—I was in prison there for the twenty-one days; nothing else—I cannot tell you the gentleman's name that convicted me for the twenty-one days—I was tried before a jury—it was for a spree—my box was sent home, and they wanted to make a theft of it because I had got a book and a pair of spurs—they did not actually make a theft of it.</p>

D."—there is nothing about the hat that enables me to say when it was made—it has been altered since I made it—a piece has been cut from the band of the hat; removed entirely—I could not say for whom that hat was made—if a hat is made to order, it is my practice to put in it the name of the gentleman for whom it is intended—it is generally put on the band of the hat; but I won't say invariably; I have sometimes marked them higher up—as a general rule, two, three, or four years back, I marked them higher up the crown; but for the last two or three years, I marked them in the band—I won't say I never deviate from that, but that is the practice—it is done for our own convenience in the course of manu<lb></lb>facture.</p>

I live at 4, Bridge-road, Ebury-bridge, Pimlico, and am a hatter—I was brought up to it from a boy—I am acquainted with all the branches of the hat trade, and the second-hand hat trade most particularly—cutting down hats and sewing them is usual in the second-hand hat trade with me and others—it is usual to stitch them when they have been cot down—this hat is not as I should do it, because it is not stuck—I should stick it with dissolved shell-lac, as well as stitch it—that would involve more time and trouble in the work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, St. George's-road, Peckham—I do not know how far that is from Camberwell-gate—in July last I lived at Stanley-cottage, James-street, Vassall-road—I have two female lodgers—they are young women who receive the visits of men—I have a young woman living with me named Mary Ann Eldred—she lives with me still—she has lived with me ten months—I know the prisoner—he has been in the habit occa<lb></lb>sionally of coming to see Mary Ann Eldred—I had known him visiting, her for about nine or ten months before 9th July—she knew him before she came to me—she has known him about twelve months, I believe—I remem<lb></lb>ber her receiving this telegram quite well—I do not recollect what time I received it—it was some time in the afternoon—I saw Müller on 9th July, about half-past 9 in the evening—Mary Ann Eldred was not come home—she had left the house about 9—she had been out about half an hour—Müller called to see her, and found she was not at home—he stayed about five or ten minutes at the door, talking with me—I am sure it was as much as half-past 9—he then left—bearing in mind this telegram, I am sure it was on Saturday, 9th July, about half-past 9, that I saw the young man</p>

               <p>evening—a German gentleman called first, and another gentleman—we did not know before that that Mailer was the man—when the German gentleman came, he asked if we knew him, and when he was at our house last—they called two or three times—I can't say how long the first time was after Mailer called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You remember with minuteness the particulars of Müller's calling on you; I ask you, how long after he called did somebody call to inquire about him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was some weeks after we had seen Müller—the first persons I saw were a German gentleman and another gentleman—we had heard at that time that Müller was suspected, but we did not know whether it was the same or not, as he went by the name of Müller—we did not know it was the same till the German gentleman came—Eldred was with me when the German gentleman came; she was called into the room—she produced the telegram, she had it in her box with other letters and papers—we had not the telegram on the table when he came, it was fetched afterwards—Miss Eldred remembered haying the letter on the same day, and she fetched it—the German gentleman did not mention the day, but Miss Eldred heard that the murder was committed on the 9th—she and I had had conversa<lb></lb>tion about the murder no more than reading the paper—I mean that she was not at all aware that the man accused of the murder was her friend Miller—she had no idea of such a thing for some time, but when we used to read the papers, he being a tailor, and the names being Müller and Müller, we thought it seemed to correspond with the same young man who we knew, also from his being lame when we saw him last, and what was stated in the paper—she did not get out the telegram before the German gentleman came, nor had she said anything about it—she did not know the day till she looked, but she remembered that she had the telegram on the day he last called at our house, and she said, "If I can find the telegram I will, if I have not destroyed it"—when she looked for it she found it—the telegram was not shown to the German gentleman then—it was only two or three weeks ago that it was found—she has always had it by her, but it was never sought for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is six or seven weeks since the German gentlemen came who were assisting in the defence of Müller; if she had the telegram when they called why did not she go and look for it at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might not have thought of it—I do not know whether she told the German gentleman that day that she had the telegram; I was not in the room all the time—nothing was said about the telegram while I was in the room—I remem<lb></lb>bered distinctly that the telegram was received on the day that Muller called last—I did not tell the German gentleman so, but she gave him the letter to convince him as soon as she found it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you tell the German gentleman that Müller had called at half-past 9 on that evening, and that you remembered the day by the tele<lb></lb>gram? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I do not know—I did not interfere with her affairs—I did not think of it at the time; they did not refer to any letter, neither did I—I do not know whether Eldred told him—I left him and her alone in the room both before and after—the first time that Eldred and I had any conversation about the telegram may be three weeks ago, that would be some three or four weeks after the German gentleman called on us—I never knew of it until about three weeks ago, because we did not know the day of the month, but she said, "I had a letter from my friend," calling him by his name," and if I can find that letter I shall know the day of the month;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240044"></xptr>
               <p>I hope I have not destroyed it"—that was two or three weeks ago, and she looked in her box and found it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say how she came to say this two or three weeks ago, never having referred to it before; can you explain that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She remembered having the letter the same day, and she knew if she had to come up she would not like to false swear, and she would know by that letter the date—I took the telegram to Miss Eldred—I have parted with it to the gentlemen who are defending the prisoner—my husband gave it to them in my presence, but not in Miss Eldred's presence; Miss Eldred sent it to him, but she said she did not know if it would be of any service—I think that was a fortnight ago come Tuesday; a week last Tuesday the German gentleman has had the letter in his possession—Miss Eldred brought it down, and gave it to my husband; I saw her do it; it was last Monday week she brought it down, and on the Tuesday she gave it to the German gentleman—I mean that at the time she gave it she said that she did not know it was of any service—Miss Eldred was sometimes in the habit of asking the time before she went out, but not always—I cannot say whether she did so the night before; I think she did—she generally wants to know the time—I cannot say whether she did on the night after—she does not go out on Sunday evenings—I cannot recollect whether she did on the Monday—sometimes she will ask the time three or four times a day—there is no clock in her room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you said that you should never have been able to fix the date unless that telegram had been found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I knew it was on a Saturday—I think it was seven or eight weeks ago when the German gentleman and one of Mr. Beard's clerks came—I told them merely that Müller had called, that he had been in the habit of visiting our house, he called on the Saturday, as we heard of the murder on Tuesday—I was not able to fix the date except by the telegram, but we should have known by hearing of the murder on Tuesday; that made me so positive as to the day of the month—I never eat supper, nor does Miss Eldred, before—she goes out.</p>

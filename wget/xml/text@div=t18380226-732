                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, Foley-place, and am a mechanic. I lost a great coat on Monday evening, the 29th of January, from the passage of the house—the prisoner Raiker is errand-boy to my wife, who is a milliner—he had been with me between three and four months—he did not leave me till the following Monday—I had not dis<lb></lb>charged him, as I did not suspect him—after that he came to my house with his father—the other prisoner was not with them at first—they went and fetched him, and Winsby said he had received the coat at the door of my house from Raiker—Raiker was there, and his father, and the officer, and they brought with them the man who bought the coat of him—his name is Carpenter.</p>

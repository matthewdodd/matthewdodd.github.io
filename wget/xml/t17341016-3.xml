            . I and my Daughter were in the Shop. The Prisoner and another Woman came in, and asked for some Cambletee for a Gown: We agreed for a Shilling a Yard, and then the Prisoner bid me cut off 12 Yards, which I did. Then she felt a good while in her Bosom with her left Hand for her Money, and the same time fumbled under her Apron with her right Hand. I suppose she was hiding the piece of Cambletee. Then she said she had left her Purse at home; and so she laid down half a Crown earnest, and said she would go home for her Purse and come again presently; but as she and her Companion were going out at the Door I mist the piece of Cambletee ; the other Woman run up the Street, and the Prisoner into an Entry; I follow'd her, and brought her back, she said she had got nothing, but the piece was afterwards found in that Entry.</p>

On the 23d of January, about six o'clock, I left my house - my wife went out before me; I left nobody in the house - I double looked the room door, and took the key with me - I pulled the street door after me, on the spring lock, so that it would not open without a key - I am sure I made it fast; I returned home first, about eight o'clock, and found the door open; I found Mary Bigg there - the street door was open and my room door also; a strange key was left in the lock of the room door, but it would not open it, so they had forced away the box of the lock, screws and all. I missed a watch, a chain, and two seals, worth 4l. 10s.; two coats, a waistcoat, a pair of trousers, a scarf, some gowns, and other things, which were all safe when I went out. I had left my watch in the drawer. A pair of blue trousers were produced to me by Miller, the pawnbroker, about the 23d of March.</p>

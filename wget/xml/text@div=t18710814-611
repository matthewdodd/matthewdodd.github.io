                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 17th June, I and another officer were at 4, Highfield Road, West Brompton, it is a nine or ten roomed house—four women and two or three children were there—I could not open a particular room, and could not get the key—a piece of paper was pushed into the key-hole from the inside, and I could not see in—in consequence of that, I got into a position where I could see into the room, and saw the prisoner Green standing by the window with his hand on a table—the blind was down—he had a very large number of letters and invoices before him—we went down the water spout from the landing into the back yard, pushed the window up and got in—I said "Halloa, here you are then," and Green said "Yes, here I am, what are you going to do with me?"—I said "Wait a bit, do not be in a hurry, where is the key of the door?—he pointed to two keys lying on the table, and said "There they are, if you have got any eyes you could see, I should think"—I took one of the keys, pulled a piece of paper out of the key-hole, opened the door, and let in three private persons from Kingston, who I had brought there to identify another person—I was not in uniform—I said "I shall take you in custody for obtaining things at Kingston, by false pretences, and also for stealing them—I took him to Kingston and charged him before a Magistrate there—I took possession of two packages of envelopes and these letters, invoices and bill-heads, newly printed—I only took away a few of them—there were 500 there, and the plate for printing them—I took the letters away with me after the first examination, but unfortunately left the bag in a carnage on the Great Western Railway—it contained the letters and die which would produce the impression, and a brass engraved plate of the bill-heads—I have made every effort to recover the bag—it contained papers with the address "Dorset 'House, Salisbury Square"—I do not think every article in the bag had been shown at the Police Court, but the die had, and so had letters from Mr. Leech, Mr. Daw, Mr. Shaw, Mr. Bradfield, and others, and seen by the different witnesses before they were lost and identified in Green's presence—I tried the die with common ink before I lost it—it produced an impression which I could read—I merely made it for curiosity and threw it away—the boy Hall saw the die before I lost it—these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found at Highfield Road, two reams of bill-heads, about 600 letters and invoices, and about 500 replies relating to fresh butter, 62 or 63 of which are dated 16th June, the day before Green was appre<lb></lb>hended—they were from about two-thirds of the counties of England, Ireland, and Scotland, and one or two from Jersey—some of them relate to varie<lb></lb>ties of produce, other than butter—there may be some as early as March—there are only three letters here which were found at Latimer Road, this banker's pass-book I had seen at Highfield Road, and it was afterwards taken possession of in Latimer Road—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came by post while I was at Latimer Road, and some of the others were afterwards sent to me by post—these marked "L" and "M"</p>

               <p>were found at Latimer Road—on searching Green at Kingston, I found this stamp to stamp the envelopes, in his waistcoat pocket—he refused to give any name on the Saturday—I took him before Sir Robert Garden on the Monday, at Guildhall, where he gave his name Edward Green, he was remanded three or four times to the 6th or 7th July—on 7th July, about 8.20 in the morning, I went to Latimer Road, Netting Hill, and found Newth in bed, on a mattress on the floor—there is no number to the house—it is a milk-shop, called Latimer House Dairy—I recognized some furniture there which I had seen at 4, Highfield Road, but it was bundled up in the rooms as if it had been recently moved in—I saw an elderly woman and two children there, who I had seen at Highfield Road, and Newth's wife was in bed with him—I found about a dozen empty hampers, three of which (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) have been identified—this banker's pass-book was in a drawer or desk, in the bedroom where Newth was sleeping—I walked into the room, and said "Come Newth, get up, you are well aware that I must take you"—he said "Oh, for God Almighty's sake, don't, Mr. Davis, if you do I am a ruined man"—I said "That is nonsense, get up"—he got out of bed and said "I will pray to you"—he went down en his knees on the bare boards, put up his hands and again implored me not to take him—he ultimately dressed himself, and I took him down stairs—while pretending to look for his hat in the kitchen, he bolted away, and slammed the door to—I chased him through the passage—he got out over the wall into the street, where I had a constable outside, and after a very short run, he overtook him, and brought him back to me—I got a cab and took him to Fleet Street Police Station—on the way there, he said "Now, let me beg of you not to be hard with me, for the sake of my wife and children"—I said "I have a duty to perform, and I must do it"—he said "Well, you need not bring out many cases against me; you know you can make it easier if you like"—I took him before a Magistrate the same day—a padlock was found at Dorset House, that was among the things I lost—I showed it to Mr. Leech before it was lost—I also found some boxes of butter there—what was there and what came afterwards, weighed about 500lbs., but a great deal was returned, as I sent notices to all the Railway Stations—I found this ledger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at Dorset House, but no other papers; "E. Green" is on the door—there was a little desk there, nothing else—the office is very small—Mr. Boulger lets the house out in three different offices, and I found this envelope at Latimer Road, addressed to Mr. Boulger, Dorset House, Fleet Street; also this envelope, post mark, 5th July, addressed "Mr. Patterson, 9, St. George's Terrace, Moor Park, Fulham, and another addressed "Immediate. Mr. Green. Take this to the man at the rag shop, and give it to him directly"—the shortest of these two papers I found behind the mantelpiece, in the sitting-room at Latimer Road—I took several papers out of several coat pockets, and on examining them at the station, found this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Bottondey objected to this being read, as it was without a signature, and was not shown to come from Newth's pocket or possession, and the reading was postponed</hi>). I did not speak to him about that letter—while I was there with Newth in custody, a letter was brought addressed to Jones, Latimer House Dairy, Not ting Hill; I took it from a constable, who handed it to me from the postman—I said "Is this for you?—he said "No"—I said "We will open it"—I found this in it, which I read in his presence, and I think he could hear me—he said that he knew nothing</p>

               <p>about it—Boulger's wife had introduced a man, as Green's clerk, when I went to Dorset House on 20th June—this man went out as soon as he came in, and I never saw him afterwards, till I saw him in the kitchen at Latimer House—I passed him, and went up to arrest Newth, and when I came down he was gone, and had left his hat and coat; I understood that his name was Williams—I went again to Latimer House Dairy, but found no person to correspond with C. Jones—I went every day for two or three days, and left a constable there, till about a week after, when the wife took the goods away—no person named Jones ever came to the place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BROWN</hi>. I am inspector at Walworth Station—that is not in Kingston district—the first time I saw Green was on 17th June—not a quarter of what I said was taken down before Sir Robert Carden—I read it over myself, and complained about it to the second clerk, Mr. Davey, I think; I said that the evidence was a mere skeleton, not taken as it ought to have been, and he said "I am aware of it"—I have seen two of the women since, they are Newth's wife and daughter, I believe—one of them was taken in custody—the charge at Kingston was, being concerned with others in obtaining goods by fraud—the prosecutors were Mr. Simmonds, Miss Jones, and several others, not the same persons who prosecute to-day—I had no warrant when I went to the house; I only went there to appre<lb></lb>hend a woman for felony, and she has been sentenced to eighteen months' im<lb></lb>prisonment—I did not know Green was there at all—I had been there half an hour before I got into the room—the window was open about an inch from the bottom, and the blind was down as far as it would come, apparently—I could not see in till I lifted the window and the blind—I should say he could easily have fastened the window if he had tried—I did not say "What are you hiding there for?—I found a black bag in the kitchen; it has no relation to Green, farther than that he was in the house at the time—he was not charged with stealing it, only with having it unlawfully in his possession—most of these letters were found in Green's room; not quite all because I received two or three by post since, which might have got among them—I omitted to say that there were a considerable number torn up, on the floor—I have mixed the documents, but I can easily select them—I found these bill-heads on the table where Green was standing; I took them away, and I have had them ever since—I did not mark them; I simply tied them up in a paper, and brought them here—I did not tell Green I held a warrant; I had not applied for one; I had not seen him—the four women were not in the same room where the black bag was found—I went thereafter a woman, and to find stolen property—my motive forentering that room was to find property—Mrs. Fair is a lady at Kingston, to whom the bag belongs—there is nothing in it—she pointed Green out, and so did Mr. Simmonds—a boy named Collier saw Green at Kingston—I applied for a week's remand—Collier afterwards said he had made a mistake as to the man who stole the bag—I was in Court all the time at Guildhall—I heard Boulger say that Newth was not the man who took his office, that there was another Mr. Green, and that Green was introduced to him as Green's clerk—I had about twenty-five letters in the bag; I separated them to keep the cases separate—I reported the loss to the Magistrate, to his clerk, and to my superiors, and in three minutes after losing it, to the railway authorities and telegraphed for it—the name on the door at Dorset House, "E. Greene," was painted out three or four days afterwards—there was a final "e"—" Dorset House" was on the lamp—it was before the committal that I lost the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOTTOMLEY</hi>. I arrested Newth on 7th July—the name that was up was scarcely legible, having been up a long time—it is a very dirty old place, a sham milk-shop, I should say—the landlord is Mr. Riley—he is not here—he told me that a person took it in the name of Jones—the pass-book I found in the desk was of the Margaret Street Deposit Bank—I had seen that pass-book before at Highfield Road, in the same desk—there were two at Highfield Road; the other, to the best of my belief, was of the Birkbeck Deposit Bank—I did not take possession of them, and when I went there again they were gone—it was the same desk—there were different articles in it, one of which was a box of capsules—I also noticed a very peculiar oval looking-glass, and chairs, and a table, and two desks, which I had seen at Highfield Road—I am certain there was no fur<lb></lb>niture at Highfield Road, at the time I apprehended Newth—after I took Green I put a man in charge, only for one day, while I went to Kingston, and when I went home again the furniture was gone—some of the butter from Dorset House has been sold, and some has been sent to the parties who sent it—I left a constable in possession, but Jones did not come—Scott was examined at the Police Court—he is not here—I sent for him yesterday, and he declined to come—I have not subpoenaed him—the Magis<lb></lb>trate said that his evidence was not important, and he was not bound over—he declined to come without a fee of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had no guinea to give him—either of the prisoners was Green when the occasion suited—Boulger said at the Police Court "The man who took my house was a bigger man than that"—he did not say that he had grey hair—he did not describe his whiskers—I wrote to the six prosecutors, and told them—I found 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Green's pocket—it is in my pocket now, with the exception of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he spent at Kingston for refreshment, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. here.</p>

"I must have money to pay Counsel." "The poor <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> looks very ill; he thought I was going to give evidence against him when I was put in the box, but I only said what the solicitor told me to say; I said he was introduced to me as head clerk to Green, which will account for his having your letter."

Sir. Fresh butter. Kindly say whether you can supply any of the above weekly, and if so, at what price for cash"—I sent an answer to that, and the officer showed me my letter before Sir Robert Garden—it stated that I could supply him—I did not mention the price, and he wrote for a sample, which I sent, and got this cheque in payment, "Pay E. Leach 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Ed.

Green, but not drawn by anyone—I never put my name as drawer on that instrument, and never got any money for it—one of my hampers was produced at Guildhall—I have not seen my other hampers, or the butter cloths—I saw one of my padlocks at the Police Court, in the officer's possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the London Provident Deposit Bank—on 17th April the prisoner Newth opened an account there with 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, in the name of Edward Green—he signed that name, and gave his address 41, Gibson Street, Waterloo Road, fish dealer—we had no occasion to go there—he was furnished with a pass-book—I looked at the Directory, and saw that the address he gave was a coffee-house, and when he called, I mentioned it to him—he said "I am lodging there, because I have not yet got an office"—he subsequently gave his address, 52, Dorset Street, Fleet Street—I received a number of cheques, perhaps thirty have been cashed—the signatures were all the same, and agreed with the signature in the signature book—I believe them to be genuine—this receipt, for 0<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from Mr. Pybus, and the other for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., look very much like the signature on the cheques—the largest amount standing to his account, at any time, was about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am salesman to Henry Bird, of Long Lane, importer of eggs and butter—about the middle of June, Newth came there and asked if we could sell any butter—I said "From the west country?"—he said "Yes, we can sell any quantity of that kind of butter" and that he was a hay and straw salesman, and his friends who sent up hay and straw sent him butter—he gave me the name of Green when he brought the butter—I have had between 40 and 50 dozen lbs. of him—he came afterwards to see if it had been disposed of—he gave me no limit as to price—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment, in June, and he signed this receipt—he brought butter once, and came two or three times for the proceeds.</p>

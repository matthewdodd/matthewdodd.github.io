I had a mare - the last time I saw her was about two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 8th of June, in a lane, about half a mile from my house. I had bought her in September previous - I missed it about eight o'clock the same night, and on the Friday following, I saw it at the Red Lion, public-house, Aldersgate-street; it had been fresh trimmed in the mane, heels, tail, and ears. I know it well by several marks on it; it is now in my possession.</p>

            . I am a farmer. On Tuesday, the 10th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was riding along Whitechapel - the prisoner called out,</p>
               <p>"Turner," and asked me to buy a four years old mare of him; I said I would not buy, but I would change it for one, if he had one to suit me, and asked where it was - he said he could not shew it to me then, as he was going into the City, but asked when I should be at my stable; I said between six and seven o'clock - I got home at eight. He called to me as I was going home, and said he was sorry he had sold the four years old mare; he was then on a mare, for which I gave him a mare and two sovereigns to boot. I took her to Romford-market on the Wednesday morning, and tied her up with another horse to sell. Mr. Lowe came up, and looked at her - I asked him to buy her for 8 l.; he fetched his father, who asked if I knew who I changed her with; I said with Snell. The prisoner was crossing the road at the time, and I pointed him out; Lowe said it was stolen. I asked him to go with me to the prisoner, which he did; I said,</p>
               <p>"Jem, this gentleman says the mare I had of you is stolen" - he said he knew better, for he had changed for it on Tuesday morning. He went down the market to find the man who he had it of, and rode away on my mare, towards town. I rode after him nearly two miles; he got off the mare - I took it. He ran across the fields, and got away. I went back to Lowe, and he had the stolen mare at the public-house, and detained it for the owner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. The father was not quite so certain of the mare - A. No; the son said he knew it. I have known the prisoner since Christmas, buying and selling horses at fairs, and at Smithfield - he lives near Whitechapel. He mentioned Baker as the man he bought her of. He saw me in the fair with the mare, three or four times before Lowe came up, and he brought three or four persons to buy her of me, and never tried to conceal it. I told him on Tuesday night that I should take it to Romford, and he said he should go there also, and that he had changed for this mare that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When Lowe claimed it did you not tell the prisoner you must have your own back again - A. Some people said so, and he rode off directly.</p>

            . I live at Hackney. In consequence of my son and Read losing a mare on the same morning, my son came to town - I went with him to look after them. about twelve o'clock on the Wednesday, he said he had found Read's mare. I went up with him to Turner, and after some conversation I told him it was stolen; he pointed across the market to the prisoner; we went up to him, and Turner told him the mare he had changed with him the night before was stolen. Snell said it could be no such thing, for he had got two men in the market that saw him buy it the day before, and he would go to fetch them; he rode down the market, as if with that intent - Turner said,</p>
               <p>"Snell, don't go away." We watched him till he got to the bottom of the market: Turner said,</p>

               <p>"He is off;" he rode after him, but returned without him. On the same evening I returned to Hackney, and met the prisoner on foot, in some meadows, by Hackney-marshes, and asked where he was going - he said to the King's Arms,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100011"></xptr>at Bow, to meet Turner and the man he bought Read's mare of. I said he must go no further without somebody with him - he said he was not going to be taken by me, and immediately ran into the marshes, and I after him, calling Stop thief! Lethbridge ran out and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your oath, did he not say he changed for it on Tuesday morning - A. He did not in my hearing. He said he had two men who saw him buy it - he did not mention the name of Baker.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness, and live at North Crawley. I came to town to look for my mare and Read's, on the 9th of June, with my father. I found Read's mare cropped and trimmed afresh, in Turner's possession; I knew her immediately. My father told Turner it was stolen; he said he bought it of Snell, pointing to him. I stopped and held the mare. Turner went up to Snell, and told him it was stolen. I was at a little distance from them, and there being a noise, I could not hear what answer was made. I saw Snell ride down the market, and Turner after him - he returned without him.</p>

In Nov. last I was lodging in the same house with the prisoner and her husband, in Poulton-terrace, Chelsea—he is a messenger of the Steam Boat Company at Chelsea—they had three children living with them—the eldest boy, William, was six years old—Edward, the second, was three years old, and the third, Arthur, eleven months—I had lived in the house with them better than two years—I recollect 15th Nov.—it was a very foggy day—the prisoner was out that afternoon—she came in about 5 o'clock—the eldest boy, Willie, came home from school before her, and he stopped in my room until she came in—she went out again with the three children some time after 5 o'clock—I dare say it was nearly half-past 5 o'clock—I said to her, "Why, Mrs. Allen, are you going out this foggy night with those children?"—she said, "Yes, I am only going on a little errand"—about a quarter to 6 o'clock her husband came home—I went to bed at 12 o'clock that night—the prisoner had not come home then—I saw nothing of any of the children that night before I went to bed—about 9 o'clock next morning I saw the prisoner—she passed me on the stairs—Mrs. Richards was with her—nothing passed between us at that time—I saw the body of the eldest child at the Inquest, on 18th Nov.</p>

I was on a barge by the side of the pier—it is one of the dummies which the people go on to get on to the pier—it is in the middle of the pier: I mean across the end of it—you go down steps from the end of the pier on to the dummy—I suppose it may be nearly 100 yards from the shore, or not so much—while I was on the dummy, I heard the cry of a child, apparently in the water—I ran off from the pier, took the life buoy and a little boat hook, and got over the rails into a boat, and proceeded to where the sound came from, and just below the Cricketer's Causeway I picked up a child—that is up the river—I suppose it was about 200 or 300 yards from the barge on which I had been standing—I picked up the child from the water—it was the young one, eleven months old—I suppose it might have been about sixteen or eighteen yards from the shore—I took it to the Magpie and Stump, and delivered it to Thomas Holmes, to take into the house—I did not see more than one child in the water.</p>

I am a waterman's apprentice, and live at Chelsea—I was walking along Cheyne-walk, coming from Battersea-bridge, on this evening, about a quarter to 6 o'clock, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I was then about forty yards from the pier, on the side nearer to Battersea bridge—I immediately ran down some steps there, and got into the water as far as I could safely go—I had to catch hold of the banisters to save myself, it being so foggy I could hardly see—I went down the steps nearest but one to the pier—they are steps where boats come to—I felt a boat that was made fast to the railing of the stairs, loosed it, and got in—it was about a quarter of an hour before high water, the boat lay right athwart the river—she was lying still, it is all an eddy there—there were other boats there, but out of my reach—none of them were touching the steps, I should say they</p>

I was directly opposite the Cadogan-pier with my cab, about half past 5 o'clock—while I was there I heard a scream from the water—there were two screams—I should say they were the screams of two children—they seemed to be different voices, one was a much louder voice than the other—a man came by at the time, and I went with him over to the water and listened—after looking for a minute, or a minute and a half, I saw something dark floating on the water, and still heard the scream—I should say it was about five or six yards from the pier, up the river—I called out very lustily for help, for watermen, and police—I ran to some steps that lead down to the shore from Cheyne-walk, and got wet in running down—they were the steps nearest to the Cadogan-pier—there was a gate at the top of the steps, but it was fastened—I had to get over the rails near the gate—I got on to a dummy which was there—I saw a little child floating past the dummy, within about half a yard of my arm's length—I was unable to reach it, and it floated past me—I could not see more than one child in the water, but I heard the screams of the second further out in the water—when I first saw the child in the water I was looking over the wall near the Cadogan-pier, I was standing, perhaps, about eight yards away from the level of the pier, by the side of the wall which bevels out, and the child was coming, it might have been about six or eight yards from the pier—it was floating from the pier at the time.</p>

               <p>Allen; that was all the answer I could get from her—about 12 o'clock I prevailed upoa her to accompany me to her house—we were from 12 o'clock till 2 getting there on account of the fog—she did not give me the least account of how she had lost her children, all she said was, that she had lost them, and she would not go home to her husband—I always understood he was the best of husbands to her—when we got to her house she let her<lb></lb>self in with a key that she had—I went into the passage, closed the door, and stood on the mat; I was rather doubtful whether she would go out again—I said to her, "Mrs. Allen, you go up stairs first, and see whether your husband is at home or not"—she said, "Very well I will, and then we will get a light"—she went up stairs, and knocked at the door twice, and Mr. Allen got off the bed where he had been lying with the little boy, and let her in—I heard him say to her, "Sarah, is it you?"—she said, "Yes, Mrs. Richards is down stairs"—he said, "It can't be you, Sarah"—she said, "Yes, it is."—I then went up—I found Mr. Allen in the room, and his brother, and sister, and the second boy—the boy was in the bed, and Mr. Allen was lying on the bed with part of his clothes on—the prisoner looked at the child and kissed it, and said, "Where did you get in?" or, "How did you, get in?"—Mr. Allen said to her, "Ah! Sarah, where is Willie, where is Willie?"—she made no answer—he said, "And where is the baby, Sarah?"—she said, "Have you got the baby?"—he said, "I have, Sarah"—she said, "Where is my baby?"—the baby was not then in the house, it was with a nurse—she said, "I will have my baby; where is my baby?" why can't I have my baby?"—that was her continual cry—Mr. Allen kept continually asking her the whole of the morning concerning Willie, but she made no answer, she only wanted her baby—I remained there the rest of the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Many years, the greater part of her life—I knew but little of her till after her marriage, about seven years ago—I have known her intimately since then—when she came to me on this evening she was in a flood of tears—she was in a state that I never saw her in before, she seemed so distressed, and could not speak to me, as though she had lost all self possession, and all control of herself—she was sobbing and crying wkile she spoke—I did all I could to soothe and console her, and to get her to her husband—they lived on most affectionate terms, and she was a most kind and excellent mother, and par<lb></lb>ticularly fond of her children; in fact, I always considered that she was too indulgent, she indulged them to a fault—I knew of the idea of hers about scrofula, and I have tried to reason her out of it—I always considered it was a delusion, but she was so very strong upon it the last time I was with her, about three weeks before this—she told me that I would not heed her—I said, "Oh! Mrs. Allen, all children have got complaints; you are so very fond of your children"—she said, "Oh! look at it; oh, Mrs. Richards, we are all ruined! I am ruined, my husband is ruined, and my children are ruined; my family is ruined altogether!"—she was under the impression that her husband was also scrofulous—I know that her mother's youngest sister died in a lunatic asylum—her mother was not at all affected that I know of—she has only been dead about three months—I should think it is quite a year and a half since she first complained to me about her husband and her children being scrofulous, but it was not so much as the last time—she was so very strong upon it the last time, it seemed to grow, nothing could do away with it—I did all I could to do away with it—the boy Willie was a very fine child—at one time I saw an alteration in him, he was look<lb></lb>ing</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> then she had the same impression that she herself was labouring under scrofula? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, that she was affected—that was latterly—it was the last time I saw her—her impression was, that she was always affected; that something was in the blood, and that it was in the bones, and would never come out, and that in future it would be worse than it was—that was what she held out to me—she said, "I am quite altered, and see how my forehead is swelled out."</p>

I have been in the habit of attending the prisoner and her children, for be<lb></lb>tween four and five years—she has from time to time made complaints to me of their having an impure disease—she called it scrofula—it is rather more than six months ago that she first called my attention to the children—I examined them in consequence of that statement—I did not find the slightest foundation for it—I told her so, but she still continued to express the same opinion—she said she thought the children would live to suffer for some years, and eventually die of it—remember on one occasion her saying she would rather see them die than live to suffer—that was about three months before this happened—it was in the autumn, about the latter end of Aug. or Sept.—I considered this a perfect delusion, both as regarded herself and her children—I have very often endeavoured to remove the impression, but entirely failed in doing so—I advised her to go to the hospital and take a higher opinion—she frequently complained to me about herself, of a swel<lb></lb>ling of the head, and the colour of her skin—she said she had a disease of the skin, and also a disease in the bones, which would eventually kill her—she complained of a little pain in the head occasionally—I examined her—there was no foundation for the existence of any actual disease—I prescribed for her once, when she complained of pain in the head—she nad medicine to take, I cannot say that she took it—the last time I saw her, I met her in the street with the three children—I then remarked how well they were look<lb></lb>ing, particularly the eldest boy—she replied, "Oh! dear, no; they are none of them well; they are far from well"—I think that was in Aug. or Sept.—she appeared to be still labouring under the same impression.</p>

               <p>diseases, and have paid great attention to those matters—I have seen the prisoner, and had conversations with her—my first visit occupied perhaps half an hour—I was then quite satisfied that she laboured under a delusion which is not of unfrequent occurrence in persons of high nervous sensi<lb></lb>bility—she stated to me that her children had suffered from a scrofulous disease, that their foreheads projected, and their eyes were starting from their heads, all that I could say was futile, and of no avail, she still persisted in her delusion—I saw her about a week afterwards, and the opinion that I had formed of her case was more than corroborated—I extended the period of my visit—I was most anxious to form a correct view of her case—she still persisted in the delusion—I called her attention to a work which she had been reading, and which has been produced to-day, and I believe the reading of that book very much strengthened the morbid view she entertained—she still labours under it—these are cases of a very protracted nature—sometimes the delusion does vanish.</p>

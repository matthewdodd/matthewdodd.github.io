                  </hi>. I go to school., On the 20th of September, I had a parcel containing two gowns and these other things, in Upper Norfolk-street, opposite Trinity-chapel—I met the prisoner—I am certain he is the man—he said he would give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. if I went to No. 10, Cumming-street, and he would hold my bundle while I went—he said Mr. Williams lived there—I went, and there was no such person there—I gave the prisoner my bundle and came back—the prisoner said he would walk up and down,</p>

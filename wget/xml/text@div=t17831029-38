I said No. 17, as plain as a man could speak.) I may be mistaken in the number; he instantly dropped the bag, there were I believe two more men with him, but they had not hold of the bag, I held him, the bag was taken care of by a man of credit, and we took the prisoner to the watch-house: we returned to seek after the property, and found Mr. Sayer's friend had taken care of it; I know it to be the same bag, I had the things taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290119"></xptr> to the watch-house, where I took out every one of them.</p>

               <p>A neighbour and me went down at Well-close-square to see the fire, and as we were coming up into Neptune-street, we saw the prisoner go by with this heavy load, I was with two neighbours that are not here, somebody behind said, I believe that is a thief, and I said if I thought he was I would run and catch him; there was a woman in the street that a gentleman here had desired her if she saw any body go with heavy loads to cry stop thief, I run as fast as I could, and overtook the man. Mr. Sayer and Mr. Hind had caught the man before I came up, but the bag was not off his back, when I came up to him: we were up with him almost together: I am sure the prisoner is the man; this gentleman asked him where he got the things, and he said No. 17, I believe, but there is no such number in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. He says now No. 17.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is such a number. Mr. Hind went to enquire for it.</p>
               <p>Benger. Then Mr. Nicholls the constable of the night came up and took the bundle away to his house: when Mr. Hind and Sayer had taken care of the prisoner, they came back to me and I went to Nicholls's house, and there was the bag tied up; this is the same bag. I have known Mr. Sayer several years.</p>

               <p>I had these these things in my custody, I was the officer of the night, I took several other things that night into my custody, and they have been in my possession ever since; I looked at the bag, and being part new and part old, I observed it was what we call a thief's bag, I know the prosecutor well, I am of the same business, and I said these are poor Davy Richardson's things, I went to him next morning, and informed him where he might find them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Hind. Whether he did not meet me in Virginia-street, where I was employed by a man to carry this bundle, and he offered me one shilling to carry it to his other shop in Rosemary-lane? -</p>
               <p>Hind. He said he would not go at first without an authority, I told him every man had an authority to take a thief.</p>

               <p>I assisted in taking the prisoner. When we first took him he said No. 72; I am sure he said so at first: at the watch-house: he said No. 17.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No. 72 was the number of my house in Wapping. I have no shop in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Hind. When he said it was 17, I said you said 72 before; he said he did not: then I gave it up, for I had my doubts.</p>
               <p>Sayer. I have no doubt in it at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had witnesses last night, when I was called up, and my trial postponed, but I have none this morning: they would have proved my character and every thing.</p>

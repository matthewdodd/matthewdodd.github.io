On the 9th of June, I went out to my work at six o'clock. The prisoner robbed me of my gown; I took the prisoner to take care of my family while I went out to work; I returned home at one o'clock; I missed the prisoner out of my room, and I missed my gown at night; when I came home the prisoner was there; I asked her where my gown was; she told me that she had left it at a person's place for sixpence. She told the officer what she had done with it afterwards; the child's hat she asked me to take to her sister to have it done up; I have never seen it from that time to this.</p>
               <p>- CAVILLIER. I am an officer. On the 9th of June, I took the prisoner into custody. I asked her what she had done with the gown; she said she had pawned it at Mr. Thimbleby's for eighteen-pence, in the name of Davis. I went to the pawnbroker, and there I found it. Mrs. Grainger saw the gown before the magistrate.</p>

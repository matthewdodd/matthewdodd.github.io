            . I arrested the prisoner in the Borough on the evening of the 26th of July. I found some bits of paper on him, but none about Mrs. Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home, and intended to settle the account with master, but he was out. I tendered my mistress the money, which she took, and then returned it, and desired me to keep it till I saw my master. I went out to get some refreshment, and with the labour of the night, and the heat of the day, I fell asleep. When I awoke I missed the money, and did not like to go back without it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KEYS re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner tell the same tale about the wife as he has now, and about his going to sleep at the public-house? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING re-examined. Q. Did he tell you what he had done with the money? A. He said he got into a coach, and laid out some of it in shirts and other things, and some of it he lost.</p>

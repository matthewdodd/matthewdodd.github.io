At length there was some suspicion of her dishonestly, and she was ordered to quite the room. She sent for a cart soon after, and had several things put up that did not belong to her; which was stopt just as they were going to drive away.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Gumbley. Since I discharged my servant, I gave her leave to reside at a house I had repairing in St. James's square, and to come to-and-fro for her victuals. I afterwards did not approve of her conduct; I had some suspicion of her dishonestly, and I ordered her to quit the room, and take away her things. Next day a person came to acquaint me, that there was a cart at the back door taking away a great many things. Accordingly I went, and found the cart just going off. I said to the carman, where are you going? He said, where he was ordered. I said you must unload the things; and the man said he would not. I went into the house, and met the maid with a bundle, and I said you are a base huffey. I then had the cart unloaded, and part of the things in the cart was a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the things removed out of the cart into the house again?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. Yes, and had the drawers carried up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time charge the prisoner with theft?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the things were removed into the house, did you see the chest of drawers opened?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. There were several things; the first was a Holland shirt, which I lost last summer - several pieces of lace, lost at different times - one piece about four yards of Holland - a piece of muslin - about seven yards of green silk damask were afterwards found by her confession where she had sold it. [ These things were produced in court, and swore to]</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched in your presence?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. No, I pushed her out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was taken up, and had before the justice, what did she say?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. She owned she had robbed me of them. The piece of damask, she said she had sold to a woman in Carnaby-market. The Justice sent for them; but the woman happened to be abroad at that time, and it was afterwards brought to me.</p>
               <p>Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the prisoner at the bar was examined?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes, and she acknowledged the taking those, and several other things. She owned some things were at her lodgings in St. Giles's, and gave me a direction to look behind the bed for some, by the side of the bed for others, and under the bolster for the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find those things you have there tied up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes; a piece of silk for lining of a petticoat, a piece of green silk damask, some red silk, some pink sattin, some towels and dusters, one apron, one handkerchief, one shirt, and some yards of linen and holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things all found there?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes. or were found by her direction.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Gumley. Are these things all yours?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. Yes.</p>

               <p>The things that I went to move out of the house Mrs. Gumley had given me, and she told me several times, that, when I went away, I should get a cart and take them away at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witness to call?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No.</p>

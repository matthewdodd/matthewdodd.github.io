                  </hi>. I am a basket-man, employed at the coal-whippers' office. The prisoner was in the same employment—I have known him twenty-four years—on Tuesday evening, 4th June, I went into the Cock, on Cock-hill, Ratcliff, about nine o'clock, and was talking to a man named Thomas Pluckrose, a person connected with our office—the prisoner was sitting in an opposite box, eating something—he had a knife and fork in his hand—he commenced giving me a tissue of abuse, without any provocation on my part—he came over to my seat—I told him to go and sit down, I wanted no more of his abuse—he made some sort of party remark, that I had called the potboy a Connaught something—I appealed to the potboy, and went over to where the prisoner was sitting, and the potboy denied it in toto—the prisoner then said to him, "You are a b—y liar"—that aggravated me, and I said, "Now you deserve a slap across the face"—he said, "You had better do it"—I said, "Put down your knife and fork, and stand up; put up your hands to defend yourself"—he laid the knife and fork down on the table—I thought he did not feel disposed to resent it, and more out of contempt than anger I gave him a slap with the back of my hand across the face, and told him if he pursued that line of conduct towards me, or offended me any more, it was more than likely that the next time I hit him I should strike him in earnest—I then turned round to go to my own company, thinking it was dropped, and I felt a cut in my cheek, which cut my lip—I did not see where the blow came from—my side was towards the prisoner—I had no idea he was going to strike me, or I would have got out of the way—I went to Mr. Cleland, the surgeon, and be dressed the wound.</p>

               <p>cooking some meat—I had occasion to go outside, and when I came in the prisoner was sitting alongside of Brown—Brown said to him, "Go away, my good man, and eat your food; I don't want to be bothered or pestered with you any more"—the prisoner went away immediately, and sat down at his table to eat his food—he made some sort of rough sarcastical remark, saying to Brown, "It is not with you as it used to be," or something of that sort—Brown said, "If you don't keep your tongue off me, I will come and stop it for you"—the prisoner said, "Which way will you do it?"—he said, "I will come and tell you;" and he walked over to the table where the prisoner was sitting, and said, "Now, what is the reason I cannot have my pint of beer in peace, without your annoyance?"—he said, "You made use of the word 'Connaught b—' to the potboy"—Brown said, "You are a liar"—the potboy was called in, and Brown said, "Did I make use of the word 'Connaught' in derision at all to you?"—"Not a word," said he—Brown then said to the prisoner, "I have a great mind to give you a smack on the nose for your insolence and lies"—the prisoner said, "Why don't you do it?"—Brown said, sharply, "Stand up"—the prisoner stood up; and Brown said, "Put down the knife and fork," in the same harsh manner—he did so—Brown then said, "Put up your hands to defend yourself; you are a d—d cur, and I always thought you were a d—d cur;" and he gave him a smack on the cheek—they looked at each other something under a minute; and Brown said, "Now, if ever you want to annoy me again in company, depend upon it I will bit you in earnest"—he then turned himself to go away; and the prisoner snatched up the knife, and gave him a back-handed stab, and wounded him in the face—I saw the blood come—Brown clapped his handkerchief up to it—I told him to run away directly to Mr. Cleland's, the surgeon;" which he did—Brown did not strike the prisoner so as to draw blood; he hit him with the back of his hand on the ear—the pri<lb></lb>soner got up to go away—I said, "You must not go away; you have severely wounded this man"—he said, "I will go"—I let him go, and followed him to the corner of Love-lane—I saw no policeman, and he ran away up Love-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Cock-hill, Ratcliff. On Tuesday night, 4th June, Brown came to me—he had an incised wound in the right cheek, extending from the lip outwards towards the ear—it was about two inches long, and very deep—it nearly cut the cheek through—it would require a great deal of force to inflict such a wound—there were two wounds, one about an inch above the other; but that was very slight, and might have been done at the same time, by a scratch from the back of the knife—the wound is not quite healed yet—he still comes to me occasionally to have it looked to.</p>

            . On Thursday the 4th of August, about half after eight in the evening, Mr. Robinson and I were going from London; he was going to Chelsea, and I to Battersea: when we got to Knightsbridge, there fell a very heavy rain; there was a coach going by to Chelsea; we got into the coach, and between <placeName id="t17741019-8-crimeloc43">Knights-bridge</placeName>

I sat with my back to the horses; when both doors were opened, there was one man on my right hand, and another on my left; the man who was on my right hand, who is not here, demanded my money; and Lane, who was on my left hand, without saying a word, cut my coat, my shirt, and just the point of my elbow with a knife; we made no resistance, nor did any thing to provoke them to use us so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain to Lane's person?</p>
               <p>Floyd. I am certain; the man on my right side clapped his hand on my breeches to feel for my watch; but having neither string nor chain he could not find it; then Lane made a stroke at me with his knife, and cut me across the wrist; my hand is spoiled for ever as to the use of it; being surprized, I asked him in a stern manner, what he was about, and told him I would give him my money if he would let me alone: the man on my right hand called out God blast him, cut away, cut his pocket out: as I was putting my hand in my pocket, Lane made a third push with his knife at my groin; the stroke took my fingers in my pocket, and prevented the knife going into my groin; there appears by my coat to have been a cut on my right side, which must have been made by the man on that side, but did not hurt me: after I had received the third cut, I took my money out of my pocket; Lane received two or three shillings, as my hand came out of my pocket, and one shilling dropped in the coach which he picked up. I had not strength to hold it. He had at least three shillings. I afterwards found half a guinea, and three shillings and sixpence sticking in the blood in my pocket. I bound my handkerchief round my arm, and bid the coachman drive on to a surgeon's. I suppose I lost near three quarts of blood. I am quite certain to the persons of both the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Robinson.

            . On the 6th of September, I was in a shop on Ludgate hill; I saw the prisoners pursuing a gentleman's pocket: on seeing me, they desisted: they went from there to Bartholomew fair; I followed them; I lost sight of them for some time; at last I found them, and determined to take them up on suspicion; I found a knife on each of them.

               <p>Coltis. I have known him four years?</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take this sugar?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go in?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the people of the shop?</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We went to him about ten or eleven o'clock, then he was at home, and said he had weighed it, and it weighed 36 or 37 pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Feathers ?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I never knew him before we carried things to sell.</p>

               <p>Q. How often have you been with them to his house?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you for this sugar?</p>
               <p>Coltis. He gave us a groat a pound for it: We ask'd him six-pence.</p>

               <p>Coltis. Not much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you how you came by it?</p>

            . I am Turnkey of New-Prison: Mr Fielding ordered me to go down to Feather's house; I went, and told him he had bought sugar and bacon of this evidence and another, the evidence was then with me; Feathers own'd it, and shewed us the sugar above stairs, and brought the sugar and bacon to Mr Fielding's that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Feathers ?</p>
               <p>Elmore. He <rs id="t17590117-34-deflabel204" type="occupation">keeps a Chandlers-shop</rs>

               <p>Q. Does he deal in sugar?</p>
               <p>Elmore. He does: I saw some in his house: but I saw the sugar upon a table above-stairs, and he said it was the sugar that he bought of this evidence and Smith, and he had cut some of it off.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the Justice ?</p>
               <p>Elmore. He own'd these two boys sold it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith and Blaze present when he brought the sugar there?</p>

He said he gave at the rate of a groat a pound for it, and said he had us'd some of it, and taken it from off the top; he was committed that night to New-prison; the next day he was brought up again with the two boys at the bar, and the evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Feathers to goal the first time?</p>
               <p>Elmore. I did; I took him there in a coach along with Coltis, the other two prisoners were there before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you carried Feathers there did he and the other prisoners seem to know one another?</p>
               <p>Elmore. The two boys were lock'd up that night; before the justice Blaze said he was concerned in taking the sugar and tea, but denied taking the bacon. Smith said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take up Blaze?</p>
               <p>Elmore. I took him in the same room where I had before taken Smith and Coltis.</p>

            . Smith and I were together last Sunday was seven-night, at night at Hoxton; Smith held the prosecutor's door open, and I went in and took this bacon out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the shop?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the shop did it lie?</p>
               <p>Coltis. It lay upon a shelf on the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We carried it to Feathers's house that same night.</p>
               <p>Q. What! on a Sunday-night?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before, or after, taking the sugar?</p>
               <p>Coltis. This was after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Feathers at home?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We did; we ask'd him if he would buy the bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his shop open?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No: we knock'd at the door, and he open'd it and let us in; he said he had bacon enough, but he ask'd the price of it; we ask'd him a groat a pound, it being a hock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bacon. He takes it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Coltis. This is the the same bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you a pound for it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. He gave us two-pence a pound for it; and there was a little sat bit that he gave us five-pence a pound for.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of that?</p>
               <p>Coltis. There was about two pounds and a half of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any questions how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it that you was at his house?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I can't say indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out upon your business that day?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We had been out about three or four hours before we took the bacon, and we went out about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Feathers pay you for the bacon that night?</p>
               <p>Coltis. He did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170032"></xptr>Q. What did he give you?</p>

            , and carried that morning before Justice Fielding; the Justice ask'd us where we were taken up? I told him at such a house; he committed me as an evidence, and he sent Elmore and me to the shops where we had stole these things from; Elmore ask'd the people if they had lost any thing? and they said they had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor say he had lost any thing?</p>
               <p>Coltis. He said he had lost such a piece of bacon as this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Feathers's?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We did; and the prosecutor Winsley along with us, he bought the bacon of Feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see the bacon at the prisoner Feathers's house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went to Feathers's house at about seven or eight at night; I took a basket and a few greens in it. I ask'd him if he had a bit of bacon to fell, and said I had got a few nice greens; I looked about and saw a hock of bacon, I took it down, and said, What will you have for this? I view'd it very well; he sold it me at four-pence a pound. I took that to Justice Fielding's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the hock that you bought of Feathers?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the very same: (if it is not mine it is like it.)</p>
               <p>Q. toColtis. Look at this bacon, do you know it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I am sure this is the same bacon that I took out of the prosecutor's shop; and Feathers own'd before the Justice, that he bought this bacon of Smith and me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it to be the same bacon, and the man that you say owns it does not know it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Mr Feathers own'd it to be the same?</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any marks by which you know it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Because here is a slit underneath it; turning it up and showing it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Elmore. Did you hear Feathers own this to be the bacon that the two boys sold him?</p>
               <p>Elmore. I did; and own'd before the Justice he gave two-pence a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he bought it?</p>
               <p>Elmore. He did; he said he bought it on Sunday was seven-night at night; I took the two boys in bed, along with two women.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence.</p>
               <p>It is a great falsity, I never saw Coltis before in my life, only once at the White-Lion by Cow-cross; and that night he went home to bed with me, and Elmore came and took us up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Coltis. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Coltis. I am between 17 and 18 years of age.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you deal in tea?</p>
               <p>Russel. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any?</p>
               <p>Russel. I did; last Monday was seven-night<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170033"></xptr> at night, between 6 and 7 in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How much?</p>
               <p>Russel. About 14 ounces of green and 5 of bohea, in two cannisters.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home at the time?</p>
               <p>Russel. I was not; my wife sent for me, she miss'd it in about five minute's time; I know nothing who took them, no more than what Coltis tells me.</p>

            . Betwixt 6 and 7 o'clock on Monday night, I and the two prisoners went that way; the prosecutor's door was latch'd; I went in and handed one of the cannisters to Blaze; then I went in and got the other, then we went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We put it all out into a handkerchief together before we got home.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do that for?</p>
               <p>Coltis. Because no body should find the cannisters upon us.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Coltis. We throw'd them away, and went directly to our lodgings, and left it on the table in the handkerchief all night, and went to bed; we were taken up on the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Blaze lie with Smith and you?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No, he went home to his lodgings about nine or ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lodge?</p>
               <p>Colt is. In Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any tea home with him?</p>
               <p>Coltis. No; we designed to have sold it the next day, and then divide the money; Blaze was taken up the same day.</p>

            . This I found on a table at the boys bed's soot, when I took them up. Producing a handkerchief with tea in it. Coltis said he took some from an old woman in Old-street, and some from the prosecutor's in Hoxton-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of it?</p>
               <p>Elmore. Here is two pounds and an ounce handkerchief and all; when the evidence had given an account that Blaze was with them, the Justice sent me after him. I went to his lodging in Barbican, but not meeting with him, I went to the house where I took up the boys, and while I was in the room, Blaze came in at the back door, so I took him there. I told him he had been stealing sugar, tea, and bacon, and must go along with me. He said he was not concerned in the bacon; he was only concerned in tea and sugar; I ask'd him whose handkerchief it was that the tea was in? he said it was his own, and he wanted it again.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>For Blaze.</p>
               <p>Mr Cattle. I have known Blaze 8 or 9 years, he is a very sober lad, he work'd along with me, I never heard the least blemish of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Cattle. I am a scale maker.</p>

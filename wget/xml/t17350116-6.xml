               <p>Prisoner. By the virtue of your Oath, are you sure you had the Money before you came into the Crowd?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibbons. I am sure I had it in my Pocket at noon, and I never pulled it out afterwards.</p>

            . I went to the Lecture about five. As soon as I was seated, I took notice of the Prisoner's going two or three times up and down the Stairs. whisking about, and looking over the Pews. He had got a Handkerchief under his Wig, and another about his Neck, and a third round his right Wrist. Mrs. Gibbons coming to the Pew, the Prisoner crowded up to her, and as she turned her Coat aside to get in, I saw him put his Hand towards her Pocket, and then he turned about and went towards the Pulpit. Mrs. Gibbons missing her Purse, I told her, I suspected the Prisoner. He was then got somewhere out of my sight, but the Clerk and I went to look for him, and in ten or twelve Minutes we met with him going out at the Door, and a Woman in a Scarlet Cloak holding by his Arm. We carried him into the Vestry, where he took four Guineas, and 4 s. 6 d. in Silver, and three Half-pence out of his Pocket, but refused to deliver it to the Constable, for he swore he knew better.</p>
               <p>Constable. The Prisoner shew'd us the Money, but wou'd not deliver it - He had three or four fresh Wounds in his Head under the Handkerchief, and likewise Wounds in his right Wrist. We asked him how he came by those Wounds, and he told us they were given him by his Wife. We enquired where he lived. He refused to satisfy us, but damn'd us, and gave us very opprobious Language.</p>

            . I saw the Prisoner and two other Fellows, and a Woman in a Scarlet Cloak, and Black Hood. By their Behaviour I took 'em to be Confederates. They made several Stops to hinder the People from passing, and they frequently wink'd upon one another. The Prisoner went two or three times into the Gallery. He and the Woman crowded up to the Lady as she was going into the Pew; and they both stoop'd thus, towards her Pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brotherton. I took notice of the Prisoner's whisking to and fro in the Isle, and soon after I heard that Mrs. Gibbons had lost her Purse. The Prisoner being carried into the Vestry, I asked him if he had any Friends that he could send for, to his Reputation. He said he knew what he had to do, and he would send for no Friend. Somebody asking him what he came thither for; he said he came for his Diversion. He treated us all with a great deal of scurrilous Language.</p>

            . I took particular notice of the Woman who was with the Prisoner, because she was once at my Shop with another Woman whom I took up for a Shop-lifter - When the Prisoner was in the Vestry, I told him, if he had any Friends to send for, I would go and fetch them. He swore if he had me in a proper Place, he would knock my Head off my Shoulders.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had good reason to give 'em ill Language when they falsly accused me with being a Thief.</p>

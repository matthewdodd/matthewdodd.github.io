                  </hi>. I live at Chelsea, and am a cordwainer. I knew the deceased, Joseph Smythers Beauchamp—on 17th July, I was drinking with him at the White Horse in Church-street—the prisoner came in, and joined us—we had several pots together, and the prisoner and the deceased got in conversation about Richmond—they had a quarrel, and they got up and fought—I separated them, and then we all sat down for a few minutes—the prisoner left, and he came back again, and we sat down again for two or three hours—we then went out together, and prepared to go home—there were four of us—we went through the coach-ride, and the prisoner and the deceased were rather in advance—I heard some more words arising, and they came to blows—the prisoner lifted his hand, and struck the deceased—the deceased had struck the prisoner in the tap-room, but he did not strike him then; he never lifted his hand to him—Wilson was with me, and he inter<lb></lb>fered—he struck the prisoner, and he stood up and fought till Wilson fell down—the prisoner then turned in an instant, and struck the deceased—he staggered, and fell heavily—his head caught the post which stands at the head of the gateway—I helped to raise him in a sitting position—he seemed quite insensible—I left his head against some other man's legs while I went to get some water—I assisted to take him home.</p>

               <p>blows, and after that they became reconciled to each other—the prisoner went out, and came back in about an hour, and nothing more was mentioned—I dare say we remained there three hours—there were two others there—two or three hours elapsed between the first and the second row.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to St. George's hospital. The deceased was brought in on 17th; he was insensible; he died on the 19th—I witnessed the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of his death was a fracture of the back of his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what state was he when brought in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a state of insensibility; he was bled—I found the anterior lobe of the brain was lacerated—he might have bad laceration without the fracture, but the concussion was the result of the fracture; they both occurred at the same time—the concussion was necessarily caused by the fracture, and that was caused by the fall. (The prisoner's master gave him a good character as a quiet steady man.)</p>

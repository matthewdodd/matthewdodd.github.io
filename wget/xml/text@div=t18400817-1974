On the 21st of July, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was on Holborn-hill—I saw the prisoner, with two others, following a respectable-looking man—when they got to the corner of Hatton-garden, the prisoner rushed forward, lifted up the flap of the gentleman's coat, and took a handkerchief out of his pocket—I crossed the road, they saw me, and ran off—I caught the prisoner within a few yards, and in taking him to the station-house I found the handkerchief in his jacket-pocket, where I had seen him put it—the gen<lb></lb>tleman was then gone—I do not know his name, for when I seized the prisoner he threw himself on the ground—a great crowd came about, and I had enough to do to secure him.</p>

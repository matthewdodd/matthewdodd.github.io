                  </hi>. I am journeyman to Mr. Edward Hoare, a butcher, who lives at the corner of Earl-street, Lisson-grove—the prisoner was in his service. On the morning of the 5th of March, about eight o'clock, I was told something—I went to a coach-house in an adjoining street, and the prisoner followed me—when I got to the stable I found a piece of salt beef in a hand<lb></lb>kerchief under the cart, close to the gate—I asked if he knew anything about it—he said no—I had seen a piece similar to that, and I have no doubt it was the same—it had been carried from the shop to the area twice, and I had seen it at the shop a few days before—when we got to the door he owned he took it to give to a friend in distress.</p>

I became acquainted with the prisoner in August, 1835—I was then working at Lewisham nursery—I married her in November, 1830, at charlton church, in Kent—she represented herself as the widow of David Ross—she said he was dead, and buried at Liverpool, and that Mr. Russell had inquired into every thing, and I might marry her—she did not tell me I had better wait two years—I did not know that she had a husband who, in all probability, was living.</p>

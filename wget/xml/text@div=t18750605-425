                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). On 14th May last, I was in the service of Mr. Miller, and on that day was employed by him to drive a cart, containing a quantity of ice, to the Victoria Docks, on the way we go through the North Woolwich Road—I know the shop of Cassinello's father; I don't know the number—I only know the prisoner by his being in the shop—I had not seen him or sold ice to him before that day—he had once or twice before spoken to me about selling him ice—it was in the winter time—he said "When it gets a little warmer, I can do with a little ice"—I said "Not me"—I did not tell him who I was—he spoke to me because he could see what was in my load—I had not said anything to him as to whose service I was in—Mr. Miller's name was on the cart, large white letters, with red round them—on 14th May, I was going by the shop when somebody called me—I was very intoxicated and could not swear who it was—I was asked whether I had got a bit of ice, and I said "Yes," and then took two pieces in, and Cassinello carried two pieces in—nothing was said to me as to how much was to be paid for it—I came out and Mr. Clark, the ice merchant, was there with a policeman; I didn't know what I was doing at the time—Mr. Clark said something to me about selling ice—the prisoner was at the door and went and fetched back the ice and put it in the van—I ran away; about a week afterwards I surrendered myself to Mr. Miller.</p>

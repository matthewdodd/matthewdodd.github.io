                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Boughton, the lessee of Hounslow Heath—I am paid wages by him for keeping the Heath, to look after the fences and the cattle, and to prevent trespassers—about 5 o'clock in the afternoon of 13th October the three prisoners came on the Heath, and were proceeding to walk across the Heath—I told them they were trespassing, and they had no right there.; they said, with an oath, that they were there, and they meant going—I told them they would be liable to be turned back again, and while I was telling them that, Linsey drew up close to me, and hit me a violent blow in the mouth with his fist, and I was knocked down immediately, and seized by all three prisoners; they all three closed in, and kicked and hit me with violence, and said "We have got you here in a good place now; we will do for you"—they all three said that—they kicked me in the eye, which bled most fearfully; I have the scar, and you can see the place now—one of them, I don't know which, said "Well, he has got enough, we have given him enough; we won't give him any more," and another said "I shan't take any farther part in it"—I don't know which it was said that; I was almost insensible at the time—I got up on one knee, finding they had left me, and Linsey then returned and made a most violent strike at me, but missed me, and threw himself right upon me—I had not done anything to them before they assaulted me; I had not put my hands to them, or attempted to; I merely told them they had no right to pass—I got up, and proceeded home as well as I could, and lost about a pint and a half of blood—I gave information to the police, and saw them in custody the same evening.</p>

On the evening of 13th October, about 7 o'clock, I saw the prosecutor bleeding from the eye, and ap<lb></lb>parently very weak—he named the persons who had assaulted him—I then went with other constables, and found the prisoners in the taproom of the George the Fourth public-house—I told them I was about to take them into custody—I first spoke to Linsey, and said "I want to speak to you"—he said "Come and say it here"—I told him he was charged with violently assaulting the prosecutor on the Heath, and he would have to go to the station with me—he said "I am b—f I shall"—I said "But you will have to go"—I then commenced to put the handcuffs on him—he was very violent, and struck at me; I missed his blow, and my brother constable struck him across the arm as he was stooping, apparently to pick up the poker—I succeeded in putting on the handcuffs; he still continued very violent—I then charged Parker and Vickery—Vickery was at first violent, but he afterwards went quietly to the station—afterwards, on the way to the House of Detention, Vickery said that, when Linsey had kicked Hammond over, he told him to come away, for that was enough.</p>

The Heath has been closed since September, 1867, by the War Department, and boards are placed on each side of the Heath, and before that the old tenant closed it on the 1st of May every year for forty years—with that exception it was open to the public—I have been stationed there seven years—since 1867 the public have gone across the Heath to the powder mills, by permission from the person who has kept it; otherwise they have been sent back—I have known a good many persons turned back—I have not known many that have not been turned back.</p>

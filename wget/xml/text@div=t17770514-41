               <p>Did he force him into it? - He was not forced into it, but he could get no employment or livelihood on account of it; I came away on the same account myself; I failed the same day he failed; they threaten there if they will not enter into the companies to tar and feather them: I was settled there in business: on the 10th of September trade was stopped there, and there was no business for any one, and on the 14th I failed, and the prisoner sailed for Lisbon.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner bound for Lisbon? - The ship was bound for Lisbon; he entered as a sailor; they put in at Norfolk as I heard, having sprung a leak, and were taken by a man of war; to my certain knowledge he shipped himself for Lisbon.</p>

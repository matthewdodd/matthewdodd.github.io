                  </hi>. On Saturday eight, 18th March, I was walking in Holborn, somebody rushed past me and snatched my watch—I am almost sure it was the prisoner—I pursued him, a policeman stopped the prisoner and I gave him in custody—I am not positively sure of him, but just next to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 48, Eagle Street, Holborn—on this Saturday night, I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I was in ray parlour—I went out and saw the prisoner standing by the constable, a few doors off—I ran up and he was removed round the corner—as I went back I picked up this watch within a few yards of where the prisoner was stopped.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I saw a crowd and went up to see what it was; I saw the prosecutor drunk, and swinging his stick about and jumping; I laughed at him and he struck me with his stick; I ran away and he ran after me and caught his stick in his trowsers or waistcoat, and two or three men got bold of him and began to pull him about; they shoved me away and I ran. The prosecutor called "Stop thief," and the policeman stopped me. The prosecutor came up and he fell down from drink before he got up to me. As I was going down the witness gave the policeman the watch and said "You have got the <hi rend="italic">jack."</hi> The policeman said that he would "make it up for me. "I can get nine or ten witnesses to say that the prosecutor was drunk and incapable.</p>

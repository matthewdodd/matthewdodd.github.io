               <p>Ann Wheatley. On the 11th of July, I was sitting by a little child in a cradle in my house near the ditch side: I had given the prisoner and her mother leave to lie in my house. I missed a guinea, and the prisoner being charged with it, she own'd she took it out of my pocket when I was sitting by the cradle, to me, the constable, and before the sitting alderman.</p>

            . I went and fetched the constable; there was 13 s. 6 d. lying on the table, which was taken out of the prisoner's pocket, she said she had changed it. She confess'd in my hearing that she took a guinea out of my mother's pocket.</p>

I was house surgeon at the London Hospital—I saw Mrs. Butler there on 8th August, about 10.30—she was stabbed in the right side of the abdomen, over the liver, and had lost a great deal of blood—the was in great danger for some weeks—this knife would produce I the wound; but I do not think it did, as there is no varnish on the handle, and I think it would have been very much stained—this handle is perfectly clean—the stab went to a great depth, and she had a very narrow escape—I do not believe the blood could have been removed from the knife by it being drawn through the clothes, because the woman was covered with blood, from the wound downwards.</p>

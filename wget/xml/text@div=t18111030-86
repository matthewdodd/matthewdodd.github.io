               <p>WILLIAM CURVIN. I am a constable. I have known Marlin two years, he kept his soot in this outhouse, and slept there, I found the bed under the soot there.</p>
               <p>for me to or three yards off the prosecutor's door, we went with the prisoner to his place, we asked him for the key, he said he had not got it, I had the door broken open, this was between seven and eight at night, on the 15th of October, we went in and found the bed under the soot, wrapped up in the cloths that he puts before the chimnies, I took the prisoner, and the bed was taken away: before we found the bed he said he knew nothing of it, and after we found it, he said he did not steal it. This is the bed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This bed was under my care for sale, it is worth twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking at the Swan public house, and on my returning to my lodging, I observed the bed in the road, I took it up there being no one near, in the morning I went out for the purpose of enquiring whose it was, and also to my labour; - when I was informed by my neighbours that there was a search warrant, and in going to my lodgings it was found there. I am perfectly innocent of the charge, and ignorant how it came in the road, I took it in my place for safety.</p>

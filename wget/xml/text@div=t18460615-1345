                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Clark, a pawnbroker, in Long Acre. On Wednesday evening, the 3rd of June, Gavelle came to pawn this scarf for half-a-crown—I asked where he got it—he said his mother sent him—I told him to go and send his mother, and if it was all right I would lend the money—he went, and never returned—I gave the scarf to the policeman.</p>

Murfitt was in my service—on the 3rd of June Pocock brought me this scarf—it is mine—I know it by the private mark—it had not been sold—I have seen Gavelle lurking about Long Acre, and associating with Murfitt and other boys—I said to Murfitt, "I have some suspicion that you know something about this scarf that the policeman brought to me?"—he said, "Yes, Sir."</p>

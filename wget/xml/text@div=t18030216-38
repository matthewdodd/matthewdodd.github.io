Locke and Knight, wine and brandy merchants, Hammersmith: On the 27th of Jan. in the evening, I went with my fellow servant to the White-hart, to have a pint of beer; Brookes, the headborough, and two or three more, were there; when I had been there two or three minutes, the lad that drives the errand cart came and called, Brookes, Brookes, come out directly, there are three men have got a box from the errand cart, and are in Black-lion-lane. Brookes and another man, I believe Sharpe, went out; I did not go out immediately, but thinking it unmanly not to go when an errand cart had been robbed, I went to Blacklion-lane, and met a man coming out of the lane, and calling, Peter, Peter; then the boy came out and said, stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy's name is Smith? - A. Yes; Thomas-Abraham Smith. I asked the boy which way they were gone; he said, towards Hammersmith; then I ran as fast as I could run, and came up with a man, the shortest of the prisoners, Price, that was in the road; I immediately looked to see if he had got any property, and could not see any thing; I looked to the right and the left to see if there were any of his accomplices; I looked forward and thought I saw the head of some person; Price looked at me, and said, why do you jostle me; I said, I did not jostle him, but I thought he was one of the thieves that had robbed the errand cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. I think a little after eight at night, the moon was not then two hours and an half high; then Brookes came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see any body else there? - A. No; I looked to see if I could see any other person; Brookes laid hold of Price, and all of a sudden I lost him. Price calls, d-n you, Jack, come here; then Brookes called to me, I suppose, and said, I order you to aid and assist in the King's name; then a man I had never seen before, jumped from the foot-path.</p>

               <p>Q. You had done nothing then? - A. No; Price, when he said, come here, said, we will do them both.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Nowland that jumped off the foot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160031"></xptr>path? - A. Yes; Nowland jumped at me, and with a dreadful oath said, what do you do with that man, I will cut your b-y head off; then he struck me in the left eye with his fist, and I think at the same time, but I am not certain, he struck me with a knife, I felt something on my breast, and my coat is cut in the same place; I then struck him in the face; he then clapped his hand up to his face and said, you have done me; I then fastened both my hands to his collar, intending to drag him away towards Hammersmith after the others; as I had fast hold of him by the collar, he put up his right hand, and cut me across both the backs of my hands, as hard as he could press with his knife; I felt it very severely; I held him fast with my left hand, and let go with the right, with an intention to hit him; I hit at him two or three times; when I hit at him, I found I could make no impression, it was open handed, I could not clench my fist, I did not know the reason of it at the time; I hit at him and felt him cut me severely about the head; the first cut I think was about the lip, the next I think was in the temple, a stroke right down. I said to him, you villain, you have got a knife, you want to murder me; then said he, I will cut your b-y liver out. I thought then the case was dangerous, and I would put my hand to his collar and throw him down; in the mean time the blood flowed into my mouth, that I was almost smothered; I found myself weak, and called out murder, I was afraid I should not hold out. I heard a person spring his rattle, and then I found the knife stabbed into my mouth as far as it would go, for his hand came against my lips; I had still hold of him, I never let him go with my left hand till I had him down; he used a word too bad to express, and said, you b-r, let me go, or I will cut your b-y liver out. I caught hold of the knife with my two fingers and thumb, and snapped it two; I then pushed him back on the foot-path, and dragged him down on his back; he being higher then me he was like to get up, I took him by the legs, and dragged him beside the foot-path, and held him a short space to get a little breath, and get the blood out of my mouth, then a man of the name of Haynes came up, he did not know which part to take at first; I said I am Mr. Locke's man, this is the thief that has robbed the cart, and endeavoured to murder me; then Haynes dashed down upon him with his knee to keep him down, and he held him down; the other begged to let him get up, but Haynes refused, and said he should not till more assistance came.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was secured? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the wounds you received where the cuts were? - A. I received two cuts across my nose, one the right side of the tip of the nose, I had a cut across the gristle of the nose, towards the right eye; I had across the upper part of the cheek, from the eye to the nose, a cut across the upper part of the jaw, and a cut down the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the use of your fingers? - A. The right hand is weak; two of the fingers of the left hand are quite dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q.Price went away after the first blow was given; he did not assist in the cutting? - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROOKES sworn. - I am headboborough of the parish of Fulham: I was at the White-hart public-house, on the 27th of January, a little after eight in the evening, there was an alarm; the boy of the errand cart came in and said, that three men had cut a box from the errand cart, and that they were in Black-lion-lane. I went down the lane and saw two men in possession of a box, they had hold of it, it was bottom upwards; I asked how they came by the box, they said they found it, they supposed it was cut from some cart. I looked at the box, and turned round to the boy and said, is this your box? he said it was; seeing it broke in, I looked to see if there was any property in it; in the mean time the two men ran up the lane.</p>
               <p>Q.The two men you saw with the box were the two prisoners? - A. Yes; the little boy set off after them, while I was looking at the box; as he got to the end of the lane, he holloaed out, stop thief. I immediately pursued them, they went towards Hammersmith; just opposite the four-mile stone I came up alongside Price; I saw a man whom I charged to aid and assist in the King's name, that turned out to be Pigeon. I immediately caught hold of Price with my left hand, and he struck me immediately; then he said, d-n - your eyes, come along, Jack; I turned my eye round, and saw a man spring out of the path to me, which proved to be Nowland.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? - A. Not from the time I saw him in Black-lion-lane; he immediately, as he sprang off the path, said, d-n your b-y eyes, we will do you both.</p>
               <p>Q.That Nowland said? - A. Yes; Nowland and Price encountered me, and got me down under Price; then he sprang from me over to Pigeon, what passed after I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it light enough to see them? - A. Yes; the moon was not gone down, and there was snow on the ground, I could see fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him before he sprang on you? - A.No; there is a deep ditch behind the path; the path was not above three yards from me; I did not see him till charge was given to aid assist.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see Pigeon again till it was over?- A.No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q. When you saw the men first, they were running away? - A. Yes, while I was looking at the box, I turned Price<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160032"></xptr>over, and got him up, and was going to secure him to take him to the watch-house; he bit my hand, and got away from me; the boy and I pursued him, crying, stop thief; Millward, the bricklayer, stopped him by the Cock and Pye.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon, and live at Hammersmith; I was sent to Pigeon at the White Hart; I found him having received a large cut on the right-hand and on the left-hand, across each hand; she cut on the right-hand had gone through the sinews of the little and ring fingers, in consequence of which he will probably never have the use of those fingers; the cut on the left-hand had cut one of the sinews, but not through it; there was a cut through the upper lip, which I was obliged to sew up; there was a cut on the top of the nose, and a cut on the bridge of the nose; it went slanting down by the side; there was a long and very deep cut on the left-side of the face, near the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cut on the bridge of the nose fever it? - A.No; it was down the side, from the top along the gristle, and another cut across the cheek, from that these two joined in one; there was a cut over the left-eye, and under the left-eye there was a cut from the fore part to the back part of the head, and one across that. In that state I found him.</p>

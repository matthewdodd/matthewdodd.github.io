On the 10th of March, I was in the kitchen having my breakfast - I saw the prisoner come into the shop - he stopped about half a minute - he put his hand towards some half-pence, which were tied up in five-shilling papers - he ran out, and I after him - he went into a house - I ran into the passage, and waited about five minutes - I then got an officer, and went and took the prisoner in the kitchen - he had dropped these half-pence in Burton-street, and Jones picked them up - one of the papers of copper was missing from our shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You were in the kitchen? A. Yes; it is in a line with the shop; but there is a little parlour between them - there is a door from the shop to the parlour, and a window from the parlour to the kitchen - I could see into the shop distinctly - there was no one in the shop when the prisoner was - my mother was with me - I am sure I saw the prisoner in the shop - I did not say at the station that I was in the cellar - I ran out immediately, and saw the prisoner in the street - I did not see him do any thing; but he got round a corner before me, and dropped the half-pence before I saw him again.</p>

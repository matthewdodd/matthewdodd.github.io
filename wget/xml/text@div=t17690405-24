               <p>Q. Was the door of the stable locked over night?</p>
               <p>Harvey. I cannot say whether it was or not. It was not broke open. The two prisoners used to be very much about our place, and being missing at the time the horse was, I suspected them. I went about the country to see for them, and meeting with the keeper of the house of correction of Adgiam, in Hampshire, he asked me if I had not lost a horse; I said I had, a sorrel one with a bald face. Said he, Have you lost any thing else? I said I had, an old sack, marked with T. R. in a ring with a star. He informed me Dyer was stopped with such. I have known Dyer from a child; he was born in the neighbourhood. I lit of Dobbins at the election at Brentford, on the sixteenth day of the month; but the mob took his part there, and took him away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find your horse?</p>
               <p>Harvey. I found him in the parish of Crookham.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Dyer say when you charged him?</p>
               <p>Harvey. He said he met Dobbins with the horse, and when I charged Dobbins, he seemed to lay it to Dyer.</p>

            . I live at Crookham, near Crundal. The two prisoners were at Crookham three weeks ago yesterday, and they asked my son how far it was to Reading. He told them about sixteen miles. Then they asked him if he would buy a horse; they asked him 50 s. for him. At last they allowed him for 30 s. My son telling me this, and that he thought they had stole him, I said, Let us examine them, and take them up. Dyer is a chimney-sweeper. I asked him if the horse was to be sold. It was a sorrel gelding, with a bald face and four white feet; they had him in the road. Dyer said, Yes, the worse is my misfortune. I said, Why so? He said he had a couple of apprentice boys run away from him, and he had heard they were at Guildford, but that he took but sixpence in his pocket, thinking to go to Guildford and back the same day, and when he came there, he heard they had been there and were gone on for Farnham: that he went to Farnham, and there he was told by a chimney-sweeper, of whom they had enquired, that they were gone for Reading, and he said he must sell his horse to bear his charges, for he could do nothing without his two boys. Said I, Where do you live? He said, At Hammersmith. I looked in the horse's mouth, and asked how old he was. He said he did not know. I desired him to trot him; he did: then to gallop him; he did. I then said, What do you ask for him? He said, Six-and-twenty shillings. I said, I suppose you stole the horse; and he said he came very honestly by him. I questioned him very hard, and said, If he would go before a Justice of the peace and clear his character, I would give him five-and-twenty shillings for him: he said he would. I said, Where did you buy him? He said, At Smithfield, and that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050016"></xptr> had had him two years next Whitsun-Tuesday. Said I, Perhaps there is some fault in him that I cannot see, therefore I'll just go up to an old farmer that has more judgement that I. I went and said to him, It is my opinion they have stole the horse. The old man said, I believe so too. He advised me to take him before the Justice The prisoner was very willing to go. I shewed Dyer the road round, and Dobbins and I went the foot way. We met at Sir

            . John's. I told his steward, I believed the two fellows had stole the horse. Sir Harry examined them, and committed them till such time as we could hear of an owner. I had the horse five days before I heard of Mr. Harvey, who came and owned it.</p>

               <p>As I was going along the road. I met this horse with a bridle and sack on him. There was no rider. We thought he had thrown his rider. We enquired all the way we went thro' Shepperton and other places. We could find no owner. We went through Guildford and Farnham, but could not hear of any owner. We were very hard drove for want of victuals, and then we offered to sell the horse. We went there to see if we could get some work.</p>
               <p>Dobbin's Defence.</p>
               <p>Going along together, between four and five o'clock, we met the horse near Sunbury, with a sack and bridle; we went on and enquired for an owner, but could not hear of any body that had lost a horse; then we got upon him and rode to Guildford, and enquired there, but could not find any body that had lost a horse; we then went on, and could get no work. Dyer then proposed to sell him. I said, I did not know whether we had best to sell him or not. I was fearful we should be prosecuted if we did, but at last he resolved to sell him. My friends are in Berkshire, and cannot come.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How old do you take the prisoners to be?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Dyer I take to be about eighteen or nineteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Dobbins. I am about seventeen years old.</p>

On the 26th or 27th of August last, I left my house and went to Aylesbury for three or four days, and on returning missed the articles named in the indictment, which I had left in charge of Banbury, my servant—I have found none of them except the hat, which the policeman brought to my house—it was one I had bought for my son Henry.</p>

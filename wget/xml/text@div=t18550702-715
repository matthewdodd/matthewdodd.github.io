                  </hi>. I am a colonial broker. I was on a visit at Mongolia-lodge, Greenwich—on the evening of 30th May, I was in Green<lb></lb>wich fair—I went about 9 o'clock, and came away in about three quarters of an hour—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket—it was a small silver watch, with a silver dial—it was attached to my dress by a silver chain—I had it safe about three minutes before I lost it—I missed it from my pocket about a quarter before 10 o'clock—there was a good deal of crowding in the fair—I felt a good deal of hustling and pressure at different times—just before I lost my watch I was in a considerable crowd, and was face to face with two or three men, but I could not recollect any faces—my watch was afterwards shown me by Crouch, but I first identified it by the descrip<lb></lb>tion without having seen it—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) that I lost on that occasion—it was twisted from the shank—the bow remained attached to the chain—I had the guard chain round my neck—I did not see the watch again till I was at the police court on the Monday following.</p>

I was on duty in the fair on the evening of 30th May, I saw the prisoner with three others—I watched them, and saw them hustle several persons in the fair for about ten minutes—I missed the prisoner—I followed his three companions till they got to the church—I saw the prisoner come to the other three, and they all went together towards Deptford—I got assistance in the Broadway; I went to the prisoner, one of his companions ran away—I took the prisoner and asked him for the watch—he said he had got none—I took this watch out of his breast coat pocket in the same state that it is now—he said a man had given him half a crown to carry it up to London, and perhaps I had seen the man give it him—I took him to the station.</p>

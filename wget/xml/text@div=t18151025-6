I had twenty one-pound notes in a glove; I got them at Greenwich; they were what I sold my pension for, to take me home. In shaking out a shilling to pay for the gin, the notes fell from the glove, which a woman observed, and went into the tap-room, as I thought, to tell the prisoner and the other men. I picked my notes up, and put them securely into my pocket; I pinned the glove in my pocket. Immediately the men came out of the tap-room to me; one man asked me for a pipe of tobacco. I went into the street, and they shoved me in again, and shut the door; then a man of the name of Gooding asked me for a pipe of tobacco; I gave him two farthings. He said, he did not want any; but putting his hand on my pocket where my money was, and said, this is some of the tobacco that I want, There were nine men standing round me at this time, and the prisoner was one. They were all pushing me about; I knew directly what they wanted, and called to the landlord for help; but he turned himself away, and said, he would not get himself hurt among so great a sight of people. The prisoner had hold of my right arm; I kept singing out to the landlord all the time. This Gooding tore my money out of my pocket in the glove, and jumped out into the street, and ran away. The prisoner had hold of my right arm where he did this; but immediately afterwards let go, and quitted me. I immediately ran after Gooding, and followed him half an hour, and then lost him. I met a gentleman in the street, who took me down to Bow-street, got a warrant for me, and we came back to the house; when I came into the room, the prisoner dodged his head down immediately, and made believe he was drunk. The constable held his head up, and I knew him to be the man that held my right arm. The prisoner was taken down to Bow-street; he was searched; but nothing belonging to me was found on him. I appeared the next day at Bow-street. I have never seen my glove or my money since.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the 1st of October, between eight and nine o'clock, the prosecutor and a parish officer came to me, and told me what had happened. I went with them, and enquired of the landlord, who were the people that robbed the man; he said, that he knew nothing about the people; they had followed the black man in. I then searched his house. I went into the tap-room: the prisoner's face was towards the tap-room door, and he was talking to the company when I opened it; the prosecutor was close behind me. The moment he saw the prosecutor; he shut his eyes, pulled down his hat over his face, ducked his head, and made believe to be drunk, and fell off the settle. I immediately lifted up his head, and the prosecutor swore he was the man who held his right arm in the robbery. He did not deny being in the scuffle; but said he was not the man that robbed him.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came down to Bow-street office between eight and nine on the Sunday morning; I went with him and the gentleman who was with him, to the Turk's Head, where he said, he had been robbed. I called the landlord into the parlour, and asked him if he knew who robbed this poor man; he said, he saw the scuffle, and was afraid to go amongst them, but did not know who it was in particular; and that he had enough to do to mind his customers. I then went and fetched Godfrey, who lives closely; and when he came, we went into the tap-room; as soon as we went in, the prisoner held his head down, and appeared to be very much in liquor. Godfrey held his head up, and the prosecutor said that he was the man who held his right arm while the robbery was committed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary and manager to the Albert Loan Society—I know the prisoners—they came to me on Tuesday, 23d of last month, I think—I had received this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from our office keeper, who is not here—it did not come by post—I was not present when it came—after I had received it I saw Walker on the 23d November at his own residence—I went there—I learnt where his residence was from this paper—I was satisfied with reference to him as a proposed borrower—I produced that paper at our interview—he saw it—we conversed about it and likewise about the surety—I don't think he read it—I read it to him; in the first instance to Walker, and afterwards to Walker and Heatheridge—(<hi rend="italic"> This paper was a printed form of the rules of Albert Loan Society, with regard to proposed borrowers and their securities</hi>)—I made an arrangement to pay the money to Walker between 9 and 10 o'clock the same evening—I said, "I have been to your surety, Mr. Richards of Marylebone-lane, and have seen Mrs. Richards, and if you will come to night with Mr. Richards I will give you the money"—he said he would, and he did so—between 6 and 7 o'clock of the 23d, Mr. Richards of Marylebone-lane, the person whom I believed we were to have for a surety, applied to me and inquired of me whether I had an application for a loan in that name—I told him that I had, and I produced the paper—Mr. Richards is here—neither of the prisoners were present when this took place—they were present afterwards—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that this evidence was not admissible as neither prisoners werepesent.</hi>

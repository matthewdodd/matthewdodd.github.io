               <p>Q. Were you on Saturday the 4th instant, with other servants, waiting at the accompting-house to be paid? - A. Yes, between seven and eight in the evening; I was waiting in a place called the Stone-kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any stacks of copper in that kitchen? - A. There were four stacks of copper in that kitchen; the prisoner was the 4th person in the list to be called; he went out, and missed his call.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do any thing? - A. I saw him take a cake of copper up in both his hands, and put it under his coat, and going out of the door he struck against the door-post, which threw his coat back; I saw the copper quite plain.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there when you saw him take it away? - A. There were seven men and seven boys; I mentioned it to

The prisoner returned in about ten minutes afterwards; we then were in the accompting-house; when he saw us come out of the accompting-house, he seemed to be confused, and asked what was the matter; we made an excuse, and said that master had been talking about our idling our time; he went away the second time without stopping to be paid, and then he came in after that, and was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You first of all saw him take 84 lb. of copper? - A. Yes.</p>

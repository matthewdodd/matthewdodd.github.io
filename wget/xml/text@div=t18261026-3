            . I am principal turnkey of Newgate, and produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction for felony, on the 16th of February last, which I saw Mr. Shelton sign. [The certificate of the prisoner's conviction and sentence, as set out in the indictment, was here put in and read.] I know the prisoner - he was in custody and tried last February Session, on the indictment which has been read; he was moved on the 8th of March, to the Leviathan hulk, at Portsmouth-dock-yard; I saw him safely deposited there. He went by the name of John Jones in Newgate - I am positive he is the man. I saw him again on the 2d of October, when he was committed to Newgate on another charge.</p>

            . I know the prisoner: I first knew him on the 30th of September, by the name of William Bryan - I saw him in my master's shop, No. 7, St. John-street; he came to ask if we had any buck-horn-hooks to sell - I am sure he is the man. My master is a cutler.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was transported it was merely for a petty thing, taking a bit of meat for my children; I was in great distress. I had left a wife and five children, and having opportunities and offers made to me to escape, I at last did escape, and came to see my family. The meat only cost 2s. 7d., - it was a hard thing to send a man out of the country.</p>

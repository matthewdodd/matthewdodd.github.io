On Sunday, the 5th of March, I was in company with Armstrong; he sent me to purchase counterfeit shillings of the prisoner; I had no money at all, he gave me two shillings; I went to Petticoat-lane with Ann Porter, and saw the prisoner, and told her I wanted ten bobs, and she gave me ten counterfeit shillings; I gave her two shillings for them; I had seen her before - I took them to Armstrong and told him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you been convicted of any offence of this sort - A. No; nor was I ever tried - Porter was an utterer of coin, and has been a great sufferer by the prisoner.</p>

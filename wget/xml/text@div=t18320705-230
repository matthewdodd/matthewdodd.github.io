On the 30th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050102"></xptr>of June the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to match a piece of gros-de-naples, which I informed her we had not got; she returned in twenty minutes, to match some ribbon - I showed her the box - she took a piece from the box and looked at it - a customer came in at that time, for when I cut off four yards of ribbon, and on turning back to the prisoner I missed a piece of Petersham ribbon, it being the only piece we had of the colour and quality - I did not like to accuse her of it, but went to the top of the shop, and told Bauer that I missed it; he came forward to look for it- we had a general search for it - I moved the box off the counter, and made the counter clear; the prisoner was then accused of stealing it, and on Bauer's touching her pocket-handkerchief the ribbon fell from it: but previous to that I saw her take the ribbon from her pocket in front, and wrap it up in her handkerchief, which she put on the counter - she had her pocket-handkerchief out when she was looking at the ribbons, and had looked at that Petersham ribbon, and taken it in her hand, having her handkerchief in her hand at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a pocket in front? A. She had; I observed her take something from that pocket into her handkerchief - it must have been the ribbon; and then she placed her hands, with the handkerchief, on the counter, and when her handkerchief was touched the ribbon fell out - she then said she had taken it by mistake - we did not accuse her of stealing it, till after I saw her take something out of her pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not, at first, say you saw her take the ribbon out of her pocket? A. I did, that was a mistake - she took something, and it must have been that; she had her handkerchief in her hand when bargaining for the ribbon, and put it down before her- we did not search for the ribbon above a minute or two after I saw her take her handkerchief from her pocket - she had said, before I went to the other customer, that that Petersham ribbon was not exactly what she wanted, but as I had no other, that must do - our shop may be about forty feet long; I left her at the counter while I went to the end of the shop, to tell Bauer - she was about three yards from the door - there was nothing to prevent her leaving, as far as she knew.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it before you spoke to the young man that you saw her take something out with the handkerchief? A. After; she had taken that ribbon in her hand once to look at - I do not know whether she returned it to the box; I am sure she took something, out of the pocket, put it into her handkerchief, and held the handkerchief before her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she say she would take that ribbon, as you had no other? A. I said I had a piece in reserve, which I would go and get (as an excuse to go to the young man), and then she said if there was no other, that would do - she had her handkerchief in her hand before she put it into the pocket - I cannot tell whether one or two hands went into the pocket; the handkerchief was in both hands - I moved them both down to the pocket.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the pocket tied round her, or in an apron? A. It was under her dress; there was an opening in her dress in front - it is such a pocket as is worn at the side.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. I was at the other end of the shop; Hunt spoke to me - I came forward to notice the prisoner - she was sitting down before the counter; I watched her movements, and told Hunt to search the ribbon-box behind the counter -I saw her pocket rather fuller than is usual in front of a ladies' dress, and saw her moving her hand about in her pocket, but whether she took any thing out I cannot say; I saw her take her handkerchief from her knees, where she had laid it, and put it on the counter, still keeping it in her hand - I touched the handkerchief, and the ribbon dropped out; I charged her with taking it - she said she had taken it by mistake; I sent for an officer; she requested me to let her go, but as my employer was not present, I was obliged to act as I thought proper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say the handkerchief was on her knees? A. Yes, she sat with it in her hand on her knees - there were two young men between her and the door, but perhaps she might have gone out without difficulty; the ribbon is a good size; I saw her put her hand into her pocket, but will not swear she took any thing out - there was an opening in front of her gown, and the pocket went down to her side - there were more valuable ribbons in the box.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the prisoner in charge, and took her to the station; a woman searched her there, and found this piece of silk, one or two shillings, and a few halfpence in her pocket - she said she had taken the ribbon from there, and was very sorry, but it was done quite by mistake, and if money would make it up she would get money, and if I would let her speak to the prosecutor, she had no doubt he would make it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The ribbon does not match that silk? A. No.</p>

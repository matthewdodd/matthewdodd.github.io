             sworn. - I am the wife of the prosecutor: I lost the sheets from the bottom of a house that was repairing; I had given them to a white-washer to hang round the room, to save the paper while he was whiting the ceiling; the moment that I missed them, I saw the prisoner running down the street with them; I went after him, and stopped him myself; I asked him how he came by those sheets; he did not make any particular answer, but turned back, and went home with me; I told him if he would tell me who he was, I would not do any thing to him, but he would not tell me his name, on account of his family.</p>

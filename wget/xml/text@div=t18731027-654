I am a surgeon, at 26, Drury Lane—on the morning of 2nd October, about 1 o'clock, I heard a noise from the next house, which is divided by a court, like a shutter coming down—a short time after that I heard the breaking of glass—I jumped up and went to my private door into the court which divides my house from No. 25—I saw two persons standing by the window of No. 25, in the alley, which is called Broker's Alley—one man ran away, and the prisoner had his arm in the window and he was stooping as if to get his arm through the broken window—I caught him, and he said "It is not me, let me go"—a square of glass was broken, and the shutter was down—the prisoner resisted, and kicked me several times—I pulled him into Drury Lane, and shouted for the police—a constable came up and took him into custody.</p>

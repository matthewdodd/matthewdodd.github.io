                  </hi>. I get my living by selling shrimps. On the 11th of June, I was sitting in a public-house at Greenwich—I was sober—I had a handkerchief, a pocket-book, and a piece of calico, in my right-hand pocket—I saw the prisoner there with three or four others—I fell asleep—my things were all secure then—I was dozing about twenty minutes or more, and when I awoke they were gone, and the prisoner also—I told the landlord I had been robbed, but he said he had enough to do of his own business without troubling his head about mine—I saw the prisoner again about five hours after, as I was sitting at the Five Bells, on the road to London—I followed him and asked a policeman to examine if he had any tbing about him belonging to me, which he did, and found my hafldker<lb></lb>chief and piece of calico buttoned up underneath his jacket—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I have never found my book—I never saw the pri<lb></lb>soner before to my knowledge.</p>

I searched the prisoner, and found this handkerchief and piece of calico buttoned under his coat—I first found this little piece of a stocking in his trowsers pocket, and asked if he had anything else about him—he said he had not—I asked if he had not a pocket handkerchief and a piece of rag about him—he said he</p>

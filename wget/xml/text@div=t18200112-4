On the 23d of December, about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, I was bringing a trunk from the Old Bell, Holborn. As I came up <placeName id="t18200112-4-crimeloc20">Holborn</placeName>

I saw them before they came up to me, and made way for them, but they ran against me, and drove me up a gateway, about five yards from where they met me - it was done wilfully and designedly; the prisoner was on my right hand, he put his hand on my watch; another was on my left, and the other behind, who laid hold of my trunk. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, my friend?" and at that instant his right hand came to my watch. I let go the trunk, and seized him before he got it out of my pocket - all three then threw me down. The prisoner held the watch in his hand, and endeavoured to give it to the others, but I still held him; he said nothing. I screamed out Thieves! knocked the watch out of his hand, and it fell. The witness came to my assistance, and collared the prisoner as he lay down - they were all three on me at that time, endeavouring to get the prisoner clear; the other two escaped; I said I had lost my watch. My case was found first and then the watch. The trunk was about five yards behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner did not take the watch out of your pocket while you was standing - A. Before I fell it was out of my pocket; it was taken out in the struggle. I saw it in his hand, and believe I knocked it out as he was handling it across to the others. It was picked up, and given to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. A woman picked up the watch - A. She picked up the case, and a man picked up the watch. She did not say a taller man threw it away. I heard her say nothing, except</p>
               <p>"Here is your watch-case."</p>

            . I was going into the gateway with a caravan, and heard Mold call for assistance. I saw the prisoner in the gateway, and collared him - Mold had hold of him at the time; there were two others there, trying to rescue him, but when I got hold of him they escaped. I saw the watch given to Mold - I heard the woman say nothing.</p>

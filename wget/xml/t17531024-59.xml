            . I live at Paddington, and keep the sign of the Wheat-Sheaf. On the second of October the prisoner brought two bay geldings, and called at my door at four o'clock in the morning, but I would not get up, for I found it was somebody drunk; I got up at five, or half an hour after, and when I opened the door there was the prisoner and the two horses, they had neither bridle, saddle, nor halter upon them, only two little bits of rope; he put them into the stable ; I thought he had stole them, but would not tax him with it. After we had eat and drank he asked me when Craydon fair was, for he would sell the horses there, and I told him it was yesterday ; he said he was very sorry for that, and ask me when market-day would be in Smithfield, and I told him on Friday ; he said that would not do, it was a long while to Friday ; he asked me if I could help him to any body that would buy one of them; I said, friend, if you come honestly by them, I will buy one; I then sent for one Mr. Holmes, and told him the affair, and desired him to buy the other, and not mind what price he gave, for I believed they were stole, so we bought them both, and gave him earnest on purpose to stop him; after we had gave earnest, we taxed him, and he said he had stole them; he said he brought them about 40 miles off on this side Northampton, and gave 10 l. in cash and a note of hand for 55 s. more. He sold them to us for 5 l. 5 s. I then said, now I'll undeceive you, I will stop you; the horses were advertised, and Mr. Bruiton came, and said they were stole out of his field, and that they belonged to the two former witnesses.</p>

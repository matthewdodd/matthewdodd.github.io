Two of them came opposite to me, one stood at the right hand of me; I discovered a pistol laying by his right side, it was something bright that I took for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150066"></xptr> a pistol; it was a star-light night, the 23d of April in the morning at two o'clock, I believe the moon was then down.

               <p>Harrison. They said your money! I said, I had but little; I told them to take it and spare my life: I was struck over the head with a cutlass, whether it was by them or the third man, I cannot say; there was a third and a fourth came up to me, one of them seemed a boy: I think it was a cutlass I was cut with; they struck me with the hilt on the double of my hat: they took a silver watch with a christial triangle seal, and a four bladed pen knife from me; they told me to cover my face, and commend myself to God; I covered my face as they bid me, they struck me upon the side of my head with a pistol and left me.</p>

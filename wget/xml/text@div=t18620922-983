                  </hi>. I live at Conley Brick, in the parish of Hillingdon—on Sunday afternoon, 14th September, about 3 o'clock, I saw a train on the Great Western Railway, going in a direction from West Drayton to Uxbridge—I was in a lane near the rail—the prisoner was there, and I saw him pick up a, clod of dirt—I thought he was going to throw it at me, and I ran away—he then said, "I am b—d if I do not throw it at the b—y train"—there was a train coming along, and I said, "Don't, you b—y fool, you will get us both transported"—he threw it at the train—I did not see it hit, but I heard it smash the carriages, and then I ran away—the clod was pretty nigh the size of a brick, and it was not very soft.</p>

I am one of the railway guards on the Great Western Railway—on Sunday afternoon, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I accompained the train from West Drayton to Uxbridge, and when I got there I found one of the windows of one of the carriages smashed—there waa no passenger in that carriage—I found on the floor of it the fragments of a lump of earth—the plate glass was knocked from one side of the carriage to the other—it must live been a good weight—there were passengers in the next compartment.</p>

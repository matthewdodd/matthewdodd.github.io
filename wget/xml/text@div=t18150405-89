The prisoner lived next door to me; she had the child to nurse for a fortnight at first, and afterwards one week to wean; she brought the child to me on the Sunday morning, I paid her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050047"></xptr>and wished her to leave the child; she said she was going to Whitechapel, she would take the child with her, and return to breakfast, the air would do the child good.

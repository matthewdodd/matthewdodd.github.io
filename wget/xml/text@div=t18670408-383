                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live with my brother at the Black Bull, Chaton Street, Westminster—on 4th March, between nine and ten the prisoner came for a pot of beer and gave me a bad half-crown—I bent it and should know it again—this is it—I gave it back to him and told him it was bad; he said that it was not—I tried it again and re<lb></lb>turned it to him—he said he got it at Willcox's and would take it back—he did not drink the beer—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

I was on duty, and in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing which was told me I found the prisoner lying in a waggon, which was laid up for the night in Black Horse Yard—I do not think he was asleep; I think he was sober—I asked him what he came there for; he said to go to sleep—I felt his pockets and pulled out nine or ten half-crowns, and then twelve more from his breast pocket, done up in paper—I said, "What do you call these?"—he said, "I don't know nothing at all about it"—there were twenty-six altogether, and one was bent—he said he came from Peascod Street, Windsor.</p>

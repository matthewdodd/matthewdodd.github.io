                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Christopher Edward Smith, of Wimbledon, and live at the farm house. On Saturday, 11th April, at 20 minutes before 5 o'clock in the morning, one of the carmen gave me infor<lb></lb>mation and I found the rick on fire—it was then-quite light—I had been disturbed in the night by the barking of one of the yard dogs, and then I heard footsteps—I got out of bed and saw a person walking by my window—I put on a jacket, went down stairs, and saw the prisoner go into the Black Dog—I asked him his business—he said, "That is my business"—I said, I would let him see—he said "I wanted to lie down, only your dogs would not let me"—I said, that if he was not off the place, I would have him locked up—he' said, "For God's sake, do not, for I am working for you, and this dog has bit me"—when he got out of the gate, about fifty yards into the highway, he said, "I have a bundle, I will go and get my bundle"—I said, "Now you are out, you had better keep out, and if a policeman comes I will have you locked up"—he went into the farm yard, and I did not see him again till 17th April—I searched the place, but could not find any one—I went in, and as the dogs kept barking I dressed myself and went and found this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on a lump of straw against the hayrick, which had been put there recently, as if the prisoner had made his bed there—I carried the bundle in doors, and was aroused about 5 o'clock, the stack was then burning.</p>

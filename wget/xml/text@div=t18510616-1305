                  </hi>. I look after Mr. Ealey's horses. I know the prisoner; he looked after two horses. On the evening of 29th May, I went to the stable—he brought the horse home, and turned her in loose in the stable, and never gave her any victuals—I asked him the reason—he said it was not his place—I said if he did it again I would give him a slap on the head—he began <hi rend="italic">sauceing</hi> me, and said if I touched him, his father would <hi rend="italic">pitch into</hi> me—I turned round to give him a slap on the head; I did not give it him, for he laid down, and I tumbled very nigh over him—he had an open knife in his hand, and he ran it right into my leg; he gave me two stabs; I saw him do it—he did it as quick as he was able—he ran away—I laid down, and they took me to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 16th regiment of Hussars, stationed at Hounslow. On 29th of May I was leaving the barracks, and saw a quarrel in the lane—the prisoner was leaving Cole—I said, "What have you done? you have hurt the boy," as there was blood running from his leg—I took him to the barracks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Hounslow. I examined Cole, and found between his knee and ancle two wounds, one rather longer than the other—one was directly backwards, and went to the bone, half an inch wide, and a quarter of an inch deep; it could not go any deeper in that part—the lower one was three-quarters of an inch long, and about one-eighth of an inch from the other—it was three-quarters of an inch deep, and downwards, so that it could not have proceeded from the same blow—they appeared like stabs.</p>

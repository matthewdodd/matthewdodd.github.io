                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Redman's-row, Mile-end. On the 21st of November the prisoner Lee came to my shop and asked for half-an-ounce of "returns" tobacco—after he was served the prisoner Roberts came in and asked for half-an-ounce of "returns" as well—he was served—when he came in Lee said to him, "Captain Roberts, when did yon arrive?"—he said he arrived with the night-tide, or morning-tide, which he pleased to call it, and that his ship laid in St. Katharine's Docks—Lee said to Roberts,"—You are little aware who you are talking to; you are talking to Mr. Rolls's sister, the plumber, of Wapping" (I am sister to Mr. Rolls, the plumber, of Wapping)—Roberts passed round Lee, and came round to a wicket-door which I have to keep customers away—I pushed him back, and told him what he had to say, to say over the counter—Lee told me not to be alarmed, for Roberts wanted to leave his watch, and I need not be afraid, it was all right—I pushed him again, wishing him not to come in, but he insisted on leaving the watch, saying if it was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he should not be afraid of leaving it with me; that he was going out on a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>, and did not wish to take such a valuable watch with him; he would not take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he then pulled his ring off his finger, left the ring and watch, and asked for two sovereigns on them—he did not say the watch was gold—he said he knew my brother very well, he had done his ship—his name was mentioned, and on that condition I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of my brother's name being mentioned—I believed that he knew my brother—did not look at the watch, to ascertain the value—Lee said there was a great deal of interest wanted among the captains, to get work now, and he seemed rather <hi rend="italic">huff</hi> and cross at it—I considered he thought my brother would have the work of the ship—I gave Roberts a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I have since delivered the watch and ring to the policeman—I had seen Lee before, but not for five or six</p>

               <p>years—I knew him as a painter, but never knew his name—I had never seen Roberts before in my life—I did not see either of them again till they were at the Thames police-office on the Tuesday week afterwards—Lee first called Roberts "Captain Roberts," and then he said "Captain Robert Brown, when did you arrive?"—I am quite certain of both the prisoners—they were dressed more like gentlemen than they are now—Roberts looked like a captain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Roberts</hi>. It was after I got the money that the conversation passed about your brother—I merely borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you, without any represen<lb></lb>tation on my part—did I make any representation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you said you knew my brother, and he had done work for you—you said that be<lb></lb>fore I lent you the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lee</hi>. When Roberts came in he asked for tobacco, I looked up, and said, "Well, Captain, how are you?"—no name was mentioned till he was going out—he asked where the governor was, and I said, "There is no governor, this lady is the sister of Rolls, the plumber. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He said nothing of the kind—he said I was Rolls, the plumber's sister—I parted with the money on the representation that Roberts knew my brother, who had done work for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the K division of police. I have a watch and ring which I received from the prosecu<lb></lb>trix—it is a very inferior watch—it is metal, and will not go—the ring is not worth a penny—the watch and appendages are not worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the K division of police. I have examined the watch, and appendages, and ring—I have been con<lb></lb>nected with the watch-making business all my life—my father was a watch-maker forty-five years—the intrinsic value of the watch is not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but as a toy it may be worth a crown—the case would take a little time to make, but it is of no value—the movements are worth nothing—the chain is of no value, only plated, and the seals are of no real value—they are got up by Jews to be sold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Roberts. Q.</hi> How long have you been a watchmaker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty-seven years—I did not serve my time to it—since I have been in the po<lb></lb>lice I have had hundreds through my hands—I cannot say what the case would cost gilding—I am speaking of the intrinsic value of the movements—it is a mere toy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Roberts</hi>. The gilding would cost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the works are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the chain is German silver; any watchmaker would give different evidence.</p>

I know it is of no use—the key will not wind it up—it has the appearance of a jewelled watch, but it is only the representation of a jewel, only a bit of glass—I know the difference between diamond and glass—I will swear it is not diamond—I will not swear it is glass.</p>

On Sunday, the 22nd of October, I was walking towards Stratford, in Essex, with Mrs. Wood and her two daughters—it was about half-past seven o'clock in the evening—when we came to Maryland-point, near a nursery, I met a man coming towards us—he was running—he had no hat on—I did not notice how he was dressed—I heard him talking as he passed, but did not distinguish what he said—he was in the road, and I was on the footpath—after he had passed I received a blow from some per<lb></lb>son behind, which made me insensible—I know nothing more of the trans<lb></lb>action—the blow was given on the left side of my head—I cannot say exactly how long it was after the man passed that I received the blow—it was not above four or five minutes, I believe, but I cannot say—I have been attended since by Mr. Vallance, a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. On the Sunday evening in question I was walking with my two daughters on the road—when we got near the nursery-ground, at Maryland-point, I heard a scream, as of some person in distress, in the front of us, and saw a man coming towards us, running very fast—he was coming in a direction from the scream—from Stratford—he was in the road—he had no hat on—he passed by us, and as he passed I heard him make use of a very bad, word, and say he would murder some person or persons—he said "d—and b—him, I will murder the b—,"—no other person passed after I heard the scream—we then proceeded on a few yards—I struck my foot against something, and found it was a man's hat—I picked it up—I had not advanced five or six yards at the most then—when I picked it up I looked behind me, and saw the same man turn round and come back again towards us very quick—he was in the road—when he came up, he rushed past me and went up to Mr. Bush, and struck him, on the left side of the head, a violent blow with his fist clenched.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take notice what kind of dress the man had on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he had on a white flannel jacket—I am sure it was flannel, for I had the sleeve of it in my hand, and he had a white hat with a round top to it—he had not his hat on when he ran away from us, but he had when he came up to us—it was knocked off in the scrummage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you doing out that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been down to see a friend, and was returning home—I had dined at home—the stick I speak of was about the thickness of my little finger—we had brought it up on purpose for riding—it was a kind of switch.</p>

               <p>it left behind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the hat</hi>)—this is something like the hat the prisoner had on—it is exactly like it—it is the same kind of hat—I had hold of his sleeve, and had the opportunity of feeling as well as seeing that it was a flannel jacket he had On, and he had a light pair of trowsers on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you said any thing about the blue jacket at all, till she sent for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes; because I had heard people talking about it—I was present at the prisoner's examination—T had mentioned about the blue jacket before then, because I had heard people talking about it—they said he had a white jacket on, and I contradicted them—I heard one or two say he had a white jacket on, a week or two after the accident happened—I did not hear anybody say he had a white jacket on this particular night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you, then, to say a word to his mother about his baring a blue jacket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—she asked if I had seen him—I said I had—she did not mention the blue jacket first to me—she asked me to go and speak for him—I said I would, and tell what dress be had on—she did not tell me what to say for him, but I had seen him in the dress.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then when you got into the witness-box to-day you knew no<lb></lb>thing at all about the effect the blue jacket would have on the case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—no; I did not know what effect it would have—I did not know what use it would be to the prisoner—I did not knot whether it would be of any use to him or not—nobody told me to come here.</p>

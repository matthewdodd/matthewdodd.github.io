               <p>Hayes—for the last 11 years I have been employed as a watcher to Sir Charles Mills—the prisoners work in the brickfield—I have known Miller all his life, and Kitson two or three years—on Monday, 23rd December about 5 in the evening, I was coming across a field in Hayes parish, I heard somebody beating in the cover, I got over a stile out of a ploughed field into a meadow, and walked along one side of the cover, I could not see any one, and I turned back and met the prisoners and another man named Edward Jellaman, who is not apprehended yet; they had just come over the stile out of the cover—Miller had got on a brown jacket, Kitson had some<lb></lb>thing on his face, or it was blacked, I had but one sight, they gave me no chance—I said, "What are you chaps doing here I you had better go away"—they began swearing, language not fit to mention in Court, and said, "What have you to do with it I we will corpse you"—all of them used the language, all together—they then all rushed at me, knocked me down, and kicked me about—I was alone—one of them had a stick in his hand, I had a fork under my left arm that I had been working with all day—while I was down, Miller said, "Have you got any bleeding money about you I if you have we mean having it"—I did not say anything—Miller got his hand in one of my trousers pockets, and Kitson in the other as I laid on the ground—I said, "If you will let me alone I will give you what I have got"—Miller said, "Well, let us have it, then, and bleeding quick"—I then gave Miller a sovereign, I had more in my pocket, I said, "Here is a sovereign, don't knock me about no more, don't murder me"—Miller then hit me in the face with his fist, and said, "We mean finishing of you"—they were all three close together; the other two then began kicking me again—Jella-man said, "Let us corpse him, let us make a job of it now we have got the chance"—Jellaman is a man just about the game age, size, and stamp as the prisoners—they kept kicking me about, and one of them, I can't say which, said, "There are two or three more of you b—s we mean to serve the same"—they kicked me a few more times after that, and then went away, and left me lying in the snow; they kicked me all over my head, at the back of the left ear and face, all down my thighs and private parts, and my hands; there are the scars now—they aimed at my private parts, it was not an accident—Jellaman kicked straight right between my legs as I laid on the ground—just before they went away they kicked my hand, when I tried to save my private parts—I can't say who kicked me there besides Jellaman, they kicked at me there several times, I was partly stunned—I suffered for several days, but not a great lot; I bled, they kicked the skin off me, I was all sores all over the head and face—they kicked the skin off my private parts, and they smashed the back of my hand—I bled all about my face and head—when I recovered myself I went home to a neighbour's, Mr. Trussler, the under gamekeeper, I live in the next house to him—I made a complaint to him, and asked him to go up to Mr. Gold's along with me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 414 <hi rend="italic">A R</hi>). On the. night of 23rd December, in consequence of information of this assault and robbery, I went to the Industry public-house—I made inquiry there for Miller—I did not find him there—I found him in a meadow between Mr. Odell's brickfield and the Willow Tree public-house about 8.30—I said, "Miller, you are charged with assaulting and attempting to rob John Halford at 5 o'clock to-day"—he said, "All right, Mr. Morby, I will go with you; I know nothing about it; I have been drinking at this house with my mates the last three hours"—we were then close to the Willow Tree—I afterwards went into the Willow Tree and found Kitson, Jellaman, and George Drinkwater, sitting in the taproom—I did not apprehend Kitson that night; Mr. Gould decided to take out warrants for him and Jellaman, as Kitson was stated to have had a black face, and Jellaman was not known personally to Halford—his name was not mentioned that night, Kitson's was—I ultimately apprehended Kitson on 18th January at the London Gas Works, Nine Elms—I said to him, "You are charged with assaulting and attempting to rob Halford on 23rd December at 5 o'clock"—he did not answer at first; he seemed very nervous as I was putting on the handcuffs—he said, "I am innocent of the job; I will go with you"—I said, "Where is Jellaman?"—he said, "Jellaman, I don't know him; I might know his nickname, but I don't know Jellaman"—he afterwards said, "I was coming home on Saturday night to save you the trouble."</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Parrott, a surgeon at Hayes—about 7.30, on 23rd, Halford was brought to me; I examined his face and head—I found 10 superficial bruises or wounds about the head and face; they had bled profusely; the skin was broken—the left ear had been bleed-ing profusely, but the hæmorrhage had stopped; that was a very dangerous injury—there were considerable bruises about the hips; they were not lacera tions; the skin was not broken—on the back of the left hand there was a severe bruise, the skin being broken—he remained under my care about 10 days; he was in bed the most part of the time—the testicle was severely</p>

I am sure Miller had on a white hat in the morning, and also at 6 o'clock; he kept his hat where his clothes were—as a usual thing he did not wear his white hat—I have seen the hat on the top of the cupboard, but never saw him wear it before; it was a thing that struck me—my husband saw him at 6; I don't know whether he noticed the hat; he stood in the tap room—Miller has no pilot coat.</p>

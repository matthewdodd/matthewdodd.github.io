I am a chairman, my stand is at the corner of King-street and Bury-street, I do not know the day of the month, this all happened on one day; I was sent for by a little child to a perfumer's shop to go of a message for a gentleman, there I found the prisoner, he was writing; he said, will you go of a message for me; I said, I would with all my heart; he desired me to wait till he had done writing; when he had finished it he came out into the street to me; when we came by ourselves, he asked me if I knew the Star and Garter, Pall-mall; I said, yes, very well; he said, go there, you will find a gentleman there from Cornhill with a parcel, go into a private room; he gave me this bill, and I was to pay for the parcel: I was to pay six guineas for the goods, and to bring him 3 l. 14 s. and if any body asked me where I came from, I was to say I came from St. James's coffee-house; then in a few minutes before we parted he said, if any body asked me where I came from, to say I came from Kensington; he gave me a 10 l. note or draft, I can neither write nor read; I asked him what I was to pay, he told me as I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where he had that paper from?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No, I cannot, he was writing a cover to put over the note, as he told me; I observed, as he was writing, there were numbers of lines on that paper; I asked him where he lived, that I might come and return your change and the goods; he would not tell me, but took down my name, and where my stand was, and said he would come to me at my stand in the afternoon, or on the morrow morning; he walked down the paved-alley, and said he would wait there till I came back, there I parted with him; then I went to the Star and Garter, and asked if there was a parcel brought there from Cornhill; the waiter said there was, and directed me to Mr. Gloucester; I said to him, have you brought some goods; he said, yes; I said, what do they come to; he said, six guineas; I said, you was to bring change for a 10 l. note; he said, yes; I said, then give me 3 l. 14 s. here is the bill; he said, let me see the note; the prisoner had bid me not part with the note without the change; I said, give me the money you shall have the note; he took and looked at the note, and said, chairman, come along with me to my master's house, and you may have the change; I went with him, his master said the note is as good as the Bank, go and change it; he was gone about half an hour, the gentleman went to see why they kept him so long: after that I was sent for, and examined by Mr. Cole; he said to me, I was liable to be sent to the Compter or Newgate; said I, if there is any thing wrong it is not my fault; they went back to the counting house, and came to me again, and asked me who I knew in the city; I told them where I had brought papers and Bank notes, and gave a good account of myself; then they asked me which way I could take this man, or I must suffer myself; I said, if they would send a clerk with me to St. James's, the goods lay at the Star and Garter; they sent the clerk with me, we went up to the Swan about four in the afternoon; between eight and nine I was informed the prisoner had been at the shop to enquire for me, and had left word; I had left word I had the change and the goods; before I got to the door I saw him standing by the shop-door; he asked what I had done; I said, I had the change and the goods; he said, very well; I laid hold of him; said he, what do you lay hold of me for; said I, you are the King's prisoner, you must give an account of your hand-writing: Gloucester followed me immediately; the prisoner said, if you will go to St. James's-street I will pay you for the goods, and settle all the affair; coming into Great King-street I met the merchant's clerk, I said, this is the man, and I beg you will assist me, I had him by the arm; he begged hard for a coach; I took him into the house, we had a pint of wine; I asked him what was the reason he put me in such danger; he got out in a minute, and got as far as St. James's-square, this was about the hour of ten at night; I ran and laid hold of him again near the Duke of Leeds's, and sent for a hackney-coach, and brought him to Sir

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>The body of the bill in question is not my handwriting, nor had I any intention to defraud; I should therefore hope that the charge against me is not true; I have some time gone to the West-Indies with particular kinds of goods; being at the Island of Barbadoes I became acquainted with Mr. Harrison, he endorsed the said bill; I had not seen him till under the Piazzas in Covent-garden, on the 8th of July; he said he should be but a little time here, and he wanted three cloaks to make a present of to three ladies at Bath: he knowing I had carried on such trade in the West-Indies, he ordered me to get them, and to be left at the Star and Garter, Pall-mall, by the morrow morning, desiring me to order the person to bring change for a 10 l. bill: pursuant to his direction I went to the prosecutor, and ordered them; going to cross St. James's-square with a young woman, on the Saturday, I happened to meet Mr. Harrison, he took me by the hand; I told him the cloaks would be ready for him; he thanked me very kindly, and pulled out his pocket-book, and gave me the bill, and desired me to receive the change, and order the cloaks to be kept till called for, which he would do in two or three days, and I being engaged to go to Kensington, got that chairman to go. This is a true narrative of my case; I solemnly protest I had no intention to defraud any body, nor did I know it was a bad bill; I have not been able to find out Mr. Harrison since; I understood him that he lodged at Charing-cross, but he did not tell me where; he appeared to me in the West Indies to be a man of character and reputation; this was the 7th or 8th of July, I was committed the 9th; I have made all the enquiry possible I could for him; I hope from the nature of the case, and my general character, the honourable court will think I am not guilty; the chairman threatening me, I thought my life was in danger, was the occasion of endeavouring to get away.</p>

            . I am a warehouse man in Cateaton-street; I have known the prisoner some time, he has an extreme good character; to my knowledge he used to trade abroad, he has been in North America and places abroad; he has been trusted with large sums; had he applied to me he should have had twenty or thirty pounds, had he wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this bill.</p>
               <p>Reeve. (He takes it in his hand.) Neither the indorsement nor any part of it, I do not think bears any resemblance to the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen him write?</p>
               <p>Reeve. I have often.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner trade in?</p>
               <p>Reeve. He traded abroad; he was connected with Col. Tucker and Mr. Hunt of Aldermanbury, who recommended him to people here.</p>
               <p>- Swainton. I have a place in the Custom-house; my acquaintance with the prisoner first commenced in the year 1753; I never knew his character in the least called in question till this time, relating to this charge; I was acquainted with him very intimately for five or six years, he has continually paid me visits; I have known a number of people more intimate with him than I was, and had he been the least faulty I think I should have heard it; if he had come to me, so good an opinion I had of him, I would have let him have thirty, forty, or fifty pounds on his word; this I said before Sir

DALY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever seen the man before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I gave a description of him to the police—I said he was a gentlemanly sort of man, with a black moustache and black beard—he wore dark clothes, a fashion<lb></lb>able coat with side-pockets—when I returned from the walk he was gone.</p>

I saw the prosecutor standing with two females at Chesterfield Street; he was in liquor and bleeding at the nose. Each side of him was a female, and in front a man shorter than myself, and dressed rather respectably. Prouse stood on the curb by the side. They were all that were present."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 33, West Street, Somer's Town—Duling occupies the back room second floor in my house—on the evening of the 9th December I was at home about ten o'clock up to half-past five in the morning, when I went to work—Duling was in the house all the evening—I am certain it was on the 9th December, because my brother-in-law had been a teetotaler, and he had a friend come to see him that evening, and he went out with him and had a drop of beer—I was examined before the Magistrate; my brother-in-law is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you hear that Duling was charged with anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till about a day after he was charged—it happened on a Monday, and I heard of it on the next Wednesday, about a week after—I don't say that Duling was at home every night that week—he is gene<lb></lb>rally home about ten or eleven—sometimes he sleeps out on a Saturday night, but very seldom—I was in bed about half-past ten or a quarter to eleven—I sleep in the back room down stairs, and Duling up stairs—there are four other lodgers in the front room, two have gone away—one sleeps along with my brother-in-law—they go out about half-past six or seven to work—I did not see Duling go out in the morning, but my misses slays he went out as usual—I never knew Duling out of work above a day or two since he has lodged with me, and he has been there three months—he works at the coal trade, and goes out in the morning about the same time as the other chaps—I have seen Griffiths visit him now and then, but not often.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at the house of the last witness—on the night of the 9th December I had a friend come to see me—I went out and had a little beer with him between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock, and when I came home Duling wished me good night in his room—if it was not his voice it was a voice so like his that I should not know them apart—it was as I passed his door to go to my room—I am clear about the date, because I had been a teetotaller about three mouths before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you swear it was Duling's voice you heard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I can—I gave evidence at Bow Street—the police sergeant came to our house first about this—I think that was in the same week—I had often bid Duling good night before—I don't think I did after the 10th December; I might and I might not.</p>

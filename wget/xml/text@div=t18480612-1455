                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman. H</hi> 65.) On 18th May, about a quarter to ten o'clock at night, I was on duty on the South-quay, London-docks, where casks of brandy were lying—I saw the prisoner crouching between the casks, and heard a rippling of liquid in the water—I turned my light on him and asked what he was after—he made no answer—I pulled him away, and heard a rattling like a piece of tin—I said, "You are at the brandy," and pulled him on to the pavement—I saw Luton take a tankard with brandy in it from the same spot.</p>

I was called by Brock, who had the prisoner by the collar—I found a spile where he described, and drove it in, also this tin pot with brandy in it—I asked the prisoner some ques-tions—he gave no answer, but appeared drunk—I sent him to the station, called the captain up, went into the forecastle and found four bottles of brandy in the prisoner's berth, which was close to where he was found.</p>

I am assistant master-cooper in the London-docks—a cask of brandy was pointed out to me by Luton—I found this spile in the head, and a hole open by which brandy could be extracted—about half a gallon was gone from it—the brandy found is of the same quality as that in the cask and that in the prisoner's berth—I broke open the prisoner's chest, and found two bottles of brandy with the corks out—he said he brought them from Sharant—he had come from Sharant as a seaman in the same vessel as the brandy was in.</p>

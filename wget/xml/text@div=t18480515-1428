                  </hi> I am wife of James Day Quy, a draper, of the Commercial-road—the prisoner was in our service four months—she left on Monday week. I missed two shawls, thirty-three yards of muslin, and a scarf—I had seen the prisoner with one of the shawls on, but did not know it then—my husband afterwards asked her if she had seen it—she said no—he charged her with stealing it—she denied it, and said she bought it in the City—I asked where—she would not tell me—I sent for a constable—Sergeant May came, examined her box, in her presence and mine, and found these two remnants of muslin—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine—she produced this shawl and scarf out of her box—they are my husband's—she knelt down and said she was very sorry she had taken them, but she had not taken the shawl and piece of muslin—she was not given in charge, but dismissed—she left next morning—the washerwoman's daughter brought me eight yards of muslin, which she had given her for a dress—I showed it to the prisoner, and asked her how she came by it—she said the apprentice, Jessop, gave it her—it is my husband's.</p>

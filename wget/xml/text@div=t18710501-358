                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Merriman &amp; Pike, solicitors, of 25, Austin Friars—we keep an account at the London Joint Stock Bank, Princes Street—the prisoner was in our service—he came to us towards the end of June, and left towards the end of August—he was cashier and book-keeper—it was his duty to take charge of the cheque-book, and to fill up cheques and the counterfoils—I have the cheque-book here, which was in use at that time—it was our practice to draw cheques, payable to a letter and number—the number would be the consecutive number in the cheque-book, and the letter would correspond with a book that we keep, which is practically our cash-book—we begin with the letter A, and go on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187105010004"></xptr>
               <p>through the alphabet—when the prisoner was there our cheques were drawn to the letter I—we do not use J—this cheque purports to bear my signature, of the firm—Mr. Merriman also signs for the firm, but our two signatures are quite different—this is an imitation of my signature—it is not written by me, or by my authority; no part of it—I know nothing whatever of the transaction of 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stamp-duty—it is one of the cheques out of this cheque-book—I find a page of three cheques missing from the books, coun<lb></lb>terfoils, and all—I have no doubt whatever that the filling up of this cheque is in the prisoner's writing—I produce a number of genuine cheques, filled up in the writing, while he was with us, also this account and letter—these two letters and agreement produced by the officer were sent to the prisoner, signed by me, in the name of the firm—the prisoner's salary was, I think, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

I live at 23, Aldenham Street, St. Pancras—I am a reader for the press—I have known the prisoner about three years—I remember his coming to me about the beginning of February—I don't remember the day—he told me he was in a little money difficulty, which he expected to get over in a day or two; that he was going away from home, and it was rather expensive, and I told him he might come and live with me for two or three days if he liked—I think he came on the Wednesday evening, and he stayed till the Monday following—he then left, by getting over the garden wall at the back—his son came to see him and said there was some one suspicious outside—I thought it might be a sheriff's officer—and it was after that he got over the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Southampton Row, Bloomsbury—I am a lithographer—I have made handwriting my study for a great many years—I have looked at the cheque for 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also at the other cheques and documents produced, and I have no doubt whatever that the filling up of that cheque is in the same handwriting as the filling up of the other cheques; and also in the same handwriting as this account—I rather think that the signature to the cheque is an imitation of the signature to one of the letters written to the prisoner by Mr. Pike—it bears more resemblance to the signature to those letters than to the signature to the cheques—the lower part of the figures "3" and "5" in the amount 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the forged cheque are terminated in a very peculiar manner—they are formed very deliberately, and terminate in dots—both of those figures occur in the cheque of 26th July, 1870, for 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they are terminated pre<lb></lb>cisely in the same manner—the figure "5" occurs also in the cheque of 27th July, 1870, and the termination of that figure corresponds—the figure "3" also occurs in the cheques of 30th July, and 3rd August, and that corresponds with the "3" in the forged cheque—and not only are the figures terminated in that peculiar manner, but some of the letters also—the capitals "S" and "T" in the forged cheque are both terminated in the same manner as the figures, after the same plan—there is a peculiarity of the writer to dwell upon those terminations—although he writes rather a free hand, yet those particular terminations seem to be slowly done, even to forming a dot at the end—in the cheque of 28th July, 1870, the capital "T" in the word "Two" is terminated very nearly in the same way—and also the "T" in "Ten" in the cheque of 5th August—the "d" in "pounds," in the forged cheque is terminated in rather a peculiar manner, the tail being thrown close over the other letter; the "d's" lie down on the other letters which precede them—that is a common way of making the letter "d"—still there is something peculiar in the closeness in which the tail lies over the line of writing—it is in the word "hundred"—I should say I made a mistake—the same peculiarity occurs in the word "referred" in the letter of 15th August—the "T" in "Tier" terminates in the manner I have pointed out—the abbreviation for the word "and" occurs I think eleven times in the various documents written by the prisoner, and in every instance, without exception, it is joined to the word which follows it, as in the forged cheque—in the dating to the forged cheque there is no stop after the name of the months, or after the figures of the year; no punctuation; and there is no punctuation to any one of the cheques—that is an unim<lb></lb>portant point, but it is one among a number—the letters "oun" in the word "pounds" are very characteristic, finishing with a dot before it so connected with the next letter—and in every one of the cheques the "i" is formed in the same way—the word "fifteen," in one of these cheques, and in the 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, perfectly agrees—I speak without any doubt what<lb></lb>ever on the subject.</p>

               <p>I little time to arrive at the conclusion, but I kept on, to be assured that I was well warranted in giving evidence—I would not give evidence without a very careful examination—there are other experts besides me—Mr. Netherclift is one—he and I have differed; in the celebrated Ryves case I our opinions were diametrically opposite upon a number of documents—I was not examined in that case; it so happened that the case broke down before it came to my evidence—Mr. Netherclift is a gentleman of some eminence as an expert—one of us must undoubtedly have been mistaken.</p>

I am an accountant, my office is at 15, King I Street, Cheapside—I have known the prisoner about four years—I have I frequently seen him write, and know his handwriting well—I was clerk in the same office with him two and a half years, at Mr. L. H.

             I am a constable. On Monday morning the 20th of March, I went to Mr. Dines's, I went to the Attic story, I found Mr. Dines and the prisoner there, Mr. Dines said, these articles that lay here in the first parcel, they were then laying on the floor, he told me that he gave me that property and the prisoner into custody; he said he found the laees in the prisoner's box. I searched the prisoner, in her pocket, I found nineteen lengths; I likewise found in her pocket this small key, on trying it, it fitted a piece of musick, that Mr. Dines had in his room, I took the prisoner and the lace into custody, the key I found upon her opened the table drawer I enquired in what room she laid the night proceeding, he said in the kitchen, in one of the beds, the feathers began to issue out, Mr. Dines said, here is a creek here, we began feeling about the bed, I found four pair of silk stockings about the feathers in the bed, and likewise this bugle lace wrapped up in paper, and this paper of pins.</p>
               <p>Q. To Dines. Look at that property - A. The stockings have got my mark upon them; the sattin had been used by the work people, a bonnet had been made by the work people; they cut it off with a slope, the prisoner cut it off with a slope to prevent detection. I compared the sattin before the officer, it tallied exactly, I can swear to the whole of the articles produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house situated - A. In the parish of St. Andrew's Holborn.</p>

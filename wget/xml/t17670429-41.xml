            . I am a clerk to the treasurers of the Navy, employed to pay seamen's wages at Portsmouth. On Tuesday the 17th of February, I was in the Pay-office; the prisoner came in and applied to Mr. Hill, desiring to know if the other seamen of the Modeste were paid or not. Mr. Hill asked her if she had any authority, any will or power from her husband; she said she had none. Then he said he could give her no intelligence; then she began to cry, and said she lived with one Mr. Field, a salesman in Thames-street, and was employed in making of bags for him. I wanted to know if she could prove herself the widow; she said she was well known to one Mr. Everden that lived there. Then he let lier know what was due to Walker, as we concluded her to be the widow; she asked what steps she must take; I told her she must get her marriage certificate, and take out an administration at the Commons, and swear the wages were under 40 l. I taking her to be an ignorant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290020"></xptr> woman, wrote it down for her. She asked me if it was necessary for her to come again to Protsmouth to receive; I told her she might receive the wages in London, but cautioned her to employ such that were of reputation, and if she was not the real widow to be careful, for it would be of bad consequence; she went away very thankful. After that I found a letter, in looking over forae papers from an agent in London, giving an account to take care, for there was another letter of attorney taken out in Doctor's Commons. I then wrote to the gentlemen I had recommended her to, to tell them there was such a fraud as I apprehended. I sent to Mr. Everden, who said Mr. Walker was something related to him; he said he believed Walker had left a widow, whom he apprehended was in Portsmouth, but he had not seen her. We found the prisoner was wife to a cook of a ship, and this cook had received half a year's pay, to enable his wife to go to London to take out the letters of administration to

On the 23d of February I went to the office, and found her there with her husband, the cook of the Infanta, and Everden the shoemaker was with them; this was at the pay-office at Portsmouth. I asked the cook if the prisoner was his wife; he said she was. I asked Mr. Everden if he knew her, and if she was Walker's wife; I think he said she was the widow of his grandson, that was Walker. I then asked the prisoner how she came to tell me such a story, that she lived in London. I observed this paper in her hand; (the forged certificate produced) by looking on the back of it I was convinced she had been at the Navy-office.

               <p>Mr. Binstead. I am an attorney at Portsmouth; I saw the prisoner at Portsmouth on the 23d of February, in the morning; she came to me, and said she was recommended by the gentlemen at the pay-office; there was a man with her that appeared to be her husband; she wanted me to repeal letters of administration that had been made, for her husband had married two wives; I told her it would be expensive. I asked her which was the first marriage; she said her's was; then I told her the other was void. I asked her where she was married; she said at Rochester. In the course of the conversation she laid this certificate on my desk; I thought it looked like a writ; I asked what it was; she told me it was a certificate of her marriage. Upon looking it over, from the diction, and spelling, and what I saw upon it. I said this is a forgery; no clergyman could ever write such a certificate as this. She said no, it was not; I turned away to one Everden that was with her, that pretended to be a relation; I told her if she would go to the pay-office, they would look it over. She went out of the house; I took great care to follow her at a distance; as she went on one side the house, (as I thought:) I went on the other; I went on to the pay-office, and staid there four or five minutes; she never came; after that we went to see for her, but could not find her; then I went on board the ship, and found Peck the husband; he said she was gone away; I sent people after her, they went on the road, and I had word brought me they had secured her. They brought her, according to my order, to Mr. Hughes, at the pay-office; there she said she got this certificate made in London by a man; then she said, she never had been married to

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Wrardour-street, Soho. On Saturday evening, 27th November, a person came to my shop to buy a pair of boots—I believe the prisoner to be that person—he tried on a pair of boots and agreed to buy them—the price was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he gave the name of Mortimer, and they were to be sent in his name to 21, Soho-square—I have a boy named Edwin Smith, and I sent him with them about eight minutes after the prisoner went away—the prisoner had not paid for the boots, and I gave the boy a shilling—the boy was gone about a reasonable time to arrive there and to return—he might have been gone about eight minutes—he came back without the boots, and gave me a bad sovereign—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. Carey. On 27th November I got a pair of boots from my master, between 8 and 9 o'clock, and got a shilling from him to give change—I was to go to 21, Soho-square to ask for the name of Mortimer—I went and found three 21's, but could not find a Mr. Mortimer—in consequence of that, I was bringing the boots back again, and the prisoner touched me on the shoulder—I am sure the prisoner is the man—he asked me whether I was bringing the boots from the shoemaker's shop in Wardour-street—he took the boots and gave me a sovereign out of his pocket, and told me to go and get change—I told him I had got change, and gave him the shilling and the boots—he told me his name was Mortimer—I brought the sovereign to my master—I saw the prisoner again on the next Monday in Queen-street, Seven-dials—I knew him directly I saw him—I followed him, and he went in a public-house—I fetched a constable and gave him in custody.</p>

I was informed by the landlord of the house, that it must be the prisoner; for I had the fore garret, and the prisoner, her mother, and sister, had the back garret, but before I came home, they were moved out, for Mr. Lewis did not like their conduct; I found some of my goods at one

The prisoner and her mother helped me to put them up into the boxes, when I went out of town, and they helped me to put up my linen; sheets, table linen, &amp;c. I lost a large trunk of linen, the trunk was opened, and the linen taken out; and I lost a large parcel of books, and a great many other things, I lost between 40 and 50 l. worth of goods.</p>

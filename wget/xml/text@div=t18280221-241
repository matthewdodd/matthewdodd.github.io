The prisoner, at half past ten o'clock on Sunday morning, the 27th of January, came into my shop, and asked for two sixpences for a shilling; I went into the parlour to give him the two sixpences - the parlour is very dark; I brought my bowl of silver out; I had four half crowns among it: I was handing the two sixpences to him, when he grasped my silver and said,"Excuse my freedom, Ma'am, I thought you had a new shilling there, I have had two that was bad;" he had the two sixpences, and went out saying, "I wish you a good morning, Ma'am, I hope you find the shop answer:" I thought that there was some of the silver gone - there was more silver gone than the half crown; my husband came in - I followed the prisoner about a quarter of a mile; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210128"></xptr>came up to him near Shadwell church - I said, "You are the man that I gave change to, you have taken a half crown;" he said, "Don't make a bother, Ma'am, here's a half crown; I'd sooner give you one than have a bother."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure you had four half crowns in the bowl? A. I am; I told the prisoner he had robbed me - my husband did not say that he had taken one to pay for meat; I collared the prisoner - he did not say that his character was worth more than a half-crown.</p>

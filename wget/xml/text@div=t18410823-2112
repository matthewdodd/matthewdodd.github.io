                  </hi>. I live in Union-place, New-road, and am a bottle-mer<lb></lb>chant—Birch had been in my employ a long time—Skarrett had been my porter but was discharged. On the 10th of August, in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation, I and my wife placed ourselves at a bed-room window which commanded a view of the premises—there is a dirty bottle-warehouse there—a little before six o'clock in the morning Birch came to his work—he went into the washing-room and came out again—we then saw Skarrett at the corner of Nottingham-place—he ran across the road to our place—I ran down to the door which was then being fastened, and Skarrett was gone down the New-road—I ran after him till he stood to rest—he had this hamper filled with bottles, which I believe to be mine—I missed a hamper when I returned—I did not see the prisoners together—Skarrett could not have got in without Birch letting him in—this hamper and bottles could not have got out without Birch's assistance.</p>
               <p>

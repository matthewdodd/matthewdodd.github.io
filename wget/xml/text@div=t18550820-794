My father is a watchmaker and jeweller, at Port<lb></lb>sea—these three letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) relating to watches and jewellery, are in my writing—I saw some watches packed, and sent by rail; one gold watch on 19th May, No. 507, Hancock; and on 6th May, a gold Geneva watch, Batten, No. 1,014; and a gold Geneva watch, No. 2,221—I have never received them back again.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my employment—his business was generally at the watch repairs—these three letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are all indorsed in his writing in the French language—(<hi rend="italic">These were dated, May</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th, May</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th, and May</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th, each stating that the watch to which it related had been sent by railway</hi>)—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was kept by the pri<lb></lb>soner—here is an entry in his writing in French—"No. 507, May 19th, C. E. Smithers, gold watch, English, gold dial, repaired;" "No. 10,149, May 30th, C. Smithers, 1 gold watch, gold dial, cylinder," there is no date of delivery—the next is, "No. 6,221, May 31st, C. Smithers, 1 watch, not done, June 12th"—I do not know the reason that "not done" was put there—12th June is the day that the watch was sent back—it is opposite both these Nos. 6,241 and 47, there is no date opposite the No. 10,149 one—the prisoner would make the entries from the watches, not from the letters—the numbers are generally very indistinct—I do not see the watches—all I know is from this book—if the watches had not been received by the prisoner, he would not make an entry from the letters, the entry shows that the watches were received by him—a delivery book was also kept—I have an errand boy named Robert Smith—on 12th June, supposing the two watches had been sent there properly, it would be the prisoner's duty to make the entry in the delivery book, and the errand boy would take them—if the prisoner took them, it would be his duty to put his name in the delivery column—there are no entries of the returns of</p>

               <p>these watches—this other book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), is for the work done by the workmen—when watches are returned the repairs are charged in this book, it is the prisoner's duty to keep it—here are no entries of these three watches in it—if they had been returned, the entry would be here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If any one has a watch to repair, would he enter it when it goes out to be repaired? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he charges what is to be charged, in this book to the party when the watch is sent away; a mark is then made across, in this large book to show that they are gone—his duty was to enter it when he received it from the customers, and when he received it back from the workman—he would also enter the date at which he sent it off, and strike out the number—the entries of two of the watches are correct, but one watch is not scratched out and has no date—I am sure that this is No. 6,221, and not 4,221—he made his sizes like this—I have never known it to happen that watches were received by the other clerks, and not put before the prisoner to enter—none of the others received watches—the railway people deliver to him when he is there, or if he is not there to anybody who may be in the front office—that would apply to myself or the book keeper—if the book keeper received two or three watches from the railway he would take the parcel to the prisoner, and put it on his desk without saying anything.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that these marks indicate that the watches have been sent back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this No. 10,149 is not struck out—if this "6" should be a "4" there is no entry, but it is a "6"—all watches that came to my place to repair went through the prisoner's hands—if anybody received a parcel of watches when he was not there, it was their duty to hand them to him and he would make the entries.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. Stauffer.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That is when they go by railway? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the pri<lb></lb>soner wrote the body of this—here has been one entry here, a parcel to Mr. F. Claude, of Manchester, taken by Kauffman, the book keeper, on Feb. 14th—that is the only entry of his—the book keeper is not here—nobody but the prisoner entered in this large book, unless it was occasion<lb></lb>ally, but very seldom, if he was out it might have been done by some<lb></lb>body else—the book keeper would receive and enter if the prisoner was absent, but he would not send off a watch—he does not understand any<lb></lb>thing at all about it, but he might enter if he received when the prisoner was not present—if a customer called for his watch, and the prisoner was not present, he was generally sent back again, because I understand nothing about the jobs—the book keeper did not send away watches occasionally, when the prisoner was not there, that I know of—if there was nothing to be charged for a watch it would still be entered—an entry would be made of its going out—every watch sent up by Mr. Smithers would be entered in this book.</p>

                  </hi>. 1 am in the employment of Mr. Stauffer, as manager of the business—I know the prisoner very well—when he was taken into custody, I asked him if he knew where Mr. Smithers' watch was, because I had searched and could not find it—it was watch No. 10,149, but I did not say anything to him to mark out that particular watch—I believe he knew; I supposed he knew what I was alluding to—he said that the case was sent to Mr. Brown for repairs—Brown is a case repairer—I have searched for the movements of that watch, and cannot find them.</p>

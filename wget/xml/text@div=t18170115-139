The prisoner had chaired for me about three months, she used to come in the day-time. About the 29th November, I went up to my bed-room and found my box empty, and missed several things from my drawers, the next day the prisoner came as usual, and I asked her if she knew of my loss, she said she knew nothing of it, about half an hour after she said she had robbed me, I said I thought it was her, she said if I would go to her lodgings she would tell me all about it. I went up with my husband, and she gave us the duplicates and said she would tell me the rest on Monday. She said the duplicates were for the only things that she had taken, she went away. Her husband gave me the duplicate of a pair of trowsers.</p>

            . I learned from my wife, that I had been robbed, I asked the prisoner about it on the 30th of November, she denied it for some time; I told her I would have her lodgings searched, and desired my wife to detain her. As I was going out of my door she said, do not go, if you and mistress will come to my room, I will tell you where the things are. She said she had robbed us, and gave me nine duplicates, saying, she hoped I would be merciful and let her come and finish her work that day, and she would let me know where the remainder of the things were; my wife gave her leave, and in the afternoon she said, there was a place in Bishopsgate-street, where she had pledged several things without tickets, she said she had been to the place and that they were so busy they could not attend to her, and that she was to go again on the Monday and she would get them. I expected to see her on the Monday morning, but we found she had ran away. We went round to the pawnbrokers, and found the things to be our property, and told the officer to look for her.</p>

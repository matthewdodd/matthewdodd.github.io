                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Snow; our private residence is No. 72, Portland-place; the prisoner was in our service for about two years. I missed a christening-robe belonging to one of my children, I suspected the prisoner, she was questioned about it, but not in my presence—some Irish linen was missing, and I asked her if she had taken it—she said no, she knew nothing about it—I did not make her any promise, or threaten her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell her she might as well tell you about the Irish, as what you wished to know about was the christening-robe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Lately I did—it was then that she made a statement about the Irish, and not until then—I said I would forgive her if she would tell me about the Irish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was she spoken to about any other things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the robe and some caps—she said the head nurse who had left had never given them into her charge—the head nurse was confronted with her, and said in the prisoner's presence that she had—the prisoner still maintained that she knew nothing about them—her boxes were searched by a policeman on the Saturday morning after—I was present, and saw the policeman find</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184101040007"></xptr>
               <p>all these articles now produced, and which are stated in the indictment—here are two little silver spoons, a pair of silver tongs, and some beads belonging to my children—these are the aprons which were made out of the Irish, and this is one of the children's frocks—the prisoner cried after these things were found, but she said nothing—she was present at the time they were found, and I recognised them as my property in her presence at the time—she made no answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She was under-nurse, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I had her from the Rev. Mr. Towers, in Essex, and had a very good character with her for seven years—my head nurse is not here, nor was she brought before the Magistrate—these pinafores had been worn a little, but they are not old—when the children's things are done with, the head nurse brings them to me to look over, and then I give her what I think the children may not use any more—I did not give the head nurse any when she went away, for she went away very ill—I am certain she did not take any away—this bonnet was found in a deal box belonging to the prisoner, which had no lock to it, but it was nailed down—it was kept in a cupboard in the nursery—when she was told to give up all the things be<lb></lb>longing to the children to the head nurse, she kept these things back—she did not deny that it was her box—I cannot swear that it was—some frocks and other things, which are not here, were found in that box—she said they had been given to her by the head nurse, and I did not make a dis<lb></lb>cussion about it—all the things that are here were in use at the time the head nurse was in my service, except these children's toys—we had only removed from another house to the present a fortnight, when this discovery was made—all my boxes had been unpacked—I cannot say whether all the prisoner's were—I believe they were—these little toys were usually in my sitting-room, but they have been constantly in the nursery, and these glass and blue beads also—when I asked the prisoner to have her boxes searched, she readily consented to it, and gave the policeman the keys—these articles are of no great value—all of them, except the bonnets, were found in her locked trunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she give you any account of the things found in the locked box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she said nothing—she said the children had given her the necklaces, and some other trumpery things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there was one box not locked in the nursery cup<lb></lb>board, might that have been used as a place in which to put away the children's things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not customary, there were drawers for that purpose, but it might have been so—it was nailed down—I cannot say whether or not it was used to bring the children's things from one house to the other, and had not been yet opened—some of the articles belonged to the infant, and they had been put by by my direction, not having occa<lb></lb>sion for them then—I had given those directions to the head nurse about eighteen months ago—some were put into the wardrobe, and some in a box—it would certainly be necessary to remove them, and put them into separate packages when we came away—I did not superintend their removal, I left that to the nurses—there were not many of the prisoner's things in either of the boxes—her own clothes were mostly in her drawers—none of the articles had been altered or disfigured, or any marks taken out—a border has been taken off one of the caps, that is all.</p>

               <p>had any objection to her boxes being searched—she said, not the least, she had nothing in her boxes but what was her own—she showed me the boxes, and unlocked them herself—I found in them all these articles, ex<lb></lb>cept the bonnets, hats, and four aprons—she cried, and did not give any account how they came there—she begged for forgiveness.</p>

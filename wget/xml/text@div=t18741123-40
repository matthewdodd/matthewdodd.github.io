                  </hi>. I was master of the <hi rend="italic">Satsuma</hi> on her last voyage from Cardiff to Table Bay—she is a British ship, her owner is W. R. Abbey, of Knaresboro', she hails from Sunderland, her register is 355—on 13th December last she sailed from Cardiff with coals on a voyage to Table Bay—the crew consisted of twelve, all told—Richard Jewell was the chief mate, James Willey the steward, William Jones an able seaman, the prisoner who went by the name of Anderson, Robert Nelson the cook, Prospero Beltram an able seaman, and Richards second mate—Willey, Jones, Anderson, Nelson, and Beltram were engaged in this transaction—on the voyage, about 20th January, information was given me by William Dunn, able seaman, that Willey was wasting the ship's stores—I spoke to Willey about it and told him I should have him punished for it at the Cape—some time previous to that the prisoner had thrown overboard a dog belonging to the ship, and I called him aft and told him I should have him punished on our arrival at the Cape—he said the dog had come into the berth and eaten his food—I don't know whether that was so or not—Jones and Beltram had been disrated before this; they were not fit for able seaman's duty, not even fit for ordinary seaman's duty, useless, fellows—nothing more transpired until the morning in question, everything was quiet and right—on the morning of 29th January we were in latitude 31.8 South, longitude 23.38 West, we had passed the island of Trinidad a few days before—we had got about four days' sail from Trinidad and were about 1,000 miles from the nearest mainland—I went to bed at my usual hour that night and everything was as I believed calm and proper—at 5 o'clock in the morning Anderson, Willey, and Jones were in my berth; when I awoke hearing a noise in my berth I raised my head, which was hardly clear of the pillow when a rope with a slip noose was put over it and hauled tight; that was done by Jones—I turned round and saw him, it was a small newly-tarred rope, it sunk into my neck, it was a splice, not a knot, a noose, it would cut your head off if it was hauled tight enough; I felt it hauled tight—Willey had a revolver pointed at my face and the prisoner had a small hatchet belonging to the vessel—I made a dash at them and burst through them, endeavouring to get to Jewell the mate's cabin for assistance—his berth was in the fore cabin—my berth was in the after cabin; there was a communication between the two, down below and I tried to get by that communication forward to his cabin—I was struggling all the way, dragging Jones who had hold of the rope round my neck all the time—before I got to the mate's cabin I received three or four, I could not exactly say how many, blows from the prisoner with the hatchet, cutting my head open and covering my head with blool—Jones was tugging at</p>

               <p>the rope all this time, it was still round my neck—I cried out for help to the the second mate knowing that it was his watch, and one of them I am not sure which replied 1" He is all right," which led me to believe that he was over-board or killed; I got no answer from him—the chief mate heard the noise and sprang out of his berth to my assistance; he warded off several blows aimed at me by the prisoner—Willey was still there with the revolver, threatening all the time, but he did not fire then—I was almost exhausted when I arrived at the chief mate's cabin—I was covered with blood, and nearly suffocated, I could hardly breathe—I made a rush at the companion, the staircase up to the deck, and dragged Jones with me, who had hold of the rope round my neck all the time; the other men followed up after—when I got on deck Beltram was at the wheel steering, it was his watch—I asked him to render assist<lb></lb>ance; he would not—there was a good deal of struggling on deck, but I was unconscious for about a quarter of an hour, and hardly knew what took place—the next thing that I remember was some one calling "Look out"—I had cut the rope off before that in the struggle, but I can't say exactly whether it was with a cutlass or an axe that I cut it—I took the axe out of Anderson's hand; the rope lay across the top of the companion, and I cut it that way as far as I remember—I had very great difficulty in taking it off my neck; it was sunk right in—I was struggling on the deck with these three men, the mate was there also; it was then I heard the cry "Look out"—I then saw Anderson with a large handspike uplifted coming down on my head, and I either fell or jumped down the companion stairs, I don't know which, to avoid the blow—I don't know whether the blow missed me—the same blow smashed the top of the companion, the wood work made of teak; at the same instant a revolver was fired—I turned round and saw the mate lying on the side of the poop deck—I thought he was shot—I went into the after cabin and sat down exhausted—I hardly knew what to do—I was sitting on a chair with my head on, the table covered with blood—the next thing I remember was the sky-light being raised up nearly above my head—I looked up and saw Willey pointing a revolver down into the cabin—I can't say where Anderson was then—Willey said he was going to leave the ship, and asked what boat should he take; but before that, he sent Nelson, the cook, down to hand up six rifles which were in the cabin—Nelson came down and handed them up—I was not then in a condition to resist—I could not do anything; that was be<lb></lb>fore the mate joined me; I thought I was the only person there free—Willey said "What boat shall we take?"—I said "Take the one on the port side"—we had three boats—the rifles were handed up through the sky-light, and they handed up a quantity of provisions—Willey called down the sky-light "Are you much hurt"—I said I was nearly dead or half dead—he said several times "l am a gentleman, I am a gentleman"—when I said I was half dead he said he was sorry for it, but if I had not struggled so much I should not have been so much hurt, or I should have come better off, or words to that effect—<hi rend="italic">Willey</hi> sat on the sky-light and gave bis orders in a cool and able manner—he gave orders to lower the boat and provisions and called for everything he wanted—I heard him crying out for Dunn, and he said he would hang him at the yard arm before leaving the ship—Dunn was an able seamau, who remained faithful, but where he was I did not know—I begged Willey not to commit murder, and he said he would shed no more blood; it was Dunn who had told me about the wasting of</p>

               <p>the stores—they had a sort of log book written against me, some stuff or other—after this the chief mate called out that the boat was gone, and I went on deck and saw her sailing away about a mile and a half off—I was all covered with blood, consciousness had returned—I found the sails all aback and no one at the wheel—I afterwards missed a number of stores—I am not sure whether the boat had the name of the <hi rend="italic">Satsuma</hi> on her; she was peculiarly painted, I never saw a boat painted in the same way; she was a kind of jolly boat with a lug sail—the five men I have mentioned went in her, the prisoner being one—I had a gun on deck—I found that was spiked when I came on deck, and all my arms were gone—I did not know of the men having a revolver, it was not one belonging to the ship; they had several revolvers, I believe, but not that I knew of until this—there were only seven left on the ship, including myself, and two boys out of that—if a gale of wind had come on and we had been near land, the ship would have been endangered, and the lives, in consequence of the shortness of hands; fortunately we encountered no wind, we had a clear voyage out—they cut away the lashings of the boat, and some of the run<lb></lb>ning gear of the ship was cut—some time after I heard a voice crying out, which I knew to be that of the second mate—Mr. Jewell released him—I saw Dunn come out of the fore hatch covered with coal dust—we ar<lb></lb>rived at Table Bay on 23rd February—I had then entirely recovered from my wounds, they had healed up—I still felt giddy and very nervous—I eventually got two hands from a Swedish ship to navigate my ship—I spoke an Australian vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Trevilian</hi>, and the captain came on board and took a copy of my official log of this occurrence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You did your work on board well enough as a sailor—I did not give you any work that you were not able to do—you did your work like a man as far as I saw; you were treated better than any man I ever saw—I was not on deck at the time you threw the dog overboard, I was in the fore cabin at breakfast when I was told of it—I was not drunk, I never was drunk—I remember the day before New Year's eve—I don't remember the mate trying to jump overboard, or his going into the galley and beating the cook—I was not so confused when you came into my cabin that you had to catch hold of me to make me fast—the thing was done instantaneously, if I had taken time you would have had my head off or I should have been shot—I swear you had a hatchet and Willey a revolver—it was you who struck me and cut my head open and would have killed me, I suppose, had not the mate interfered—I did not threaten to throw you overboard when I heard of the dog being thrown over; I said you ought to be served the same as the dog, but I would wait and punish you at the Cape—the provisions that were wasted were flour, sugar, tea, butter, and others—I know they were taken away, for after Dunn told me I went and looked and found more than a month's stores gone, taken into the forecastle—Dunn told me that he had used some of the stores himself, but he said it was such a shame—I did not go into my cabin and smoke my pipe after this occurrence—the night Dunn told me of the wasting of the stores he brought a book to me, it was full of lies and I threw it overboard; I did not read it; Dunn told me it was a lot of lies—I did not go into the cabin and seize the steward by the throat—I did not on the Saturday before this Sunday go into the forecastle and drag anybody out.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chief officer on board the <hi rend="italic">Satsutma</hi>—she left Cardiff on 13th December—nothing occurred until the 29th Jauua-y—no complaints were made before that—it was the second mate's watch—at 5 o'clock in the morning I was in bed in my cabin—I was awoke by a noise; I looked out and saw the captain covered with blood and struggling with three men, Anderson, Willey, and Jones—Jones had hold of a rope which was round the captain's neck, it was a small piece of rattlin line; he was trying to strangle him—the captain was blue looking and all covered with blood—the prisoner had a hatchet, Willey had a revolver, he was standing by pointing the revolver at the captain—the prisoner had the hatchet over the captain's head making a motion as if he was going to hit him down, but I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> hold of him and the captain rushed up the companion and I and the rest followed, all three of them; Jones had hold of the rope till he got up—I can hardly tell what then occurred, but the first thing I saw was the prisoner come with a handspike and was going to aim at the captain's head—this was on the poop close by the companion; it is not a flush deck, but a poop, the companion comes up on to the poop—I don't think the handspike hit the captain—I sung out "Look out!" and just at the time the captain fell down, I think, and the handspike broke the top of the compa<lb></lb>nion and smashed it all to pieces—the captain went down the companion stairs—then somehow or other the prisoner and I got scuffing; he had a revolver in his hand then, sometimes it was-at my head and sometimes it was knocking against me, but he could not discharge it—he had not got the hatchet then; I don't know what had become of it—I was trying to save myself and he threw me down and I lost the revolver somehow—when I came to myself I got up as quickly as I could, seeing I had nobody to take my part I rushed down to the cabin and just as I went clown somebody discharged a shot, I think it was Willey; it flashed past my eyes—after that I went into the cabin to the captain—he was lying with his head on the table exhausted—I whispered to him—Willey, who was at the companion with a revolver pointing down, ordered me away, and said "I know what you and the captain are talking about"—the captain was not able to speak—I then went into my berth and stopped there—I could not see from there—I heard Willey send down Nelson, the cook, to pack up things, all kinds, brandy and whiskey, the boat's sails, and everything they required—they took six rifles first—after a while Willey sung out and asked the captain which boat they should take—the captain said the one on the port side—after a while I heard that they had gone, but they were an hour or more before they went—they asked me for a South Atlantic chart—I said I had not got one, I had one for the Brazil coast—they said that would do, and I passed it out to them—Willey like made game, telling me that I dared not refuse them because they had us in their power—he also asked me for tobacco, pipes, and matches, and they took a bag of bread, tins of preserved meat, and a new log line—when they had gone away I found the second mate down the after hold with his hands and feet strapped together and tied round the body and legs as well—I released him—I think the name of the ship was on the boat which they took away—they took black and white paid, and I missed some paints and brushes after they had left—I cut the, hair off the captain's head and put some sticking plaster on the places, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> The captain did not kick Beltram about one Saturday morning in the forecastle, he never kicked or touched anybody to my knowledge; he did not tell the men to scrape down the fore-to pmast—I remember George Simmonds being sick—I did not go in to his berth and haul him out; I was not <hi rend="italic">tight</hi>—I never put my hald to one of you, but you pretty well killed me—I never went into the galley and beat the cook—I did not try to jump overboard—you did your work as well as you could; there were many things that I could have done better, you did the work very carelessly—I don't think I ever spoke an uncivil word to one of you while you were on board, I am certain I did not—you had plenty of everything to eat and drink—you were never kept short of anything—I did not on the morning of New Year's eve come to you at the wheel with the steward and ask you what work had been done for a couple of days that I might make up the log—I did not have a cutlass to defend myself on the morning of the mutiny, I never had a cutlass in my hand—I did not see one with the captain, you took us by surprise—I twisted the revolver out of your hand somehow or other, but you threw me on the deck and broke my knuckle over it, and my hand was bad for sir weeks after I got to the Cape, I had to go to a doctor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I did not notice which of you it was that shut the forecastle door on us, but I think it was Willey—you did not shake hands with me over the boat's side as you were leaving—I and Dunn did not come into the cabin one morning and steal some bread and pork—I was never drunk while I was on board, and never saw any one else drunk—I swear that it was a revolver you had in your hand—I saw you go towards the forecastle with it, and 1 heard it fired off—a block falling on deck would not make the same noise—I did not see the smoke, I was not there at the time, I was amidships when I heard the firing—I don't remember the captain beating Beltram or any one; I swear that, at least I did not know—I did not see the captain haul him out of the forecastle on Saturday forenoon—I don't remember the captain hauling the steward out of his berth one Sunday night—I had a dog on board, I gave it to the ship—I used to feed it—I did not see the steward and the mate set the dog and cat to fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went on with the ship to Ceylon and afterwards came home in her—I found everything comfortable on board, and" I would not care about going with the captain again if he would take me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police Inspector.</hi>) In consequence of a telegram received by the superintendent from Australia, on 7th July, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">City of Florence</hi> at Gravesend and found the prisoner there—I came up with the ship to Victoria Dock; Inspector Sayer came on board there, and I pointed out the prisoner to him—Sayer told him that he was an inspector of police and asked him if his name was Johnstone—the prisoner said "Why?"—Sayer said "You were in the <hi rend="italic">Satsuma</hi>"—the prisoner said "This is a bad job"—I then accompanied him to the deck-house of the ship and Sayer said that he should take him in custody for mutiny on the sea—he made no answer—he afterwards said to me "How did you know about me?"—I said "We hear of things," and asked him where he left the <hi rend="italic">Satsuma</hi>—he said "At sea"—I said "How did you get to Melbourne"—he said "We were picked up by the <hi rend="italic">Kate Kearney</hi>"—I said "Did she take you to Melbourne?"—he said "No, there were three of us in the <hi rend="italic">Singalea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sin<lb></lb>galese</hi>

               <p>(I am not certain which) and she took us to Melbourne"—I then took Mm to Wapping station—I there said "How many of you left the <hi rend="italic">Satsuma</hi>"—he said "Three"—I said "Where are the other two?"—he said "Bill Jones and the Spaniard Beltram went to Hong Kong in the <hi rend="italic">Kate Kearney</hi>"—he then said to me "How do you think I shall get on?—I said I don't know"—he said "How is the captain and mate?"—I said "You ought to know best, how did you leave them?"—he said "All right; the mate gave us a bottle of beer and some rope yarn to bring the sail to when we left the ship; one day the captain and mate were drunk, they beat two of the men and threatened to throw me overboard; if it had not been for the whiskey this would not have happened"—he afterwards said he told them in the <hi rend="italic">Kate Keurney</hi> that he had been cast away in the <hi rend="italic">Laura</hi> and she had foundered—on the 8th I took him to Bow Street, and in passing St. Paul's in a cab he looked out and I asked him if he had seen the building before—he said "No, I was never in London before"—he afterwards said "I had a pistol on board the ship, I sat on the skylight and kept guard, but I did not use it, I suppose I shall get off with two years"—this was a voluntary statement on his part.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in a long address, reiterated his assertion that the captain and officers were constantly drunk during the voyage, and that the men were ill-treated; that in consequence of this they made up their minds to leave the ship, but that they did not intend to injure the captain, and would not have done so had he not resisted.</hi>

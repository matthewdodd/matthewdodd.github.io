I was formerly in the C Division, Metropolitan Police—I left it in August last—on the morning of 3rd March, between 2 and 2.15, I was going home through Finsbury Square, towards Chiswell Street—I crossed from Sun Street, past Messrs. Whitbread's brewery—I had been with a cousin to Hackney Wick; there was a benefit for the Clerken<lb></lb>well outrage, for the sufferers by the explosion, to get some money for them—I had left my cousin in the Hackney Road—when I got against Whitbread's brewery, two young men ran past me on the left hand side—I deliberately turned round and watched them—they crossed over, and-went</p>

               <p>up Whitecross Street—when I got to Whitecoross Street corner, the prisoner stood there, and he deliberately fired at mo with a revolver—he might then be about five yards from me—I had walked up to him, meeting him, and he was standing—I was walking on the pavement—he was not in the road, he was at the corner—I heard a hiss by my right ear when he fired, as if it was a bullet—he then deliberately fired a second time, and I put my head back against the shutters, as I was so agitated I did not know what I was doing—I heard a similar hiss on my left side, and the prisoner went across to me—I called out "Murder! police!" and he deliberately turned, and fired at me again—I had got my umbrella in my hand, and was following him—eight or nine yards behind him, my foot caught against a stone, and I fell, and by chance the shot went over me, and I was not hit—I called "Murder! police!"—Maley, a policeman, came up, and said, "What is it?"—I said, "Take that man, he has shot at me, "pointing to the prisoner—he said, "Are you sure he is the man?—I said "Yes, take him"—the prisoner had his hand behind him, with a revolver in it; I saw it distinetly against the lamp-post—Maley went on one side of him, and I on the other—a struggle ensued; he tried to get released from us—I said, "For God Almighty's sake hold him still;" but he got the revolver up, and went bang, bang, discharging the revolver twice, and pointing it towards where I was; and a piece of the cap went into my right eye—ho fired right at me, but I put my head back, and it did not hit me.</p>

               <p>1863—there might have been complaints, but I resigned—I then went down home, as steward to my brother-in-law, near Pinchenfield, in Essex—I was employed as farm bailiff—my brother-in-law did not get rid of a farm bailiff and put me in his place—he maintained me from the time I left the police till March, 1864, when I went and joined the Essex constabulary—I did not like that, and resigned in four or five months—there was no com<lb></lb>plaint against me there—I then went and took a second attendant's place at St. Luke's Asylum—I lived in the house—I was there eleven months, and resigned because I had bad health—I then went and stayed a little while at my own brother's house—I have two friends in London, my brother and my cousin—I was earning nothing then—I joined the Metropolitan Police on 14th May, 1866, and resigned on 30th August, 1867—I was brought up to farming—I liked the Metropolitan Police very well, but there was a little dispute, I was robbed of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my box and some suits of clothes, which caused ill feeling, and one of the constables put a wet towel in my place; I did not like it, and resigned—from August, 1867, up to the period of the Clerkenwell explosion, I was specially employed by police officers engaged in the cases—I was living in London—I was paid by them—that was not my only means of livelihood, because I had my own savings—my pay as a constable of the Metropolitan Force was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, with a deduc<lb></lb>tion out of that for superannuation allowance and the mess, which was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I did not have gratuities—I was paid for work done—I can't say what it amounted to a week, for we were so engaged I cannot inform you—I kept no account—the largest sum I received was 1<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>; but I have had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and so on—I had no regular pay—I mean to say that I went to this public-house, Little Pulteney Street, on duty, before the Clerkenwell explosion, that was part of the labour for which I had those sums—the public-house in Little Pulteney Street is the same as that in Great Windmill Street—that is the house that Allen and Timothy Desmond and O'Keefe frequented—I cannot tell you any day when I saw the prisoner in that public-house, because I never took a note of it—I have sworn that I saw him in that public-house before the explosion—I hare seen him in the public-house which they frequented, but I never spoke to him—I cannot tell you what month I first saw him, or the last time I saw him, I did not take notice of it—I have never spoken to him—I have seen him in company with those persons in the public-house, but not when anybody has been present with me—I used to go by myself, and sometimes I had some of the other officers with me—my visits to the public-house in. Pulteney Street and Great Windmill Street extended from August down to December—I have not been there since December—I have been past Desmond's house, 9, Cross Street, Regent Street, since December, but not to watch it—I have not been employed to watch since December—there are a great many officers named Chamberlain who I know, but I do not know one in the Metropolitan Police Force; I know one in the City of London Force—I do not know Chowne—I can read—I read newspapers—I have not heard of money for rewards subscribed for Chowne and Chamberlain: do you mean in the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> division? I have heard that a man did shoot at two constables of the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> division; but I know nothing of them—I never spoke to them—I do not know of subscriptions of money to those men, only what I have heard say—I have been in frequent communication with the police for the last three months; and I mean the Jury to believe that I have never heard a word from anyone of a subscription for those men—I went</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you hear an officer say that he had made inquiries, and this man was not connected with Fenianism? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Ricketts put a question to Mullany on the second examination—not to Mullany, to Maley—he asked Maley whether he thought the prisoner was in any way connected with Fenianism—I did not at that time make any statement that I had ever seen him at the public-house with Desmond and the others frequently—I signed my depositions afterwards—Mullany is a man who belongs to the Fenian brotherhood, I believe—no doubt there is a man named Mullany connected with Fenianism.</p>

Q.</hi> How many shots did you hear altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four—the first one was a minute or better before the next, and when the police<lb></lb>man got hold of him there was not five seconds between the two—I swear that the policeman was holding him by the arms at that time—I cannot say whether they were struggling for the possession of the revolver—Hill got up between him just before the last shot was fired; and there was another young man there, but I can't swear whether he had hold of him—he was not half a yard off—he is here—I went to the station, and was there when the prisoner was charged—I saw nothing of two men running away—when I first saw the prisoner there was no one else in the street—I was about half as far again as the length of this Court from him—he had been drinking, I can't say that he was drunk—he might have carried a little more I think.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Milton Street, Cripplegate, and am a box<lb></lb>maker—on the morning of the 3rd March I was coming down Whitecross Street—heard a report and saw a flash in Red Lion Market, that it at the corner of Whitecross Street—I heard one more shot fired besides that—the constable walked past me—I heard four shotsfired altogether—my friend Ewar picked up the pistol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How near were you when the last two shots were fired? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About the distance of from here to the wall—my friend was not with me—he was a little ahead of me—the constable had hold of the prisoner by the arm, and they appeared to be struggling—the gentleman who was shot at also had hold of him—I was further off than Ewar, but I got up to them—I went to the station—I walked close behind him with Ewar to the station, and was there wnen the charge was made.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant O</hi>). On the morning of 3rd March, about 2.15, I was at the corner of Play House Yard, Whitecross Street—I heard the report of fire arms and saw a flash, went to the place and saw the prisoner and the constable struggling together in the road—there was a quantity of smoke and a smell of powder—Maley had hold of the prisoner, and Hill had hold of him behind by the collar—I received this revolver from Ewar—I took the prisoner to the station and searched him—I looked at the revolver, it had five chambers, and had been recently discharged—one of the nipples had an exploded percussion cap on it, which Inspector Bryant took off—Hill charged the prisoner with discharging three chambers at him, and Maley with discharging two at him—Inspector Bryant entered the charge on the sheet, and read it over to the prisoner, who said, "I can do ten years for this"—directly they put him in the cell went and looked at a gate-post belonging to Haywood and Taylor, right opposite where the shot was fired, and found the dent of a bullet there—the prisoner refused his address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know now where he is working? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he is a shoemaker, working for Mr. Cox, of 198, Whitecross Street, and living on the premises—I walked with them all the way to the station—I have not cut out the piece from the gate-post, it is solid oak; it is not punctured with the bullet, I only saw an indentation—I saw the post every night in the week—I had not seen the indentation the night before; it, seemed to me fresh done—I could not judge when it was done, I should not have noticed it then if this was not done—it has chipped off the paint all round, and there is an indentation in the post, and a lead mark as well—I tried to find the lead but could not—I believe I mentioned the lead mark</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector G</hi>). I was at Old Street station when the prisoner was brought there in custody—I entered the charge, and read it over to him, telling him he was charged with feloniously shooting at John Harvey Hill and Portens Maley, with intent to kill and murder them, at Whitecross Street, St. Luke's—he said, "All right, I can do ten years for that bit"—he was a little in liquor I think, but it was hardly perceivable, he was able to walk and talk—he gave his name Thomas O'Hara—I asked him where he lived, he said that he declined to give his address, as he did not wish his friends to know anything about it—I went the same morning with Allingham, looked at the gate-post, and found a circular indentation, such as a bullet would make.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was it the address was spoken of, some hours after he was in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he first came in, and before the charge was made—I have made enquiries since, and know that he works with Mr. Cox.</p>

I believe I am an Irishman by birth—I live at 198, White<lb></lb>cross Street, and am a shoemaker—I have been there six years, and my father kept the business before me—the prisoner came into my employ about three weeks or a month before Christmas—he continued in my employ, and lived there—he is a very sober and industrious young man; that is the general character he has borne.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who lived with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Another young man, named Joseph; I cannot exactly tell you his name—he lodged with me all the time—I took very little interest in him—he is outside—they occupied the same room—they did not both come there to lodge together; the other man came first, and then the prisoner came and occu<lb></lb>pied the same room—the other man has lodged with me nearly twelve months, but I dot know his name—I have heard it; I shall recollect it directly—it is Joseph Connor—I heard at 9.30 or 10 o'clock next morning that the prisoner was taken in custody—I do not know whether a box was taken out of his room that morning—I did not tell the constable so—Sutton the policeman came to the house that morning, and I showed him up stairs; it was then 10.30 or 11—the prisoner's box was not in the room then—I do not know when it went—I do not know that it was removed after these shots were fired—nobody told the oonstable that it had been removed—Connor did not tell the constable in my presence that it had been removed; nothing of the kind; he said that a friend of his had called, but that he knew nothing about the box—I asked the fellow workman whether he knew anything about it in the constable's presence—I do not know how the box got away, or whether it contained bullets and powder—I never saw it but once—I do not know what time the prisoner went out the previous night—I generally go to bed about 11 o'clock—neither he or Connor were in when I went to bed—I let him and the other man in at 11.30 or 12; but they can let themselves out—I believe he was out all day, but do not know what time he went out—the bed had been slept in, but not on both sides; Connor's side had been slept in—I do not know whether the prisoner went up stairs and went out again in a few minutes.</p>

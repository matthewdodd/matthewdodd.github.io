                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Packard Clements, of Judd-street. At half-past one o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th of July, the prisoners came, and Williams asked the price of some frock-bodies—I showed them some, and Melgrove bought one—she then bought a pair of gloves—after that they jointly purchased a remnant of Irish linen—they afterwards saw some table-cloths hanging on the top of the shop—Williams asked the price—I showed her one, and she thought it too high—I showed her some others—there was one that was soiled—Melgrove was sitting by her side—I then showed a table-cloth that was on the counter—I went to ask the least I could take for it, and as I was turning round I saw Wil<lb></lb>liams take this table-cloth from the counter, and deposit it under her shawl—I told George Wilson she had taken it; and as soon as she saw me tell Wilson she appeared very much agitated, and left the shop—Wilson fol<lb></lb>lowed her, and took the table-cloth from under her arm, and she was brought back to the shop—Melgrove said to Williams, "Don't flurry your<lb></lb>self"—this is the table-cloth.</p>

I received a communication, I remained still in the centre of the shop till Williams walked out—she turned the next street—I said, "You have gone quite far enough"—I turned her shawl on one side, and took the table-cloth from under her arm—she begged and prayed of me to let her go for the sake of her family, and said the other prisoner had a sovereign she would give me to let her go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live at 33, Ernest Street, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—on 28th January, I met the female prisoner in the King's Arms, Old Kent Road, about a quarter to twelve at night—I had some drink with her, and we left to go away together—I had hardly proceeded many yards outside, before I received a violent blow on my head, which rendered me nearly insensible, and a second blow on my ear—I was knocked down, and the female prisoner laid hold of me by the throat, and tried to get my watch out of my waistcoat pocket—she nearly strangled me, but only got the chain, and she did not take that—Bowman had hold of my legs—there were four altogether—twelve or fourteen people came up, and then the police—when I came to my senses, my chain was on the pavement; but I had got my watch, and I kept my arm on it for security—Bowman, pulled my legs very violently.</p>

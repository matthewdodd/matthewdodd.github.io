               <p>The Councel for the King, first opened the Nature of both the Indictments to the Gentlemen of the Jury, shewing how malicious a Fact, and what a Barbarous Murder the Prisoners at the Bar stood charged with; it being the more aggravated, because the Relation and Affinity was so Conjugal as the Wife to the Husband, therefore it was no less than Petty-Treason in her, as well as Felony and Murder: Therefore it was a Crime of a very High Nature in them all, if so be that they should be found guilty of it; and it required their serious and mature Consideration.</p>
               <p>Then the Witnesses for the King were called and sworn; the first was one Jane Williams, Mr. Symbole's Servant, who de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16950220003"></xptr>posed, That on the 30th day of January last, Mr. Reginer, and Mrs. Symbole's two Sisters, viz. the other two Prisoners, came to Mr. Symbole's House in the Afternoon, and found Mrs. Symbole in the Kitchen; so she ordered her to make a Fire in the Parlor, which she did, and then they went to Cards. Mr. Reginer had brought some Wine with him, which they drank, and were merry. Then Mrs. Symbole sent the said Williams for her master to one Mr. Lamberts, but he did not come home till <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> of the clock at night; when he came in, a Supper was ordered, which they eat together, seeming to be good Friends; and after Supper they went to Cards again, playing at a Game called Bone Ace, at a Farthing Bone, and a Farthing Ace. Then she went down Stairs, and there fell asleep; afterwards awakening, hearing the Watchman knockt at the door, she went up stairs, where she found Mr. Reginer standing in the Room with a Naked Sword in his hand, all bloody, which he wiped   his Coat; and her master she found sunk down in his Chair behind the table, with one Leg upon the Chair. She going towards him, he put his hand out to her, and made as if he would speak, but could not, and immediately died. In the mean time the said Reginer got away, as also the two Sisters, her mistress Symbole being only left, who seemed to be in a great Agony; then she run down stairs, and called one Stoneman, and one Springback, that were Neighbours, who came immediately, and lifted up Mr. Symbole from the ground, and perceiving his Lips to move, they got Strong-waters, and poured into his mouth, but to no effect; for he instantly died. Stoneman and Springback deposed the same. A Watchman being sworn, declared that he was at the Door but about a quarter of an hour before the murder was done, and knockt at it, but some Woman answer'd him out at the Window, saying, All was well. There was other confirming Proofs how, and in what manner Mr. Symbole was found, and that Mrs. Symbole was much troubled, crying out, She was undone. Being asked, Who it was that murder'd her Husband? She would give no account at first, only said it was a Lawyer belonging to the Temple; at length when more people came in, she told them his Name was Reginer. It was further deposed, that Mrs. Symbole nor the other two did not offer to stop the said Reginer, but suffer'd him to go away. The Surgeon gave in Evidence, that upon search of the Body of the deceased, he found no less than 18 Wounds about him, five of which were mortal; that they were all made with one and the same Sword as he believed; and that there was a Bruise under his ear, which was perhaps done by his Fall off his Chair, for one of the Searchers (an old Woman) swore that she thought that was done by a fall, for it could not be blacker, except he had died at the Tree, as she call'd it; she knew it very well, she said, by experience, for that she had been an old Stripper. This was the sum of the Evidence for the King against the Prisoners, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then they were all call'd upon to make their Defence; and Mrs. Symbole first began, who said, That she was wholly Innocent of the Murder, and declared the whole matter, how that Mr. Reginer, and her Sisters came to her House whilst Mr. Symbole was abroad, and brought some Wine, and that she sent to look for Mr. Symbole to come home and bear them Company, so they went to Cards; and about Nine or Ten a Clock at night Mr. Symbole came home, and was in a very good Humour, very kindly embracing Mr. Reginer, telling him that he had highly honoured him with his Company, and complemented him very civilly; after which, a Supper was provided (by Mr. Symbole's Order) which they eat very amicably together; after which they played at Cards again, at Bone Ace, and Mr. Symbole and Mr. Reginer, happening to turn up two Sevens each of them; Mr. Symbole said, That the Cards should be dealt again, which Mr. Reginer denied, upon which high Words arose: Mr. Symbole telling Reginer, That he had been in the Crown-Office. Reginer replying, That he never was in the Pillory; so to boxing they went, and Mr. Reginer drew his Sword and stabbed Mr. Symbole. She further declared, That she was so much affrighted, that she knew not what she did, and that she screamed out as loud as she was able; but the Old Woman being asleep in the Kitchen, could not make her hear, besides, she called a whole Cloud of Witnesses to prove that her Husband and she had always lived very lovingly together, and that Mr. Symbole had been often times heard to speak very respectively of his Wife, and loved her very well; besides, she had divers very credible Persons, who appeared in Court, and gave an Excellent Testimony of Mrs. Symbole's Reputation; and that she had been always bred very Religiously, and had a very modest Carriage and Behaviour, not guilty of any manner of <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> or Disregard in the Comporting of herself towards Mr. Symbole, never since she was his Wife, and being much surprised she knew not how Mr. Reginer got out of the House, it being supposed that her Sisters had gone out before him, and <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> ; so he got away before any Assistance came.</p>
               <p>One Sister in her defence, alledged, That she was there the same night the Murder was Committed, and that Mr. Symbole and Mr. Reginer were good friends, till they fell out about turning up two Sevens; and that she being so much affrighted when she saw them fight, she ran down Stairs and went home crying out and making a noise, but did not know what she did, only she remembered that in the Quarrel, Mr. Symbole called Mr. Reginer Cowardly Rogue, and told him, That he had been in the Crown Office. Then Mr. Reginer replied, that he never was so great a Rogue as to stand in the Pillory.</p>
               <p>The other Sister declared to the same effect, as did the former, That she was also much affrighted, and her Sister going away in the time of the Quarrel, she went also; but as to the designing any Murder, she knew not. They had both the same Evidence as to their Reputation, as had Mrs. Symbole. So, then all the Witnesses having been examined fairly on both sides, with a great deal of patience and Indulgence from the Court, for their Trial lasted very long; the Court gave the Charge to the Gentlemen of the Jury, distinguishing the Law in the Case of Murder; and because, where any Person shall stab another, other People being by, and not interrupting him yet he only is guilty of the Stabbing and Death of the man, because he gave the thrust; so this Evidence did not affect the Prisoners upon the Statute of Stabbing, so they were all acquitted of the Penalty of that Statute; and there being no positive Proof that they did Abet, Aid, or Assist the said Reginer in the Perpetration of so Barbarous and Bloody a Murder, or had any hand in the same, the Jury brought a Verdict that they were all <rs id="t16950220-18-verdict74" type="verdictDescription">

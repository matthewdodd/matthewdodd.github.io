I am a journeyman shoemaker; I had five guineas and three seven-shilling-pieces when I went to bed, I had not been at work, I had been at Norfolk, and had returned but four or five days before, I had not done any work; I got up in the morning and had my breakfast, with Griffiths and a sailor that was in the house, I paid one shilling and sixpence for the three breakfasts, I had my money then; I had a pint or two of porter, and some ale, between breakfast and dinner, the landlady dressed me some pork chops, which Griffiths took part of; after dinner Berks came in, and he partook of two or three pots of beer with Griffiths and me, then I left the room, this was about three o'clock; I happened to meet with a friend in the tap-room, he said he had no money, or we would have a pint together; I said, if he had no money I had, and would treat him; we had three pints together; I pulled out my pocketbook, with two seven-shilling-pieces and five guineas in gold; the two prisoners both came out of the room where I left them, and came into the tap-room, just as I pulled my money out, I took out a seven-shilling-piece to pay for what we had had, and Berks hit me a violent stroke on the wrist, and beat the two seven-shilling-pieces, and the five guineas, out of my hand; they fell upon the floor, and Berks stooped and took up a guinea, Griffiths gathered up four guineas, and one seven-shilling-piece, Griffiths gave it me into my hand; I laid it on the edge of the table, and said I had lost another seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this money knocked out of your hand in play? - A. The blow was so violent I could not think it in play, I felt the blow the next day; I told Berks he had got a guinea of my money, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160046"></xptr>disowned having it; I desired him to strip, and be searched.</p>
               <p>Q.Your friend was by at the time? - A. Yes; when he saw what they were about, he left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the room when Berks struck your hand? - A. Yes; Berks pulled off some of his clothes, and said, when he was stripped he would give me a d-'d good basting; the landlord's maid, or daughter, brought me a candle to look for the seven-shilling-piece; it was a close box, I could not see well without a candle; I saw Griffiths take the four guineas and seven-shilling-piece off the table, I thought he was going to keep it safe for me, as he gave it me before, but he put it in his pocket; at that time Berks had got his clothes on again; Berks said to Griffiths let us brush, and they ran away out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to Griffiths that he had got your money? - A. Yes; I asked them both for my money, and they set off, they made me very little answer at all; I went to see for a constable, but did not find one immediately; I thought, as I knew Berks, and where he lodged, he would give me my money without a constable; I went to the house where they lodged, the Prince's-Head, Prince's-street; when I went they had changed their clothes, one had got on the other's great coat, and the other had got another great coat on; I asked them for my money, they had left me without a shilling to pay my reckoning or lodging; they went out of the house, I followed them, and asked them to give me my money, or some of it; they said if I followed them they would knock me down; I went and got an officer, Jones, and they were taken. I saw one of them at Marlborough-street on the Wednesday, and the other on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your money again? - A. I never got a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you had been drinking several pints of beer that day - were you sober? - A. The day before I was intoxicated, but the day I lost my money I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positively sure these are the two men?- A.These are the two men, and these only.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Griffiths's defence. The prosecutor came to our lodgings, and asked me to have some gin, which he shared out between me and himself, and two girls; he asked me if he could sleep with me; I told him, no, my bed was full, I could get a bed for him; I went and got him one, at the Westminster-arms, we lay there that night; the next morning we got up, and had some breakfast, we staid and dined there, there were some soldiers there and girls of the town; he had his pocket-book out, and people pushing about, pushed Berks against him, and knocked it out of his hand; I took up three guineas, and gave him; we went away, and at night we had a scuffle, and I dropped a guinea out of my pocket; I went and left three guineas in the landlady's hands, and fetched it next morning.</p>

               <p>Berks's defence. I knew Griffiths was at the Westminster-arms; I went to him, and found Gafford in the tap-room, he desired me to wait a little, he said a pot of beer was coming, and drink before you go; by accident I hit his elbow, and knocked the money out of his hand; I begged his pardon, and said, let Griffiths pick it up; I did not stoop myself at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman; the prisoner is my brother, I had a watch, which was hanging over the mantelpiece—he knew the place where it was hanging, at No. 92, Fye-foot-lane, on Tuesday, 8th July—I did not see him that day—I left the room for about five minutes, and went down to the bottom of the lane, and in coming up again a neighbour told me my brother had gone into the house—I went to see if I could see him, but could not—I came back, went into the room, and missed my watch—I went out again, and saw my brother at the bottom of Holborn-hill—I gave him into custody—another man escaped—that man is not here, he was acquitted—on the way to the station, my brother said he had taken the watch and given it to a man whom he called <hi rend="italic">Nat</hi> Symes, whom he said that I could find at the King of Denmark, nearly opposite here, in the Old Bailey—I did not find him there—it was nearly four hours after the robbery before we found him—he had time to get rid of it—I had seen my watch safe ten minutes before I missed it—Mrs. Blackman gave me the informa<lb></lb>tion—she is here—I left my watch about 10 o'clock at night—I was only away about five minutes—I went to see a lodger out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I own I was there, but I never took the watch; as to my saying that Symes had it, it is no such thing; anybody else was as likely to rob him as I was.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner on that Tuesday night go into his mother's house—he came out again in a few minutes—there was a man standing in the lane, and he went across and spoke to that man, and they both went out of the lane together—I saw the man that was afterwards in custody—I could not say whether he was the man or not.</p>

                  </hi> I am a trunk-maker, and live at No. 2, Liverpool-street, Bishopsgate. On the 30th of Aug., about a quarter before ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner—he gave me this card, "R. Harrison and Co., shipping-merchants, 3, Finsbury-chambers, Blomfield-street, City,</p>

               <p>London"—he said he came from that firm, and wanted two portmanteaus for packing cigars—that is a common thing—I showed him two—he said he thought they were not large enough, but if I sent them a little after ten o'clock, to the counting-house, Mr. Harrison would be there and would see if they would suit—I took them myself to No. 3, Finsbury-chamber, Blom<lb></lb>field-street—I saw a person—I do not know his name, he appeared to be one of the firm—he acted as a clerk, or one of the partners—he was quite a stranger to me—in consequence of what he said I went away, and left the portmanteaus for Mr. Harrison as he was not present—I came back at half-past three o'clock, saw the prisoner there alone, and inquired for Mr. Harrison—his answer was, "Mr. Harrison is at St. Katherine's Docks"—I then asked him where the portmanteaus were—he said they were packed with plated goods, and gone to St. Katharine's Docks—I answered, "That is very strange; you told me in the morning they were to pack cigars in, and now you tell me they are packed with plated goods; I suspect they are not packed at all, that they are on the premises"—he said they were not—I knew something of the counting-house, opened the door, and found they were not there—I asked the prisoner for them again, and he said they were at the Docks, and asked me to make a bill of the goods—I told him, cer<lb></lb>tainly not; I did not consider them sold—I sent for a policeman, to give the prisoner into custody, but the counting-house was then shut up, and he was not there—after going to several places, I met him in Broad-street-buildings, and gave him in custody—at the station he told me and the inspector that the portmanteaus were at a coffee-shop in Clifton-street—he went with us, and we found them there, on a table—these are them—I value them at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the wholesale price.</p>

On Monday afternoon, the 30th of Aug., at a quarter-past four o'clock, I went with Jenkins to No. 3, Finsbury-chambers, and found the door locked—I then went to several places, and received charge of the prisoner in Broad-street-buildings, at half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—I took him to the station—he said, "I will not get myself into trouble, the portmanteaus are not packed and gone to the</p>

I took up an old space, and I tried to strike at him, for fear of striking my wife, I struck at his hat, and something fell from his face, and I saw him as plain as I see these gentlemen now, and his eyes looked so monstrous fierce and savage at me, I did not know what to make of it; seeing some more behind me all disguised I turned myself round, and I cried out Harry! Harry! your mistress is murdered and cut to pieces! that is a journeyman of mine, who was at work for me; with that Harry jumped out of the back shop, he had a silver soap ladle in his hand, w hich weighed four ounces in the bowl, and nine ounces throughout, and he struck the man on the head with the ladle, hearing a noise in the street, I looked to the door, and saw it open, and I saw two or three men walk out, and the prisoner was left behind, he walked the length of the passage, and Harry kept hitting him on the head, and he went out of the house, and I saw no more of him; and they brought him back and declared he was the man, and the next morning, though they had even changed his clothes in the Compter, I declared that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you see him again that night? - Yes, we took him directly, he was not out of sight, only whilst turning round three doors.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did your wife open the door to let him in? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. How long might you be in the passage before all the people went away? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You can tell whether you was an hour or five minutes? - I cannot say it was an hour, nor half an hour.</p>
               <p>Was it five minutes? - My fright was so great at the time, it was out of my power, or any body else in the agony I lay in.</p>
               <p>You was extremely frightened? - I was.</p>
               <p>What light had you? - A light commonly in my kitchen, and a light in the back shop, there was a candle on the compter.</p>
               <p>Where is your compter? - In my shop.</p>
               <p>Then there was the partition of the shop, between the candle and the place where you had this scuffle? - No, Sir, it is in the passage, I told my Lord.</p>
               <p>Does your street door open into your shop immediately? - No, Sir, into a passage, the compter joins with a passage.</p>
               <p>I want you to describe to the Jury, the situation of your shop and your passage, how are they separated from each other? - The street door comes in, and the compter runs down on one side the shop, with shutters up to it, that joins to the parlour partition, none can come into my shop without lifting up the flap of the compter, or breaking through that which was broke.</p>
               <p>

               <p>You was very much frightened? - I leave into any body else to judge.</p>
               <p>What did you think was passing when you first came up? - I had no apprehension of thieves, the outer shutters in the street were shut up.</p>

               <p>On the 22d of March, about ten at night we heard the bell ring, and our young woman opened the door, and came and called me out, and when I came into the passage, that man was about a yard in the passage, I was in the back kitchen, I came out with a candle in my hand, and this man stood in the passage, about a yard in; he stood with one hand behind him, and another before him, with a great coat on; and when I looked him full in the face, he looked at me, he never spoke a word to me; and I saw a second come down one of the steps from the street; I looked then behind me, and I saw the second man put his hand into his right hand pocket and pull out something black, and put it all over his face.</p>

               <p>Had this first man any thing over his face at that time? - I did not see any thing at all over his face at that time; when I saw that man disguising himself I was frightened, and called out Muffles, thinking of the people as I have heard tell of with things over their faces; then the first man that is now at the bar

               <p>How many did you see in all? - I saw in all the man that was disguising his face, and one or more behind him, I know there were more than one; I stood some space with the candle in my hand, looking full at him, expecting he would tell his business to me, he had a black thing round his neck, his face was uncovered as it may be now.</p>
               <p>How near was you to him? - About half the length of this board.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take it for granted you was very much frighted? - I was terrified, I did not know but they might shoot me; I have not been right well since, I spit blood for two or three days after, with falling down on the pit of my stomach.</p>
               <p>How long was all this passing? - Not twenty minutes; I do not know how long it was.</p>
               <p>You had nothing but your own light you brought up with you? - No, that I put on the compter; I had no suspicion till I saw him behind putting on his disguise, then said I, Lord have mercy upon me! muffles, muffles! he hit me on the back of my head.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that any body touched you at all? - He certainly must have drove me down.</p>
               <p>Do not tell me what he must have done, in point of fact did you feel anybody touch you? - Yes I did, I felt a weight after I was down.</p>
               <p>Have you never said that you believed you fell from the fright, and you was not sure anybody touched you? - I have said that he certainly must have hit me on the back of the head.</p>
               <p>Have you ever told anybody that you did not know whether you was pushed down, or drove down? - I said I was drove down.</p>

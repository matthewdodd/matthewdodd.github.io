            . I am a hair-dresser, and live in Featherstone-street. On Christmas-day, about half-past two or a quarter to three o'clock, I saw the prisoner come to my shop; he took a piece of beef from his apron, and put it into a bedstead in my shop - I asked what it was; he hesitated, and then said, it was a piece of beef he had put there for a minute or two; Mr. Jones came in about five minutes, and told the prisoner there was a gentleman over the way who wanted him; he went - I took Mr. Jones to the bedstead and showed him the meat; I should have gone to Mr. Jones', but I was waiting on the prisoner, who sat down directly in a chair.</p>

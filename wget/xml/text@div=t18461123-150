                  </hi>. I keep the City Arms public-house in Ord-street, Mill-wall—it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of All Saints, Poplar. The prisoner had been in my service as a pot-man—he was discharged on the 13th of June—in consequence of my house having been broken open several times within a short space of time some persons were on the watch—on Thursday, the 12th of Nov., I was the last person up in my house—I shut up the place and went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—I saw it all shut up safe—about three o'clock in the morning the policeman rang the bell, and I went down stairs—there is a flap leading into the cellar, in the passage or a sort of lobby—it was down when I went to bed, and when I came down I found it lifted up—it prevented the lobby door from opening—I examined the house—there was no mark of violence on the outside—there is a wash-house there—from the ap<lb></lb>pearances, I should say a person had got out of the house by unbolting the wash-house door, and going up the steps from the wash-house into the back yard—there is no communication between the back yard and the cellar—the wash-house is on the same floor with the cellar—a person could get from the wash-house to the cellar, and from the cellar to the wash-house, from which there are steps leading up into the yard and over the wall into other yards and get away—I examined the doors of the spirit and the beer-cellar—I found them open—I had left them locked—I examined the bar, and missed from there half a crown's worth of farthings, a glove, and some screws of tobacco—I know the paper the farthings were wrapped in—that paper was produced by Edwards, the officer—the farthings were safe the night before—they must have gone between half-past ten o'clock at night and three o'clock in the morning—I had in my spirit-cellar a cask of unsweetened gin—the officer produced this bottle of unsweetened gin to me—I have tasted it, and it cor<lb></lb>responds with mine—this glove was produced to me—it is mine, and was in the bar—these parcels of tobacco are in paper which corresponds with what I had put the tobacco in the night before, and this is the paper the farthings were in—I have a perfect recollection of it—I have not a doubt this is the paper I put them in—the house was searched, and there was no person in it—the prisoner was in my service long enough to be acquainted with the pre<lb></lb>mises, and the ways of getting in and out—he was with me from March till June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Gaygin. On the 7th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went to the Royal Stand and Saloon, in Shoreditch—I had a shawl on, and missed it—the prisoner sat next to me—I asked him if he had seen it—he said he had not—after the performance, I asked him again—he said he had not seen it—in coming out of the gate, I said I knew he had it in his possession, but I did not with to take any further trouble about it—this is my shawl.</p>

I was on duty on the even<lb></lb>ing of the 7th of February—I saw the prisoner going along—Harding came to me, and in consequence of what he said, I seized the prisoner, and told him it was for robbing some female of a shawl—he said he was quite willing to go with me where I wished to take him—he took this shawl from inside his coat, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it over some iron railings.</p>

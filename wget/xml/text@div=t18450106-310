                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Garbutt—we live in the parish of St. John, Wapping—he is the householder—the prisoner lived Servant with us for four months. On the 22nd of Dec. I went to chapel about a quarter to six o'clock in the evening—I returned about a quarter past eight—I first missed my cap off my bed—I went up into the prisoner's room, and seeing her clothes I thought there was something amiss—she was not there—I then went to my room again, and missed from my drawers, which were open, the articles stated—these now produced are what I missed, and are my property—they had been in separate drawers in the same room, except a half-sovereign, which was taken from my son's room—that is not included in the indictment—my drawers were not kept locked—I gave notice to the police, and saw my things again at the police-office—the value of the property is about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never gave the prisoner any of the things, or gave her any authority to take them—I had a good character with her.</p>

A man, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came to my house on the 21st November, and had dinner in the little parlour, and went away, and said he was going to spend the evening in the neighbourhood, and asked if he could have a bed at night; he returned and slept there, and went away about nine o'clock in the morning. About eleven, the servant missed the sheets off the bed, and about four in the afternoon, I missed the articles stated in the indictment from my bed-room - he slept in the back-room, second floor, opposite to my bed-room. I had seen them all in my bed-room the morning before he slept there, (Wednesday the 20th), but not after. The tea-pot and cruet-stand were silver - the cruets were glass, silver mounted. My bed-room was not kept locked, nor the cupboard in which they were; the stair-case is a good distance from the room where he dined, and there is a door at the bottom of the stairs, which is always shut, but not locked. I found the property on the Saturday week following, at Turner's, in Brydges-street. They are family plate - I am certain they are mine, they have my father and mother's initials on them.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Turner, pawnbroker, of Brydges-street. This property was pawned at our shop - all on the same day, but at seperate times, by the prisoner, on the 22d of November, in the name of Strand - I am certain of his person. I advanced 2 l. 15 s. on the silver tea-pot, it is worth 3 l. I advanced two guineas on the cruets and stand, they are worth two guineas and a half as old silver. Mr. Catterton saw them and claimed them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I stand here overwhelmed with shame. I have not been in this country above twelve months from the West Indies, where I had been eleven years. When I came to town I had 1100 l., the hard earnings of a toilsome life, both on sea and shore. In a few weeks I accidently met with a person who I knew in Jamaica - he introduced me into one of the houses in St. James's, which have been the destruction of many besides myself. He deprived me of 300 l., and in the course of three weeks, I was deprived of 1500 l. more. I was an alien, and had no where to resort, and God only knows the feelings I experienced before I could bring myself to this. I never was the companion of loose or abandoned characters. I must throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court.</p>

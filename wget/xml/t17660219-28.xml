Then he said, he had had a power of attorney made to him abroad by Slack, but the rats had eat it, and he was persuaded to come in that name, and they could not hurt him.</p>

He took it, and went into the office with it, and came out again and said, I must come on the morrow, and I should get the money. I was advised by two men at the King's Arms, on Tower-hill, to do it. I said, I had a power, but that was destroyed: they said, if I had a certificate that would do as well.</p>
               <p>Smith. The prisoner brought a sick ticket to me in the name of Slack. I did not then recollect him. I said, did I never receive money for you. He said, no, it was for a brother of mine. Then I recollected him: then I went into the office, and told the gentlemen there was a man coming on a bad thing; then I shewed this paper to Mr. Cooper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to James Thomas Barker, of St. Savionr's Dock, in the parish of St. Saviour. We have lost many staves lately—about two o'clock, on the 14th of September, from information, I went after the prisoner, and overtook him in Redcross-street, and found on him three staves—I told him I had caught him at last—he said, "Will you swear to the staves?"—I told him I would—he said, "Will you swear I have not paid for them?"—I said I would swear he should go to the station-house—the policeman came up at the moment and I gave him into custody—I know the prisoner from his occasionally dealing at the yard for a stave at a time, but not for staves of this description—they are worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I went into this yard, went into the stable, and asked him to serve me three small staves—I had but 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would give him the rest when I came by again, and the carman came to let me have the three staves—his name is Welch—I have dealt at that yard four years—the carman boy was coming in at the time I came out with them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Welch may deny that I had bought them when he had not the full money—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and was to give the rest afterwards—he has often obliged me before by letting me have staves when I wanted 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I never trusted any man a farthing—I never put 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to his money, and gave it to my master—I was in the stable, cut ting a stick, but I did not see him—if I had he would have been stopped directly.</p>

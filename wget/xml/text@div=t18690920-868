                  </hi>. I keep the Travellers' Friend, at Woodford—on 21st August, about 10 o'clock, McLein came to my house—Ellen Smith served him with a half-quartern of gin, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave her a half-crown, which she passed to me, and I doubled it up directly, so that he should not pass it again—he asked me to give it back to him—I said, "No"—he asked me for a piece of it—I said, "No"—he paid me with a florin, got the change, and left—I informed the police—he was brought back, and I gave him in custody, with the half-crown; this is it.</p>

I found McLein, about 10.15, standing by the side of a ditch, by the road side, about 120 yards from Mr. Cole's—a man was with him, who I believe to be Johnson, and who walked away—Jervis showed me a heap of stones that night, to which I went next morning, about 5 o'clock—I found the bag in the ditch, containing four bad half-crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of 21st August, I was on duty near the Travellers' Friend, and saw McLein in custody—I found Johnson standing on the foot path, against a gravel heap, on the public road, a little over half a mile from the Travellers' Arms—I asked him what he was doing there—he said that he was going to London—I asked him where he had been—I said down the road—I asked him what time he left London—he said; "3 o'clock in the afternoon"—I said, "What are you?"—he said, "A butcher"—I said, "I think you are the man we want"—he said, "A butcher" and I heard something fall—I said, "If you do not stop I shall knock you down"—I took him to the station, and McLein owned that he was the man he was in company with—I found three halfpence on him—I showed Roberts the spot where I took him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a whipper-in, at Woodford—on 21st August I was at the Travellers Friend—McLein came in, about 9.50 for a half-quartern of gin—Mr. Cole's niece served him—he gave for in half-crown, and she turned to Mr. Cole, and said, "This is a bad one"—he took a hammer, and bent it on the floor, and said, "This is a bad one"—McLein said, "Give it me again"—he said, "No, by Act of Permanent I am not allowed to give it you"—he then took some other piece, paid for his liquor, and left—someone was ii company with him—he walked a little way down the bye-road, and then turned into the main road—there was a whistle—I did not see who whistled, but Johnson came and joined him—they walked ten or twenty yards together—I told the policeman—we walked past them, and the policeman went back—Johnson crossed in front of us, and I thought he was in liquor—the policeman took McLein—John<lb></lb>son was brought to the station half an hour or an hour afterwards—I did not know him as the man, but he said that he was the man that crossed the road to McLein—I said, "Are you the man who crossed over between me and the policeman?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "If yes are the man you had a round <hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi> on"—he said that he was the man—I lost sight of McLein for scarcely a minute when he left the house.</p>

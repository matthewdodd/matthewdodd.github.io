                  </hi>. I reside at 8, Brewer-street, Clerkenwell, and am errand boy to Mr. Redmond, gold-case maker, of Clerkenwell—about two weeks before Christmas I was taking a bag with a quantity of gold in it to the flatting mills—I was coming back with another boy named McMillan, I had the bag in my hand by a string—when we got to Market-street the prisoner came up and said, "What have you got here"—before I could answer him he cut the string of my bag—it was about 6 in the evening—he was with another man—they ran away together—I and McMillan ran after them, but did not catch them—about the middle of last June I was taken to the old-street Police-station—I was there shown ten men, and I picked the prisoner out from them—I am quite sure he is the man who robbed me.</p>

            . The Prisoner came to my Shop, with a Pattern of printed Linnen, and said, If I could match it, he should buy a Parcel of me, I happened to have none of the same Sort in my Shop, and so he left it with me, and came again in 2 or 3 days. I told him, I had been at several Places to match it, but could not do it exactly. Well,, says he, It don't signifie much, and as I have given you some trouble, I intend to take a Parcel of you, for I have got a Sister at Twickenham, who keeps a Worsted Shop next to the Kings Arms there; and as she has a large Acquaintance, she is willing to sell Linnen. I desired him to look out what he thought proper. But, he said, he would come another time, and do that, because his Sister's Waterman, who had brought up Money to pay for a Parcel of Linnen, was gone back to Twickenham, but would be here again in a Day or two. The Prisoner came accordingly, and said the Waterman had brought the Money. So he look'd out a Parcel of Goods, and made me cut a Piece of Muslin, because, he said, the whole would come to more Money than his Sister had sent. When he had chosen the Goods, and we had agreed upon the Price, I made out a Bill of Parcels for Goods <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240003"></xptr> sold Mrs Wilson, (for that he said was his Sister's Name) and sent them by my Servant, with Orders not to deliver them without the Money. My Servant returned, and told me that the Prisoner had run away with the Goods. This was on the 21st of March; and on Saturday the 30th of the same Month, as I was going along White-chappel with Mr. Dun, I accidentally saw the Prisoner. Says I to Mr. Dun, I believe that's the Man that took me in. Mr. Dun mending his Pace, the Prisoner took to his Heels, and happen'd to run down a Stable-yard that was no Thorow-Fare. We follow'd, and at last found him hid under a Manger. We carried him before a Justice; but he was so sullen, that he wou'd not tell his Name, where he lived, or who he was acquainted with. I had seen a Description of such a Chap, (in the Daily Advertiser of the 4 or 5 of March) who had cheated other Persons of a large Quantity of Linnen; and thereupon I sent to those Persons, who came and found the Prisoner to be the Man. We found a pocket-Book upon him, in which there was an Account of many dark Things he had been concern'd in.</p>
               <p>Mansel Alcock, the Prosecutor's Servant. By my Master's Order I took the Goods, and went with the Prisoner to the <placeName id="t17340424-5-crimeloc18">Blue-Anchor Alehouse in Swan-Lane</placeName>

He asked if his Waterman was there, and somebody said, No. Then he called for a Pint of Beer, and when it was empty'd he said, Come, we'll go see for him at another House, and you may leave the Goods here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you deliver the Goods to me?</p>
               <p>Alcock. No; I left them in the open Room, and then we went to an Alehouse. And the Prisoner pretending to speak for some Beer, stept out at the back Door. As soon as I found he was gone, I ran back to the Blue-Anchor to see for the Goods. But Mrs Spinks, the Woman of the House, told me, that the Prisoner had fetch'd them away.</p>
               <p>Mrs Spinks. I keep the Blue-Anchor.</p>

             - This Lad bid the Prisoner come to my House. The Lad brought a Bundle, and the Prisoner asked me, if the Twickenham Waterman was there? I said, No. Then he asked the Lad if he'd drink a Dram or a pint of Beer - They had a pint of Beer; and then the Lad left the Bundle, and they went away together. But the Prisoner soon returned alone, and said, he had found the Waterman; and so he took the Bundle and went away, towards the Monument.</p>

            . On Saturday the 21 of March, as the Prosecutor and I were going along White-chappel, we saw the Prisoner crossing the way. Says the Prosecutor, I believe that's the Man as took me in. Why don't you follow him then? Says I; and upon that the Fellow began to run, and we ran after him. I suppose he intended to make the best of his way to Goodman's-Fields: But turning down an Alley that was no Thorow-Fare, he hid himself in a Stable, where we found him.</p>

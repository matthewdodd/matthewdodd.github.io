                  </hi>. I live at 52, Dorset-street, Fleet-street—my late husband was a livery-stable keeper in Wilderness-lane, Whitefriars—ho died on 12th August—the prisoner was his ostler, and I made him foreman after my husband's death—my husband never kept books, but I have a slight book—in October, Mr. Redfern owed me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the balance of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was the original debt—Mr. Redfern had taken his horse away, and the prisoner was aware that I intended applying for the balance—he asked me to let him go for it, as Mr. Redfern had promised to give him something for having taken his horse from the Temple to Clapham—he said, "If you go he will not give you anything, but if I go and he does not give me anything, I shall ask him"—I said, "Very well, George, you can go," and gave him a letter to deliver—this was on Friday, and he was to go on Saturday—on 2d November, he came to me and said that Mr. Redfern said that I had made a mistake, and charged him one week too much—I said, "If that is the case, Mr. Redfern ought to have deducted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more"—he then gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I held it out like this, and he said, "That is better than nothing"—I said, "Did the gentleman give you anything for your<lb></lb>self?"—he said, "Yes, ma'am, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Well, that is better than nothing, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is worth going for"—he said, "Mr. Redfern is ill; his physicians say he cannot live three days—his mouth is all black with the black thrash"—I said that I was very sorry to hear of it, and gave the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the omnibus—I owed the prisoner nothing, but about a week or a fort-night afterwards, finding that he had been selling some clothes belonging to me, I went to Mr. Redfern—I never saw this cheque—I believe this writing on it is the prisoner's, he has slightly tried to imitate mine in some of the letters.</p>

             sworn. Q. Your are an officer of the Thames police? - A. Yes; on Wednesday the 27th of November I was sent for; I found the prisoner at the Gun public house, in Wapping; I took him into a little parlour and searched him, I found this little screw-box concealed under his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his pockets? - A. Yes, I found nothing in his pockets but a few halfpence; when he unbuttoned his waistcoat this box fell out, I unbuttoned one part and he the other, this box fell out from under his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any holes in his pockets that could have prevented him from keeping anything in his pocket? - A. He had two pockets in his waistcoat that were sound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him what you were searching him for? - A. I told him that I suspected him of robbing this girl, I did not mention the box, I have had this box ever since, I am sure it is the same that fell from under his arm, and from under his waistcoat, there is a shilling and a sixpence in it, I found that he had changed some gold at the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. That you had only from information, there is nobody here to prove that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) Look at that box? - A. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it, there is many boxes like that? - A. This here box we could not unscrew it at one time, we have a stone kitchen, I put it on the ground and put my foot on it, which made it dirty, it was black then, it has been cleaned since, it was black when the officer found it on him.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Gill) Was it dirty or clean when it came into your hands? - A. It was much in the same state then as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you done any thing to it since? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) There is no particular mark to it that you can speak to it? - A. No further than I had it four years, I had it continually under my eye.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a kind of a common box is it not? - A. No, it is not, it is a lemon box.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know it by any particular mark do you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know no more of it than this place does, I had half a dozen of them boxes at one time, I do not know any thing of the money, that box was mine, and I had six of them at one place.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prisoner) Is there any person here that knows who you bought this box of? - A. There is one, but he is not come up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

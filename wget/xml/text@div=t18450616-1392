                  </hi>. I live at Woodford-bridge. Hicks was in my employ for ten months—he came to London with a load of gravel on the 19th of May, and my foreman gave him directions to take something back—I was not at home when he returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Dyer. I saw Hicks on the 19th of May, and I delivered him, for my master, ten trusses of meadow hay, four trusses of clover, one sack of oats, and two trusses of straw, at my master's stable, in Worship-street—Hicks asked me for them, to take down to my master's country house—I helped to put them on the cart, and I saw him leave with them—I have a sample of oats here, which are the tame as those I put into the sack—I saw some clover and oats after<lb></lb>wards at Ilford, similar to the clover and oats I gave to Hicks—I would not attempt to swear to the clover, as it had been so pulled about, but the oats I think matched very much.</p>

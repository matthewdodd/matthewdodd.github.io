               <p>Q. Had you given her any money? - A. No; I asked her what she would have, and she made a demand of half-a-guinea; after that, I said, it won't do; I went down stairs, and went home, but I was so intoxicated I could not find my way to the house again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, while you were in the room, pull out your money? - A. I did not; I had my hand in my pocket when I paid my reckoning at the public-house door, and the notes were then in my left-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen them? - A. About six o'clock in the evening, in Smithfield; there were two five pound Bank-notes, one two, and one one; I have never seen them again. On the Tuesday after I got information where she lodged, I went to the house, and found her up stairs, in the same apartments; I knew the apartments again, and I knew the prisoner again; I sent for an officer, and she was taken to Hatton-garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 45, Old-street-road, and am a steward—the last vessel I was in was the <hi rend="italic">Arena</hi>. On Thursday, 9th Aug., about half past 2 o'clock in the morning, I met Brown in the City-road—she asked me to give her something to drink, I told her I did not feel inclined as I wished to get home—she pressed me, and I said that I did not know a house which was open—she took me to Levy's, in the City-road—I walked with her to the top of Paradise-street, where I talked to her and felt a twitch at my coat pocket—I heard something snap, put my hand to my pocket, and missed my watch—I am certain I had it when I came out—I accused her, and she said that she bad not got it—I took hold of her hand directly, we walked to the top of the street, and two men ran across and wanted to know what was the matter—Taylor was one of them, Brown leaned towards him, and he leaned towards her—the men then said, "We will fetch a policeman?" and they both ran away—I did not leave go of Brown—she called, "Police!" in rather an under voice—I met a policeman, who took her into custody—a policeman came into the station and said, "There is a couple of young men over the way, go and look at them"—I went out and recognised Taylor as the one who had leaned towards her, and gave him into custody—I was sober—my watch was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>

Q.</hi> Did not you catch hold of my hand at the very moment and say that you would hold me, whether you had lost it while with me or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said so; I did not ask you to come to my house—both the men wore hats, and not caps—you cried "Police!" both before and after the men came up, but rather in an under voice at first—I think it was meant as a sign for the men to come up, for they ran across the road directly—when they had gone, you went on crying in the same way—you said that you had not got the watch.</p>

I heard a cry of "Police!" in a female voice, and found the prosecutor holding Brown's hand—he said, "This female has taken my watch"—I took her to the station, and saw Taylor and another young man, and two females near there—the prosecutor pointed out Taylor as one of the two who had ran away—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Twickenham, and am shepherd to Sir William Clay. I had the care of a number of sheep of his in a field near Hospital Green, in that parish—there was one particular sheep that I knew well—I saw it on 21st Oct.—I went the next morning to the field, and it was missing—some bits of skin and bits of fat were in the field, and some blood—I have since seen the head of that sheep—I have no doubt whatever of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, V</hi> 17). On 22nd Oct, from informa<lb></lb>tion, I went into the field where Sir William Clay's sheep had been kept—from thence I went to a plantation, where I found this skin and bead of the sheep, and the entrails were rolled up in the skin—on the 23rd I went to the prisoner Elms' premises, which are about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's, and on looking up stairs I saw a shelf, and on it a bundle—I took it down, and found in it part of a leg of mutton, uncooked—this is it—it has been salted—it was not cut as a butcher would cut it; and on the same shelf was a dish full of fat—to the best of my belief, it was mutton fat—I went to a cupboard, down stairs, and found a saucepan, with some fat in it, and a bone—I sent two constables after Elms, and he was brought to the house to me—I asked him if he had any mutton in the house—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had any fat—he said, "No"—I showed him the mutton and fat that I had found—I said, "How do you account for this? "—he said, "I know nothing about it; my wife bought it"—1 afterwards went to the house of Cox and Hayward—I went up stain, in company with a constable—after I came down, Cox came in, and I said to him, "Have you a candle in the house? "—he said, "No"—Roberts, whom I had left below, had been in the coal cellar, and I desired him to go there again—Cox said, "It is no use your going there"—Roberts went down, and found some mutton—when it was found. Cox said, "O my God! this is the room I occupy," pointing to a front room—on the 24th I took Cox's and Hayward's shoes to the field, and at a gap there I found some marks which corresponded with Elms' left shoe—I tried it by putting the shoe in the impression—I found one footstep there—on the morning of the 22nd there was a very heavy dew; and after I had found the akin and entrails, I could see where some person had been, along the side of the hedge, through this gap, on to the hospital bridge, and across some other fields, into a ploughed field—there were the footsteps of two persons in the ploughed field—I examined them with the shoes, and have no doubt they were Elms' or Hayward's—it was Elms' left shoe that corresponded with the mark in the gap—after Roberts had been in the cellar some time, he brought me up six pieces of mutton—he went down a second time, and brought up a hind quarter, and part of a neck—Roberts gave me this bone—I fitted it with a portion of the bone in the head—the hind quarter, which was left in the skin, fits it exactly—here is a part of the inner skin, which is left inside the skin.</p>

On Tuesday, 23rd Oct., I went with sergeant Butcher to the house of Elms—I was with him when the piece of mutton was found—I went to apprehend Elms, he was at work—I told him I wished him to accompany me back—he wanted to know what for—I said, "Will you accompany me; if not I must take you into custody? "—he went back with me and Barker—when we got back to the house, Butcher said to him in my presence, "Have you any mutton in the house? "—he said, "No"—Butcher said, "Are you sure? "—he said, "Not that I am aware of"—Butcher then took the mutton from the shelf over the stairs, which was rolled up in a woman's night gown, and said, "How do you account for this? "—he said, "I know my wife bought it in Kingston market"—I went afterwards to Cox and Hay ward's—I went into the coal hole, and under the bottom step of the stairs I found six pieces of mutton rolled up in an old apron and an old child's frock—when I brought them up, Cox said, "O, my God! "—I never knew Cox before—after I brought these pieces of mutton out, I returned to the coal hole, and at the further end I pulled up the bricks and found a smock frock, and in it a leg and a neck of mutton, which have been produced—I went on the Thursday morning with sergeant Butcher through the gap to the ploughed field—I saw the footmark in the gap—I observed the bottom of the shoe which we had, and compared it with the mark in the gap—it corresponded exactly, on looking at the mark, and then at the shoe before it was fitted to the mark—in my opinion the mark appeared to have been made by this shoe—I have not the least doubt on the subject—when we fitted the shoe into the mark, it was put in as nightly as it could be—it corresponded in length and breadth, and every thing else, and with the single row of nails, and the double row—before it was put in the mark I had noticed the mark of the single row of nails, and the double one—these others are the shoes belonging to Hayward—I found thirty or forty marks in the ploughed field corresponding with these shoes—before I put them into the marks at all they appeared to correspond, and when I put them to any of the marks I did it in the same way, gently—here is an iron tip to this heel—I am able to say that the marks corresponded.</p>

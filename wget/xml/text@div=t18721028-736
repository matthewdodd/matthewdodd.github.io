I live at 14, Dunford Place, Kentish Town, and an toll-collector on the Regent's Canal—on Saturday, 14th September, about 8.10, I was at my office at Paddington and heard a splash in the water—I ran out and saw an infant floating in the water—I got a garden-rake, got a child out, and gave it to a constable—it was in the water two minutes or two minutes and a half after I heard the splash—it floated on top of the water—it seemed hearty and well—I did not look to see if any one was about; my attention was attracted to save the child's life.</p>

On Sunday evening, about 12.30, I went to 25, Essex Place, Hammersmith, and saw the prisoner in a back room—I told her I was a detective, and should arrest her for attempting to murder her child by throwing it into the Regent's Canal on Saturday night—she said "<hi rend="italic">My</hi> child! you have made a mistake, my child id dead; it cannot be my child"—I said "it is very fortunate the child is not dead; it was found on Saturday afternoon in the Regent's Canal; here is a porter outside from the workhouse, if you wish me to call him I will do so"—I do not think she made any reply—I said she would have to go with me to the station—I do not think she made any reply—her cousin, who was there with her husband, said "You don't mean to say that, sir"—I said "Yes, that is the truth"—I said "Were not you aware that the was living?"—she said "No, she wrote to me and told me that it was dead, and I wrote to the mother to that effect," meaning the prisoner's mother, "and she will be up to-morrow"—the prisoner replied "You did not tell me that mother was coming to-morrow."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the house with the porter—I did not take him in because I thought she would know him—I did not want to pump her with a few questions to get up a case against her—I took the porter to identify her—I believe I told the Magistrate that the prisoner said her child was dead; I signed my deposition, and it was read over to me—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's</hi>

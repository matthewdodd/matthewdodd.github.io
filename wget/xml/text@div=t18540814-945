I went to Mrs. Chadd, who had been a customer of mine ever siren I had been in business—I had a bill against her of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had never received that from the prisoner—he kept a book, in which he books his bread, and one in which he books his money—both were in his writing—they are not here—I gave them up to the prisoner's attorney, Mr. Sleep, at Brentford Town Hall—the Magistrate asked if I had any objection to leave them—I left one, and the other I took, and booked the bread in, and the policeman came and took it away—I have my own books here—here is my book in my writing—I make the entries in it from the information of the prisoner—he sees me make the entries from time to time—he has his book with him, and he tells me from his book, and I enter it in his presence—this is the book of the bread sent out—here is the book of all money received by me—on 1st Aug. here is no sum of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., purporting to have been received by the prisoner for me—on 3rd Aug. here is no sum of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 5th Aug. here is no sum of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are no such sums—I have never received any of these three sums—the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was due from Mrs. Barnett—she never</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Nelson-place, City-road. I was taken to the station on the 10th of February, for drunkenness—I had two half-crowns in a little black bag, and a watch—about half-past seven o'clock I was bailed out, and my bag and half-crowns were gone—the prisoner was in the cell with me—this is the bag that had my money in it.</p>

               <p>in about quarter to four; he was searched, the officer gave me one shilling and one halfpenny, which he said he took from the prisoner—the prisoner pretended to be drunk, but I am certain he was shamming—I brought him out about six o'clock, and searched him, he had nothing about him—about eight o'clock the prosecutor was bailed—about nine the prisoner sent for me and said he wanted me to send to Field-lane, for some coffee—I said I would furnish him with any thing—the prisoner afterwards put his hand through the cell-door, and gave the man who came there half-a-crown, to fetch him some refreshment—I opened the cell, searched him, and found another half-crown—I said, "How is this, you had no money?"—he said, "Yes, it was in my watch-pocket"—I said, "I shall find an owner for it"—the next morning the prosecutor said he was robbed of two half-crowns, and a small bag—I went to the water-closet, and found this bag there—there were two more people in the cell, I searched them, they had nothing about them—I am certain the prisoner had not the money about him when I searched him—the watch-pocket 1 searched particularly.</p>

I am the wife of Edward Pye, of Haberdasher Street—on a Sunday evening about three weeks ago I was in East Read, and the prisoner came up, struck me a blow on the chest, and twisted my chain, which was tied in my button hole, tore my coat, and took my watch—there were two more with him—I held him as long as I could, but one of the others struck me a blow on my side, and the prisoner twisted round and ran <hi rend="italic">for his might</hi>—I saw that he had stolen my watch and chain, and then the others struck me and ran away—I called "Stop thief," and then went to the station and told the inspector—I was much hurt, and have not been very well since—I have not been in the doctor's hands, but I had a large bruise on my chest—on the next Tuesday I picked out the prisoner from six other men, and am positive he is the man—it was a silver Geneva watch, worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On Tuesday, 19th November, about 4.30 p.m., I met the prisoner with another man in Nile Street, East Road, and from the description I had received I told him that I should take him on suspicion of stealing a watch on Sunday night in East Road—directly I took hold of him, he said "If you don't let me go I shall kill you"—he was very violent, and took from his pocket this stocking with a stone in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I closed with him, and caught his comforter with my left hand—his companion kicked me and threw me down—I think there were two or three companions, but only one of them took a prominent part in it—they got me down, and I asked some of the shopkeepers by name to</p>

               <p>assist me, but they would not come—the prisoner heard that I halloaed out loud when we were struggling together—it is a very low neighbourhood in Hoxton—I got up again and struck the prisoner's companion across the face, and struck the prisoner across the head with my cane and cut his head open—my cane was then taken from me, and I lost my hat—a uniform man came to my assistance, and then two constables, and the prisoner was taken to the station—I went back and picked up this stocking with a stone in it, which the prisoner dropped when the constables came up—I was shaken, but not much hurt—I had one or two little bruises—he was put with six other men, near about his own appearance, at the station, and she identified him—I did not point him out to her—I kept in the charge room.</p>

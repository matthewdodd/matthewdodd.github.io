I was in the back room - the prisoner came and said he wanted to fit out, to sail; I brought out some shoes, handkerchiefs, and other things, which he looked at; he wished a better assortment, and showed me an order to the amount of 2l. I went out for half an hour, to get some of the things, leaving him with my wife; when I returned he was gone with these things.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. My husband went out to get some things, to show the prisoner - he sat in a chair, close to the door in the parlour; he tried on a frock and shoes - I said, "Your are not going to put them on?" he said, "No, I am only going to try them;" I wrapped up two silk handkerchiefs for him: the bell rang - I went into the shop, and on my return he had gone out at the passage door. I missed this property - he left his own shoes behind.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor agreed to let me have the things, and he was to be paid for them when I got to Gravesend. I merely went out for some tobacco, and seeing the ship moving, I went to assist, which was my duty- I went to join the ship, and found another man was engaged in my room.</p>

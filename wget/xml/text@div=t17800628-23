               <p>Was you at your house on the 8th of June in the evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Describe what happened? - On the 7th of June the first mob came to my house, they went away peaceable; I contented them with letting them have what they chose to drink; the mob returned again on the 8th; the prisoner was the third or fourth man that entered my house; he began pulling down the boxes as fast as he could. I ran after him up stairs; he and two or three more forced my chamber door open. I begged them for God's sake not to tear my place to pieces; they were breaking my drawers open then; that was up the one pair of stairs. I begged they would not spoil my property. The prisoner held me by the colar, and his comrade held a pistol to my head; the prisoner told me if I did not go down stairs he would send me down twice faster than I came up, and then I received a blow on my arm which fractured the bone. I went down stairs; I saw the prisoner no more till I saw him in the mob, which might be a quarter of an hour afterwards; I was struck by one of the mob.</p>
               <p>What with? - I took it to be a small bar.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner any thing in his hand? - A bludgeon; and he had a lighted candle in his hand.</p>
               <p>What was done to your house? - It was entirely demolished; the door, the wainscotting, the floorings, and the window frames, are all demolished.</p>
               <p>What o'clock was it? - About ten or a quarter after; I believe the watch had gone ten.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I have seen him pass and repass through Whitechapel and Petticoat-lane two or three times.</p>
               <p>You are not acquainted with him? - I never was acquainted with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you make the discovery? - He was taken by some of the people at the Rotation-office in Whitechapel. I told the magistrates there was such a man; as soon as I saw him I owned him. I said he was the man; and after he was fully committed he acknowledged it himself.</p>
               <p>When did you tell the magistrates? - The Sunday after the thing was done.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he confessed the fact? - I was, and so was Mr. Dawson.</p>
               <p>Where was the confession made? - He confessed it in the room, after he had been examined by the magistrates.</p>
               <p>Was that confession reduced into writing? - I cannot say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Did he confess of his own accord, or did any body tell him it would be better for him? - I heard neither promises nor threats.</p>
               <p>What day was it that he confessed? - The Tuesday or Wednesday following the riot, I cannot positively say which.</p>
               <p>How came he there? - He came with an intention of turning evidence against other people, I believe; I did not know of his being taken till I came there and saw him at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Which of the publick offices is it that you attend at? - I attend at none.</p>
               <p>Would you have me understand that it is not the principal part of your business to attend at a publick office at the east end of the town? - I never did belong to a public office. I am an officer of his Majesty's palace court.</p>
               <p>And did never attend an office upon cases of this kind? - No; I never did in my life; I detest a thing of this kind.</p>
               <p>When did the proclamation come out offering a reward? - After the man was taken.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I did not come here for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>When did your house receive a damage? - The 7th.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that on the Sunday after these things happened you spoke of this? - Yes. I told Justice Staples of it.</p>
               <p>That was after the proclamation offering a reward? - That I cannot tell; I did not see it till the middle of the next week.</p>
               <p>You did not see it, you might hear it? - I had trouble enough about something else.</p>
               <p>You said this man came voluntarily, and that they took him? - I said he came voluntarily, and they took him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280064"></xptr>You came then not to enquire after him? - He secreted himself; it is not to be supposed a villain would not sneek out of the way.</p>
               <p>This was at ten at night? - As near as I can charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Were there any other lights than that candle in your house? - Some lights were sticking in my windows.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened? - Yes. I suppose if you had been in my circumstances you would have been frightened too.</p>
               <p>I suppose so. But when people are so frightened they are not so likely to recollect? - When a man holds one by the collar with a candle in his hand, I think one may easily recollect him.</p>
               <p>But can you be positive the prisoner is the person? - I am consident the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>What clothes did the person wear that night? - I thought they were brown. He afterwards confessed they were not. But I am not positive to his clothes, I am positive to his person.</p>
               <p>You swore before the magistrate that he had brown clothes on? - That I thought he had brown clothes on to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came voluntarily there? - He absconded some time; when he came the justice would not admit him on evidence he being one of the principals.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

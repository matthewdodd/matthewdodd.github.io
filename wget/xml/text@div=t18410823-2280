                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Richard-street, Woolwich, right opposite Mr. Harris. On the 9th of August, I saw the prisoner at his shop-door—he went in, went to the other end of the shop, took the trowsers off a peg, rolled them up, put them into a basket which he had, and was returning with them, when I secured him—he was trying to push the trowsers out of the basket when I caught hold of him—I did not let Dim get out of the shop.</p>

They did not fall down—he put them into his basket, and they were half out when I got hold of him—he was pro<lb></lb>fessing to sell lemons—he had the basket, under his arm hanging by a strap round his neck.</p>

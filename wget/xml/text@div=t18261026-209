            . On the 8th of September I was in the factory, and heard a noise in the loft - no one has any business there; I had shut it an hour before; I called out,"Who is there?" but received no answer - I ran up-stairs, and met the prisoner coming out, with a box lid in his hand - I said, "What do you want? why not take a light?" he said, "A box-lid, to cover a box;" I looked round, and under a box saw two cakes of soap, in another box - I locked up the place, and when Mr. Birke came in the morning I told him; I then put a crooked nail into the soap, and left it there - it had been moved from the cutting-room. On the 14th it was missed, and I went with the officer to the prisoner's house, and saw him find two cakes of soap in his bureau - on cutting it the crooked nail was in it; I told the officer about the nail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state all this to Mr. White, the Magistrate? A. Yes, and he was discharged, because the witness was not there; he was committed by Mr. Hall, at Bow-street. I am not in the habit of calling at his house; Farrell used to call him up in the morning.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner - he said he had no soap, and knew nothing of it; I found it in the bureau in his room, and the nail was in it; Bain had said he had put one into it - the bureau was not locked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A box of fat stood in the yard; the carpenter sent me for a box lid - I went for it in the dark; the doors were open. Bain called out, "Who is there?" I said, "Me;" the soap had been there for months - Mr. Birke said he had lost none.</p>

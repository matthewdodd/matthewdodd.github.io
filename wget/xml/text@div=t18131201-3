            ; he lives in the house himself, and the prisoner lodged in the house. All the other part of the house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you took the prisoner up - A. On the 11th of November, last month.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, tell me all you know of this transaction - A. A few days back the prisoner passed my door; he said he was just come out of the country; he asked me if I could tell him of a private lodging I told him no. I asked him where he came from; he said from Doncaster in Yorkshire; I replied, that is just by where I came from, come in, and stop a bit, I will enquire for you. After he came in I spoke to him about them that I knew; he said he knew them also; I then said, you can sleep with me until I can get you a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he from that time sleep with you - A. Yes, except the two nights that he slept out of his lodging. When he came back the first time he said he had been robbed; the first time I thought he had been robbed; the second time I thought he had not been robbed. He came home with the same story; after dinner I said I would go with him to the house where he had been robbed, which was of a Sunday. I then went with him to the house, and then from the story he had told I supposed it to be true, and then the next day we obtained a warrant to apprehend the people; they got clear. I told him, although he had been unfortunate he should have victuals and lodging with me until he got employment; so it went on for a fortnight. This was the second or third night that he slept out; he said with me from the first night until the Thursday fortnight following. He got up; I thought he went out to get employment; he soon returned again; that was the 11th of last month; he returned back in half an hour after he went out; he said he thought there was nothing to be done in London, he thought he would go off into the country. I told him I would give him some victuals to eat as he had no money. He seemed to say he was going towards the North, and seemed anxious to get away. I gave him an eighteen-penny piece to get a pot of beer; his hand shook, which led me to suppose all was not right. When he was gone for the beer I went and unlocked a caddy that I had got, and found that I had lost fifteen pound in bank notes; two five-pound notes, two two-pound notes, and a one-pound note. There was some money left behind, but that was shut down under the lid of the caddy. The caddy was still locked. Soon after, he came back with the porter; I accused him of taking the notes. He denied it, and said that he had not got it. After some time talking with him, begging him to give me the money, he would not; I sent for an officer; his name is

            . The officer came; I then told the prisoner if he would give me the money I would forgive him. The officer told him to give up the money. I then gave charge of him, and he went out with the officer. I did not go with them; I staid in my shop. In about fifteen minutes be returned with the officer, and the officer brought back the fifteen pound that I had lost, but I did not see the notes until I saw them at Marlborough-street office the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after - A. About an hour and a half I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop do you keep - A. A chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the caddy stand in your shop - A. No, in a drawer in my bed room. I don't think the drawer was locked; the caddy was locked, and the key in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had ever opened the caddy in the presence of the prisoner - A. Yes, frequently of a night I have took money out and put money in while the prisoner was sitting there.</p>
               <p>Q. During all the time the prisoner was with you was the prisoner in any employment - A. No, except doing an errand for me, which he always seemed extremely willing. That is all I know, except speaking to the notes when they are produced.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NEVILL. I am an officer of Marybone, and assistant watchhouse-keeper. I was sent for to go to Mr. Leach's. I went there; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010006"></xptr>and Mr. Leach were talking together. Mr. Leach wished to have his money; he said he thought it a cruel thing of him if he did not assist him in finding it; he did not wish to have; him but he did not like to lose his money, as he had been so kind to him. The prisoner said he had not got it; he refused to look for it. Mr. Leach then said he must give him in my custody. The prisoner asked me if he was given in my custody should I prosecute him. I said, I should not prosecute, but if Mr. Leach gave him in custody I should not let him go again. I took him in custody. The prisoner called and asked me if I would permit him to go and find the money. I told him I had no objection to his finding the money, but I must go with him. I went with him into Hyde-park; he turned short of the right hand side of the Cumberland gate; he walked first, and I followed him about two hundred yards under the wall; he went up to the wall, there he stopped, pulled up a turf, and then pulled up something. The notes were doubled up in his hand; I could not see them. He brought his hand towards his clothes, as if he was going to put them in his pockets. I immediately seized him by the wrist, and said I must see what is in your hand. I pulled the notes out of his hand by force. I immediately then put the notes in my pocket unexamined, any further than I could see</p>
               <p>"Five," outside. I brought him back to Mr. Leach's house first, and told Mr. Leach that I had the prisoner and the notes both. These are the notes. I took the prisoner to Marybone watchhouse, and when I had locked him up I examined the notes. It was so near the time of going to Marlborough-street, I did not shew the notes to Mr. Leach until I was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the notes - A. I can swear to the notes; there is the two five-pound notes, two two-pound notes, and a one pound note; I know them to be my notes by the marks upon the back of them; the two five pound notes are marked; one with the letter N upon one of the fives, the other with the letter R.</p>
               <p>"February" I remember perfectly well upon this one. The two two's have the names of the persons I took them of in the neighbourhood; Mrs. Collins is written by herself; the other is Mrs. Gibson; I wrote that with my own hand. I am certain they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the notes to take to the bank; I carried them to the bank in Hyde-park, and put them in the bank. The officer said he would make a little money of me; and Mr. Leach said he would not appear against me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never gave him any notes to carry any where, nor entrusted him with money only for a pot of beer.</p>

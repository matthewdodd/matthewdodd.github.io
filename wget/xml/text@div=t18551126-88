                  </hi>. I was in the tap room of a public house at China Hall Rotherhithe—on 9th Nov., about 9 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in—he spoke to me and wanted some of my drink, I refused—he said he had got plenty of money—I told him I did not want any of his money—he had some drink, and wanted roe to have drink with him—at last he gave me a shilling—I took it to the bar and it was returned to me as bad—I brought it back to the prisoner and told him what the barmaid had said, and he gave me another which was good—I took that to the bar and gave it to the barmaid—soon afterwards the prisoner gave me another shilling to get something else from the bar—(there had been 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change on the first occasion)—I gave that shilling to the barmaid—Mr. Leftwich was in the bar parlour—he stepped out and took the shilling, and made a hole in it—</p>

               <p>I took it to the prisoner and asked him if he had got any more; and he had got the shilling that I took back to him first, and two more bad shillings in his hand—I took the other two shillings to the bar, and they were both bad—Mr. Leftwich came with me to the prisoner, and asked him if he had got any more money—he said, "Yes, in this pocket "—I put my hand in it and there were 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. loose in his pocket, and two 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces, and two half crowns wrapped up in one piece of paper—Mr. Leftwich took the two half crowns—the other two pieces the prisoner took and put in his own pocket—he was very tipsy—he had not much to drink there—I took him three half quarterns of rum—he had one, I had one, and a stranger had one.</p>

On 9th Nov. the last witness gave me a bad shilling—I went with Mr. Thurston to where the prisoner was sitting, in the tap room—Mr. Thurston asked him where he got the bad money—he made no answer—he was very drunk—he had some money in his hand—I looked at it—it was bad—I took two half crowns. which lay on the table after Mr. Thurston took them out of his pocket—there were seven bad shillings altogether, two bad half crowns, and two bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces.</p>

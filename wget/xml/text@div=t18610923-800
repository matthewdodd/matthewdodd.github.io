I am a gaoler at the Clerkenwell police-court—I hid the prisoner in my custody on 23d August, and he was in my custody previously—he had been before the Magistrates on that day, and had just returned—when I took him into my room he said he wished to see the constable—I said that I did not allow constables to see prisoners when in my care—I asked him what he wanted to see the constable for—he said he wished to make some statement, to tell who the others were; he did not see why the others should escape and he should suffer—I said, "You are a fool, you had better hold your tongue and say nothing"—he said he did not care—I then put him in a cell—I had occasion to go to the cell two or three times after that, and once when I went he said, "You have not brought the constable yet"—I said, "No; I don't think I shall," or something to that effect—he said that he must see him—I said that I should see—I then went away—I had occasion to go back again, and as he kept calling me I got the constable at last—I took the prisoner out of the cell into my room at his request, and he then said to Tidy that he wished to make a statement to</p>

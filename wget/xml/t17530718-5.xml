I was walking about in the fields, in the afternoon about 5 o'clock ; and coming by Mr. East's house, I saw a woman breaking in at a window, I saw her break a hole, after that she put her arm in and took something out and put it in her bosom, I was about forty yards off at this time, then I saw her get into the house, there was another man with me, who went and alarmed the neighbourhood while I staid to watch her, that nobody might come to her assistance; then the maid came and open'd the door, and we went in; we found her sitting in a chair, I saw the spoon taken out of her bosom.</p>

                  </hi> I am a market-gardener. On 18th April, I was in my garden, which adjoins the Surrey canal bridge, at Deptford—I was about thirty yards from the canal—I saw the prisoner on the bridge with a child in her arms, folded in a shawl—I watched her for half or three—quarters of an hour—she walked about on the bridge—some showers came on and she went under the railroad arches once or twice out of the rain—I heard a man cry out, "There is a woman in the water"—I directly went to assist, and saw the prisoner in the water—she was off her feet, lying on her face, and the child was underneath—she did not move hand or foot, only her head—the water there is never less than six feet deep, and sometimes it is about eight—a rope was thrown by a man named Moore, and she was pulled out by about half a dozen people on a barge—she laid for a minute and a half or two minutes before she was lifted up, and the child was lifted from her—they were both taken out at the same time—when she recovered she asked where the child was—I</p>

               <p>did not see anything peculiar about her when she was on the bridge, but I was rather doubtful of what was going to happen—I thought she had no bus<lb></lb>ness there with the child that wet morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 4.) I saw the child at a surgeon's, wrapped in a blanket. I went after the prisoner as she was going home, and told her she was charged with throwing herself and the baby into the canal, and she must go with me to the station-house—in going there she said she did it in consequence of having words with her mother-in-law—there was a barge passing at the time, and three or four people assisted in getting her out.</p>

On 18th April the prisoner was brought there—I took off her things—they were very wet indeed—she had this shawl under her arm—it was very wet—she said that was the shawl she wrapped the child in, and I was to take care of it—she said she tied it to her apron and jumped in, and it was through her mother-in-law upbraiding her with it so many times she was quite tired of her life—she thought the best thing she could do was to get rid of herself and the child at once—I afterwards saw the child—it was from ten weeks to three months old—this is the child.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Burford, a labourer, of New-street, Deptoford. The prisoner is his daughter—on the morning of 18th April I had some words with her—I always brought the baby up by hand, and when it misses me it cries after me—I asked the prisoner to cover it over, and she walked away from the bed-side, pulling off the things, and uncovered him again—I pulled her away, and told her not to uncover him—she made use of a very bad expression and struck me—I struck her again—she struck me two or three times, and I her—I never reproached her for having the baby—I have always been kind to it—the child went by the name of William John Burford—we were very much distressed at this time, and had no victuals—we have got up and gone to bed without having any<lb></lb>thing—I have always done all that I could for her and the infant—she was in distress as well as me—we had not had a bit of fire or breakfast that morning—she had sold the baby's basket the night before for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a loaf and some sugar—we cannot get relief from the parish as it is not my husband's parish—after I married him he fell from a waggon in Farringdon Market, and was bad for a long time—Mr. East, a publican, in the Old Kent Road, with whom the prisoner used to live, will take her back into his service—the child's father has sent money as far as it lies in his power, but bringing up the child by hand is so expensive, it costs 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for milk—we could not starve the infant if we starved ourselves—the prisoner was very attentive to the child—she did not suckle it as she had no milk, owing to a fever that she had.</p>

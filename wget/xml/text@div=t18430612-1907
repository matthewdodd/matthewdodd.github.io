                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Great Charlotte-street Blackfriar's road. About half-past three o'clock, on the 3rd of June, the pri<lb></lb>soner drove up to my shop in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he came in, and said he wanted some clothes—he had just come home from sea, that he had been two years and a half on a voyage to China—he selected a hat, a coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, two shirts, and a pair of boots; they came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said if I could send any body down with him to the East India Docks gates he would see the skipps and pay for them—I called the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man, and asked if he knew anything of him—he said he agreed to take him down to the West India Docks, to get his money, and take him home—my lad went with him—he returned at half-past nine, and said the prisoner was in custody—he bad given him the ship at the dock gate—he did not bring me any money, nor the things—the pri<lb></lb>soner had the boots on bis feet.</p>

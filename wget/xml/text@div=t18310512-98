The prisoner has been in my employ four years - I had a box of Mr. Huggin's to take care of; it was locked - it had been in my care two years; about the middle of February I discovered that it had been broken open, and some articles were missing, among the rest two sheets; the box was kept in my granary, to which none but the prisoner had access.</p>

            . I left my box in care of Mr. Walker - it principally contained linen, and among the rest a pair of sheets; about the 9th or 10th of February I discovered it had been opened, and a pair of sheets and some other things taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For what you know they might have been gone some time? A. Yes, within twelve months - I was the first person who missed them; when I went to fetch the box, it had been wrenched open - the sheets were marked R. No. 2; they had been left me by a gentleman I was housekeeper to.</p>

            . I am a widow - my husband died on the 5th of November; he was a stay-maker, and worked for Mr. Gold - he left me some furniture and other things; I know the prisoner and his wife - she had been backwards and forwards to her sister and brother, who lodge in my house; in order to send my husband up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120056"></xptr>to Richmond, I was obliged to sell a pair of sheets to the prisoner's wife, but she was not Mrs. Morris then; I only knew her by the name of Margaret - the sheets were marked R., No. 2; these are the sheets - I know them, but I cannot swear to the mark, as I cannot mark myself; I know these sheets - I sold them in October, and they were marked in this way; I had had them five years - she gave 10s. for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to have these sheets? A. I bought them of Mr. Cockin five or six years ago - I do not deal in sheets; I sold two pairs of sheets in all - I had not had them in my possession above a month; I heard that Margaret left her brother to be married to the prisoner; I knew he lived at Mr. Walker's, as he used to come to his brother's to dinner.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You stated you had had them five or six years, and then you said one month? A. They had been in pawn three or four years; I had them at home a month - I was going to pawn them again, but I said I would rather sell them; the other pair was marked with red, and they were left me by my mother - this pair are marked R., No. 2, and these I bought in Blackfriars-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Charles Eve. I was lying in Mr. Webb's ground, between twelve and one o'clock, on the 24th of Oct., and saw the prisoner come in—he looked round, but could not see me—he went out again, to see if anybody was coming—he came in again, went to the end of the bench, and took a felly, and pushed it through the fence—he then fetched another, and put that through—he then walked out, to see if anybody else was coming—he then walked in, took another from a stack, put that through, and then another—he took five in all—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Robert and William Webb. I know their yard. On the 24th of October, about twelve o'clock in the day, my son gave me some information, and I went to look after five fellies—I found them <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> in a hole where an old piece of brick wall had been taken out—they were Messrs. Webb's property—I asked the prisoner if he had been in the yard—he said he had never been in the yard, but the coachman had met him coming out.</p>

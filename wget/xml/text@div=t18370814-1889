                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Walker and Co., attorneys, of New Inn, and live at No. 51, York-square, Regent's-park. On Saturday evening, the 29th of July, about half-past ten o'clock, I went to the Acton Arms, Kingsland-road, and asked for a glass of porter—I had missed my way—I saw the prisoner in the house—she called for a quartern of gin, and when the landlord asked who was to pay for it, she immediately said, "That gentleman is to pay for it"—I said I knew nothing about it; but there having the appearance of being a disturbance about it, I asked what it was—he said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and I said, "Rather than have a disturbance, take it out of the change"—I had not spoken to the prisoner—I gave a sovereign, and put the change into a wash-leather purse which I had in my hand, and placed the purse in my right-hand trowsers pocket—I had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold; and, to the best of my belief, three half-crowns, a shilling, and sixpence in silver, in my purse—the porter disagreeing with me, I left the house—the prisoner followed me out, and took me by the arm—I requested her to leave me alone—she immediately seized me by both arms, and held me violently, passing one arm round my back, so as to take hold of my right arm, she standing on my left side—I was rather alarmed—another woman came in front of me—I believe she had been in the public-house, but I had not no ticed her—another came on my right side—(I had not seen her before;) and, in an instant, I felt my pocket unbuttoned, and a hand draw my purse from my pocket—I struggled hard, and at last got away from them—I imme diately went back to the house, and informed the landlord I had been robbed—the prisoner did not let me go till my money was taken from me.</p>

On the 29th of July, the prosecutor came there, about half-past ten o'clock at night, and called for a glass of porter—the prisoner came in about a minute after, called for a quartern of gin, and told my master that the gentleman would pay for it—she was rather in liquor—the prosecutor paid for the gin, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and master gave him a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, one shilling and sixpence, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, which he put into his purse—the prisoner asked him if he would have any gin—he said, "No"—he drank the glass of porter, and then he was taken sick—there were three or four girls round the bar, one of them goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Newington Nance</hi>—master told me to see the gentleman out, but the prisoner said, no, she would see the gentleman righted—I went away, and just turned my head and saw the girl called</p>

I was coming out of the Acton Arms when the prosecutor was outside—the prisoner was holding him very fast by his arms—I heard him state he had been robbed—I Immediately went to get the police to his assistance—the prisoner had pinned his arms completely behind him, and he was struggling to get them loose.</p>

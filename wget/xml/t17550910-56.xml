             was read in court. Then Thomas Palmer, a sheriffs officer, deposed, he tendred the oath in court to the two prisoners, before they gave their evidence on that trial. Then Thomas Gurney, the short-hand writer , deposed; he saw them both sworn on the trial, and they gave in evidence the same as printed in the trial, to which the reader is referred . See No. 281, in last July sessions-paper. Then Alexander Plunket deposed the same as before, on the said trial, with this addition; that the goods Horan told him he had got to carry over to France, were 16 dozen of hard ware, 7 dozen of hats, and 6 dozen of great coats. Then Lockline Bourne was called and deposed the same as on the said trial.</p>
               <p>Philips's defence.</p>
               <p>Plunket certainly was in my room every day for a time; if he missed a day, I used to say to Mrs. Macdaniel, what is become of my thick legg'd cousin; God and my conscience thinks I did not tell one word of a lie .</p>

               <p>He absolutely was in company with one Mackey and me, I have no interest in swearing for Horan.</p>
               <p>Gyles Farrel. I have known the gentlewoman in the brown gown longest (that was Philips) she was captain Talbot's wife; I live at the end of Tottenham-court road, in Maynard's-street .</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Farrel. I keep a couple of lodging houses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known her in the brown cloaths?</p>
               <p>Farrel. I have known the gentlewoman ever since the hard frost; I have known the other about a year and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the character of Philips?</p>
               <p>Farrel. I never knew, or heard any thing worse, than being a very honest just woman in all her dealings; she liv'd on her means till her husband died. Then she married another man, and that man died; then she liv'd by her needle, and several ways that she had for bread. I never knew any thing of Macdaniel, any farther than being a well brought up, and well behav'd honest woman; that is what I have to say, they behav'd very just to me.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Macdaniel live?</p>
               <p>Farrel. She is here.</p>
               <p>Q. But where did she live, before she was here ?</p>
               <p>Farrel . I believe this time 12 month, she liv'd by Saltpeter-bank ?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live in June or July last?</p>
               <p>Farrel . I can't tell .</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the other live?</p>
               <p>Farrel. The other gentlewoman lodged by the Hercules's-club, by Wellclose-square, she lodg'd with me eight or nine years ago; I lent her money upon her credit, and trusted her for victuals and drink , and she paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of people do you let your lodgings to?</p>
               <p>Farrel. Some to tradesmen, some to apothecaries, some to surgeons ; any body that pays me honesty . My husband is dead, I am an Irishwoman .</p>

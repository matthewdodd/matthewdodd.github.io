Yes; I know the apron, and this piece of my child's cotton gown; I parted with the prisoner that same day, at three o'clock, at the Horse-guards, he was going into the country to see for work; before we went out, I told his wife, who was with him, that I had got twelve pounds to pay my landlord, that I had got seven pounds by me towards it, and I believed I should make what money I could of the remainder of the things that were stolen; she came to me at the prison at nine o'clock, she was to sleep with me that night, and went home with me; when I came home, I found my house broke open, and the things gone; when we parted at the Horse-guards, she told me I did not know what might happen, I had better take the key of my own place.</p>

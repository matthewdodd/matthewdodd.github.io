            . I am constable of Cripplegate. I have known the prisoner about five months, by seeing him at the Queen's Head. I have repeatedly heard him say he was an attorney, and kept three clerks. I never heard where his office was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the middle of last Term the prosecutor applied to me to commence this action. I advised an action of trover to be brought. I moved the Court, and charged him 35 s. Brown agreed to give up the property. The prosecutor wished me to proceed with the action against Hobcraft. At the return of the writ I filed the declaration, and served the defendant with notice and rule to plead; I attended at the office in proper time, and found no plea was put in. Crawley said he should be better satisfied if he went to the office himself; I suppose this to be the office he says he searched. He refused to advance more money, and never paid me for filing the declaration. I refused to proceed, and he had me apprehended. I do not consider that my case is connected with a Criminal Court.</p>

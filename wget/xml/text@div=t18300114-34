            . This violoncello is my property; I went to dine with my father and mother on Christmas-day, and I took up a fiddle there, and asked where the violoncello was - my brother-in-law said he thought the prisoner had it; I know the prisoner - we brought him up from a child; he did not live in that house, but I suppose he went up stairs and took it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. On Christmas-eve I went to my father-in-law's; I went up stairs to hang up a great coat, and threw it against the place where the instrument stood; I then came down, and in the evening the prisoner went up stairs to get some coals, and I suppose at that time he took the instrument and put it against the door, as it was missed the next day; he has had a good character.</p>

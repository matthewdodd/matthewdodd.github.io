               <p>Council. Was your sister a woman of the town?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. No, not as I know of, I am talking of her box, she has been dead seven months.</p>
               <p>Council. Was she a common woman of the town, what is called a woman of pleasure, from time to time, to different people?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She lived very honest, and died very honest; she retired from business, and would have no connection with lewd women.</p>
               <p>Council. I will have an answer, was she a woman of the town?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. No, she was not, for she was a married woman.</p>
               <p>Council. Who was her husband?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She told me on her dying bed she was married to Mr. Farrel, he lives at Marybone, he did keep a bagnio in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Council. Was your sister reputed to be a woman of the town?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She might have had a misfortune to be sure; I do not know what you mean by a woman of the town, she was unfortunate.</p>
               <p>Council. Had not she been a woman to many scores at different times?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. O, my God, I think that was a false information given you, she really could not bear a thing of that kind, she could not bear to sit where a lewd woman was for years, for that reason she lived retired.</p>
               <p>Council. Was not she sent for sometimes to a tavern to a gentleman, I will mention the Bedford Arms, and the Shakespeare under the Piazzas, for these last seven or eight years?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She died at twenty-seven years of age, I saw her first and her last breath, I wish we may all die as well and as happy as she; I am a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190037"></xptr> very honest woman, I will not tell a lie for the world</p>
               <p>Council. Pray then tell me what you are?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. I am a midwife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never live at a bagnio?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. I never put my foot in a bagnio but when she has been ill, I mean that bagnio where she was when she was married.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your sister deliver these things to Mrs. Quin, in order to run away from 'Squire Butler?</p>
               <p>

               <p>M. Thompson. About three years, she was but a baby, she was but about 14 years of age when she came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any fortune of her own when she came to 'Squire Butler's?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. No, she had nothing, she was a poor child; he bought her to make a sacrifice of her, and we put two women in Newgate for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all she had was 'Squire Butler's?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. The jewels were her own, she bought a good many of them of Mrs. Quin.</p>

            . I came over from Ireland in company with Mrs. Quin, Mr. Harding, and Miss Butler, in the year 1755; Miss Butler sent her trunk of wearing apparel in another ship with a servant maid, I know she had some jewels, rings, a gold watch, a picture set like bracelets round it, and things that she gave to Mrs. Quin to bring to London for her; I heard Mrs. Quin say so, but whether Mrs. Quin gave her them back I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear Mrs. Quin say about them?</p>
               <p>H. Alexander. I heard Mrs. Quin say she would take care of them for her</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you hear her say that?</p>
               <p>H. Alexander. At Mr. Kennedy's at Chester, where we supped, and that she had them in her possession.</p>

               <p>It is read in court to this purport:</p>
               <p>"Sir,</p>
               <p>"I understand Miss Butler received a letter from</p>
               <p>"you, where you say you had a fall that has</p>
               <p>"almost endangered your life, which has had</p>
               <p>"such an effect on her, that renders her incapable</p>
               <p>"of answering yours; she requests I should</p>
               <p>"do it for her, and let you know that she was</p>
               <p>"determined to go off to you, so soon as she received</p>
               <p>"your last; for which purpose I advanced</p>
               <p>"her 50 l. and as she intended her journey to</p>
               <p>"you, and return immediately, she thought she</p>
               <p>"might leave some of her debts unpaid; but the</p>
               <p>"creditors got the alarm, and tied her in such a</p>
               <p>"manner, by means of her friends, who feared</p>
               <p>"they should lose her, has put it out of her power</p>
               <p>"entirely to fly to you, as she intended; she was</p>
               <p>"obliged to give a separate note to her creditors</p>
               <p>"for 200 l. as her friends, as near as she can</p>
               <p>"learn, was the cause of their being so severe</p>
               <p>"upon her, to prevent her going to you; if you</p>
               <p>"desire her, it is her greatest inclination to do so;</p>
               <p>"if convenient to you so to do to settle that affair</p>
               <p>"for her, so as she may not be detained here,</p>
               <p>"pray favour me with a line, and you may depend</p>
               <p>"upon her going to you; if you pay the</p>
               <p>"money in Dublin to Mr. Smith, attorney, I</p>
               <p>"shall advance the said sum here, so that she may</p>
               <p>"be at liberty, and that will set her clear; she is</p>
               <p>"so desirous of going to you to settle for life, you</p>
               <p>"and she are the best judges; this I offer to serve,</p>
               <p>"if agreeable; she desires you to pay no money</p>
               <p>"for her, but upon condition of her going to you,</p>
               <p>"which she says is her desire; Mr. Harding joins</p>
               <p>"with service to you, from</p>

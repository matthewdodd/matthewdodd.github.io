                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Tottenham. On Sunday, the 1st of August, I noticed a brick or stone had been taken out of the wall of my cellar, from the outside, and I missed about two dozen of old claret, which I value at about 84<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I had three dozen in that particular part of the cellar a few days before—the hole in the wall was just about large enough to admit a man's arm and hand to remove it—it was all gone from that part, except four bottles, which were out of reach—one of those four bottles was broken, and three were whole—the prisoners had been working on my premises for about a fortnight before, and had whitewashed the coal-cellar, which adjoins the wine-cellar, the night before—they are bricklayers' labourers, in the employ of Mr. Fiddler, who I employed—I do not believe there are any chalk-marks at the bottom of my claret bottles; if there are, they have become quite obscured by age—I have since seen four bottles, which I believe to be part of the lot—I tasted a small quantity which remained in the bottles, and the flavour and colour were precisely the same as mine—this wine-glass corresponds with a set which I had, one of which had been missed by my servant—this wine had been at least fourteen or fifteen years in my family—it is a quality I can speak to—it was very excellent—it was made a present of to me.</p>

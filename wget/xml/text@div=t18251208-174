            . I attend at this house sometimes to play on the Scotch pipes - I was there on the 12th of December; the prisoner was there most of the day. I saw him take the boots from the side of the fire-place, and go to the bar door. I followed, and told him they were not his - he said "Go along, you young rascal," and he gave me such a blow that I was stupid; when I got better I told the people.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 3d of December, I was sent for, and took the prisoner; he said he had never seen any boots; he was committed for re-examination. I asked where he had sold them - he said he had not sold them, for he gave them to a man to hold while he made water, and the man went off with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to have a pint of beer - there was a sailor there; he asked if I belonged to a vessel; he had a pair of boots to sell, and told me they were sailor's boots. We sat there about half an hour; when the boy came in the man said to me "Come, let us go and sell them, and get something to drink;" the boy stood there, and said "Whose boots are they?" I said "They are not yours - go along;" I went out of the door, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080068"></xptr>wanted to make water - the man took hold of the boots, and I saw no more of him.</p>

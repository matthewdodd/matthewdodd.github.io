               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I had been at Walworth with a relation upon some business; I had been drinking, but I was not drunk; I was going home, and met with a woman, not the prisoner; I went in with her, I did not see the prisoner during that night; when I got there, I sent out for some gin; I staid the remainder part of the night; I pulled off my clothes, put them on the chair, and went to-bed, and the woman that I went in with along with me. In the morning, about two o'clock, I was awoke by the prisoner; she asked me what I did there; she said, I was lying upon her bed, and she wanted to come to bed; then I looked for my property, and it was all gone; my property was in my coat-pocket, and I lost out of my pocket-book two guineas, three half-guineas, and five shillings, and the halfpence were in my coat-pocket; I found the pocket-book in the room upon the table, empty.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen any of your property since? - A. No, except a shilling, which I know by the mark that was upon it; it was taken from her by John Marsden; I saw it as soon as it was taken from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose house this was? - A. The man's name is Young, I do not know his christian name.</p>

             sworn. - I searched the prisoner on the 31st of July, and found three shillings in a nutmeg-grater, (produces them); Williams came to me about ten in the morning, and went with me to a house in Duck-lane; I found the prisoner there, I took her into custody; I asked Williams if he should know any of the money again; he said, yes, there was one shilling that he was sure he should know again; I put the shillings into my hand, and he picked it out, and he said, I will swear to that, there are two W's upon it, one on each side, and a sort of a cross-bar. (The shilling was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The woman that this man was in bed with gave me that shilling to get some drink with, and when I got to the watering-house, it was shut up.</p>

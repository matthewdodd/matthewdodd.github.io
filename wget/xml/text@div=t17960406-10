             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am butler to Mr. Denys; The prisoner quitted Mr. Denys' service on Saturday the 19th; he was employed on that day to distribute some cards; it was after nine o'clock that I quitted the house; he stayed behind me; I was obliged to go; upon my return from the opera, with my master, and Captain Palmer, I found he was not returned; he did not return at all; I sat up till past one o'clock on Sunday morning; at half past eight I made a search, and missed the articles specified in the indictment; I found him afterwards at Woolwich, on Tuesday the 22d; I had heard that a person of that description had been about the Warren; I employed a constable, and he was taken up; he was then in regimentals, at drill, in the light artillery; I said, Thomas, I am sorry to see you in this situation; he said, I am not sorry at all; if you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060008"></xptr>take me to London I shall soon return; upon that, his brother fetched the plain cloaths that belong to my master, which he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to induce him to confess? - A. Not the least in the world; he signified that these were the cloaths that he took away from Mr. Denys; at the Marlborough-street office he acknowledged they were my master's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it those cloaths that he has on, that he said he had taken from his master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where they his own livery cloaths? - A. Yes; and there was a new pair of boots, that I believe were Captain

            's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Mr. Denys). Q. Had you given those cloaths to your servant, or no? - A. By no means; he had only worn them about three months.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They were made for him, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It may, perhaps, be too much to say, that a man going away with his own cloaths that were made for him, can amount to felony.</p>

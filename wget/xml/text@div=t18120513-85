               <p>Q. In the month of March you were under the necessity of going to lodge in the prisoner's house - A. In January and February; and afterwards in March. The prisoner had a house in Paddington. I was absent from my house till the 4th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. And during the time you were absent from your house, you left the prisoner in the care of it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you became a bankrupt, did you in consequence of suspicion, search the prisoner's house - A. I went with the assignee, Mr. Barnard, to search his house; I there saw a glass hookabottom, and some gools, that I claimed as mine; the gools are my own making. The gools are made of charcoal and rice. And I found some tobacco.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When did the prisoner leave your service - A. In March.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the justice, did not the prisoner assert that you had sent the hookabottom there by your servant Elizabeth - A. Yes: but I did not send her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought that girl here - A. I cannot find her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your assignees complain of your moving any thing to Barlow-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember making an application to the prisoner, some time before you were a bankrupt, for him to accept bills for you - A. Yes; and he refused it.</p>
               <p>Q. That made you more his friend than before - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The tobacco, with a part of the gools, I brought from India. The hookabottom, with a part of the balls, were brought to my house by his servant; her name is Elizabeth.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

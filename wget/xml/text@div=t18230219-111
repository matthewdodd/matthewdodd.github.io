            . I live in Long-lane, Southwark. Sinfield was convicted at Horsemonger-lane, of stealing these skins; and in consequence of what he told me, I went to the prisoner's house, Middlesex-street, Whitechapel, on the 3d of September, with an officer, and Anthony my man - we found him at home. I told him I had been robbed, and was informed he had part of the property, which I described; he keeps a furrier's shop, and deals in hats. I had lost them on the 29th of August; he appeared confused, and said, he had bought no skins of any description for three weeks, and knew nothing at all of them. I said, we must search the premises - he immediately pulled about twenty skins of various sorts, principally cat and fitch, and said,</p>
               <p>"If any of these are your's, you may see them." Anthony identified four Dutch cat-skins, three of which had his mark - two of them were in a finished, and in a saleable state - and the other two in a half manufactured state. I said, if he had those, he must have some others; he took a seal-skin from under the counter, and asked if that was mine, it was mine; I had given it out to my man to finish some time before - it was nearly finished, and cost me 12 s.; the finished cat-skins are worth 18 d., and the others 1 s. 3 d. each; they are part of those Sinfield was convicted of stealing - he was taken to Union-hall, and said, he bought them of a man named Hart for 10 s. 6 d.; they are worth 17 s. 6 d. Foreign skins are never hawked about, but bought of merchants. No respectable person would buy them in this state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were these skins produced on Sinfield's trial, and given in evidence - A. They were, the magistrate did not reject these - it was one others; I lost about 1 l. worth. I might not have seen these for a fortnight, before the 29th of August.</p>

            . I deal in clothes and hare-skins; the prisoner took me to Union-hall, and I was told to go about my business. I sold some skins very much like these to the prisoner. I was coming down the Minories, and a man asked if I would buy some; I said, I did not understand the value of them; he said he was a furrier, and if I would go with him to sell them, he would pay me for my trouble - I went with him, and when we got to the market, he said, he would give me 2 s. to sell them,</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the market - A. Petticoat-lane, he waited outside, while I went in and sold them to Phillips - he told me to ask 12 s. for them, but I asked 14 s. Phillips offered 9 s.; I at last took 10 s. 6 d., came out, and gave the owner the money, and he gave me 2 s.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago was this - A. About five or six months. I live in Phillip-street, Commercial-road; he did not ask where I got them, for he knew my face. I had sold him two or three hare-skins before - he called me Hart; I think he does not remember that he did. I have told him where I lodged once - I never spoke to him much - I did not hear of his being taken up till I was taken myself. I sold them to him above a month before I was taken I dare say. I only know him by dealing with him two or three times.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live in the house. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that this man was in the habit of going out in the morning to get some rum and milk for the purpose of treating the girls. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him did he not say so; I see there is no stopple to the decanter, if a man had taken it, for his own use, he would have taken it with the stopple, the decanter would have been more useful with the stopple. - A. Certainly.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On the morning of the 8th of September, I placed myself at the outside door, I saw the prisoner, he was looking about him as if he thought some person might see him; I brought him back to the shop, and took this decanter out of his breeches, this is the decanter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did he say that he took it to get some rum for the girls. - A. Mr. Shepherd told me yesterday that he heard so.</p>

When I left the shop I was going to the Rising Sun public house; Mr. Shepherd and Mr. Dorrington took me in the street, they asked me where I was going to, I told them to the Rising Sun, I have frequently took glasses to get liquor, and washed them afterwards.</p>

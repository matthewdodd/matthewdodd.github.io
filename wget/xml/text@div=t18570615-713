                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Ashby Street, St. Pancras. The prisoner is my husband—on the evening of 3rd June, between 6 and 7 o'clock, he came home dreadfully drunk—I had been out selling some fire ornaments, to help to get a living, for he had been out of work for a fort<lb></lb>night—I had brought home some coals in my apron, and had just lighted my fire, and put my kettle on, when he came in—he said, "I have got drunk, you b—, on purpose to <hi rend="italic">do for</hi> you;" and with that he gave me a blow over the eye, and broke what things I had on the mantel shelf with the blow—they belonged to my poor father, who lies in St. Pancras workhouse—there was a carved eagle hanging up over the shelf, and I said, "You shall not break this," and I put it under my right arm—he turned to the cup<lb></lb>board, and seized a knife, and seized me by the left hand—I put up my right arm to protect my throat or face, and received the stab on the back of my hand, and the eagle fell, and its wings were broken—I went out, and fell on the landing—at the time he did this, he caught me by the frock, and said, "I have got drunk on purpose <hi rend="italic">to do</hi> for you to-day"—he said that a second time; it was before I received the wound—I was rather confused with the blow that he gave me over the eye, and am not quite sure what he did say—he seized me by the hair of my head, and tore my clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went home on 3rd June very drunk, and asked my wife where she had been; she made use of very bad language, and I said, "You have been out along with Mr. Cox again;" that is a man that she is keeping company with. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not use bad language to him; I have seen the man Cox once—he did not say to me what he states.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Judd-place, St. Pancras. I saw the prosecutrix on the evening of 3rd June, about 9 o'clock, at the police station—I examined her arm, and found three incisions on the back of the hand, extending to the thumb, about two inches in length, and about a quarter of an inch deep—it is possible that it might cause permanent injury, but not very probable—the effect is want of power in the muscles of the thumb—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would cause such a wound—it must have been used with a good deal of violence—she could not have done it herself.</p>

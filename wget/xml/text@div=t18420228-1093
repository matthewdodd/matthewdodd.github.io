                  </hi>. I am single, and live servant at Plumstead. On the 4th of February I was at Woolwich, near Warren's-gate, about half-past two o'clock-there were several other persons there, but no one with me—I felt some one at my pocket, but I did not take notice what they were doing—I had only my purse and a duplicate in my pocket, for I had taken my money out a few minutes before, and had it in my glove in my hand—soon after I felt this I looked behind me, and saw the policeman with Day's hand in</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King's Arms-yard, Silver-street. About ten minutes past nine o'clock, on the 14th of April, I was in my stable, I heard a noise, in consequence of which I went out into Mr. Everett's yard, and saw the prisoner coming along with something under his arm—I stopped him, and found it was a piece of lead and a ball and cock—he gave it me, and said he was very drunk—I took the pipe from him, and let him go—he was very drunk—the pipe was wrenched off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was very drunk. It was this man's place to give me into custody, not let me go home. I was at work next morning, and did not know any thing about it. He could not swear to me; he said it was a man in a red night-cap. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I have not the least doubt he is the man—I never said I had any doubt—I did not know him before.</p>

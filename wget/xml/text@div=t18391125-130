On the 14th of November, the prisoner was employed in that warehouse—as he was leaving that evening, I took him into a place and searched him, and found about 2 lbs. of tobacco concealed up his back under his jacket—he took a knife and cut a rope-yarn that was round his body, and the tobacco fell down—I asked if he had any more about him,</p>

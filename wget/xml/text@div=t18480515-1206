                  </hi> I am shopman to Mr. King, a grocer and cheesemonger, in Brick-lane. On the evening of 25th April the prisoner came for some butter—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her ninepence change—shortly afterwards I discovered the shilling was bad, and I put it aside on a high shelf—no one knew it was there—next Monday the prisoner came again for a quartern of butter, and gave me another shilling—I said it was bad, and asked her if she had got any more of that sort—she said no, and she did not know it was bad—she wished me to give it her back—I said, "No," and I called Mr. King into the shop and told him—I said to the prisoner, "I have another shilling here, do you know anything about that?"—she said no, and she never was in the shop before—I marked the two shillings at the station-house and gave them to the officer.</p>

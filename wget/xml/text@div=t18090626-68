One of the officers took the sack of flour, and the other took Blain; I went to Shoreditch church and got a coach; we took Blain with us; before we came to the White Hart, this side of Newington-green;

               <p>Q. Did he mention the sack of flour - A. No; he mentioned on the Friday night that he should not stop any longer than Saturday week, or if I pleased to get a man, he would go the next day.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Saturday the 10th of June, I, in company with Bishop and Armstrong, went with Mr. Pratt to the Leg of Mutton and Trimmings, Kingsland-road, I went into the house and asked the landlord for his ostler, he pointed out the prisoner Blain, who was standing in the yard; I told Blain we had come to look over the stable for a sack of flour that had been stolen; Mr. Pratt came up, the prisoner Blain addressed himself to Mr. Pratt, said I have a sack of flour that was left here yesterday by your man. We went into the stable, and on the right hand side of the stable, by the corn bin, stood the sack of flour, covered over with a matted basket, and by the side of it was a truss of straw; I told the prisoner Blain that we must take the sack of flour and him before the magistrate, we got a cart, and sent the sack of flour with Armstong. Mr. Pratt got a coach for the purpose of finding Taylor; Mr. Pratt had two men of the same name. We went to the White Hart, Newington; at the door stood Mr. Pratt's cart, loaded; we saw Taylor, Blain pointed him out, at the public house door; I told Taylor he must come to his master, who was waiting in the coach for him; he came along with me to the coach, Blain then said that is the man that left it with me; I then said we have found the sack of flour in the Leg of Mutton and Trimmings stable belonging to Mr. Pratt, where did you get it from; he replied, I brought it from my master's mill in a mistake.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. When I loaded the flour it rained, I drawed the tarpaulin over them as I laid them; I laid one sack on the top, as I always did, to keep the horse from hanging. When I was four miles from home I found I had one sack too many I asked this man to let me leave it; he said I might if I liked; I drawed down the yard and pitched it in the stable.</p>
               <p>Blain's Defence. I stood against the door way when this man came by, he asked me to let him leave a sack of flour, he had one too many; I told him he might leave it till he came back.</p>

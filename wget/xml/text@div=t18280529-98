            . I am a constable. I was sent for and went to the Canteen at Charing Cross - the prosecutor stated what money the prisoner had robbed him of; I took her out, and asked her if she had robbed him - she denied it; but on searching her I found three half-crowns, four shillings, one sixpence, and four-pence-halfpenny, and two knives; I found the prosecutor and her making it up the next day; I parted them, and took her in to Sir

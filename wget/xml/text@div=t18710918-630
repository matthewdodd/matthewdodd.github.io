               <p>from William Hedges: "Sir In reply to yours of yesterday, I will thank you to send to Battersea Wharf, one barge of stocks, say about 30,000, at 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; cash at a month. At the same time, I beg to hand you reference, Mr. C.

(Signed) J. Chandler. W. Hedges."—It was sent for signature by the consignee—I wrote that same day to Mr. Hedges that I had despatched a barge, with 25,000 stock bricks, consigned to him at Battersea Wharf, and I received back the delivery note, marked "D," as it now appears—on 27th January, 1871, I received this post-card from William Hedges.: "I, Beechey Street, Ley ton Road, Stratford. The barge of bricks duly received, and unloaded yesterday."—I have tried to obtain payment at the address given, 1, Beechey Street, Leyton Road, by written and personal application—I went to the house in March or April, and found it shut up—there was no business carried on there at all—I have not been paid—I made inquiries for William Hedges, but could not find him or ascertain his whereabouts—prior to making inquiries, I received other letters from Hedges—I received one on 20th February, 1871, from the same place at Stratford, ordering another barge of stocks, at 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and stating that he would run down to Uxbridge, and pay for the two barges—I sent off 25,000 stocks 'on 25th February, and I wrote a letter stating that I had dispatched them, and asking for an acknowledgement of the same—the delivery note is dated 25th February, 1871: "Received from the Cowley Brick Company, Limited, by the boat <hi rend="italic">Jane,</hi> stocks, 25,000. <hi rend="italic">Pro</hi> William Hedges, G.

Mr. Barlee. Sir. When may I expect the bricks at Cherry Garden Stairs?"—This is the letter I received from Mr. Perry, on 1st February: "58, New Street, Kennington. Sir. In reply to yours of 30th instant, respecting Mr. Serle, of Forest Gate, I consider you will be justified in selling him bricks, as I have had business transaction with him for some years, which have been always satisfactory Yours</p>

Tour attention will oblige")—I replied, stating our price was 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per thousand hard stock, and grizzels 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per thousand less—on 31st January, I received another letter, signed John Archer, ordering a barge of best stock bricks at 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to be delivered at Lindsay Wharf, Chelsea, and enclosing as a reference, A. Javey &amp; Co., 17, Great George Street Westminster—on 1st February, I wrote to Messrs. A. Javey &amp; Co. for information respecting John Archer, and received this letter from them in reply: "3rd February, 1871, 17A, Great George Street Gentlemen. In reply to yours of 1st instant, we beg to say that we always found Mr. Archer punctual in his engagements in any business transactions with us"—In consequence of that I wrote to Archer on 6th February, 1871, stating that as the reference was satisfactory, I would send the barge of bricks, the usual quantity, two-thirds stocks and one-third grizzels, to any wharf at Chelsea he might wish; and on the 7th I received this letter from John Archer: "In reply to yours of the 6th, you can please forward the barge to Lindsay Wharf, Chelsea, as addressed in my former note. I ordered all stocks, but if you have them loaded, I can make use of the grizzels"—In consequence of that letter, I dispatched by the barge <hi rend="italic">Sophia</hi> 17,000 stocks and 8000 grizzels to Lindsay Wharf, Chelsea—on 15th February, I received another letter from John Archer, stating that he had received the barge of bricks, and ordering another barge-load to be delivered at Lindsay Wharf, Chelsea—the delivery note for those bricks has been lost—I have since applied at 18, Herbert Street, New North Road—the letter was returned through the dead letter office—I made a personal ap<lb></lb>plication, but he had left about a month, and I could not trace him—I went to the office of the reference, he was not there, and his private address was not known—I could not get any information at all—on 23rd February, I sent to Lindsay Wharf, to John Archer, 18,000 stocks and 7000 grizzels—I received the delivery note back, signed—I sent the invoice by post, which amounted to 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—the amount sent to Hedges was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the total amount of the six consignments was 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of not finding the persons referred to, I communicated with the police, and the men were taken into custody, and committed for trial—the men there were Southwell, Baker, and Palmer, with the prisoner Feiler—they were</p>

I had instructions to take these persons into custody, and had been searching for them—I found a large quantity of letters at Southwell's place, and also a memorandum book—there is a memorandum there, "Mr. Herbert Barlee, manager, Cowley Brick Company, 11/1/71," and also, "W. Feiler, jun., I, Beechey Street, Leyton Road. Stratford New Town"—I also found letters directed, "Mr. William Hedges, 1, Beechey Street, Leyton Road"—I also found a memorandum with the name of "John Archer, 18, Herbert Street, New North Road"—I was at 4, York Street when Feiler or Fisher was apprehended—I was down stairs—I found this agreement, dated 27th April, 1871, for the house at 4, York Street, and it describes Fisher as of 2, Stanley Terrace, Odessa Road—I also found an agreement for 2, Stanley Terrace, dated 11th March, 1870—there is a distress for rent attached to it—I found the agreement between Mr. Horncastle and Feiler at the prisoner's place—I also found some bankruptcy proceedings, in the name of Daniel Feiler, trading as David and Alfred Feiler, and various addresses—one was in 1868, and another in 1869—the adjudication was in the name of Daniel Feiler, trading as Alfred Feiler, shirt manufacturer; and another is Daniel Feiler, trading as David Feiler, 4, George Street, Minories, and several other addresses—there is also a County Court summons, of 12th July, 1871, in the name of "John Fielder."</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the premises, 4, York Street, London Rood, Southwark—I know the prisoner as Thomas Fisher—I let him the premises—this is the agreement signed by him as Thomas Fisher—he gave me a gentleman named Zencraft as a reference—I made very little inquiry, except from Mr. Zencraft, whom I have seen sometimes—the prisoner was a shoe manufacturer—the rent was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the shop was never opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew Mr. Zencraft—he was an agent for a merchant in Yorkshire—he brought Mr. Fisher to me—I did not know Fisher's name was Feiler—he did not say when he took the shop he was going to carry on business for his father-in-law—about two months afterwards he said the shop was going to be opened by his father-in-law—I saw him, and told him a gentleman had been to me, and said that his name was not Fisher, but Feiler, and he said "It is quite true, Fisher is my father-in-law's name," and he was going to carry on business there in Mr. Fisher's name.</p>

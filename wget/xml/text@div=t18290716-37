            . I am fourteen years of age, and am errand-boy to Mr. Mason. I had a paper parcel of magazines and books on the 29th of June, which I was to take to the Black Bull, Holborn; I had 2d. to book it with, and 2s. to pay the carriage - the prisoner came to me in <placeName id="t18290716-37-crimeloc214">Benjamin-street, Cow-cross</placeName>

               <p>"What is it?" he said 1s. 6d. - I said I had 2s., and I asked him if he had a sixpence; he said No, but he would get it in the public-house - as we were going in he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, that's right - 2s. for the carriage, and 2d. for the booking:" he then took it, and ran- I thought he was making haste with it - I went back to my master's, and the shop was shut up; I went home, and about nine o'clock one of Mr. Mason's porters came to me, and said the constables were waiting for me - I went and told them about it; I saw the prisoner on the Saturday week, in Bunhill-row watch-house - I am quite sure he is the man; there was a plain direction on the parcel, part of it, I believe, was printed; I do not exactly recollect how I carried the direction; I might carry it uppermost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What dress had I on when I came up to you? A. I did not exactly notice your dress, as I thought there was nothing the matter, but I believe you had a blue coat on - I believe I did say at the office that you had a blue coat on, and I am pretty well sure you had.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the 29th of June I was going up Brick-lane, in the evening, and saw the prisoner crossing Old-street-road; he went down a street leading to Baltic-street, and then down some back alleys to Ball-yard, where there is a stable - he went in there, and dropped this parcel; I went in and took him, but he resisted, and got away - I took the parcel, and found where it came from; I had known the prisoner before - he was taken the Friday week afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my father at 18, Hinton Street, Pimlico—I have for some little time past been engaged to be married to a Mr. Henry Newman, who assists his brother in a hosier's shop in Chapel Street, about opposite to the Castle public-house—no female lives in the house, and on that account I am in the habit of walking outside the shop and meeting him—this is with my father's knowledge and Mr. Newman's parents' too—on Wednesday, 18th October, I went to meet Mr. Newman as usual—it was 9.35 when I left home—I got into an omnibus at Victoria Station and rode to the Marylebone Road—I went to the end of the Marylebone Road into the Edgware Road, and walked to the corner of Chapel Street, where I stood quite still—I was standing on the path, near the Castle public-house, which is in Chapel Street—I had turned the corner, and was waiting for Mr. Newman—I had been standing there for about two minutes, and had not spoken to anyone since I left home—the prisoner came up in uniform and said "What do you want?" or "Move on;" I am not certain of the words—I told him I was waiting for a friend—he said "What are you? you are only a common prostitute"—I told him that he</p>

I am a baker, of 75, Crauford Street, and work for my brother—I am twenty-one years of age—about 10 o'clock on Wednesday night, 18th October, I was with my friend, William Arthur Bramhall, passing down Chapel Street towards home and the Marylebone Road—I saw a policeman in uniform and I also noticed two young men and a young woman on the Lisson Street side of the railway-station—Lisson Street intersects Chapel Street and goes into the Marylebone Road—there was no fighting between women going on at that time—I afterwards ascertained that the prisoner was the man my attention was directed to—the persons I noticed were standing still—I heard one of the young men say to the prisoner that he did not like such nasty snacks as that and they walked away on the opposite side of Lisson Street; the station end, away from the Marylebone Road—the prisoner went on the opposite side, following them down Lisson Street—in consequence of what I had observed I watched him narrowly from that moment—he returned on the opposite side into Chapel</p>

               <p>Street, towards the Marylebone Road—he had to cross the road—he walked on the pavement on the same side as the Castle public house, at the corner of the junction between Chapel Street and the Marylebone Road—there was no disturbance of any kind going on in the street at that time—up to that time, as far as I know, I had never seen Miss Brown in my life—I first noticed her standing on the kerb opposite the Castle, going the opposite side of the road on which Mr. Newman's shop is—there—were no women near her—the prisoner went up to her and began talking to her, and presently I heard her say "I will let you know who I am "—I did not hear what he said to her—she spoke in a very indignant manner—two or three people began to get round and some young man advised her to go away, and she was doing so—she had just turned into the Marylebone Road when the prisoner went behind her and caught her by the back of the neck forcing her along for about 10 yards with his hands—she screamed very loudly and I went up to the policeman and said "Don't handle the girl so roughly as that"—he would not let go so T. took hold of bis arm and pulled it off her neck—I did not notice her hat and shawl—more constables off duty came across the road and the prisoner said "Hold that man; he has struck me on the back of the neck"—I did not strike a blow from first to last—I was carried off to the police-station leaving Miss Brown in. the constable's hands—she was kept in the yard—nearly a quarter of an hour before she was put in the dock with me—Inspector Soriven was engaged with some other parties in the yard at the time—when I was in the dock with her I heard the Inspector ask the prisoner whose charge it was—he said that it was his—that she had been disorderly and fighting with another woman in Chapel Street, and that I had struck him on the back of the neck, knocking his helmet off—I was" locked up and was let out on bail ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after—I surrended the following morning before Mr. Mansfield and was put in the dock on the case coming on—I saw the prisoner go "into the witness box—he was sworn—he said that Miss Brown was disorderly and fighting another woman in Chapel Street, and that when he told her to move on she said she would bring a better man than him to do for him, or some such words as that, and that I had struck him on the back of the neck—I made my statement and Miss Brown hers—Mr. Bramhall was then called as a witness—I think Mr. Mansfield asked the prisoner where the other woman was—I was discharged—his statements that Miss Brown was disorderly and quarrelling or fighting with another woman and that I struck him were all untrue.</p>

I went to the police-station with them—the inspector asked me what I wanted, in the prisoner's hearing, and I said "I have come to see my friend righted "—he pointed to a chair and told me to sit down, in a very surly manner—I sat down as he told me—I had never seen Miss Brown before—I went to the police-court the next day and I gave my evidence as I have given it to-day, and the charge was dismissed—I heard the prisoner say in his evidence at the police-court that, Miss Brown was fighting and riotous and disorderly, with another woman, and that she said she would find a better man than him to fight him, and that Schwenck had struck him on. the back of the neck—none of which was true—I was not near enough to hear her say she would "find a better man "—I was under the impression then, that she said something about smacking his face as we walked by her—I do not know exactly what she said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Harris.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector D</hi>). On the evening in question I was on duty at the Marlborough Street police-station—at 10.20 Sarah Brown and Henry Schwenck were brought in by defendant, <hi rend="italic">D</hi> 171, and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> 141—he said he charged her with being disorderly and creating a disturbance in Chapel Street, and fighting with another woman—I asked him where the other woman was and he said she had got away. (<hi rend="italic">The witness deposition was read to him, and confirmed</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. Not a single word of complaint was made by either Miss Brown, Schwenck, or his friend Bramhall, of any ill-treatment on the part of the constable—I remember Schwenck's mother coming to bail him out; Bramhall was in my office—I said to him "It is a great pity that young men should go and get themselves into these disgraceful quarrels?"—he said "We have done nothing"—I said "What do you mean, done nothing? "and he said "The young woman did nothing, only threatened to slap the constable's face, and all Schwenck did was to give him a bit of a shove "—Chapel Street and all the neighbourhood is the worst part of Lon<lb></lb>don, infested with thieves and prostitutes—we have had numerous com<lb></lb>plaints from the railway people—the superintendent has gone there himself to see what is going on—I should say where this took place is about 60 yards from the railway-station, it may be more, but I question whether it is—we have also many complaints from the respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood as to disorderly persons assembling—it was not the prisoner's duty alone to prevent persons assembling, but every man's and they would have special instructions to do so—the clock struck 10 o'clock as I marched the seventy-five men out for relief—the prisoner was perfectly sober when he came into the station—a few minutes after 11 o'clock, after Schwenck had been released from custody on bail I went to see him again to satisfy myself that I was not mistaken; he had been nearly five years in the force and was a very quiet, harmless, and inoffensive, good-tempered man—the duties of a constable in that neighbourhood are very onerous and arduous to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner said "She tried to slap my face," so that Bramhall would have heard his statement before he said "All she had done was to threaten to slap the constable's face"—I have a knowledge of Rat<lb></lb>cliffe Highway and Fleur-de-Lis Street, and the Dusthole, Woolwich; I should say the whole neighbourhood was not worse than Fleur-de-Lis Street—I did not take Miss Brown for a disorderly prostitute, I never made that mistake—it is a shortened beat near the railway-station—he had no special instructions beyond what they all had doing duty in that particular street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 127, Seymour Place—on the night in question I was coming flown Chapel Street' from the Edgware Road about 9.50 or 9.49—I saw some women at the corner of Lisson Street apparently quarrelling with each other, pushing or striking each other, and using angry language; it was a street row—the prisoner went to the women and sepa<lb></lb>rated them; he then followed one towards the Edgware Road, and then returned, when I saw Miss Brown standing at the other side of the street—he went up to her and said "Now, miss, you must move on," pointing towards the Marylebone Road, desiring her to go the reverse way to the other woman—she said "I am waiting for a friend "—he said "I can't <hi rend="italic">help</hi> that, I am placed here to prevent women from loitering about"—she went on a little further and then turned round and said "I shan't go "—then she went a little further and gradually went on towards the bottom of the street and said "I shan't go, I am waiting for a better man-than you, who would soon make you take yourself off," and then she proceeded a little further towards the bottom of the street by a public-house there, I don't know the name—previously to her getting to the bottom of the street a young man said "You had better go, you will get into trouble, miss"—when she got to the bottom of the street opposite to the public-house she turned round and said "I shan't go any further for a thing of a policeman like you; I shall smack your face for you "—there were a number of persons about, twenty or thirty; I should call it a crowd—the prisoner then said "I must take you into custody," and he took hold of her left arm with his left hand and placed his right hand upon her shoulder—she screamed then—she attempted to fall down; she looked as though she was falling down—her hat slipped off, but what became of it I don't know—more people approached, hearing the screams—Mr. Schwenck then came up and said "Leave her alone; let her go "in a quick manner—the prisoner still kept hold of her and Schwenck struck the prisoner behind about here (<hi rend="italic">at the back of the head</hi>), which caused his helmet to fall off—another policeman came up and took Schwenck in custody—the police used no violence whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Besley. I could not have acted more gently my<lb></lb>self—he could not have spoken more quietly or nicely to her—from the time he said "Now, miss, you must move," I heard all—I swear I did not hear him say "You are a common prostitute "—I was not examined at the police-court—I read of this case last Sunday week—I am a voluntary witness—I sent to Mr. Berkeley, the solicitor, last Friday week—I know Schwenck—I read in the paper of Schwenck being charged on the 19th October—I saw him taken into custody—Mr. Berkeley is the first person to whom I stated I would give evidence—I hare not got a beer-shop—it is a beer-shop where I carry on business—sometimes policemen come into the beer-shop in uniform and have what they want—sometimes I see them—Miss Brown was in Chapel Street, the Edgware Road side of" Lisson Street, when the occurrence first took place—I cannot swear to Miss Brown individually</p>

               <p>—I did not take sufficient notice then—the woman I have been talking about is the one that was taken into custody—I mean Miss Brown—the person who was taken into custody on the Edgware Road side of Lisson Street was very much like Miss Brown, but I cannot swear to her being the same—she was in the crowd when she objected to move on—he separated the two women—I supposed it was Miss Brown I afterwards saw taken into custody—she had moved to the opposite corner when he said "Now, miss, you must move on"—he divided the women and followed one up the Edgware Road, and when he came back one of them (I suppose it was one of the same) was standing at the corner of Lisson Street—there are two corners to the street, and she moved to the opposite side—there is a wall this side and a tailor's the other, the name of Bishop—I swear that at the corner of Lisson Street, on the public-house side, there was a woman to whom he said "Now, miss, move on," and I kept her under observation; following within a few yards—I swear it was the same person who was taken into custody in Chapel Street—it might have been a dozen yards away from the corner of the Marylebone Road, or a yard or two more—it was opposite the public-house—I do not swear that Schwenck did not say "Don't treat the girl so roughly; she has done nothing"—I heard her say "Let me go; I have done nothing "—I did not see two young men and a young woman to whom the prisoner spoke, or hear one of them say to him in return "I don't like such nasty snacks as that," or see them go down Lisson Street and the prisoner following within a few yards—the police-court is in Seymour Place, three turnings off the beer-shop, perhaps 250 yards—the beer shop is not just opposite—it was kept by my wife's father, but he is dead—it was left to my wife by the executors, but the affairs are not settled yet—I had been to the City that night, and I came home by the underground railway to Chapel Street—I got in at King's Cross—I tried to find a friend of mine who lived in the neighbourhood—I went to see a friend in Gracechurch Street, an omnibus driver who I knew from a lad; one of Mr. Ball's omnibuses from Brixton—I went into one public-house at the corner of Eastcheap with this <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> driver, just before six o'clock—from there I went to Finsbury to try and find a friend—I proceeded through the City and called to see a friend of mine who lives in some large buildings I forget the name of, an umbrella maker—I went in there and spoke to him—I then went to King's Cross station and there saw another friend and had another glass of ale.</p>

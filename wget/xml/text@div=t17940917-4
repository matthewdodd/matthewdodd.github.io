               <p>Q. How far was it from London Bridge? - A good way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you saw the old woman before she brought you to a house? - About an hour.</p>

            How far did you walk with the old woman after you met her? - A little way, I was only a little while in going, but I don't know the place, because I am a stranger here; when we got into the public house, I looked about to give her a pint of beer, and she was off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this public house is situated? - I don't know, it was in the dark, and I was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you there? - There was a very good entertainment, there was one captain there said he was from Barbadoes, another from Jamaica, and another from Martinique, and some from Saint Le terre, which I took last war, and when I got in one of them said, will you have a glass of wine? and I said, I will have a pint of porter, I am tired of wine, and one of these captains said, will you sleep along with my mate, and I was walking to bed, and this pretended mate got up and shewed me into the room to bed, I know him very well if I was to see him, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170019"></xptr>says to him why don't you shew me the light, and as soon as they got me inside they locked the door on me, and it was all dark, and there were three bars at the window, I was used very cruel, I saw the bars at the window in the morning, and four or five padlocks on the door, that was a pity; I heard them open three or four of them in the morning. I will fight for my King and Country while I am able.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep there all night? - I did not sleep a wink, the next morning there were one of these jail keepers came up and opened the door, and asked me how I found myself? I asked for God's sake for some drink, some ale, he said he would give me some directly, and he kept me there till it was dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you staid there all the day? - I did, and in the middle of the next night they transported me to this place in Whitcomb-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any ale? - No, not a drop; the next night they came and threw me into a coach, there were about ten of them about me, they threw me in like a cat, and they used me very cruel; the coach drove on at the rate of three knots an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the ten go into the coach with you? - No, only two.</p>

               <p>Q. What discharge was that? - A discharge from the navy office that captain Roberts and Willoughby gave me; they afterwards threw me into a coach, and put the blinds up, and drove me away to the Banbury road.</p>

               <p>Q. You was telling my lord that you was put into a coach to go to Banbury. Why was you to go to Banbury? - I don't know, your honour, why I was to go there. I would go to sea to serve the king, if I was well, sooner than go to Banbury.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170020"></xptr>Q. Do you know of any paper presented to you before you was put into the coach? - They brought in a paper, and I was obliged to sign that paper or else die that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it in? - There, that very man.</p>
               <p>Q. You was put into a coach to go to Banbury? - I was, and they blinded the coach that I could see nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. The blinds of the coach were up? - Yes, I could not see no light, and they drove me away, and I take it the coach went about three knots an hour, about three miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you suppose they carried you in the coach? - They carried me a great way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take you out of London? - O, yes! a great way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose they were driving you that way? - About three or four hours. Then they threw me into a waggon, and the waggon carried me about fifteen miles. Indeed I cannot tell you all what they did. Afterwards when I could not walk and keep up with the party, they flogged me, and whipped me to make me go along.</p>
               <p>Q. What party do you mean? - The kidnapping party.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the party of kidnappers come from that house? - They had; they used me very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. They went with you all the way? - Yes, all the way to Banbury; I was obliged to go or die on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never was out of the kidnapping house in town, till you was put into that coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And after you was put into the coach, you went immediately to Banbury? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the persons were? - Very well I do, if I could see them all I would shew them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the persons were that went with you to Banbury? - There are none of them here, a party of kidnappers went with me, but they are not here now.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got to Banbury what next happened? - When I got to Banbury all the gentlemen took my part, the justices and all. I asked the quarter master, when I went down to Banbury, what sort of a man are you? Says he, I am a quarter master. When they carried me down to Banbury, they kept me in prison to transport me, and I would be in a good ship of war now, if they had let me alone; they wanted to make an East India soldier of an old sailor.</p>

            When you went down to Banbury, they kept you in prison to transport you? - Why what else were they going to do with me? Well, then the justice of peace at Banbury, and the Mayor and all the gentlemen there got up, and they took my part, and brought me up here again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they bring you? - With a coach; they brought me up very decent. Look here, see they knocked out half a tier of teeth. The man in the brown did that (Ruggles.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in Banbury after you got there? - I was three weeks there, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray are you at all certain whether it was in June or July that you got to town? - I don't know what time it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - I cannot say. They kept me three weeks in Banbury, and three weeks in town, and I was about eleven days coming up from Deal; I was too bad to get into a coach, and I did not keep any day or hour in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went before the Mayor of Banbury, and gave information of this? - Yes, he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you arrived at Banbury was it the Mayor took your examination? - The second night, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170021"></xptr>Q. Then the Mayor of Banbury, and gentlemen there, heard your complaint, and, I believe, they support you in this prosecution? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two persons at the bar, that you see now, are the two persons that you have described? - Indeed they are the two; I would not tell you a lie.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I say, my honest fellow, I want to have a few words with you? - I have spoke to my lord, the judge, and I cannot say any more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in Banbury before you told your story to the Mayor or justice? - Not long. They came to me soon, the gentlemen of the town did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Banbury you did not like to be looked upon as a soldier? - I am a sailor and not a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you did not like; then you told your story to the good people there, as much like as you have told here, but they insisted on it that you was a soldier, and when you came to Banbury, you found yourself as a soldier; and you thought that by your story you should get your discharge from the situation in which you found yourself? - They took away my discharge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Banbury, they wanted to tell you that you was a soldier there, and you did not like it, and you gave this story; they gave you countenance and protection there, and you thought that you should get out of their clutches? - Certainly; I cannot serve three kings at once.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people went to Banbury with you? - There was some poor old men that they kidnapped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a good large party? How many in number? - I don't know. There was a woman that saw the second robbery made on me of my buckles, but they transported her out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. How many marched into Banbury with you? - There were about twenty-eight on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of dress had you on at the time? - They put a blue jacket and a pair of trowsers on me, and I could not button them about my lame legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was in this miserable condition when you got out of the waggon? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any of these recruits with you in this waggon? - No, they were able to walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any recruits in the coach? - Yes, there were two thieves with me.</p>

            Neither of the two thieves at the bar? - No, these two gentlemen one, of them was agent in my time, and the other was landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now speaking when you went from their house in Whitcomb-street; There were two I believe with you in the coach, where they kidnappers? - Kidnappers! I would shew them to you if they were here.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down the road and then you was put into a waggon? - Yes, and then when I was out of the waggon, I was not able to walk, and when I got on the road one of these kidnappers came and took a faggot of prickles and whipped me on my legs. When the justice wrote up a letter to try whether my name was in the navy books, my name was open on the books, and whereof the colonel got a letter, and he wrote down a loving letter to me, that I should be cleared when he came down, in about five or six days, he came down to the Red Lyon, and when he came there he was not a minute there, and these people that were kidnapped all together about the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You said, that you never was out of the kidnapping house from the time that you came in, till the time that they put you in a coach to carry you to Banbury? - Never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170022"></xptr>Q. During the time who was in this room with you? - No, nobody but the jailer, and he left a pot of water with me and a bit of soul bread. I cannot think on it all, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. So you was in this room for a fortnight and nothing to live upon but bread and water, saw nobody hardly during that time? - No, only the turnkey.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they keep you in this room for? - Because I would not swear before a justice; that man used to bring up a pint of beer, and I used to ask the servant for a pint of beer, and I used to say, for God's sake, good woman, will you give me a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you never went before a justice? - No, only in Banbury, and justice Bond, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look towards the bench and see if you recollect the face of any person that fits there, just by my lord. (Justice Kirby stands up)? - No, I never saw the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went before him and altelted yourself? - There was a wooden handed justice came into that man's house in Whitcomb-street, he says, take this book into your hand, and I said, band me that book out of your starboard hand; and he handed it to me out of his larboard hand; and I said, I was as loyal a subject as any man, and I was knocked down by that man there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now to your best recollection you never saw that man there (pointing to justice Kirby)? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went before any magistrate, to be attested, in your sober senses? - Never in my days.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we will travel with you a little from the beginning of this system; how long had you been in Deal hospital? - About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you up from Deal? - I walked, I was afraid of going into a coach or waggon for fear of shaking my bones.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw in Deal a good many seafaring people there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you in London? - To come up for my money, that was due to me from the Inflexible.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have got the money at Deal? - I thought to have got my money and go into an hospital here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it since you had received any pay? - I did not receive any pay at all yet, I only got a note; I had not received any money for a great while before.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you when you left Deal? - I had three guineas in my pocket, captain Roberts gave me one guinea, and the admiral gave me another guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the captain give you the money when you went into the hospital? - No, when I came out captain Roberts gave me two guineas, and admiral Beaconfield I believe, or something like it, his fleet lies in the Downs, he gave me one guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the admiral's name that gave you the guinea? - Some cross name, I cannot think on his name.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no money till captain Roberts gave you the two guineas? - O! yes, I had money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you before? - I had only some silver in my pocket; when these people met me, I had about seven shillings and six-pence in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the silver? - Do you think my poor father had not sent me no money?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he send you the money to? - To Deal, from Ireland, he always sends me money, he sent me money in the American way.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170023"></xptr>Q. What age are you? - I believe I am about thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. When your poor father had sent you some money, what made you apply to captain Robert or the admiral? - captain Roberts was a good man, and knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father had contrived to send you money to Deal? - My father sent me money the last American war.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - He is a wine cooper.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you then when you came out of the Hospital that your father sent you? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get at it? - I got it from the man that brought the letter; he gave it me out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a bank note? - No, it was only three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to bring you the money? - This man came over passenger.</p>
               <p>Q. In what ship? - In the Mary brig.</p>
               <p>Q. And he found you out at Deal? - He did, because I had wrote to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the Mary brig come from? - From the City of Cork.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was a sailor from on board that ship that brought you this? - No, he was a landsman.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say this moment that he was a postman that brought you it with this letter? - He was all the same as a postman.</p>
               <p>Witness to Court. My lord judge, am I to answer this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What time was it you received these three guineas? - I was pretty sure I was all the same as a dead man, in the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was the money brought to you before you left the Hospital? - I was not above two days in the Hospital when the man came to me; I wrote from Portsmouth before I came to Deal.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know that the ship was going to Deal? - Because that was the place that we had got orders to steer to.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you wish us to be contented with that story, that you sent your letter to your father at Portsmouth, and two days after, when you arrived at Deal, this man brought you the money? - You want to confuse me. I wrote from Portsmouth, and was some time coming round Spithead.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, two days after you had been at the Hospital, you got three guineas, what became of that money? - Spent it; I spent all the money I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all this money gone before you applied to captain Roberts or the admiral? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had got a watch left, and a pair of silver buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to captain Roberts for two guineas, and the admiral for one? - Yes; and if admiral Barrington was here he would give me ten. I wish to God I could see him here!</p>
               <p>Q. So you set out with your watch and your silver buckles in your shoes? - Indeed I did; and a lady coming along, Sir Charles Everett's wife, on the road, said she would give me a lift in the coach; but I was afraid to get into it, I was afraid of the horses shaking me to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was that on the road? - I cannot tell; she told me she was Sir

            's wife. Would not any gentleman take a liking to a sailor, seeing me walk lame on the road. If I was in a ship, the ship would ride fair and easy; that would do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be on the road from Deal to London? - I was a good while; I could not walk above four miles, five or three miles a day; I was about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170024"></xptr>eleven days coming from Deal. I was bothered so much the last American war by the shot hurting my hearing, and this leg and thigh was condemned once to be cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not very deaf now? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk with any body on the road? - I did not ask any body any questions at all, only walked along till I came to London-bridge, there I saw an old woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to this old woman she was the first person that you spoke to about your journey. How came you to speak to her? - Because I thought she was a friendless woman, whom I could speak to. My good old mother, says I, can you tell me where I can get a lodging? she said, she could shew me a very pretty house.</p>
               <p>Q. This old witch had slown away when you came to this public house? - O, Yes! she was an old rogue; what did she bring me into that wicked house for? that was no honest lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. So this old woman took you to this place, and as soon as she had shewn you there, away she went? - And I thought to give her a pint of beer for it, and she flew away instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition was you in that night? - I had my stick in my hand and my seafaring clothes on.</p>

            Was you weak? - Shew me before a doctor, and I will tell the doctor how I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you surprised when you came into this house? - How do I know but you are a parcel of honest gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. So you never have recovered of this illness from that time to this? - No, I am afraid I never will. Is it not bad usage to use any sailor so, to make a sol dier of an old sailor?</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get this lameness? - This leg was hurt the last American war, it was splintered, and this other leg was hurt this war.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Honesty, you see I call you by a fair name? - I am an honest man for Old England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you halloo when you got into this place? - What use was my hallooing at the back settlements of a house, there was nobody would hear me, it was as good hold my tongue, it would be of no use. May the great God strike me dumb, deaf, and blind, if I was not asking in his(Kerr's) house two hours, before I got a pint of beer; that man used to take the drop of beer, and sling it into my face, and lock the door on me. Drat it all gentlemen, my life is nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the coach and came from the first house, did you make any hallooing then? - It was no use then.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew you was got into the hands of enemies? - Yes, they were worse than the French. Did not I do as well as I could? I hallooed as well as I could; there was nobody came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the door of the house in Whitcomb-street, you must have got out of the coach? - There were ten of them people about had hold of me as I came in, because I did not like to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. And then they kept you in this room for a fortnight, and you see nobody but this jailer? - There were three or four jailers used to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. In the situation in which you are now, you will certainly remember this question, during the time you was in Whitcomb-street, did any person come to examine you? - They had a surgeon of their own, and a wooden handed justice of their own.</p>

            Was there in fact then, during the the time of your staying in Whitcomb-street, any body in the character of a surgeon that examined you there? - I saw no surgeon; I saw a wooden handed justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him at the time how you had been used? - When I came to that wooden handed justice there, in the one pair of stairs, there was his starboard hand off, he had a billet of wood on, and he paid me with it about my breast very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any gentleman who examined you, as a surgeon? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Now tell me if whether you was ever attested in your serious moments, at a time that you had every opportunity of examining for yourself? - Never.</p>

               <p>Q. You made no complaint of any thing of this kind till you arrived at Banbury? - I did not, I saw nobody but a poor farmer on the road, and he would be knocked down if he came to take my part, he would be killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it cut your hair off? - The barber; he is not here; I see him at the outer door, and when he see me, he ran away. Gentlemen, it is a pity you don't see me rectified. I beg of my lord judge to shew me some lenity. You think better of them than you do of me, and that is a pity.</p>

Is it the usual way for the magistrate to see the person that comes to be attested? - As soon as they bring any one in to be attested, I take him immediately to the magistrate, and the magistrate asks him how long he has been enlisted, whether he has been enlisted twenty-four hours? and often examines them whether they are sober.

Did he appear to be lame at all? - No, he did not, he said he was foot foundered; I made him walk backwards and forwards in the tap room, to view him, and he did jump, and as he jumped one of his shoes came off, that was tied by a bit of cord, or rope yarn; I then said, my lad, if you are not ill, I will enlist you, I then took half a crown piece out of my pocket, and I put it into his hand, and I said, now my lad, you are free, willing and able to serve his Majesty, in the Birmingham volunteers, now laying at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, and I will make this up five guineas and a crown; he says, then by Jasus I will go to the bounds of b-gg-ry with you, I then gave him a supper, and a pint or two of porter.</p>

            Is it customary to have a man examined as to his state of body by a surgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the surgeon examined him? - I was not, I called two or three days afterwards and I saw him in a state of intoxication, not sit to go before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been attested before he went to the White Horse? - No, I believe it was six or seven days before we could get him sober enough to go before a magistrate; I then applied to Mr. Ruggles, and begged of Mr. Ruggles to let one of his servants keep him from drinking; he said he could not, for he would be down in the tap-room; Mr. Ruggles desired me to call early some morning, very likely then I might catch him sober; I called two or three days after that, and asked him if he would go and be attested? by Jasus, says he, let us have a drop of the creature first, I afterwards asked him what the creature was? and he said, sure man alive it is good whisky; I then took him to the magistrate's, before serjeant Kirby, and there he was attested; I then carried him home. and never see any thing more of him till this day.</p>
               <p>Mr. serjeant Kirby. Though I cannot swear to this man, yet I have a sloating idea of a man that I particularly examined whether he had been in the Navy, and I remember that the man that was so examined, gave me an account of his having been discharged, and I remember that that man did give an account of his being at an hospital, and ill for some time, and he pretended the circumstance of having had money of a captain or admiral, but he stated that he had been at Deal some time, and I remember the circumstance of his meeting an old woman, and he talked of going through a very old way, through Thames-street, to try to be enlisted; I have tried the best I could to bring the circumstance to my recollection since I have been in court; whether the witness remembers more than I can, I cannot tell, or whether it applies to that man, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Watson. When you went to him to the house of Kerr, and he was intoxicated, did he pretend that any ill usage had been given to him? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had been in the navy? - No, but I think since Mr. serjeant Kirby has mentioned it, he wanted to make some excuse.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is no uncommon thing when they have got the money, to want to get off? - No, when they have got eight or ten guineas, they will say they have been kidnapped.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you leave him in? - In the one pair of stairs, a very large room, and saw him sometimes in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the different recruits going off when they went to Banbury? - I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are a recruiting sergeant, and keep a public house? - I did not at that time, I have married the widow since.</p>
               <p>Barrett. This is one of the men that molested me along with these people there.</p>
               <p>Court to Barrett. Do you insist on it still that you never went before the magistrate at all? - I was obliged to sign that paper, or die that moment, and this very man pretended to be the justice of peace, and he struck me about with his wooden hand, and every stroke he gave me went to my heart.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you never went before the justice? - I never was, till I came before the justice of peace at Banbury.</p>

            ? - I believe so, I did not see him in bed, I left the house between ten and eleven o'clock, I don't live in the house, but close by, the man when I saw him the next morning, I searched him, to see whether he was found or not, and I approved of him, we always make it a rule when we enlist men to see that they are not ruptured, or any bruises on them; I found nothing but what I approved of.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he drest? - In an old brown jacket, like a sailor's jacket; the next morning when I searched him I gave him some clothes to put on, the morning after he had enlisted I think it was, I gave him some jackets and trowsers that I had to spare of Sir Thomas Dunlap's independent company.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of his old clothes? - He sold them to a shop keeper, who now lives at No. 16, East Smithfield, I don't rightly know his name, he is here, he has got the shirt that he bought of him with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his shoes? - I see every thing.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. How long did he remain in this house? - About three days, it was the evening when he came in, and I think he went away about eleven or twelve o'clock the third day, he went from there to the White Horse, Whitcomb-street.</p>

At the time that he was there, was he used well, and was he willing to be there? - Directly as he was passed I treated him with a shillingsworth of rum and water,! and gave him half a crown, and he was called in to Mr. Ruggles, to know what bounty he agreed for, and Mr. Ruggle paid him, I don't know what Mr. Ruggles paid him.</p>

               <p>Q. I want to know whether from the general state of intoxication in which he was in, and also from your observation of him, at different times, he did not appear to be deranged? - No, if he had not appeared very well to me, I should not have passed him, nor the doctor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When he is very drunk he is not in his senses? - No, I know I am not.</p>

               <p>Joel. I remember seeing Barrett at the Swan and Anchor in East Smithfield, the beginning of July, Mr. Inkingbottom came to my house, and said that he had a man that had enlisted, and came for me to come and buy his old clothes, I went, and saw him at the Swan and Anchor; I see him there, he brought down his clothes, a brown jacket, an old blue jacket and a check shirt, and a pair of trowsers, and a pair of old shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drest at that time in any military uniform? - He was drest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these shoes any buckles in them? - No, strings, he asked me half a guinea for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of strings were they? - I think they were yarn, I cannot say rightly; I told him they were not worth that money; then, says he, I will not sell them to you at all, except you call for half a pint of gin; I told him I would not buy them, they were too dear; says he, if you will call for half a pint of gin I will take less; with that I bought them of him for six shillings and half a pint of gin, and I gave him the money into his hand, and after I paid him for them I left two of the garments behind me, they were not worth taking away, I took nothing away but the brown jacket and his check shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look how he was drest? Had he any buckles in his shoes that he had on? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any watch? - No, I think not, I will tell you why I can say so, I had a very handsome chain hanging to my watch, and he took notice of it, says he, I will buy it of you if you will wait till I get my bounty; says I, it is not worth my while to go after you.</p>
               <p>Court to Joel. Shew Barrett the shirt.</p>
               <p>Barrett. May the great God strike me dead if ever I wore that shirt, or ever saw it before.</p>

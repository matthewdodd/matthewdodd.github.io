               <p>- BEVAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a breeches-maker, and live at the corner of Beachey-street, near Mr. Murphy's house; I can see his house when I stand at my own door.</p>
               <p>Was you at home when the mob came to Mr. Murphy's? - I was; they came between six and seven o'clock, on Wednesday the 8th of June, there was a very great number of them; they filled all the street which was within my sight.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner at the bar there? - When I heard the glass fly I went to the door and looked up, there were a number of people in the street. I looked up to the windows of the one-pair-of-stairs and to the top of the house; the prisoner was at the one-pair-of-stairs window with a piece of wood breaking the window frames; after the window frames were broke and thrown out, I saw him in the room assisting in throwing some things out, but I cannot say in particular what.</p>
               <p>What became of the window frames after they were broken? - They were thrown out into the street; after that there was a cart, which the mob had pressed, brought into <placeName id="t17800628-39-crimeloc201">Golden-lane</placeName>

               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - Yes. I knew him very well by living in that neighbourhood with him; I took notice of him particularly; my house was threatened by the mob as they came backwards and forwards. I took particular notice of those I knew, that I might intercede with them to be favourable to me. The prisoner came to my door. I spoke to him in particular. I said, Waters, you have known me a great while, do not be so cruel as to break my windows and let the mob come in. He did me a great deal of service, for he kept them off from coming into my door, while they were examining my books, and he saved my windows from being broke; after the mob were gone away, they gave me three huzza's, and I was obliged to shake hands with them.</p>
               <p>Court. I take it for granted you gave no information against the prisoner? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>The whole front of the house was pulled down, was it not? - It was.</p>

               <p>The mob came to Mr. Murphy's house? - I went away very well satisfied. They crossed the way; some went into Mrs. Clark's, some went past. The prisoner went past Mrs. Clark's door. She beckoned to them and the prisoner came back to her. She begged they would come back for Mr. Murphy's was a

               <p>In what manner did they get into the house? - They went in, the door being open; the rest all followed. They immediately began breaking the tap-room; they pulled the bar down and began directly to demolish the house.</p>

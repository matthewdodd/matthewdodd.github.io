                  </hi>. I live at 7, Egerton-terrace, Stratford—on Saturday, 30th August, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was walking up Stratford-grove, and in consequence of a question put to me by a gentleman passing T felt to see if my handkerchief was safe, and found it was gone—the stout prisoner was pointed out to me (Hall)—I think they were both in company—I crossed the road to him—I said, "Young man, I want you," and he ran away at full speed—they both ran in the same direction—I called out, "Stop thief"—I did not see either of them stopped; I met them coming back—they were brought back to me almost immediately.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hall. Q.</hi> Did you see me take your handkerchief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was picked up shortly afterwards, and given to me; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Harris, of Stratford—on Saturday, 30th August, I saw Mr. Cobham coming along the Broadway—I saw Reeves behind him—the prosecutor was leaning on a lady's arm—as he came along Beeves stooped down, and when he rose again he had a handkerchief in his hand—I turned round to Mr. Cobham and told him he had lost his hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I did not see Hall during this time, not till afterwards; he was standing on the other side of the church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hall.</hi> This gentleman said first that I stole the handkerchief. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Oh, no, it was Reeves, and I said so at first.</p>

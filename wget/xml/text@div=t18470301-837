                  </hi>. I am independent, and recently resided at Albert Villa, Finchley. I am now in the Queen's Bench prison—I was arrested for some debts on my return from examination before the Magistrate in this case—on the 26th of Jan. I was stopping at Drummond's Hotel, Euston-square—about that time I received 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Robarts and co.'s the bankers—there was one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and four 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—a person of the name of Last, was stopping with me at the hotel—he is my cousin and brother-in<lb></lb>law as well—we left the hotel about four or five o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th Jan.—I put the money in a pocket-book, and placed the pocket-book in my left boot—Mr. Last saw me put it there—I wore straps, and my trowsers fitted rather tight—it was impossible the pocket-book could get out—we got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and drove to the North and South American Coffee-house, where we dined—we left there, and after going to various places, arrived at the Catherine-wheel public-house, in the Borough on the morning of the 27th—at about five o'clock a policeman rang the bell for us there—the prisoner came to the door, we asked for beds, and were told there was only one to spare, and we consented both to occupy one bed—we went to the bedroom—the bed stood so that the door of the room was almost opposite the left hand corner of the bed—I placed myself at the foot of the bed—Last went over to the other side of the room—I was sitting at the extreme left hand corner of the bed—at the foot of the bed, opposite the door, and about a yard from the door—the door was about one yard from the left hand corner of the bed—Last was over at the other side of the bed, near the head of the bed on the other side of the room—I was at the foot on the left hand side, and he was at the head at the right hand side—he sat down on the bed at the head, with his back towards me—it was a four-post bedstead, of the ordinary size—the prisoner was there—I sat down on the bed taking my boots off—the prisoner pulled Mr. Last's boots off, I do not know whether I was sitting or standing at that time—I sat down, and put my left hand down on my trowsers, pressing on the boot to push the towards down, in order to undo the straps—in doing so I felt the pocket-book—I pressed on the pocket-book in my boot—finding the strap dirty, I turned to the prisoner and asked him to undo it for me—he undid the strap—Mr. Last was still sitting on the bed at the head, on the right hand side—the prisoner undid my strap, and partly pulled the boot off—in consequence of its being tight, I made the remark, "I think I could get it off better myself"—I kicked it off with the other foot by pressing the toe of the other boot against the heel of my left boot—the prisoner then stopped down—I do not know whether he took the boot or not—he then made the remark, "I must go down to lock my gates"—he went down stairs, lea<lb></lb>ving me with one boot on and one boot off—he returned in three or four minutes—he then undid the other strap, and pulled off the other boot—the whole time the prisoner was absent my brother-in-law was on the other side of the room—he did not move to my knowledge—he did not come to the foot of the bed—he kept at the other side of the room—to the best of my knowledge I think he was sitting the whole time—the prisoner took up my boot or boots, and I said, "Stop, bring those boots back, I have a pocket-book in one of them"—he brought my boots and I turned them</p>

               <p>over, and put my hand into them—I found the pocket-book was gone—I said, "Just come inside, I have lost a pocket-book with 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the door was open—he was partly in and partly out—he came in, and I closed the door—he said, "Do you mean to accuse me of robbing you? I have not got it."—I said, "I mean to accuse you of nothing, I have lost my pocket-book, and only wish to find it"—he threw open his jacket, took one or two things from his jacket pocket, a bunch of keys and a handkerchief, making the re<lb></lb>mark, "You may search me"—I lifted his cap from his head, but did not seach him any further—on my going nearer to him he said "Keep your hands off me; do not be after putting anything into my pockets"—we searched at the bottom of the bedstead, where it would have been if it had fallen out of my boot, and also round about the room—I searched myself—he was close to me—we did not entirely search the room till Mr. Gander came—the book not being found I said to the prisoner, "I shall have a policeman"—he said he should call his master. he would not be treated in that way—we went to Mr. Gander, the landlord's room, the prisoner, my brother-in-law, and my<lb></lb>self—the prisoner went partly through the door, which is a kind of small place adjoining the room—it is a small room, closet, or passage, the Prisoner went in and spoke to Mr. Grander—I did not hear what he said—Mr. Gander came out after a little time—he came round to the room where I had my boots pulled off—he said he would not have any disturbance made in his house—he was perfectly satisfied with the honesty of his servant, to which I replied, "I am not satisfied, I have lost 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I must have a police<lb></lb>man; I will have the house searched but what I will have my money found"—Mr. Gander appeared perfectly satisfied, and the only remark he made was, "I do not believe you ever had the money to lose"—he said he was satisfied I had not lost it there, and that his servant had not got it—he said he would have no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in his house—I wished to have the police called, and asked him for the key to get out—he or his servant had the key of the gate that leads into the street—I asked Mr. Gander for the key to get out—he replied it was not his place to open the door—he told the prisoner to leave the room, and go and call another person up—he did not go—that was after I had accused the prisoner of the robbery—I went down to the yard and to the gates, but could not open them—I then went back to the room—the prisoner, my brother-in-law, and I think, Mr. Gander and myself went—the prisoner finally opened the gates and let me out—I think full a quarter of an hour had elapsed since I asked to be let out to get a policeman—I went out and got Hall—he returned with me—by his desire I went out again, leaving him there, and fetched two more policemen, and returned with them and searched the room and gallery—one of the policemen went into Mr. Gander's room—he allowed him to do so—we searched the yard and different carts there and found nothing—the prisoner was in the yard—I said to him, "Now, if you will restore me my pocket-book I will give you ten sovereigns and ask you nothing"—he made some exclamation, <hi rend="italic">puff</hi>, or some word of the sort—no person was searched to my knowledge—I heard nothing said about search<lb></lb>ing, with the exception of the prisoner offering to let me search him—in the room, but saying "Keep your hands off." When I went towards him—no person was searched after the policemen came—nothing was said about it, to the best of my memory—we then went to the station, my brother-in-law, the prisoner, the three policemen, and myself—I and my brother-in-law walked together the greater part of the way—it is my impression that we were in front the whole way, but the policeman says not—I do not know the place where the pocket-book is said to have been found—I believe we did pass Adam's-place' as it has been described to me, but I do not know it myself—we were walk<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>next the road, near the curb—the prisoner was walking next the shops—he was near the shops, the policemen next, Last and myself outside—we did not walk in a row—I cannot say what the width of the pavement is—either Last or myself was on the outside—on the way the prisoner expressed a wish to have coffee two or three times, saying he was thirsty, but he did not—he was searched at the station, and my brother-in-law and myself also, at the request of Mr. Gander—nothing was found.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What age are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was twenty-tree last July—when I left Drummond's Hotel I went into the City to dine at the North and South American Coffee-house—I went into the City on business with my brother-in-law—I went to two or three places, to Wil<lb></lb>lis's, the Queen's Head public-house, in Newgate-street, to get some sweep<lb></lb>stake tickets—I had dined before I went there—I also wanted to find a Mr. Abbott, who owed me money—I do not know where I went first—I went to one wine and supper-room and one coffee-shop, and to some public-houses—it might be four or five, or five or six places—I do not know how many I drank at—it is most likely that I drank wine and spirits that afternoon, but I do not know how many times—I cannot say whether I went to a dozen public-houses, and drank at a dozen public-houses—I was out twelve hours—I went to the dining-rooms at a quarter to seven—I do not think that I had a dozen glasses of spirits and water that night besides wine—I was perfectly sober—I forget the places I went to after the lapse of time—I was not inebriated—I forget the number of <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> I had that evening—there were a great many things pressing on my mind—I do not know how much I paid for <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> that night—I know the man demanded a great deal more than was right, and I paid him more than his fare—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which took us to the Catherine-wheel, we took, I think, in Oxford-street, I will not swear that—I do know where I went to first—I do not think I drank with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man—I will not swear I did not—I very often treat the <hi rend="italic">cabmen</hi>, if it is late at night—I think we took the last <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about one o'clock—we arrived at the Catherine-wheel about five—I had been to two or three public-houses; to one in the Haymarket, and one just round the corner of the Haymarket—I do not know their names—I do not think that I went to as many as seven public-houses in the last <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, but I cannot tell you—it is very likely I had some supper—I had been going about all night after a person who owed me money—I had slept at the Catherine-wheel before, and knew the house, and knew I should most likely get a bed there—I do not always know where to get a bed at that hour in the morning—I was sleepy, and glad to get to bed—I do not know where we were when I told the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to drive there—I went there because I thought it the most likely place to get a bed at—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> drove there, and a policeman rang the bell for us; either I, or the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>, or my brother-in<lb></lb>law, asked him to do so—I do not know the size of the bed-room exactly—it was not a large room—I cannot say the size.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, when the policeman came, tell him it was no use search<lb></lb>ing the prisoner; that you were satisfied he had not got the pocket-book about him, that you had searched him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said I had searched him—I said I thought he had not got it about him, because he had been down stairs—I did not put my hands into his pockets; he would not allow me to do so—I did not tell two policemen, James Hall and John Carter, that it was no use searching the prisoner, for he had been searched, and I was satisfied he had not got it about him—I did not put my hand into his jacket or waistcoat pocket—I did not turn out his trowsers' pocket—the prisoner was admitted to bail by the Magistrate, and has been at liberty ever since.</p>

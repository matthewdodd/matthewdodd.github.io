                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant K</hi> 29). About 1.45 on the morning of 6th January I was in Butcher's Row, Ratcliffe, and was passing Mr. Steam's coffee-shop, I saw a piece of paper up against the shop window, which was broken, about 3 feet from the pavement, and saw the paper move, and went up and found the prisoner standing on a form inside fixing the paper and a board up to the broken pane—I said "What are you doing there?—he said "I live here"—I said "I don't think you do"—he said "Oh, yes, I do"—I said "How long have you lived here?—he said "Three years"—I said "Are you the landlord?"—he said "Yes"—I asked him how the window was broken—he said in a fight on the previous night—Moon, 281, came up, and I asked him if he knew the man inside—he said "No"—I directed him to go round to the side door, to see if he could call the landlord up—as soon as Moon turned the corner, the prisoner broke about 3 inches of the glass and jumped out of the window—I seized him and detained him—the landlord came down when he heard the glass break, and the prisoner was given in charge—I went inside and found the shutter, which is partly a screen inside, had been broken away, and the glass was strewed over the floor inside.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps this coffee-shop in Ratcliffe—I went to bed about 1.15, leaving everything safe—at 1.45 I heard a noise and ran down stairs, and found a man in the shop, near the window—just as I got into the shop he bolted out of the window into the policeman's arms—I know nothing about the prisoner—I undid the door and let the sergeant in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have not been in England many weeks—I met a fellow-countryman, and he took me round about London, and he took me to several public-houses and gave me some beer, which I have not been accustomed to, and I got rather more than I ought to have had, not being accustomed to English beer—I remained at his house until about 1 o'clock</p>

               <p>in the morning, and then he told me to go as straight as I could go and I should get right to the London Docks—I did not know what I was about, and thinking this was an empty house, I did what I did, and went in there and the police saw me there.</p>

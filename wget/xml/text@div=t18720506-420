Hill &amp; Sanderson, on Sunday morning—it was on Saturday that I unloaded—I don't know the day of the month—I received the receipt from the mate at 11 o'clock on Saturday night—although the receipt is for 340 casks, I do not myself know how many were actually delivered, because I had to leave to come to the foreman to get a receipt, as I had none.</p>

Hill &amp; Sanderson—they carry on business at 25, Minoing Lane—I saw Mr. Hill—I told him the nature of my visit, in reference to these casks, that they had been short shipped, sixteen, by the <hi rend="italic">Parana,</hi> that I was mate of the ship—I told him what voyage it was—he referred to a book, and looked back at the date and found an entry there (<hi rend="italic">a book was here produced</hi>)—I saw the entry—I believe this to be the same entry, with the exception of this at the bottom; that I am not certain about—it is "Receipt for 340 and remainder 24 ditto, shipped by <hi rend="italic">Stetson</hi>"—I don't remember that addition at the bottom—I can't say whose handwriting that is—I told Mr. Hill that I was very sorry it had taken place, for I should certainly have to pay for them, or else lose my situation—he told me he was very sorry, but he could not help me in any way whatever—that was all the con<lb></lb>versation I had with him—he mentioned nothing about the South Devon Wharf (<hi rend="italic">Entry read</hi>: "Ex. <hi rend="italic">C.

I was first asked to give evidence in this case somewhere about December, I think—I am not positive about the first time I was required to give evidence, I was questioned about the casks in November, when I returned—when I got this answer from Mr. Hill, I went to the office and explained it to them—I was first examined as a witness at the Mansion House, some time last month, I think about the 6th—at the time I signed for the 340 casks the barge was quite empty, that I am sure of; there was nothing left in the barge—I struck out "364" in the receipt and wrote "340" in words as well as in figures—this "340 casks of soda, J. Spurring," is my writing, that was written at the time they were taken in—I believe these crosses across these two figures were there as they are now, but I don't know for certain—I don't believe I struck them out myself—I looked to the second mate or the quartermaster to tell me what the proper tally was; there are both abroad—it is the ordinary course at the water-side if there are any in dispute to sign the receipt, and say so many in dispute—I did not do that, because the lighterman was so positive—he had taken them out of the ship and tallied them into the barge himself, and I had not time to count them over—I wished to sign in that way—I told the lighterman I would sign for them in dispute—but he would not have it that way, he was so positive they were in the ship—a mate does not always do what the lighterman wishes, certainly, but in this case it was on account of his being so positive—in the hurry of shipment we are often obliged to trust to others—I don't know whether the dispute I had was with either of the lightermen who have been examined to-day—I could not recognise the man again if I saw him—I have seen the two Slacks, but I could not tell which presented me with the note; I will not swear it was either—I saw the marks at New York—the deficiency was in the "A K," I don't believe it was in the "B T;" it was in the "A K;" I would not swear to it; I am almost positive it was in the "A K," the others all turned out right; it was the "A K" that was sixteen short; it was not in the "BT;" I am certain positive it was not; I would not swear it, but I know very well it was not in the "B T"—I don't know anybody of the name of Cock—besides the sixteen casks there was no other part of my cargo short, that I am aware of, which ought to have gone by me, and which went by the <hi rend="italic">Stetson</hi>—I am not aware that 175 that ought to have gone by me went by the <hi rend="italic">Stetson</hi>—the only things short of delivery were the sixteen—I have no idea that any part of the cargo that ought to have gone by me went by the <hi rend="italic">Stetson</hi> instead—I am not aware that there is anyone here who can tell you—when Mr. Hill showed me the book at his office he did not ask me what the marks were, nor did I tell him that I did not know—I told him there were sixteen short; I did not refer to marks, neither did he—he did not tell me to go to my broker's and find out the marks—I will distinctly pledge my oath that nothing of the sort passed between us—I was told the marks at the time of the discharge at New York, "A K"—I had no note when I was at Mr. Hill's, of what the marks were, only my memory—I won't swear that I did mention the marks, and I won't swear that I did not—I do not remember any reference being made to my broker—there was no reference whatever made to the broker—only Mr. Hill and myself were present, there was no one else in the office—the conversation did not last more than five minutes, five to seven minutes perhaps—I did not notice the time—it was in the afternoon, after 12 o'clock, I think; it may have been before 12 o'clock, I can't say—there were</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Smith, Sandihurst &amp; Co., ship<lb></lb>brokers, 33, Gracechurch Street—they were brokers for Messrs. Malcolmson to the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi>—on 18th September last, I saw the mate's receipt (marked "A") for 340 casks of soda—I have a copy of the marks from the bill of lading—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge on 10th November, I went to the defendant's office in Mincing Lane—I there saw Mr. Sanderson—I said we had received advice from New York that a cer<lb></lb>tain number of casks had been short delivered—I had the letter with me that stated the number of casks, and I read from the letter that there was a certain number of casks short at New York by the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi>—I said that we had not been able to discover what had become of those casks, and as I believed they were the lightermen I should feel obliged if they would give me information about them—he referred to a book, and I went into the inside office, and he said all he could tell me was that they gave a clean receipt to the Newcastle steamer (that is, they had given a receipt for a certain number of casks, and that they were in good order), and they had received a clean receipt from the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi>—that was all he could tell me about it—I said it was rather an unfortunate thing for the mate; as we had not been able to trace anything about it, he would have to pay for them—that was all that passed—the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi> returned to England some little time afterwards, and I wrote to the mate to go and see Hill &amp; Sanderson's—I heard nothing more about the matter until January this year—on 26th January a man named Hall called at our office and gave me certain information, in consequence of which I saw Mr. Robinson, the agent for the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi>—I went to South Devon wharf, and afterwards to Mr. Bumstead's office—on 30th January I received this memorandum from the defendants. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Memorandum, 30th January, 1872, from Hill &amp; Sanderson, licensed lightermen, to Messrs. Smith, Sandihurst &amp; Co., Gracechurch Street is the mate of the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi> in town, as we wish to see him about some casks of soda he was short in September last; he came up here about it, and we promised to see after it, and have now discovered the error. H &amp; S.") On the same day that I received that memorandum I called at the defendants' office and saw them both—I had this memorandum in my hand—I said that I had called about that memorandum that they had sent us that day, and I asked them if they could tell me how the error had occurred—I can't say which of them spoke—I rather think I commenced the conversation with Mr. Sanderson—I think he replied to the first ques<lb></lb>tion—he said that they were shipping other sodas at the time, the barges that contained the soda going to the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi> had likewise sodas that were going to the <hi rend="italic">J. E. Stetson</hi>—I asked where the <hi rend="italic">J. E. Stetson</hi> was loaded, and one of them, I can't say which, said at Millwall Dock—I said that I presumed, after they had delivered the sodas for the <hi rend="italic">Stetson</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi> on board each of the respective boats, that the craft would have been empty—they said "No; we were acting as agents at the time, and there</p>

               <p>was some for landing"—I said "Where was it landed?" and, after some hesitation, they said it was landed at South Devon Wharf—I said "Who bought it?"—they said part of it had been bought by Chester &amp; Holland—I did not ask any question about the other part—they said that the sixteen casks had been sold, and had realised about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I should report the conversation to Mr. Robinson, and they said they would send us on an in<lb></lb>voice and a cheque for the amount whenever we liked, that is, for the sixteen casks—during the whole of the conversation the name of Bumstead was not mentioned to me—I reported the matter to Mr. Robinson.</p>

Malcolmson are not here, to my knowledge—F. W. Cock was the shipper of the soda—he is in London—I have seen him here to-day—I don't know to whom the soda was consigned at New York—all I know is, there was a claim made at New York.</p>

I am a lighterman, of 3, Elizabeth Place, Roman Road, Rotherhithe—in September last I was in the employment of Hill &amp; Sanderson, as foreman lighterman—it was my duty to give instruc<lb></lb>tions to the lightermen—I remember the lightering of the soda from the <hi rend="italic">C.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am baliff to Messrs. Jupp, and live on Norwood-green—the prisoner was employed with two others in unloading manure on Wednesday, the 28th of September—they came again on Thursday, between ten and twelve o'clock in the morning, and went away again down Norwood-lane, in the direction of their homes—I looked after them—they separated—two of them turned into the foot path—the prisoner went in the direction where some turkeys were, within about forty yards of them—I am sure he parted from the other two—I then lost sight of him—soon after I went in the direction he had gone—I saw some turkeys there—the prisoner was then gone, but I saw him again in about ten minutes, following his brothers—I then found some feathers, which appeared to have come from the turkey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Gould. I had some turkeys safe, I counted them on the evening of Wednesday, the 28th of September—I missed one about one o'clock on Thursday—I went into Norwood-lane, and found a quantity of feathers lying there—they had the same ap<lb></lb>pearance as the feathers of my bird—I afterwards saw the head, neck, and legs—I am quite sure they belonged to my bird.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion I went to the prisoner's house, at Roxworth, near Harrow, several miles from where the turkey was stolen, on the 29th of September, and found the head, legs, and neck of a turkey—I went into a closet adjoining the bed-room, and found a quantity of feathers in a basket, and some en<lb></lb>trails, and a quantity of congealed blood, in a dust-hole—the feathers were partly burnt—these are some of the feathers from Norwood-lane, and they correspond with the others.</p>

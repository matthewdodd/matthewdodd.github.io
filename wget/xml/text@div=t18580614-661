I was the last up in the house, on the night of 27th May—I went to bed at a quarter before 11 o'clock—the house was then shut up safe—the back parlour window has not been fastened for two years, but it was closed; it has always been closed—about ten minutes before 7 o'clock, the next morning, I was called up by the police—I found that window open, and missed this cruet stand and these cloaks—they were safe the night before.</p>

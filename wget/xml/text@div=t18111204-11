The prisoner pushed his arm against mine, and took from my fob my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not under any alarm at the moment, were you - A. I was not, until I felt the watch going. I clapped my left hand down, it was gone; I caught the prisoner by the collar of his coat, he asked what I did that for; I saw some men behind him, they did not come up; I said you have robbed me of my watch: he then struck me on the eye; I then tried to secure him, he struck me in the mouth; I had hold of his collar, and then I took hold of the skirt of his coat, and the coat rent up the back to the collar; I then got the other part of the skirt, but he turned his head towards me, and slipped his arms out of the coat. When he escaped from me I halloaed stop thief, my eye and mouth were very much bruised; my mouth bled very much; I saw him run straight down Clerkenwell Green; I did not follow him.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you see any thing of the two men - A. Not when the prisoner escaped it was dark. I saw no more of the prisoner until I saw him in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after - A. About ten minutes. because we searched for the watch; we found the case, not the watch; I was informed the prisoner was taken, I went in the watchhouse and saw him, I knew him; I said, that is the man that robbed me. The prisoner at that time had no coat or hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came to lose his hat - A. My hat was knocked off in the scuffle, also I found the case of my watch close by where I was robbed, it was picked up and given into my hand. I have never got the watch again or the seals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Whoever this person was you had lost the watch before the blows were given - A. Yes.</p>

            . I was in Clerkenwell Green coming out of the Crown Tavern about five minutes after twelve. On my coming out I heard a faint voice from Aylesbury-street crying stop thief, it being very dark, and the place very wide I got into the centre of the green as fast as I could; I saw a person running towards me on the flag way opposite me, this person had neither hat or coat that I perceived running I ran across to stop him; I missed him. I had this cane in my hand, I threw my cane after him and lost the head; a thought came into my mind that the person who was running away without his coat and hat was running away in consequence of a fight; that was my conjecture. I got my cane, and was proceeding home; on going into Aylesbury-street I saw Mr. Abrahams without his hat; I asked him if he was robbed; he told me he was by the person that ran down the green. I immediately called to the watch for a light. When the light came I found two hats, also a coat, it lay close to my feet; the first hat I picked up; I announced it. Mr. Abrahams said, there is a particular name in my hat; that was his hat; I picked up the other hat. I accompanied the watchman who carried the coat and hat to the watchhouse, the prisoner said he was fighting in Aylesbury-street, and that was his coat, and hat, and hoped to get it; it being a cold night the constable gave it him. The prisoner was afterwards searched, there were four or five handkerchiefs found stuffed in his breeches.</p>

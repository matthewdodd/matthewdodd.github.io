I was reaching down a neck of mutton. I cast my eye down, and saw my apron was removed from my pocket-apron. I was very much frighted. I laid hold of the prisoner's arm, and asked him what he had been doing? He said, he had been doing nothing. He told me his master was coming to buy some meat of me. I asked his master's name, he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120007"></xptr> it was Isaac, and some other name I cannot remember. I looked in my pocket, and mist a canvas bag, with the money laid in the indictment in it. (Mentioning the pieces.) I still held the boy, while a neighbour came to assist me. I said, I had lost a canvas bag, and fifteen or sixteen pounds in it. We took the boy into the shop and searched him, and found the bag, with the money in it, concealed betwixt his legs.</p>

            . I live in Goodmans-fields. The prisoners happened to come into the street where I live with some coals; I wanted them to carry three boxes, a bundle, and a portmanteau, (in the last were the goods lost) to <placeName id="t17511016-51-crimeloc235">the water side at alderman Parsons's wharff</placeName>

My wife gave them a shilling; they wanted a pot of beer: I went to call a waterman; they drove the cart away with my portmanteau and the goods mentioned in it, not knowing who they belonged to. I went back to the place where they brought the coals; I found their master lived near the Hermitage, and found them also next morning coming to work; I got a constable, and took them up. They denied it; I never heard of the things since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hill. On Saturday evening, 6th November, I was in Eyre-street, Woolwich, at a little after 11 o'clock—that is where the butchers' shops are—I felt a hand in my pocket, and put my hand and caught hold of the prisoner's arm while his hand was in my pocket taking the money out—as he drew his hand away something fell from it in the street—I called the police, and Mr. Frazer picked up two half-crowns and gave me—I had bad about 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I had just received six half-crowns at a shoemaker's shop—I had nothing left in my pocket—I said to the prisoner "Give me my money," and he put 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my hand—I am about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Eyre-street, Woolwich, on this night about 11 o'clock—I saw a conflict between the prisoner and prosecutrix—I picked up two half crowns and gave them to the prosecutrix—she had not hold of the prisoner at that time—he had been taken in custody and was on his road to the station—I believe she had hold of him when I heard them fell—I did not lay hold of him—I was not before the Magistrate; a policeman subpœnaed me—I had not given my name to him—I live at 46, Montague-place, Woolwich.</p>

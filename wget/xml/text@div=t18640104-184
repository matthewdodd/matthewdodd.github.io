                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the van department of Alfred Waterhouse, who carries on business in the name of Dakin—the prisoner was in his employment for four years—his duties were to start of a morning with a way-bill of the goods, to deliver them, and receive money, which he was to pay on the following morning—a way-bill is delivered to him with the names of the customers—it was his duty to pay me the money he received from agents, but not what he received on the way-bill—these receipts are in his writing—he has not paid me these moneys—I produce the way-bill of 26th September, 1863; there is no entry in it of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, received from Burnard—it would be the prisoner's duty to enter it on the back of this way-bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what class of customers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All way-bill customers are already on the way-bill; it contains the names and the amount due—the money received from persons, whose names do not appear on the way-bill, account customers, is entered on the way-bill at the bottom of the amount, after the total—all those on the face of the way-bill pay on delivery.</p>

               <p>in hand; he only had to show bad debts every three months, and part of them were deducted from his salary—he was allowed latterly 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, from which was deducted 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to make up for bad debts or accidents; and if at the settlement at the end of three months, any bad debts or accidents appeared, half of it was taken out of that fund—supposing it amounted to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he would lose 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; if to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would lose 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the firm loses half, and he loses half, which comes out of the fund of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—with that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had to keep his own "owings;" if he had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out upon any bill, he had that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so that he should pay the whole amount in—the contents of the way-bill were debited to him, and he was obliged to pay them, whether he got them or not—that is what I call working the van—the amount that he did not receive was paid in out of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if his customers took any credit, they would pay him, and he would show the amount he received in the book—they were charged in the book to his debit—he was not required to pay interest on that amount—if he took the goods out in the van and received the money at the time, he would not deduct discount from the customers' accounts; only for agents, and they have nothing whatever to do with the way-bill—if he received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for an account, which had previously been 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he would not have to pay in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., only the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no van man has ever been charged with interest in that way—no claim is made <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the men for interest, if they do not pay in money on Saturday, nothing of the kind, under any circumstances—the prisoner left on 10th October—I did not ask him about the amount he had received from agents, nor did he say that he could not pay me the whole amount, as the prosecutor had not paid him his wages—I saw his wages paid to him—I did not see them paid; Mr. Miller was the person to pay them—I do not remember the prisoner saying anything about his wages not having been paid—I do not remember his coming to me on the 17th, he having left on the 10th, and asking me if I would settle with him, and receive the amounts he had in hand, or that I saw him at all—I did not say to him, "No, I have entered it as owing by you, and it must be paid by your sureties"—I never in any instance remember his coming to me and offering to pay me money—he did not come to me in the office on that day—I have seen him several times, he came one Saturday night to see the principal; that was, I think, the Saturday fortnight after he left—he saw me—he did not tell me that he wanted to settle, and offer to pay over the money to me—I did not take him over the books and have a settlement with him when he left—a bond is entered into by each man, with two sureties, to make good any deficiencies—I will swear I made no such remark as that it must be paid by his sureties—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an extract I have made, and here is the book for the agents—this extract is several small amounts which he is short—I have entered them to him—goods which go out to agents are entered not to him, but against me; I give them to him to deliver, but make no entry of having given them to him—I have to pay in all agents' moneys—wherever the agents may be, they are given out in the morning—I am not responsible for them; they are entered in that book, and I have the collection of them—I am not responsible in the same way as the prisoner is for the goods on the way-bill—the prisoner is not made responsible for the agents' goods, he is for the customers'—he has the different goods in the same van, customers' and agents'—these initials in the book are my voucher from the clerk—the only entry is made in that book—the prisoner receives no voucher from me; if he pays money to me it is entered in this book—these sums are entered when he goes out,</p>

               <p>and before he pays them—when I receive the money I put it down on a slip of paper, which is afterwards destroyed at the end of the week—I know that the prisoner has not paid it to me, because I do not find that I have paid it over to the other clerk—the amounts are not paid to the other clerk, and therefore I infer that the prisoner has not paid them to me—I may have some of the slips in my pocket now (<hi rend="italic">Looking for them</hi>)—I made out this slip of the prisoner's differences from this book; there are three items—the prisoner met me two or three times after he left, at a coffee-shop; he told me that he would come to the firm and see the principal—I told him I should be glad when the accounts were settled, and he gave me a list of goods which he had out—I have not got that list; I worked them off the list, and got the money for them—the prisoner did not go round with me in the van and introduce me to the customers after he left—I went round with him in the van before he left—I believe he did ride with me one day after he left, I met him at Vauxhall—he did not wish me to settle with the customers who I did not previously know—some time after he left, he told me that he had obtained another situation with Fender and Co., a tea-establishment in Wandsworth-road—I went there with a detective three weeks or a month after he told me, and we saw him in the shop, and gave him in custody—during those three or four weeks I found out that he was endeavouring to get some of the customers away—that was not the reason I gave him in custody—I did not do so before, because I was going through his accounts—I took to his journey on 12th, but he having left on the 10th, it was impossible to find out the deficiency then—I do not know that I found out any portion of it that day; I found out small amounts at the time—it took me three weeks or a-month to find out the rest—some of these are weekly customers, some fortnightly, and some monthly—he has been trying to get away customers ever since he left, but I have not been trying to get up a case against him ever since he left—I did not give him in custody at once—I am not a principal; I was a van man a short time ago, and was put over the prisoner's head—I am aware that he was trying for the situation which I now fill.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you promoted for your good conduct and honesty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so—I saw him every day between 18th September and 10th October, except Sundays, on any of which days he could have paid in the amount; and the same from October 5th—it was his duty to pay me those sums the first time he saw me, and also to enter them on the way-bill under the total amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who makes the entry in the books of the names and amounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Rolfe—it is then handed to me—they are all entered on Saturday, to leave on Saturday morning, and they enter all the goods of the week—it is handed back to me with all the names of customers to whom goods have been sent, and the amounts due—it is the prisoner's duty to receive such moneys if they are offered to him, and then to pay me—the proper person in the establishment then initials the sums, which is his discharge—if an item is disputed, and I find it is not initialed, that would be conclusive to me that I have not paid it over to the clerk, and then I say that I have not received it.</p>

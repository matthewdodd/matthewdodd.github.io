                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, John Sang<lb></lb>ster—we live in Regent-street—the prisoner was in our service, and had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—in consequence of a communication from Mr. Cheek, of the Strand, I went to his shop on the 24th of October—I there saw seventeen silk umbrellas, which I immediately recognized as my manufacture—when I had been there about half-an-hour the prisoner came in—I said, "Halloo, Bloomfield, is that you?" and asked him what he had to do there—he said he had some business with Mr. Cheek—I said "What are these umbrellas?"—he said, some that he had made up—I asked where he got the silk—he could not answer—I said, "You had better hold your tongue, you know that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230063"></xptr>
               <p>they are mine"—he burst out crying, and laid, "Do let me go—don't take me"—I was rather inclined to do so, but Mr. Cheek was desirous that I should have him taken—the prisoner said it was the first time.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say that you should not have prosecuted him if it had not been for Mr. Cheek. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said so just now—he was the last man I should have suspected, only Mr. Cheek said, "If you let him go, you deserve to be robbed every day of your life." The prisoner worked for me till seven o'clock, and then worked at home for me, by which he earned about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I have not the least reason to believe that the frames of these umbrellas belonged to him—I have brought three workwomen here to prove that these umbrellas were sewn by them, two of them were before the Magistrate, but they were not examined—I am prepared to swear that the prisoner told me it was his first offence, and begged for forgiveness—he said, "Do let me go—it is the first time"—I do not recollect saying to him, "Have you sold umbrellas to any shop?"</p>

On the Way to the station he asked what would be done with him—I said it was impossible for me to tell—he said he was going to be married on the Tuesday, which was the cause of his doing this, and if Mr. Sangster would give him time, he should be able to make all right.</p>

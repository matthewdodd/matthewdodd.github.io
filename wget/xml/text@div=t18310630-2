Smith and Son; (looking at a cheque) this cheque was presented to me at our banking-house on Monday. the 23rd of May, by the prisoner, and on my taking it from his hand, I said, "How will you take it?" he said, "Short;" I said, "A 100l. note" - he rather hesitated, and then said, "No, two fiftys;" I perceived the signature was different from the usual way of signing, and inquired if he took it himself of Messrs.

            . I am a marshal of the City. I was sent for to Messrs. Robarts and Curtis', and took the prisoner into custody for presenting a draft for 100l. - I searched him, and found some letters and pocket-books on him, a pair of ear-rings, a snuff-box, several memorandums, and a sheet of blank cheques on Messrs. Curtis and Co.'s, also a small piece of paper; the cheques were in a pocketbook in his coat pocket, folded up together - I think the smaller paper was loose; I found no draft upon Messrs. Barclay on him - I asked where he lived; he said he had no residence - I then asked where he had been living; he said with Messrs. Smith, of Aldersgate-street, grocers - I took from him twelve sovereigns and some silver, which were given up to him by order of the Magistrate; I believe I said to him, "How could you be so foolish?" he said he was in great distress - I said that could not be, it was impossible he could be in distress, as he had 12l. or 13l. in his pocket.</p>

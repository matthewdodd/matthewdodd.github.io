                  </hi>. On Sunday, 1st June, I was at Temple Mills, West Ham, about 4 o'clock in the evening, and missed my handkerchief, which I had safe five minutes before—one of my fellow-workmen was with me, and also lost his handkerchief—there were a great many there bathing—the prisoner was one—I did not bathe, but only stood by the water-side—the next night Benton brought me my handkerchief—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 381). I apprehended the prisoner on 2nd June, and found this handkerchief on his neck. I told him I was going to take him on suspicion of stealing a handkerchief—he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "Have you found one?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you bought one?"—he said, "No;" and at the station he said he bought one at the Temple Mills for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the way to the goal, the prisoner's mother came and offered a lad 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the handkerchief—the prisoner told her not to give it to that lad, but to another one, which was the prosecutor.</p>

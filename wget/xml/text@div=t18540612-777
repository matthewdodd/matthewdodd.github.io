                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Rochester division of police. On Saturday, May 13th, I was at Woolwich Dookyard; it was the day of the launch—I was at the dockyard gates between 2 and 3 o'clock, and saw the prisoner on several occasions go towards the gate, and walk in with the people, feeling the dresses of persons with his left hand; he had his right hand in a sling—he went behind a lady, put his hand into her dress, pulled out a purse, and put it into the sling his arm was in—he turned round, saw me, and ran away—I caught him, and in scuffling with him he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the purse behind him—I said, "I saw you pick that lady's pocket, and take the purse from her"—he said, "I never see any purse, I never touched any purse"—as I had hold of the collar of his coat he swung round, took it out of the sling, and threw it down—some<lb></lb>body picked it up—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

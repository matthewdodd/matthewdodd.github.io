I am the wife of Joseph White, and take in washing—I know the prisoner by sight about the neighbourhood—about twenty minutes past six o'clock on the 21st of June, 1 hung out a shirt to dry in the yard in front of the house—it was near enough for any one to reach from outside the premises—I missed it about twenty-five minutes past six—I found it pawned at Mr. Harvey's, in the Highway—this is it.</p>

About half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 23rd, the prosecutrix pointed out the prisoner to me in Vinegar-lane—he turned round, and began to run—I caught him, and told him he was charged with stealing a shirt—he said, "I could have escaped before if I thought proper"—I said, "Perhaps you did not think I was coming after you"—he said, "Yes I did; I won't go with you unless I think proper."</p>

I live at 14, George Road, East Greenwich, and am gardener to Mr. Peebles, at Crath Nithen Lodge, St. John's Road, Black—heath—I was left in charge of the house in his absence during May, and went away at about 6.50 a.m. on the 7th, leaving the house secure—I returned about 8 or a little before, and found an entrance had been forced by the area door, and that three pairs of boots had been stolen from behind the door of a spare bedroom—I had seen them safe before—I did not miss anything else.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Mumford, Nelson Street, Green<lb></lb>wich, pawnbroker—Martin came at about 9 a. m. on the 7th May and pledged this pair of spring-side boots for 5a. in the name, I think, of William Brown, and they were taken out on the 8th by Covill, who said "Are the boots worth the money that was lent on them?"—he did not mention the amount; he had got the ticket—I said "I think they are," and he redeemed them, but brought them back next morning and repledged them—I know both the prisoners as customers of ours.</p>

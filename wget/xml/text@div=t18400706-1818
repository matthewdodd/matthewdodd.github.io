                  </hi>. I live in Twisters-alley, Bunhill-row, St. Luke's. On Tuesday, the 16th of June, I went into my workshop, at the bottom of my yard, a wall encloses it with the house—I found the shutter was broken down, which had been nailed up for five months—on looking about I missed a hand-saw, two birds, and two cages, and some pork—I afterwards found one bird in the cage, in Chequer-square—Mr. Tarbox, who had bought it, detained the prisoner while I went for a policeman.</p>

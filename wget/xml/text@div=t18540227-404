                  </hi>. I am the wife of Walter Jackson; he keeps the St. Pancras-road post-office, near King's-cross; I attend to the duties of the post; my husband is absent in his business during the day. On 30th Jan. the prisoner had been in my service between six and seven months, as near as I can recollect—I had occasion to give her notice to leave; I had given her warning on several occasions, for neglect, I think about three weeks before 30th Jan.—she was to leave on Monday, 30th Jan.—I saw Mrs. Bramwell at my shop that day, before the prisoner left—she came, I think, for two postage stamps, and she asked me to give her a wafer at the same time—I did so; I did not take particular notice what she did with it; I was engaged in other business, serving other persons in the shop—we keep a stationer's shop—I think she had a letter with her—I did not observe what she did with it after I gave her the wafer; she left the shop—from that time until 8 o'clock I only left the shop to go into the parlour—I went down into the kitchen once during that time—the prisoner had access to the shop while I was in the parlour—she went into the shop to serve postage stamps several times between 2 and 8 o'clock—I was not aware that she was gone when she left—she had not said she was going at that time—I had occasion for her services, and rang the bell, and she was not in the house, she did not answer—that was, I think, about 8 o'clock, or a quarter after—she was to have gone that evening, but she did not say, "Good night," or anything, before she went—I knew that she had a cousin or a relation living at No. 11, Little Camden-street, and, finding she was gone, I went there—I saw a young person, answering to the name of Mary Ann Busnell—I asked her for Mary Ann Clark, and asked to see the bundle she had brought—she showed me a bundle; it was the prisoner's—I opened it in Busnell's presence, and found in it this letter—I thought at the time it was three letters—there are three pieces of paper, and two envelopes—it is addressed to Mrs. Joseph</p>

               <p>Swannell, and the envelope inclosed is addressed to Mrs. Bramwell, at the saw-mills—the letter had been opened, and it was all crashed—the papers were all separate, and crumpled—I also found in the bundle a pair of stockings belonging to me, but they were of no use—I took the letter home to my husband—I did not leave any message with Busnell for the prisoner—I made some observation in her presence—I got home between 9 and 10 o'clock, and gave the letter and papers to my husband—next day, at near 1 o'clock, the prisoner came to our house—I told her she had been a very bed girl to take letters out of the box; that my character was at stake by her doing such an action—she said she had not done so—I told her that there were some letters in her bundle, and something else belonging to me—a letter posted at our office at 2 o'clock, on 30th Jan., would be forwarded to the chief office at a quarter to 4 o'clock—I made up and despatched the letters for that delivery—a letter put into our letter-box for that delivery would be taken out and stamped, and would bear the stamp of our office—this envelope does not bear our stamp—if it was put in at 2 o'clock, it must have been taken between 2 and 4 o'clock—the prisoner had occasion to go into the shop several times between 2 and 4 o'clock—if this letter had passed through my hands it would have borne the stamp—the prisoner had no authority to interfere with the letters at all.</p>

               <p>said that she had not taken it; I did not hear her say that somebody must have put it into her bundle; I cannot exactly swear that she did not say so, but I do not recollect it at all; I cannot say more—she said she did not put it there—the letter was open when I found it, all crushed up together inside a dress—I remember Mrs. Bramwell saying something to me before the Magistrate, about a letter that had been lost in June last; I said it was wrongly directed, and that I supposed was the reason it had not reached.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness. I remember her going to the House of Detention on Monday, 6th Feb.—I had heard that my niece (the prisoner) was in custody there—when my daughter came home, she told me what had passed between her and the prisoner—I went with her to the House of Detention, to show her where it was—I did not come here to-day with my daughter; I was here before her; she was fetched here—I mentioned to that gentleman (Mr. Peacock) what my daughter said she had heard from the prisoner, and then my daughter was sent for.</p>

Q.</hi> Pray how came you to get hold of my friend Mr. Peacock, or he hold of you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the officer, I believe—I believe he is a policeman; some one connected with the Post-office, that I have repeatedly seen since this occurrence has taken place—his name is Russell, I believe—he did not come to me—I did not go to him; he was at the office here when I came down to show my youngest daughter the way—he spoke to me after I had been speaking to Mrs. Jackson, through the old lady who was with her, who I believe is her mother—I was talking to her, and then he said, "Will you step this way? I want you to speak to this gentle<lb></lb>man"—I have seen Mrs. Jackson this morning, but not spoken to her—she was with her mother when I came here—Mrs. Jackson saw me several times—I am not aware that she heard what I said to her mother—I did not go up in a corner, I was in the thoroughfare—she might have heard, but I was not talking personally to her; she was there—I do not know whether Russell was listening—I cannot say how long it was after I was talking to Mrs. Jackson's mother, that he came up—it was not long, I dare say; perhaps a few minutes, or a quarter of an hour—he only said, "Step this way," and then he took me to Mr. Peacock, who asked me some ques<lb></lb>tions—he did not tell me I was going to be a witness—I was not told I should be called—he asked me where my daughter was—I supposed she would be a witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of Mrs. Jackson, and keep the receiving house at St. pancras. I received these letters and papers from my wife on the Monday night in question—I took them next morning to the Post-office, and I believe I gave them to Mr. Sculthorpe, he gave them back to me—I do not remember giving them to Russell, I merely received them back from Mr. Sculthorpe to put my initials to them, and then, I think, I returned them to him—Russell was present at the time—I do not remember which gentleman I gave them to.</p>

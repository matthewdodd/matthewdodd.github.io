               <p>I live at Stepney. On Thursday five weeks ago I set my box down on a bench by the London Infirmary, being tired. The prisoner sat drinking a pint of beer at the door. He asked me if I was going to a place? I said yes, to a publick-house in the Borough. He said he could help me to a place in a private house, which would be better than a publick-house, and if I would go over to the Red Lion he would tell me more about it. I went over with him; I put my box down on the table, and he called for a pint of beer, then he began talking about the place. We sat there about three quarters of an hour; he then went with the box to the woman at the bar, and desired her to take care of it while he went to enquire about the place. I asked if the box would be safe; the woman said yes. We then went to the Horse and Groom, in Church-row, Whitechapel; he called for a pint of beer; then he went out. He said he was going for an answer, and would be back in three minutes. I staid about a quarter of an hour. I began to be be uneasy. I went down to the Red Lion and asked for my box; the woman said the man had been and got the box. I was sitting at a house at Bethnal-green, on this day month, I saw the prisoner go by, and I had him secured. The box contained the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I have never found any of them.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these things? - They are put at the value of fifty-three shillings, they are worth that.</p>

The prisoner and the prosecutrix came into our house between four and five o'clock and called for a pint of beer; they sat about an hour talking together, then they left this box in my care. They went out together, and in about a quarter of an hour he came back and said, Now, madam this box. I said there it is, and he took the box on his shoulder and went away.</p>

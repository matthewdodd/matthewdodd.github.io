            . I am a coach painter, I work for Mr. Comford; my master's shop where I work adjoins Mr. Ford's shop. On Friday the 22nd of May I heard somebody rattle the iron about in the next shop; it being five o'clock in the afternoon I knew it was the time for the men to be all at tea; I looked through the crevice of the boards of Mr. Ford's shop; I saw the prisoner standing against the door of the warehouse; he seemed confused and he was looking as if to see whether any body was coming into the shop; I looked through the party wall, I saw him try to get into the store room; he got part of the way in but could get no further; I got upon a carriage, so as to look over the party wall, I saw him attempting to get into the warehouse; he retreated back, came again, and ripped down another bar of the warehouse; then he went in, he began taking the brass coach door plates, he took some out the first time, and he came a second time; with that I called my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any in the presence of you and your master. - A. Yes, my master came and saw him; he went round and caught him; master asked him what he was after, he said nothing; my master replied you must be after something down there; he said he was looking for a piece of leather.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not break the place down, the place was broken down.</p>

            . I am a coach painter. When I came out from tea my man told me he saw the prisoner taking the plates from the warehouse; I saw him in the act of taking the plates out of the warehouse; I went into Mr. Ford's shop, I asked him what he was about, he said nothing; there was no one with him at the time. I told him I was sure he was about something, I could see him, and he was in there taking the plates.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the warehouse could you see that it had been forced open. - A. Yes, there were two bars torn down.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. I was sent for to take this man in custody; I searched him, I found nothing upon him but a few nails. These are the coach door plates, I found them in the body of a stage coach; and these plates I found at Mrs. Hill's, an old iron shop. The next morning the prisoner said he was sorry for what he had done; I told him I thought he had a warning before.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of these plates are they worth five or six shillings. - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not put these coach plates in the stage coach. - A. No; I lost many before; I put them in that place; I could see my stock was diminished; he left only one out of eleven dozen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no leather to work with; my mistress told me to look about the warehouse; I put my arm in, and the pale broke in; I pulled out the leather, and two of the plates came out with it.</p>

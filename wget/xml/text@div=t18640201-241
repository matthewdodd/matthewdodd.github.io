I am a labourer at the Chartered Gas Works—on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> January the prisoner was a fellow labourer with me, and has been since the first part of the winter—I have worked there for years—we had some words about a quarter to 1 o'clock on Saturday, when he came out of the retort—we struck work, and I told him to put another shovel or two of coals on the retort—he looked at me and struck me—I said to my foreman, "I shall not work with that man again"—he struck me again, and the foreman parted us and sent him to another gang—about half-past 3 we were having tea in a place called the lobby—the prisoner belonged to the other lobby, but he came into our lobby and said, so help him God, he would scald me before the day be out—he then left the room smoking his pipe—I said, "You</p>

               <p>won't, because we are parted now, and there is no more of it"—after I had had my tea, I was smoking my pipe, and saw him come in with a tin can of boiling water, with a handle to it, which we boil our tea in—he never said a word—I was just coming out of the lobby door, and saw him with his gloves on, putting his hand under the bottom of the tin—I stooped, and it all went over my back—I have no bad feeling against him, and do not want to prosecute him, but his passion ought to have cooled since half-past 1 o'clock.</p>

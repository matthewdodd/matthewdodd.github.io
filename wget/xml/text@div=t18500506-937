                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Lovett, of Perkins'-rents, Peter-street, Westminster. On 19th April, I had a shirt hanging out to dry in the yard—I saw it safe at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and missed it in half an hour—the prisoner lodged with me at the top of the house—after I missed the shirt, I went up, and accused her of taking it, and she denied it—I told her nobody had been in the yard but her—there were four or five young men in the room with her, and in consequence of what one of them said, I went to Mr. Williams's pawn-shop in Great Smith-street, and found the shirt there—I went back, and told the prisoner I had found the shirt pawned for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if she gave me the ticket I would get it, and she would have no more bother about it—she refused, and I gave her in charge—this is the shirt(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my husband's.</p>

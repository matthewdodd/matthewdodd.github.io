The prisoner was in our employ; I was informed by a neighbour that I was being robbed daily, and next night when I went to bed I counted the money in the till in the bar - I counted it the last thing at night on the last day of February; the bar was kept locked, and I kept the key in the bed-room - there was 14 1/2d. in copper in the till at night, and next morning there was only 2 1/2d. remaining; and on the following night, the 1st of March, I counted the money and marked it - there was 2s. 6d. in copper and three sixpences in silver; I am quite sure I locked the bar - I came down about eight o'clock in the morning; my sister came down before me, and opened the bar door - the till was not locked; I examined the till when I came down - and the silver was gone, and only 4d. remaining in copper; I sent for an officer, and told him I suspected one of my servants - the prisoner was searched, and the whole of the marked money was found in her possession; she said she had taken it the week before in exchange on Ludgate-hill - she lived with me about ten months; I had a good character with her - I have lost several things while she has been with me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and had the three servants up; I began to search the prisoner first - she immediately put her hand into her bosom, pulled out a paper and said, "I have money here, but it is my own;" I opened it, and the three sixpences and halfpence were all in it - every one of them was marked very particularly; they are all marked differently - I found on her twelve penny-pieces and seven halfpence; I took her to the Computer, got a woman to search her, and she found four penny pieces and three halfpence in her stays.</p>
               <p>MRS. TWELFTREE. I have made different marks on the different coins; I am positive of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am very sorry for it; it is my first offence - I have been fourteen years without father or mother.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask him whether he saw me, I was coming from Drury-lane, I had been to my brother's, and as I was returning to make the best of my way home this gentleman caught me, and said I must go with him for I had robbed him of two guineas, and immediately called out to the watchman and I was taken, and the Gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070084"></xptr> said he was robbed of five guineas, on the Monday he said if I would send him up two guineas he would not come down for me, and when he came up he said that he lost one guinea and a half and two shillings, and that it was either me or the other women that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you in liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure to the woman? - Yes, I told her at the watch-house that if she would give me my property which is very natural, I would not hurt her; I said I had lost five guineas, for I missed the remaining part in the scuffle of securing her.</p>
               <p>Court to the Constable. Was there another woman taken up? - Another woman came into the watch-house with her, but the prosecutor did not give charge of her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Might not you have dropped the money? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to the witness. Has she a brother? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did he appear to be in liquor? - The gentleman appeared much in the same state he is now.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you often seen the prisoner at this time of the night thereabout? - I never saw her before, I searched her very minutely when I took her, I found only one six-pence.</p>

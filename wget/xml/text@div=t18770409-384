                  </hi>. In consequence of information I received at Mrs. Allen's, and this escutcheon which was found, I went on Friday to the shop where Hassett and Samuel were working, in Little York Place with the detective—I said to Hassett" We want to speak to you privately"—when we got into the parlour I asked him if he had been to Mr. Allen's on the Tuesday to offer some castings for sale—he said "No"—the officer who was with me said "I am a police-constable, we know more than you think we do; you had better speak the truth"—then he admitted he had offered some of the things, the German silver and the brass castings to Mr. Allen, of Drury Lane—I then asked him if he bought them—he said "No"—I said "Where did you get them from, you know they are my property"—he said he got them from "<hi rend="italic">Ted</hi>" meaning my brother—I said "Did you have any bill?"—he said <hi rend="italic">"Yes</hi>"—he fumbled in his pocket, he could not find one—then we searched his place and found a similar un<lb></lb>finished escutcheon to the one found at Allen's, and other articles now produced which I have identified—the screw plate I recognise by the stamps upon it—he said my brother had lent him this tool—I said "He had no authority to lend it, and you must have stolen it"—he made no reply—I will swear to these buckles and the India rubber used for shackles—he admitted the shackles were some that were left of a quantity he had had of my brother—he said he bought the stops, but he could not give me a name—these unfinished handles are mine, they are separate patters—as</p>

               <p>each article was produced I asked him how he came by them, and he said he bought them of my brother—I have lost similar files to the twelve, which were found—we never sell them—I believe they are mine; I recognise some of the things by the writing on the parcels—I identify the breech rings by the spots—I could not purchase these goods anywhere, except the nuts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some of the things were in empty soap boxes, others put away in cupboards—the prisoner is a harness plater, he would have them to plate—some of the files were found in a drawer where his wife kept her clothes; some of the files are new—the prisoner has been over twenty years in my employment, off and on; he left about nine or twelve months ago—I was forced to employ him when busy, though he was an extra<lb></lb>ordinary drunkard, he would work a week and play a fortnight—I am some<lb></lb>times obliged to employ men as bad as he, even thieves—my brother is over forty—he had no authority from me to do business on his own account—I gave him an Irish rise, which means that I reduced his wages from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I should not have employed my brother if I knew he was carrying on an independent business.</p>

I am a brass founder, carrying on business in Drury Lane—on the morning of March 20th, Hassett came to my shop with some dirty buckles and escutcheons, like those produced, there were 6 lbs. or 7lbs.—I put them in the scale, but I had a presentment there was something wrong, and would not buy them—he complained of my troubling him to open them.</p>

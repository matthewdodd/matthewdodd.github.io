                  </hi>. I live at 5a, Pye Street, Westminster—it is a lodging-house—on 4th June, a short time before 5 o'clock, I was sitting at a table in the kitchen, taking my tea, at the end towards the door, and the two prisoners came in together—there were several persons in the kitchen—they both came up to where I was sitting, one alongside me and the other opposite—Brown asked me for some tea—I said "I have got no tea to give you; I shall be obliged to you if you will keep your distance; you have no command of me, nor I of you"—a man sitting above me reached Jones a saucer of tea, which she drank, and flung the saucer at me—it broke on the back of my neck—they then called me names which I could not express; they called me out of character, all the bad names they could think of—I stood up, and put my hand like this, and said to Brown "Go away," and then Jones called me names, and Brown picked a knife up from the table, which I had been using, and stabbed me in the back of the <hi rend="italic">poll,</hi> and then followed me up, and stubbed me a little below the ball of the left eye, near my nose—my other eye has been totally dark for a year—while Brown stabbed me, Jones caught hold of my hair, and pulled me—I said "I am stabbed; I must go to the hospital"—the blood was running out of my eye, in a stream, on my clothes and on the floor, and all the way from there to the hospital, where the surgeon bandaged my head and strapped up my eye—the blood continued after that till I went to Rochester Row before the Police Magistrate—I saw the prisoners together the same evening in Tothill Street, and gave them in custody, but the constable could only take one—Jones got away, but she came to the Court afterwards, and was detained.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in this house—on 4th June I was in the kitchen, a little before 5 o'clock, and saw the prisoners come in—one stood on one side of Cogan and the other at the other side of the table—they asked him for tea—he said "I have no tea, only what will do for myself; you have nothing to do with me; go away, and leave me alone; I am an old man"—a blind man who was sitting next him, said "I will give you a saucer of tea if you will go away and sit yourself down"—he gave a saucer of tea to Jones, who drank of it, and said "Here, sister, you have the remainder"—after that they called the old gentleman names not fit to be mentioned in Court—he put his hand out, and said "Now, go away from me"—Jones picked the saucer up after she had put it down, and sent it at him, and it was broken, but where it hit him I could not say—Brown then picked something up, and Jones was holding him by the hair and blood was flowing from the back of his neck—I pulled Jones away, and saw Brown stab him with a knife in the corner of the eye—I made a grab at her, and took the knife out of her hand—he said "Oh, dear! I am blind; I must go to the hospital," and blood flowed down his face on to the floor—I could not tell what sort of a face he had, for blood—this is the knife—he said "<hi rend="italic">Entertain</hi> them; I must go to the hospital." and another one from the house went with him—Brown said "There, sister, see what execution I have done"—I allowed them to go, and as soon as they got to the door, away they ran, as if they were shot; they did not stop to walk—I afterwards went with Cogan to the Broadway, and gave them in charge, but the police-man could only take one—the other one came to the Police Court, and was given into custody—they were both sober; they could run as well as I could.</p>

I am deputy at this lodging-house—I was sitting in the kitchen just before 5 o'clock, when the prisoners came in—they went up to Cogan and asked him for some tea—I have heard what Cogan and Peek have said, they have accurately described what passed—I saw Brown with a knife, and saw her use it on the old man—Jones abused him, and used bad language to him, but I did not see her throw the saucer—there were about twenty people in the kitchen, and some of them obstructed the view of what was going on—the prisoners were the worse for drink, but they knew what they were about.</p>

               <p>Hospital—Cogan came there, and I examined him, and found a wound on his face, just below the left eye, rather more than half an inch long and penetrating to the bone—that on the back of his head was an inch and a half long, penetrating to the bone—he came again some hours afterwards to say that his eye had been bleeding again, but I told him to go home I did not think much of it—if it had been half an inch higher, it would have blinded him for life, or deprived him of life—the wound on the back of his head was comparatively unimportant—I daresay it was painful—it healed remarkably fast—the wounds might have been inflicted by this knife.</p>
